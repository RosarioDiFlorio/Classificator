Michael James Noonan (born 21 May 1943) is an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Finance from 2011 to 2017, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of Fine Gael from 2001 to 2002, Minister for Health from 1994 to 1997, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1986 to 1987, Minister for Energy from January 1987 to March 1987 and Minister for Justice from 1982 to 1986. He has been a Teachta DÃ¡la (TD) since 1981, currently for the Limerick City constituency.
Noonan was a minister in every Fine Gael-led government from 1982 to 2017, serving in the cabinets of Garret FitzGerald, John Bruton and Enda Kenny. During these terms of office he held the positions of Minister for Justice, Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Health. When Fine Gael lost power after the 1997 general election, Noonan remained an important figure in the party, taking over as spokesperson on finance.
He succeeded John Bruton as Leader of Fine Gael and Leader of the Opposition in 2001, however, he resigned following Fine Gael's disastrous showing at the 2002 general election. After eight years as a backbencher, during which time he served as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appointed Noonan to his front bench in 2010 as spokesperson on finance.
In May 2017, he said he would retire as Minister for Finance in the coming weeks when a new Taoiseach is appointed, and from politics at the next general election.
