The Economic Adjustment Programme for Portugal, usually referred to as the Bailout programme, is a Memorandum of understanding on financial assistance to the Portuguese Republic in order to cope with the 2010–14 Portuguese financial crisis.
The three-year programme was signed in May 2011 by the Portuguese Government under then-Prime Minister José Sócrates on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In June 2014, Portugal exited the €78 billion programme, with a concluding tranche of €0.4 billion being disbursed in November 2014.
