The Stability Council (Stabilitätsrat) is a joint body of the German Federation (Bund) and the federal states (Länder). It was established in 2010 as part of the second stage of Germany’s federal reforms and is enshrined in Article 109a of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), Germany’s constitution. The Stability Council strengthens the institutional framework for safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public budgets on the federal and Länder levels.
