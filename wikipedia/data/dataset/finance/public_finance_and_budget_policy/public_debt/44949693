The Economic Adjustment Programme for Cyprus, usually referred to as the Bailout programme, is a Memorandum of understanding on financial assistance to the Republic of Cyprus in order to cope with the 2012â€“13 Cypriot financial crisis.
It was signed in March 2013 by the Cypriot Government on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
