The Access Bank Nigerian Government Bond Index is a liquid index that was created to ensure that there exists credible data on the Nigerian sovereign bond market which will help the investors and other stakeholders to make informed investment decisions while providing a benchmark for measuring the performance of the rapidly developing local currency bond markets. This is particularly important as the bonds market is becoming redefined from a primarily sovereign fiscal deficit process to a sound investment option.
