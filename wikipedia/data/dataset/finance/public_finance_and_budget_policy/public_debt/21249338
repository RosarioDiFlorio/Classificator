Seán FitzPatrick (born 25 May 1948) was former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank until he resigned in December 2008 amid mounting revelations over hidden loans. The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price which in turn led to its nationalisation on 21 January 2009.
In an RTÉ Radio 1 interview on The Marian Finucane Show in October 2008, FitzPatrick denied critics' charges that the bank had been reckless in making too many big loans to property developers as Ireland's property bubble grew. While saying he was grateful for the state's help, he refused to offer taxpayers an apology, saying

The cause of our problems are global, so I can't say sorry with any degree of sincerity and decency. But I can say thank you.

FitzPatrick addressed the government in another speech on the same day and recommended cutting spending on what he called the "sacred cows" of Irish society: children, the elderly and health care. FitzPatrick was declared bankrupt on 12 July 2010.
