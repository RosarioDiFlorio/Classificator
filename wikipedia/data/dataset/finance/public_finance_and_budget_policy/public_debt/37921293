The local property tax (LPT) is annual self-assessed tax charged on the market value of all residential properties in Ireland. It came into effect on 1 July 2013 and is collected by the Revenue Commissioners. The tax is assessed on residential properties, with the owner a property being liable (though in the case of leases over twenty years, the tenant becomes liable). The revenue raised is used to fund the provision of services by local authorities and includes transfers between local authorities. Such services currently include public parks; libraries; open spaces and leisure amenities; planning and development; fire and emergency services; maintenance and cleaning of streets; and street lighting. Some recent media reports dispute that such services have been funded from 2013 property tax receipts.
