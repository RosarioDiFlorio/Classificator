The European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) is the framework for financial supervision in the European Union in operation since 2011. The system consists of the European Supervisory Authorities, the European Systemic Risk Board, the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities, and the national supervisory authorities of EU member states. It was proposed by the European Commission in 2009 in response to the financial crisis of 2007â€“08.
