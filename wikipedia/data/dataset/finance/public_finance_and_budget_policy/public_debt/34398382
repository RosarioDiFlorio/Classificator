The Vita Cortex sit-in was a peaceful protest at the Vita Cortex plant on the Kinsale Road in Cork, Ireland, which began on 16 December 2011 after workers were made redundant without pay with immediate effect. The dispute led to nationwide protests, television appeals and debates in Dáil Éireann. According to the trade union UNITE, the dispute was part of a growing trend of workers being "left in the cold" after being made redundant.
The staff had worked for a total of 847 years for Vita Cortex, with the most senior employee having worked there for 47 years. The strike received support from, among others, the Cork senior hurling team, former President of Ireland Mary Robinson, human rights campaigner Noam Chomsky, international soccer player Paul McGrath, musician Christy Moore, film and theatre actor Cillian Murphy, and Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.
The 160-day sit-in was ended in May 2012, after the workers started receiving redundancy payments.
