The board is an independent body of experts that assists the Stability Council in monitoring compliance with the upper limit on the general government structural deficit set out in the Budgetary Principles Act. The board produces statements and recommendations in this context that lay the foundation for the work of the Stability Council. The chair of the advisory board participates in Stability Council discussions on monitoring the general government structural deficit limit and communicates the board’s opinion.
The advisory board was set up as part of Germany’s national implementation of the European Fiscal Compact. The board convened for the first time on 5 December 2013.
