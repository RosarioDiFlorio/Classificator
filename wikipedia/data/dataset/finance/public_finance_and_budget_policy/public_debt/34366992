The United Kingdom government austerity programme is a fiscal policy undertaken in response to the Great Recession. It is a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending and tax rises, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the role of the welfare state in the United Kingdom. The National Health Service and education have been "ringfenced" and protected from direct spending cuts. United Kingdom austerity policies have received pointed criticism from left-wing politicians and economists, and have prompted anti-austerity movements among citizens more generally.
