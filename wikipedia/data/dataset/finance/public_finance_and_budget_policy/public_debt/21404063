Free Education for Everyone (FEE) is an Irish student campaign group which was set up in September 2008 in University College Dublin (UCD) to fight the proposed re-introduction of university fees. FEE is active in all of Ireland's main universities, including University of Limerick (UL), University College Dublin (UCD), Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), NUI Maynooth (NUIM), University College Cork (UCC) and NUI Galway (NUIG). It has recently grown in Northern Ireland as well, with a group at Queen's University Belfast, and a broad group in Derry which is not affiliated to any specific university.
Since its formation the group's activists have organised mass protests (in conjunction with the Union of Students in Ireland or USI), but it is mainly known for its occupations of government constituency offices and blockades against government ministers and of government buildings. Politicians such as the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, and Ministers Batt O'Keeffe, Éamon Ó Cuív, Brian Lenihan and his brother Conor Lenihan have all been targeted, with NUI Galway and UCD having the most widely reported rate of activism against visiting Ministers.
