Andreas Georgiou (Greek: Ανδρέας Γεωργίου, born Patras, 1960) is a Greek economist. On 2 August 2010 he was appointed as President of the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT). On 2 August 2015, he surprisingly resigned from office with immediate effect.
In July 2016, the Greek Supreme Court upheld charges against Georgiou for having harmed the "national interest", with a possible sentence of up to 10 years in prison.
These charges have been widely criticized as spurious by numerous international statistical bodies and experts who have backed the accuracy and ethics of his work. As the Financial Times reported,
"The case has sparked outrage from economists and statisticians worldwide who believe Mr. Georgiou has become a scapegoat for Greece's political class." [1]
Mr. Georgiou's prosecution has been denounced as a violation of scientific freedom and human rights by the American Statistical Association's Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights [2], the editorial board of The Economist [3], and others.
