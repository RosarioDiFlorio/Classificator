The Southern Claims Commission (SCC) was an organization of the executive branch of the United States government from 1871 to 1873 under President Ulysses S. Grant. Its purpose was to allow Union sympathizers who had lived in the Southern states during the American Civil War, 1861â€“1865, to apply for reimbursements for property losses due to U.S. Army confiscations during the war.
