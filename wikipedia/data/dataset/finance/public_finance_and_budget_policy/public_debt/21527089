The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N'COBRA) is an organization based out of Washington, DC that seeks financial compensation for the descendants of former slaves in the United States. The group advocates that the U.S. Government, U.S. corporations and individuals who benefited from the labors of former slaves should pay reparations of an undisclosed amount and say that further study needs to be done to find the exact amount, but estimate that the amount may be approximately $8,000,000,000,000 (eight trillion.) Members of Nâ€™COBRA seek reparations because of the many injuries caused from slavery and the continuing effect it has had upon the black race. These reparations can take many forms including land, economic development, and other monetary resources. Based on the estimated U.S. population for 2008, this amounts to approximately $205,000 per black citizen in the United States. The group also seeks an apology from the entire white race, including those considered "white" in the United States today who came over after the slave movement.
