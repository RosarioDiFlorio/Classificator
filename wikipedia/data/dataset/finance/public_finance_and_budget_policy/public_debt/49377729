The Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, or DiEM25, is a Pan-European political movement launched in 2015 by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Croatian Philosopher Srećko Horvat. The movement was officially presented at a ceremonial event held on 9 February 2016 in the Volksbühne theatre in Berlin and on the 23rd March in Rome. The movement aims to reform the European Union's existing institutions to create a "full-fledged democracy with a sovereign Parliament respecting national self-determination and sharing power with national Parliaments, regional assemblies and municipal councils". The movement is supported by intellectuals, activists such as Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, prominent American linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, Italian philosopher Antonio Negri, Dutch sociologist Saskia Sassen, American economist James K. Galbraith, former Labour MP Stuart Holland and Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek, among others.
The acronym DiEM refers to the Roman carpe diem. They argue that the moment of organizing at the continental level should not be wasted today, since they consider that the model of national parties forming fragile alliances in the European Parliament is obsolete and that is necessary a pan-European movement type, capable of facing the great economic, political and social crisis that Europe is facing. In its analysis, this crisis threatens to disintegrate Europe and has characteristics similar to the Great Depression experienced in the 1930s.
To highlight the urgency of democratizing Europe before reaching a point of no return, the movement sets the horizon for the year 2025 to draft a democratic constitution that will replace all the European treaties that are in force today. One year after its foundation, DiEM25 declared that it had over 60,000 members from across the EU.
