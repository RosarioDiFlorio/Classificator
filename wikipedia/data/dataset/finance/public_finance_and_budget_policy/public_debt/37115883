The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is the name for the mechanism which has granted the European Central Bank (ECB) a supervisory role to monitor the financial stability of banks based in participating states, starting from 4 November 2014. Eurozone states are obliged to participate, while Member states of the European Union outside the eurozone can voluntarily participate. As of 3 November 2014, none of the non-eurozone member states had opted to join, although the ECB reported that some of them had expressed an interest in joining, and that talks were being held with each of them to map which changes to national legislation need to be adopted in order to become a SSM member. The SSM is the first established part of the EU banking union, and will function in conjunction to the Single Resolution Mechanism.
