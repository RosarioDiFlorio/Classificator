Drachmi Greek Democratic Movement Five Stars (abbreviated as: Drachma Five Star) is a Greek eurosceptic political party established on May 1, 2013 by Theodore Katsanevas, former member of PASOK and son-in-law of Andreas Papandreou, with a primary target for Greece to abandon the euro and to return to the drachma.
