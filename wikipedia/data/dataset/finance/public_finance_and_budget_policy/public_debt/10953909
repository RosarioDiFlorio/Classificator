Dying While Black by Vernellia Randall, J.D. is a book about the disparities between the health care administered to minorities, particularly, African Americans and that administered to European Americans. She states that these disparities, the black health deficit, are caused by the continuation of the slave health deficit. She encourages reparation in the form of long term monetary and legal commitments and a comprehensive civil rights health care law.
