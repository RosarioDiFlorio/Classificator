The Campaign Against Home and Water Taxes (CAHWT) is a group opposed to the introduction of property and water taxes in Ireland. It calls for the boycott to be used to this effect.
The campaign launched on 22 December 2011. It has a national presence, and is supported by numerous national representatives, including Joe Higgins, Clare Daly, Joan Collins, Séamus Healy, Richard Boyd Barrett and Thomas Pringle. While it has support from some Sinn Féin members, it is not supported by Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael Environment Minister Phil Hogan, who is charged with implementing the taxes, having openly criticised the campaign.
It has established a "national anti-household tax" phone line and organised meetings in every major town in the country. The Irish Times said in April 2012 that the campaign had been "built with lightning speed."
On 1 May 2013, gardaí arrested five members of the group, including Ted Tynan and Mick Barry, during a midday protest inside the Patrick Street branch of the Bank of Ireland in Cork city. Tynan said he felt a need to stand up against austerity.
