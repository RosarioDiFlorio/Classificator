Jubilee Scotland is a coalition of organisations across Scotland that describes its goal as "campaigning to end global debt slavery". Membership of the coalition is broad, and includes faith groups, unions, cooperatives, campaigning groups and local councils.
The charity aims to take action against debts owed by countries in the Global South to individuals, organisations and countries in the Global North where these debts are considered to be odious. In doing so it continues the work of the Jubilee 2000 coalition, which similarly called for the cancellation of unjust and unpayable debts. The organisation has strong links with the Jubilee Debt Coalition, which undertakes similar work in England and Wales.
