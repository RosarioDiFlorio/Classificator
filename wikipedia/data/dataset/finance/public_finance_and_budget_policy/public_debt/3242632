Eurodad (European Network on Debt and Development) is a network of 49 non-governmental organisations from 19 European countries. Eurodad and its members make up a network, this network researches and works on issues that are related to debt, development finance and poverty reduction.
Recently this network has focussed on issues such as tracking the aid spent by European countries, multilateral debt cancellation, debt sustainability, aid quality, conditionality and harmonisation, illegitimate debt, and export credit debts.
Eurodad's main targets are organisations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, however it also targets European governments themselves.
Eurodadâ€™s stated aims are to:
push for development policies that support pro-poor and democratically-defined sustainable development strategies.
support the empowerment of Southern people to chart their own path towards development and ending poverty.
seek a lasting and sustainable solution to the debt crisis, appropriate development financing, and a stable international financial system conducive to development.
Eurodad coordinates the work of non-governmental organisations working on these issues, and collaborates actively with civil society in the North and South to attain these goals. Eurodad has existed since 1990 and is registered as a non-profit organisation in both the Netherlands and Belgium. It is funded by its members (about one-third of its budget) and by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and UK Department for International Development.
The members in the UK include CAFOD, Oxfam, Christian Aid, Tearfund and the World Development Movement.
