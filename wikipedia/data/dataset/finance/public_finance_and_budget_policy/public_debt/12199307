The New Panther Vanguard Movement (NPVM) was created in South Central Los Angeles as a response to the Los Angeles rebellion ("riots") of 1992. Former members of the Black Panther Party and other community activists came together after the rebellion and shared their frustration with the lack of leadership in the Black community. After various dialogues they decided to create a grassroots organization that would reflect the vision and community spirit of the Black Panther Party. Formed in 1994 (and until 1997 called the New African American Vanguard Movement), the NPVM had Peace, Justice and Reparations as number one in its ten-point platform and program.
Community Services Unlimited (CSU) Inc. was originally set up 25 years ago as the non-profit arm of the Southern California Chapter of the Black Panther Party. Since the demise of the Black Panther Party and the closure of its last remaining chapter in the early 1980s CSU has continued exist to provide services to the Los Angeles community. These services have included the provision of tax-exempt services and fiscal sponsorship to various community-based organizations.
