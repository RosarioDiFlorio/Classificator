The Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland, usually referred to as the Bailout programme, is a Memorandum of understanding on financial assistance to the Republic of Ireland in order to cope with the Post-2008 Irish financial crisis.
It was signed on 16 December 2010 by the Irish Government under then-Taoiseach Brian Cowen on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
On 15 December 2013, Ireland exited the programme.
