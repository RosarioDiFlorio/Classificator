Ontario Savings Bonds (OSBs) are bond securities issued by the province of Ontario. Introduced in 2001, OSBs' principal and interest are backed by the Province of Ontario. The OSBs are available from financial institutions, credit unions, caisses populaires and investment dealers.
Unlike the Canada Savings Bond, OSBs are sold only to residents of Ontario.
