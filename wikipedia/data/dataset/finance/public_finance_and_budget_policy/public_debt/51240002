Reparations is an American website started by artist Natasha Marin to raise compensation for descendants of the Atlantic Slave Trade.
Marin has stated that the website is not about reparations for slavery, which Black Lives Matter has called for as part of their platform; Marin's website is an avenue for people to respond to modern racial turmoil in the United States.
