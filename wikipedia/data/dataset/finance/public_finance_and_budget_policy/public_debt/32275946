The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) was the name given to the entity formed in 2011 by the court-mandated merger of the state-owned banking institutions Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.
Following a High Court order on the application of the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, the Irish government drove through overnight legislation to liquidate the IBRC in February 2013.
