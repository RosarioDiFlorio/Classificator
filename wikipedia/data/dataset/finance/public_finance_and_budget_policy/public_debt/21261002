A second bank rescue package totalling at least £50 billion was announced by the British government on 12 January 2009, as a response to the ongoing global financial crisis. The package was designed to increase the amount of money that banks could lend to businesses and private individuals. This aid comes in two parts: an initial £50 billion being made available to big corporate borrowers, and a second undisclosed amount that forms a form of insurance against banks suffering big losses.
