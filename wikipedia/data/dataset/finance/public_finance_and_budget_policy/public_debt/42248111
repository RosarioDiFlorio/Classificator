Solidarity, formerly known as the Anti-Austerity Alliance (AAA), is a socialist political party in the Republic of Ireland, launched in 2014. It has been registered as a political party to contest local elections, and ran at least forty candidates in the 2014 Irish local elections. This included all of the Socialist Party's sitting councillors, which has led to criticism that Solidarity is a front organisation for the Trotskyist Socialist Party. Solidarity denies this, asserting that Solidarity is an alliance of activists and organisations from across the left.
