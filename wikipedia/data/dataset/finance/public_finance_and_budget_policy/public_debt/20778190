David Kenneth Drumm (born November 1966) is an Irish chartered accountant and former banker, best known for his tenure as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to December 2008, when he resigned, amid mounting revelations over hidden loans. The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price, which in turn led to its nationalisation on 21 January 2009.
