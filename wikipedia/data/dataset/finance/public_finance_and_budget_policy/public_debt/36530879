The Wolfson Economics Prize is a £250,000 economics prize, the second largest economics prize in the world after Nobel, which is sponsored by Lord Simon Wolfson, CEO of retailer Next plc and run in partnership with the think tank Policy Exchange. The Prize invites new thinking to address major economic policy issues that aren't already subject to significant public discourse. The Prize has run in 2012, 2014 and 2017.
The 2012 Prize was a contest for proposals on how the Eurozone could be safely dismantled. The contest ended on 5 July 2012, when the Capital Economics team, led by Roger Bootle, won the prize.
The 2014 Prize asked the question “How would you deliver a new Garden City which is visionary, economically viable, and popular?” It was won by David Rudlin of urban design consultancy, URBED.
The question for the 2017 Wolfson Economics Prize was "How can we pay for better, safer, more reliable roads in a way that is fair to road users and good for the economy and the environment?” It was won by Gergely Raccuja.
