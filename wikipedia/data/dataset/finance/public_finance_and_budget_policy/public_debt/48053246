Solidarity–People Before Profit is a trotskyist political party in Ireland. It was formed by members of two socialist political parties: Solidarity and the People Before Profit (PBP). Solidarity was known as the "Anti-Austerity Alliance" (AAA) until 2017. The alliance was formed in 2015 and replaced AAA and PBP in Ireland's official register of political parties. However, each entity retains its separate organisation and identity. PBP also retains its own registration in Northern Ireland. The alliance was created with the intent to obtain more speaking rights for its constituent members in Dáil Éireann after the 2016 Irish general election.
