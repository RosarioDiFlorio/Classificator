Ballyhea Says No is a protest movement based in the north County Cork townland and parish of Ballyhea. Each week after 11 AM Sunday Mass, and since Sunday 6 March 2011 (the weekend after the general election that overturned years of Fianna Fáil rule and brought a Fine Gael-Labour coalition to power), residents protest against the continuing bailout of unidentified bondholders by the Irish state.
A prominent spokesperson for the movement is the sportswriter Diarmuid O'Flynn—creator of the Bondwatch blog in which he documents bank bailout payments as they happen. Among those to have offered their public support for the ideals of the movement are the economists Constantin Gurdgiev and Stephen Kinsella, as well a numerous other public figures.
