In economics, intragovernmental holdings (also known as intragovernmental debt or intragovernmental obligations) are Government Account Series (GAS) securities held by government trust funds, revolving funds and special funds. 
Intragovernmental debt is incurred when the government borrows from federal trust funds to help fund current operations.
