The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) was introduced by the European Union in autumn 2011 amidst the economic and financial crisis, and entered into force on 13 December 2011. It is designed to prevent and correct risky macroeconomic developments, such as high current account deficits, unsustainable external indebtedness and housing bubbles. The MIP is part of the EU's so-called 'six-pack' legislation, which aims to reinforce the monitoring and surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the EU and the euro area.
