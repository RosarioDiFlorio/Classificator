The Irish property bubble was the overshooting part of a long-term price increase of real estate in the Republic of Ireland from the late 1990s to 2007, a period known as the Celtic Tiger. In 2006 the prices peaked at the top of the bubble, with a combination of increased speculative construction and rapidly rising prices; in 2007 the prices first stabilised and then started falling until 2010. By the second quarter of 2010, house prices in Ireland had fallen by 35% compared with the second quarter of 2007, and the number of housing loans approved fell by 73%.
The fall in domestic and commercial property prices contributed to the post-2008 Irish banking crisis. House prices in Dublin, the largest city, were at one point down 56% from their peak and apartment prices down over 62%.
For a time, house prices returned to 20th century levels and mortgage approvals dropped to 1971 levels. As of December 2012, more than 28% of Irish mortgages are in arrears or have been restructured and commercial and buy-to-let arrears are at 18%.
Since early 2013 property prices in the country have begun to recover with property prices in Dublin up over 20% from their nadir.
