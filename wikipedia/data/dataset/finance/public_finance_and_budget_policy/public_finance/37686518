Tax buoyancy is an indicator to measure efficiency and responsiveness of revenue mobilization in response to growth in the Gross domestic product or National income.
A tax is said to be buoyant if the tax revenues increase more than proportionately in response to a rise in national income or output.
A tax is buoyant when revenues increase by more than, say, 1 per cent for a 1 per cent increase in GDP.
Usually, tax elasticity is considered a better indicator to measure tax responsiveness.
