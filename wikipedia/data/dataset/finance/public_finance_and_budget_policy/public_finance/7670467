The Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) is a text developed to aid in the understanding and implementation of United States Department of Defense Acquisition practices under the DoD Directive 5000 series. This text, also available in web-accessed electronic format and web-structured HTML basis (see https://dag.dau.mil/) provides insight to a life cycle view and functional roles within the lifecycle of acquisitions.
In 2002 the DOD 5000.2-R became the Interim Defense Acquisition Guidebook.
