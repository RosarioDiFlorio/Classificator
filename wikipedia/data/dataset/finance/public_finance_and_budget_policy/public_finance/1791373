Sonar 2087 is a towed array sonar designed and manufactured by Thales Underwater Systems at sites in the UK (Cheadle Heath in Stockport and Templecombe in Somerset) and in France (Brest). Sonar 2087 replaces the older Sonar 2031 in the Royal Navy and equips eight Type 23 frigates. The system is also expected to an equip the Royal Navy's future Type 26 Global Combat Ship starting around 2020.
It is a Low Frequency Active Sonar (LFAS) and consists of both active and passive sonar arrays. Thales describes the system as "a towed-array that enables Type 23 frigates to hunt the latest submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range at which they [submarines] can launch an attack."
During Exercise Auriga in 2010, HMS Sutherland's capability equipped with Sonar 2087 was described as "world-beating" by the Sutherland's commanding officer. American, British, Canadian and French warships took part in the exercise, including the French nuclear submarine Perle (S606).
