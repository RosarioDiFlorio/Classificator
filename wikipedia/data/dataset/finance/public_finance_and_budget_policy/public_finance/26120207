CAAFI (Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative) is a cooperative effort among interested stakeholders to bring commercially viable, environmentally sustainable alternative aviation fuels (e.g., aviation biofuel) to market. The potential of these fuels to reduce airline CO2 emissions is anticipated to complement and possibly exceed reductions from technical and operational improvements. CAAFI is co-sponsored by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), Airports Council International - North America (ACI-NA), the Airlines for America (A4A) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CAAFI consists of approximately 450 organizations and more than 800 stakeholders. These include members of other U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and trade associations, as well as energy producers, university faculty, nongovernmental organizations and consultants. CAAFI functions as a clearinghouse, facilitating the exchange of information about and coordination of private-sector and governmental initiatives supporting the development and commercialization of "drop-in" alternative aviation fuels (i.e., fuels that can directly supplement or replace petroleum-derived jet fuels). CAAFI is also exploring the long-term potential of other fuel options.
