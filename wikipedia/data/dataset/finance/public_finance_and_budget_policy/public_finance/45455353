The Bungehuis and Maagdenhuis occupations are an ongoing protest occupation movement at first the Bungehuis Building of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) by a group of students and a staff-member, referring to themselves as The New University (for a democratic university), and then the Maagdenhuis Building of the UvA, its administrative center. The Bungehuis occupation was lasting 11 days, from February 13 to February 24, 2015, and the Maagdenhuis occupation (2015) began on the evening of February 25 and is ongoing.
