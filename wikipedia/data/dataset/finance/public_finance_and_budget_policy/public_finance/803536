In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a P45 is the reference code of a form titled Details of employee leaving work. The term is used in British slang as a metonym for termination of employment. (The equivalent slang term in the United States is pink slip.)
A P45 is issued by the employer when an employee leaves. It is a multipart form.
