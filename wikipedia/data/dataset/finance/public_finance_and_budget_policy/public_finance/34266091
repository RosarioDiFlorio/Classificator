Social VAT is the earmarking of a defined amount of VAT revenues to finance social security. The shift from taxing labour to taxing consumption in order to finance social security is based on several premises.
reduce non-wage costs in order to improve competitiveness
achieve sustainable revenues for the social security system
share the tax burden of social security systems more equitably
The impact of a shift from payroll financing to VAT financing is similar to devaluation as labour costs fall and improve competitiveness.
