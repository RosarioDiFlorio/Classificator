Morpheus is the name of programme that will deliver the next generation tactical communications system to the British Armed Forces.
As of 2016, the MoD publicised plans to replace the existing Bowman with a system named Morpheus. Morpheus will deliver the next generation of Tactical Communication and Information Systems (TacCIS) capability. It will address critical system obsolescence and introduce a more agile TacCIS solution (both technical and business).
