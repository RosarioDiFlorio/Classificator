The 1975 Mason Review was a review of UK defence policy conducted by the Labour Government's Secretary of State for Defence, Roy Mason. The review was influenced by a Government decision to reduce the defence budget to 4.5% of Gross Domestic Product. The review was intended to anticipate defence needs during the period 1975â€“1985.
