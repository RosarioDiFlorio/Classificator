The ability of the United States government to tax and spend in specific regions has large implications to economic activity and performance. Taxes are indexed to wages and profits and therefore areas of high taxation are correlated with areas of higher per capita income and more economic activity.
Spending is largely focused on areas of poverty, the elderly, and centers of federal employment such as military bases.
