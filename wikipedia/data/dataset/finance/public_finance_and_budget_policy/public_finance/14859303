Canadian import duties is the amount of tax or tariff paid while importing goods into Canada. The Canada Border Services Agency collects the tariff on all imported goods.
According to the North American Free Trade Agreement, there is no duty to be paid if the goods are for personal use and "the goods are marked as made in the United States, Canada or Mexico, or the goods are not marked or labelled to indicate that they were made anywhere other than in the United States, Canada or Mexico."
Canadians also have to pay the federal goods and services tax and in most provinces provincial sales tax on the imported goods.
