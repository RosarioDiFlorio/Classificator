Air Departure Tax (ADT) is a tax being introduced in Scotland on 1 April 2018, as a result of the passing of the Air Departure Tax (Scotland) Act 2017 on 20 June 2017 (royal assent: 25 July 2017).
The new Air Departure Tax will replace Air Passenger Duty (APD) in Scotland (while APD continues to be payable in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).
APD will be payable to Revenue Scotland by aircraft operators from Scottish airports.
