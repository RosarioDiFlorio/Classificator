An Installment Agreement in the United States is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) program which allows individuals to pay tax debt in monthly payments. The total amount paid can be the full amount of what is owed, or it can be a partial amount.
There are several different kinds of Installment Agreements: Guaranteed, Streamline, Partial and Full Pay.
