The Peopleâ€™s Assembly Against Austerity is a political initiative in the United Kingdom, launched in 2013.
It is a movement to "push the arguments against austerity" it sees as missing from British politics and to fight for all those people it sees as being hit by Government policies, including low-paid workers, disabled people, unemployed people, the young, black, minority and ethnic groups and women.
