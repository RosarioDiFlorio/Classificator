The Ultraperformance Nanophotonic Intrachip Communications (UNIC) program is a project of DARPA. It is dedicated to funding projects by chip makers to create nanophotonic microprocessors.
On March 3, 2008, Sun Microsystems announced that it had received a US$44.29M grant from UNIC for a "five and a half-year research project focused on microchip interconnectivity via on-chip optical networks enabled by Silicon photonics and proximity communication"; this project also involves collaboration with Luxtera, Kotura, Stanford University and the University of California, San Diego.
