The Harry DeWolf-class offshore patrol vessel is a Government of Canada procurement project for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) that is part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. The class was previously referred to as Arctic Offshore Patrol Ship (AOPS). In July 2007 the federal government announced plans for acquiring six to eight icebreaking warships for the RCN.
The vessels had been speculated to be modelled on the Norwegian Svalbard class and as of 2007 were projected to cost $3.5 billion (CAD) to construct with a total project procurement budgeted to cost $4.3 billion in order to cover maintenance over the 25-year lifespan of the vessels.
The lead ship of the class was announced as Harry DeWolf in September 2014, and four additional ships were named in January 2015. Construction of the ships Harry DeWolf and Margaret Brooke started in September 2015 and September 2016 at Halifax Shipyards, respectively. Both ships are expected to be delivered and in-service by 2018. Max Bernays and William Hall will begin construction in 2017, with Max Bernays to be delivered by late 2019, and William Hall by early 2020. Frédérick Rolette and Robert Hampton Gray, are planned to be in service by 2021 and 2022, respectively. Both Harry DeWolf and Margaret Brooke are planned to be retired from service and decommissioned by 2043.
