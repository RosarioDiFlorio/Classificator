Taxpayer groups, also known as taxpayers unions, are formal nonprofit or informal advocacy groups that promote lower taxation, reductions in government spending, and limits to government debt.
Many United States cities and counties have taxpayer groups. Members of these groups try to make their presence felt by attending government budget hearings, working with elected officials, and distributing their information on their views on taxing and spending. They can even initiate legislation at the state level to keep taxes and spending in check.
