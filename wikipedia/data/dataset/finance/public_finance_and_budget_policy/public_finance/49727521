In vitro models for calcification may refer to systems that have been developed in order to reproduce, in the best possible way, the calcification process that tissues or biomaterials undergo inside the body. The aim of these systems is to mimic the high levels of calcium and phosphate present in the blood and measure the extent of the crystal's deposition. Different variations can include other parameters to increase the veracity of these models, such as flow, pressure, compliance and resistance. All the systems have different limitations that have to be acknowledged regarding the operating conditions and the degree of representation. The rational of using such is to partially replace in vivo animal testing, whilst rendering much more controllable and independent parameters compared to an animal model.
The main use of these models is to study the calcification potential of prostheses that are in direct contact with the blood. In this category we find examples such as animal tissue prostheses (xenogeneic bioprosthesis). Xenogeneic heart valves are of special importance for this area of study as they demonstrate a limited durability mainly due to the fatigue of the tissue and the calcific deposits (see Aortic valve replacement).
