The tax wedge is the deviation from the equilibrium price/quantity (
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            ∗

   and

    {\displaystyle Q^{*}}
  , respectively) as a result of the taxation of a good. Because of the tax, consumers pay more for the good (
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{c}}
  ) than they did before the tax, and suppliers receive less for the good (
  
    
      
        
          P
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P_{s}}
  ) than they did before the tax . Put differently, the tax wedge is the difference between what consumers pay and what producers receive (net of tax) from a transaction. The tax effectively drives a "wedge" between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product.
Following from the Law of Supply and Demand, as the price to consumers increases, and the price received by suppliers decreases, the quantity that each wishes to trade will decrease. After a tax is introduced, a new equilibrium is reached, where consumers pay more
