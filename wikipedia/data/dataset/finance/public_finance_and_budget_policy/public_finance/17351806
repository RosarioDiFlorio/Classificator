The Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee (ETAAC) is a panel of the United States Department of the Treasury authorized under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. ETAAC panel members serve as volunteers that are appointed by the Secretary of Treasury and serve a three-year term. ETAAC’s primary purpose is to provide continued input into the development and implementation of the Internal Revenue Service’s strategy for electronic tax administration. ETAAC researches, analyzes, considers and makes recommendations on a wide range of electronic tax administration issues. Each June, ETAAC presents an annual report to the United States Congress on the IRS’s progress with electronic tax administration. ETAAC also provides an organized public forum for the discussion of electronic tax administration issues in support of the overriding goal that electronic filing should be the preferred and most convenient method of filing tax and information returns to the IRS.
