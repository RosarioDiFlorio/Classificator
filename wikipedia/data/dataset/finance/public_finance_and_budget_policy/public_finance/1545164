The Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB) was a tax-free monthly payment available to eligible Canadian families to help with the cost of raising children. The CCTB could incorporate the National Child Benefit (NCB), a monthly benefit for low-income families with children, and the Child Disability Benefit (CDB), a monthly benefit for families caring for children with severe and prolonged mental or physical disabilities.
The CCTB was enacted in response to a commitment made by the Canadian parliament, in November 1989, to eradicate child poverty in Canada by the year 2000. However, it has been found that, due to cutbacks to social assistance, the impact of this program in reducing child poverty is negligible.
This program was eliminated in 2016 and replaced by the Canada Child Benefit (CCB), a tax free payment of $533.00 per child under 6 and $450 per child from 6 to 17. Which is reduced at various rates by the number of children and the amount of money the household makes so that households at the top end of "middle-class" and "high-income" get nothing.
