Steuerberater (StB) is the professional license for tax advisors in Germany.
The provision of tax advisory services is restricted and basically permissible for Steuerberater only according to German law. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass the Steuerberaterpr√ºfung, a special uniform nationwide state examination. Merely being qualified as an attorney at law is not sufficient.
A similar license exists in Austria, please refer to Steuerberater (Austria).
