A taxpayer receipt is a proposed receipt given by government to taxpayers that would show the division of the citizens paid tax into different areas such as social security and military operations. In many countries the data for tax division is publicly available, and given the amount of taxes one has paid can be computed by a third party. Thus countries that implement taxpayer and countries that do not implement taxpayer receipt have the same amount of information available, the question is then whether or not this kind of information should be made available to citizens that are not interested enough to go through the trouble of computing the division of their personal taxes.
The taxpayer receipt will give you a breakdown of how your tax dollars are spent on priorities like education, veteranâ€™s benefits, or health care.
The 113th congress of the United States passed the Taxpayer's Receipt bill in August 2012. This bill was grounds for settling our worries of where our money is going after taxes are paid each and every year. The information stated on the bill gives us exact details of the Taxpayer Receipt and allows us answers to our questions. The proposed bill is public record and available online for anyone interested in seeing it.
