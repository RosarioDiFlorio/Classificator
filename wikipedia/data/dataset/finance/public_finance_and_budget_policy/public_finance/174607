Supply-side economics is a macroeconomic theory that argues economic growth can be most effectively created by lowering taxes and decreasing regulation. According to supply-side economics, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices, and employment will increase. It was started by economist Robert Mundell during the Ronald Reagan administration.
The Laffer curve is one of the main theoretical constructs of supply-side economics, the idea that lower tax rates when tax level is too high will actually boost government revenue because of higher economic growth.
The term supply-side economics was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist Jude Wanniski in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson, the term "supply side" was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein, a former economic adviser to President Nixon, and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. Its use connotes the ideas of economists Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer. Critics prefer the term trickle-down economics.
