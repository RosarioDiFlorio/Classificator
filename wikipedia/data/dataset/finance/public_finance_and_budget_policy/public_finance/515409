The term "offshore company" or "offshore corporation" is used in at least two distinct and different ways. An offshore company may be a reference to:
a corporation or (sometimes) other type of legal entity which is incorporated under the laws of a different country than in the jurisdiction of incorporation, and/or which statutory seat may not or does not deploy economic activities, and of which the actual beneficiary resides (or has his/her seat) in another country than where the offshore company has its legal seat. 
a company or corporate group (or sometimes a division thereof) which engages in offshoring manufacturing or business services.
The former use (companies formed in offshore jurisdictions) is probably the more common usage of the term. In isolated instances the term can also be used in reference to companies with offshore oil and gas operations.
