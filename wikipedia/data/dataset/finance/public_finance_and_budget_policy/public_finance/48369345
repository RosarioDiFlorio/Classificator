This is a list of countries by Military Strength Index based on the Credit Suisse report in September 2015. The factors under consideration for military strength and their total weights are: number of active personnel in the army (5%), tanks (10%), attack helicopters (15%), aircraft (20%), aircraft carriers (25%), and submarines (25%). The Military Strength Indicator introduced by Credit Suisse includes only the 20 strongest militaries and does not account for the actual training that the militaries may have.
