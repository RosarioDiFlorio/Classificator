Each president of the city of Kraków (known as the Mayor) fulfills his duties with the help of the City Council, city managers and the city inspectors. Their joint responsibilities include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing city budget as well as its administration, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The Kraków Council resides at the Wielopolski Palace at All Saints 3-4 Square in a historic building erected originally in 1560; purchased by the Municipality in 1864.
