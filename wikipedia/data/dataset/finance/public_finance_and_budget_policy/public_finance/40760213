The European Electronic Crime Task Force (EECTF) is an information sharing initiative, started in 2009 by an agreement between United States Secret Service, Italian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Poste Italiane, whose mission is to support the analysis and the development of best practices against cybercrime in European countries, through the creation of a strategic alliance between public and private sectors, including Law Enforcement, financial sector, academia, international institutions and ICT security vendors.
Accordingly, EECTF aims to help the cyber security community by:
Strengthening relationships between the different players;
Training and supporting members through sharing expertise and knowledge;
Enabling an effective communication channel for information exchange;
Maintaining co-operation on a technical and operational level.
