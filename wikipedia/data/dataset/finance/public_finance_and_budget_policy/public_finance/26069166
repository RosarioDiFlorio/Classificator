The Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (or I2WD) is a component of the US Army Communications-Electronics RD&E Center, based out of Aberdeen Proving Ground. Consisting of five primary divisions, I2WD forms a cohesive and effective Research and Development (R&D) enterprise which is capable of rapidly maturing critical technologies from initial concept, through support, to fielding.
I2WD’s goal is to develop and apply emerging technology that will significantly advance the Soldier’s fighting capabilities now and in the future. I2WD is developing and integrating the critical technologies required to provide a speedy transition from the research phase to the field.
Operations previously resided at Fort Monmouth, NJ. However, due to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure act, the majority of I2WD activities were transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground Sep 2011.
