Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to tax planning strategies used by multinational companies, that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity.The project headed by the OECD was initiated by the G20 in 2012.
BEPS concerns strategies which aim to move profits to where they are taxed at lower rates and expenses to where they are relieved at higher rates. The result is a tendency to associate more profit with legal constructs and intangible rights and obligations, and reduce the share of profits associated with substantive operations involving the interaction of people with one another. "While these corporate tax planning strategies may be technically legal and rely on carefully planned interactions of a variety of tax rules and principles, the overall effect of this type of tax planning is to erode the corporate tax base of many countries in a manner that is not intended by domestic policy."
Key issues include:
International mismatches in the way entities and instruments are characterised by different jurisdictions
Digital delivery of goods and services, and how this relates to tax treaty rules
Inter-group financial transactions such as related party loans and captive insurance
Transfer pricing, in particular in relation to the shifting of risks and intangibles, the artificial splitting of ownership of assets between legal entities within a group, and transactions between such entities that would rarely take place between independents;
The effectiveness of anti tax avoidance measures
Preferential regimes
