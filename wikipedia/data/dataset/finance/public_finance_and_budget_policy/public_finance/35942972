The United Kingdom's Polaris programme provided the first submarine-based British nuclear weapons system.
"Polaris" itself was an operational system of four Resolution-class submarines, each armed with 16 UGM-27 Polaris A-3 ballistic missiles, with each missile able to deliver three ET.317 thermonuclear warheads around a single target. This configuration was later upgraded to carry two hardened warheads along with a range of decoys.
Operated by the Royal Navy and based at Clyde Naval Base on Scotland's west coast, a few miles from Glasgow, Scotland's largest city and the UK's third largest city. At least one submarine was always on patrol to provide a continuous at-sea deterrent.
The British Polaris programme was announced in December 1962 following the Nassau Agreement between the US and the UK. Construction of the submarines began in 1964, and the first patrol took place in June 1968.
In the 1970s it was determined that the re-entry vehicles were vulnerable to a Soviet anti-ballistic missile screen concentrated around Moscow. To ensure that a credible and independent nuclear deterrent was maintained, the UK developed an improved front-end named Chevaline. There was huge controversy when this project became public knowledge in 1980, as it had been kept secret by four successive governments while incurring huge expenditure.
Polaris patrols continued until May 1996, by which time the phased handover to the replacement Trident system had been completed.
