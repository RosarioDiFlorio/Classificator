The National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy is a Government of Canada program operated by the Department of Public Works and Government Services. The National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy (NSPS) was developed in an effort to renew the fleets of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG). The strategy was broken into three sections; the combat package, the non-combat package and the smaller vessel package. The smaller vessel package was not able to bid on by those companies who won one of larger ship packages.
The National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy was launched on 3 June 2010 and the results for the two larger packages were made public on 19 October 2011. Contracts for smaller vessels under the NSPS were announced as they were awarded.
