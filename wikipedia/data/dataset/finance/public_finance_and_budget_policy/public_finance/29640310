CompleteTax was an online tax preparation software for individuals to use to prepare and file their federal and state income tax returns.
The program was developed by CCH, a Wolters Kluwer business, that has been providing tax, accounting and audit information and software solutions since 1913, the year the U.S. federal income tax was created. It was reviewed by The Street as well as About.com. Complete Tax merged with eSmart Tax as of December 26, 2012.
