The Acquisition Management System (AMS) provides policy and guidance on lifecycle acquisition management by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The self-stated objectives of the AMS "are to increase the quality, reduce the time, manage the risk, and minimize the cost of delivering safe and secure services to the aviation community and flying public." The AMS applies to acquisitions by the FAA in place of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and various other provisions of Federal acquisition law.
