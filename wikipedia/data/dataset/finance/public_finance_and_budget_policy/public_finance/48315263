The International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD) is a research centre based at the Institute of Development Studies, and funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. Founded in 2010 with close to Â£6 million in funding, its mission is to generate knowledge that will help developing countries to mobilise domestic resources efficiently, effectively, and equitably, and develop tax systems that promote good governance and pro-poor economic growth.
Towards these ends, the ICTD fosters a network of social science researchers from developing countries to engage with taxation issues by funding research, building research capacity through courses and workshops, and collaborating with a range of partners including the African Tax Administration Forum, the Institute for Security Studies, and the Chr. Michelsen Institute. It also aims to disseminate its research evidence to policymakers through its publications and annual centre meetings in Africa. By sharing its research findings, the ICTD aims to widen the public debate on taxation and governance in developing countries.
