The International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is an annual conference in the field of operations research. Two tracks are held simultaneous, covering domain independent methodologies and technologies and also practical work developed in specific application areas. These tracks are present in the conference not only in technical sessions but also in poster sessions, keynote lectures and tutorials.
The works presented in the conference are published in the conference proceedings and are made available at the SCITEPRESS digital library. Usually, it's established a cooperation with Springer for a post-publication with some of the conference best papers. The first edition of ICORES was held in 2012 in conjunction with the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART) and the International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods (ICPRAM).
