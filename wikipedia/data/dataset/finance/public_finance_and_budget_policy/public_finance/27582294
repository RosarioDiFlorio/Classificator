This is a list of countries by military expenditure per capita, the amount spent by a nation on its military per capita in a given year. This list is sourced from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute for the year 2015. Note: by 2014 there had been a large change in Saudi military expenditure per capita, standing at 80.8 billion for a population of some 30.8 million, thus surpassing $2623 per capita spending by Saudi Arabia. In April 2015 it was confirmed that of all the world's countries, Saudi Arabia's military spending was the highest "by far" as percent of GDP as well as highest in per capita military spending.
