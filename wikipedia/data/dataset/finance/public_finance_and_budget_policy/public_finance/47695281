The Budget Memorandum (Dutch: Miljoenennota, literally "Millions Bill") is a general explanation by the Government of the Netherlands of the expected revenues and expenses in the National Budget for a year.
After the king has given the Speech from the throne on Prinsjesdag (every third Tuesday in September), the Finance Minister offers the suitcase with the National Budget and the Budget Memorandum to the president of the House of Representatives.
