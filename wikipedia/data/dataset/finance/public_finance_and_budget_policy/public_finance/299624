Under United States tax law, the standard deduction is a dollar amount that non-itemizers may subtract from their income before income tax is applied. Taxpayers may choose either itemized deductions or the standard deduction, whichever results in the lesser amount of tax payable. The standard deduction is available to US citizens and aliens who are resident for tax purposes and who are individuals, married persons, and heads of household. The standard deduction is based on filing status and typically increases each year. It is not available to nonresident aliens residing in the United States (with few exceptions, for example, students from India on F1 visa status can use the standard deduction). Additional amounts are available for persons who are blind and/or are at least 65 years of age.
The standard deduction is distinct from personal exemptions, which also are available to all taxpayers and dependents.
