A tax form is a blank document or template supplied by a government for use in the reporting of tax information to the government or to potential taxpayers. Specific tax forms are intended to be used by taxpayers, the government itself, or private entities that are required to report information on the tax liabilities of other private entities. Entities fill out the form and file it with the government as a tax return.
