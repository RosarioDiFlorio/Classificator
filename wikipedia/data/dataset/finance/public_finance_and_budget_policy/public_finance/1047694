The solidarity tax on wealth () is an annual direct wealth tax on those in France having assets in excess of €1,300,000, (since 2011) . It was one of the Socialist Party's 1981 electoral program's measures, 110 Propositions for France. First named IGF (Impôt sur les Grandes Fortunes), it was abolished in 1986 by Jacques Chirac's right-wing government, but re-established in 1988 as ISF in slightly different terms after François Mitterrand's re-election.
In september 2017, the French government decided to abolish ISF and replace it with the solidarity tax on real estate (IFI), exonerating all financial assets.
