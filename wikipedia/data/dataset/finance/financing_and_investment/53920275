Security vote in Nigeria is a monthly allowance that is allocated to the 36 states within the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the sole purpose of funding security services within such states. The monthly fund run into billions of naira and vary based on the level of security required by the individual state. States such as Rivers State, who face security threats such as pipeline destructions and kidnapping, receive one of the largest security vote funds.
Security votes have not been widely accepted by citizens, as most have claimed that such funds are being abused by the state governments, because how the funds are disbursed as not accountable to any agency. The state governments are advised to use their discretion in ways on how to spend the funds.
