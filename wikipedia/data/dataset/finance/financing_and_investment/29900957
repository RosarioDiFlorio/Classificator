Domain Developers Fund (DDF) is the first public open-ended alternative investment fund exclusively invested in Internet domain names. DDF maintains an inventory of websites and domain names, including a wide variety of gTLD and ccTLD domains, from which it extracts advertising revenue through a combination of pay per click advertising, affiliate marketing and domain parking. Internet domains are perceived as an alternate asset class for investment diversification.
