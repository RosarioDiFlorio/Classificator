The Trillion dollar club is an unofficial classification of the world's major economies with a gross domestic product (nominal GDP) of more than USD 1 trillion per year. As of 2011 it currently includes 15 countries.
Due to the world financial crisis, South Korea and Australia exited the trillion dollar club as their nominal GDPs shrank below $1 trillion in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Australia rejoined the list in 2010 while South Korea did so in 2011 as these countries' nominal GDPs once again were above $1 trillion. Accordingly, with the IMF, Mexico's estimated nominal GDP in 2009 also disminished below the trillion dollar mark, although other sources such as the CIA reported it above the mark.
Africa and Antarctica are the only continents without countries included in the group.
