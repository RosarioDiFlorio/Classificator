An Individual Pension Plan or IPP is a Canadian retirement savings vehicle. An IPP is a one-person maximum Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DB Plan) which allows the plan member to accrue retirement income on a tax-deferred basis. As such, an IPP must conform to the Canadian Income Tax Act (ITA) and regulations (ITR) as well as the requirements of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) with respect to defined benefit pension plans. It is possible for an IPP to be a combination plan offering both Defined Benefits and Defined Contribution pensions
