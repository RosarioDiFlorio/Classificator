Asset price inflation is a economic phenomenon denoting a rise in price of assets, as opposed to ordinary goods and services. Typical assets are financial instruments such as bonds, shares, and their derivatives, as well as real estate and other capital goods. Although the values of such assets are often casually said to "inflate," this should not be confused with inflation as a defined term. A more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation.
