A bellwether is one that leads or indicates trends; a trendsetter.
The term is derived from the Middle English bellewether and refers to the practice of placing a bell around the neck of a castrated ram (a wether) leading the flock of sheep. The movements of the flock could be noted by hearing the bell when the flock was not in sight.
