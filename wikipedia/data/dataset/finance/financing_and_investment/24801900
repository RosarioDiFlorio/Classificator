Advisors Sentiment survey is a field of market sentiment. Advisors Sentiment was devised by Abe Cohen of Chartcraft in 1963 and is still operated by Chartcraft, now under their brand name of Investors Intelligence. The survey surveys independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds). Findings are reported weekly as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, bearish and those that expect a correction. The survey is anecdotal evidence as to extremes in investor confidence, conditions which are often seen at major market turning points.
The survey is often quoted in the media. In August 2009, articles in the LA Times and Wall Street Journal reported that advisors were as bearish as they were in October 2007, a warning sign that markets were getting ahead of themselves.
