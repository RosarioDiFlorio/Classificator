The apsar (Abkhaz: аҧсар) is a currency of Abkhazia. So far, only coins in denominations of 10, 25 and 50 apsars have been issued. While the coins are legal tender in the Republic of Abkhazia, their usage is very limited, and the coins are mostly made for collectors. In Abkhazia, the Russian ruble is used in practice. The first apsar coins were introduced in 2008.
The Bank of Abkhazia is responsible for the apsar coins, and has so far issued two series: "Outstanding personalities of Abkhazia" (6 coins) and "The patriotic war of the Abkhaz nation 1992–1993" (2 coins). Persons who have appeared on coins include:
Vladislav Ardzinba, president 1994–2005
Fazil Iskander, writer
Dmitry Gulia, writer
Samson Chanba, writer and statesman
Bagrat Shinkuba, writer and politician
Aleksandr Chachba, artist
10 apsar coins are made of silver; 25 and 50 apsar coins are made of gold. The number of coins produced is low: 2,000 silver coins are minted and 1,000 gold coins.
