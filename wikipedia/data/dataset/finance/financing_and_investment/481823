The forward market is the informal over-the-counter financial market by which contracts for future delivery are entered into. Standardized forward contracts are called futures contracts and traded on a futures exchange.
It should not be confused with the futures market, as
Future contracts are traded in exchanges whereas a forward contract is traded over the counter.
The forward market is highly customized.
Each party has to deal with counterparty risk, unlike exchange-traded futures where the contracts are renovated.
