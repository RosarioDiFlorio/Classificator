In futures trading, a box spread is a spread constructed from two consecutive butterfly spreads (also known as a "double butterfly"), summing to +1 -3 +3 -1 in consecutive, or at least equally spaced, contracts. The term also has an alternative meaning within the context of inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a calendar spread for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range. The box spread, like normal butterfly and calendar spreads, derives it's hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.
