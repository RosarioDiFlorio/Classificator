In macro-economics the term infrastructure usually refers to public infrastructure. That is, that which provides or supports state services. There is also firm-specific infrastructure such as factories, private roads, capital equipment, and other infrastructural capital assets under private ownership.
The related term "firm-specific human capital" applies to the development of individual capital, social capital and instructional capital to specifically enable the activities of a particular firm or enterprise.
