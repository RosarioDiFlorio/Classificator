The constant ratio plan was one of the first plans devised when institutions started to invest in the stock market. The plan is often called rebalancing. Another type of plan is called a "variable ratio plan". There are several ways of executing these plans. The simplest is called the Constant Dollar Plan, which has been discussed in various investing books.
