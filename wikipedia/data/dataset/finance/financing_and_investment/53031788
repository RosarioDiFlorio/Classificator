In finance, MIDAS (an acronym for Market Interpretation/Data Analysis System) is an approach to technical analysis initiated in 1995 by the physicist and technical analyst Paul Levine, PhD, and subsequently developed by Andrew Coles, PhD, and David Hawkins in a series of articles and the book MIDAS Technical Analysis: A VWAP Approach to Trading and Investing in Today's Markets. Latterly, several important contributions to the project, including new MIDAS curves and indicators, have been made by Bob English, many of them published in the book.
Paul Levine's initial MIDAS work and the new MIDAS approaches developed in the book and other publications by Coles, Hawkins, and English have been taught at university level and are currently the subject of independent study intended for academic publication. The same MIDAS techniques have also been widely implemented as part of private trader and hedge fund strategies. The MIDAS curves and indicators developed by Levine, Coles, Hawkins, and English have also been commercially developed by an independent trading software company for the Ninja Trader trading platform, while individual curves and indicators have been officially coded by developers of a large number of trading platforms, including Metastock, TradeStation, and eSignal.
The new MIDAS curves and indicators are in line with the accomplished MIDAS goal of developing an independent approach to financial market analysis with unique standalone indicators available for every type of market environment while also offering information not available from other technical analysis systems.
