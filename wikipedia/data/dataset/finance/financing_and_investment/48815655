Differential voting right (DVR) shares are same as ordinary equity shares except these provide fewer voting rights to the holder. So they usually trade at a discount and may offer higher dividends for surrender of the voting rights. Sale of such stock does not dilute the promoters voting rights and makes it difficult for hostile takeovers.
