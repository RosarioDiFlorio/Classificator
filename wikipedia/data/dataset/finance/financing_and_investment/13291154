A government investment pool (GIP), or local government investment pool (LGIP), is a state or local government pool offered to public entities for the investment of public funds. These pools are important investments tools, offering safety with a competitive yield. GIP managers are vested with a public trust that the pool will maintain liquidity, diversity, and follow the investment poolâ€™s guidelines. GIPs have a history of prudent management; however, there have been several isolated instances of fund losses. Despite these failures, GIPs are required to provide regularly reporting and disclosure to its participants, fund investors.
Although many GIPs are managed by government employees, there are also GIPs that are managed by outside investment firms.
