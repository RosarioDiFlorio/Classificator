The Regional Investment Company of Wallonia (French: Société Régionale d'Investissement de Wallonie or SRIW) was founded by the Walloon Region in 1979 to provide capital to the Walloon industry. The purpose of the SRIW is to invest in the equity of unlisted companies (private equity). The SRIW acts either by purchasing shares of companies, by increasing the capital of the business, by subscribing to a bond issue, or by granting subordinated or convertible loans.
