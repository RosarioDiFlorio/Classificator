Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment (SEED) Policy and Practice Initiative is a long-term savings and investment account policy and practice endeavor that develops, tests and impels matched savings accounts and financial education for children and youth. The SEED accounts are installed at birth with an initial deposit of $1,000, and accumulates over the span of a lifetime. All the money will be invested in childrenâ€™s savings accounts for future purposes.
Established in 2003, the SEED initiative accrues deposits from family, friends, and accountholders themselves, as well as augmented by other public and private sources. Each voluntary contribution from any public or private sector should be invented by a public match that increases in value over time for lower-income families.
