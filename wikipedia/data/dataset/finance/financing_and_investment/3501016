A convenience yield is an implied return on holding inventories. It is an adjustment to the cost of carry in the non-arbitrage pricing formula for forward prices in markets with trading constraints.
Let 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            t
            ,
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{t,T}}
   be the forward price of an asset with initial price 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{t}}
   and maturity 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  . Suppose that 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   is the continuously compounded interest rate for one year. Then, the non-arbitrage pricing formula should be

  
    
      
        
          F
          
            t
            ,
            T
          
        
        =
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
        ⋅
        
          e
          
            r
            (
            T
            −
            t
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{t,T}=S_{t}\cdot e^{r(T-t)}}
  
However, this relationship does not hold in most commodity markets, partly because of the inability of investors and speculators to short the underlying asset, 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{t}}
  . Instead, there is a correction to the forward pricing formula given by the convenience yield 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  . Hence

  
    
      
        
          F
          
            t
            ,
            T
          
        
        =
        
          S
          
            t
          
        
        ⋅
        
          e
          
            (
            r
            −
            c
            )
            (
            T
            −
            t
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{t,T}=S_{t}\cdot e^{(r-c)(T-t)}}
  
This makes it possible for backwardation to be observable.
