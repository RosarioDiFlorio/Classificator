The Beetham Organisation is a privately owned property development and investment company based in Liverpool, UK. It was founded by Hugh Frost as Oastdren Investments in 1985. Its primary focus is city-centre real estate, specialising in hotel, residential and office projects. As of 2005, Hugh Frost owned 67%, his sons Stephen Beetham (born Stephen Frost) owned 27% and Simon Frost held the remaining 6% of the company. Stephen changed his name from Frost to Beetham after the sect into which he had been born, the Plymouth Brethren. Beetham is an ancestral family name; the name of the business was changed soon afterwards.
