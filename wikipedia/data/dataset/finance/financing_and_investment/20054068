Two assets are said to be complements when investment in one asset increases the marginal return on the other. On the contrary, assets are substitutes when investment in one reduces the marginal return on the other.
If the production process is described by the production function 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are the amounts invested of the two assets, then it is possible to define formally the elasticity of substitution as
