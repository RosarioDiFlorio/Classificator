The time-weighted return (TWR) (or true time-weighted rate of return (TWRR)) is a method of calculating investment return. To apply the time-weighted return method, combine the return over sub-periods, by compounding them together, resulting in the overall period return. The rate of return over each different sub-period is weighted according to the duration of the sub-period.
The time-weighted method differs from other methods of calculating investment return only in the particular way it compensates for external flows - see below.
