In the United States, Nifty Fifty refers to the historic benchmarking index that was used in the 1960s to reflect the stock index. It contained 50 popular large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960s and 1970s that were widely regarded as solid buy and hold growth stocks, or "Blue-chip" stocks. These fifty stocks are credited by historians with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s. Most are still solid performers, although a few are now defunct or otherwise worthless. The American nifty fifty is now defunct as it was subsequently replaced by the S&P 500.
In India, the term Nifty 50 refers to the diversified stock index of the National stock exchange, consisting of 50 stocks that represent 12 sectors of the Indian economy. It is one of the two main benchmarking indices in India, along with the BSE Sensex.
