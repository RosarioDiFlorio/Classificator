The International Monetary Market (IMM), a spin-off from the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange and largely the creation of Leo Melamed, is today one of four divisions of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the largest futures exchange in the United States, for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures. The IMM was started on May 16, 1972. Two of the more prevalent contracts traded are currency futures and interest rate futures, specifically, 3-month Eurodollar time deposits and 90-day U.S. Treasury bills. The other two CME divisions includes the Index and Option Market (IOM) and Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM). All products fall under one of these three divisions.
