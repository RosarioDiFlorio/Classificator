The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) was established by the US Congress on November 6, 2003. It allocated $18.4 billion to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, damaged from years of neglect, sanctions, and war.
As of March 29, 2006, approximately $16.3 billion, or 89%, had been obligated and $11.4 billion had been expended. The fund has come under some criticism due to the slowness with which the allocated money has been disbursed, largely because of the time-consuming US procurement process.
A budget for the allocation of the $18.4 billion may be found here.
Weekly updates on reconstruction spending are available from www.defendamerica.mil, and from www.usaid.gov.
The duties of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction include oversight of expenditures from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.
