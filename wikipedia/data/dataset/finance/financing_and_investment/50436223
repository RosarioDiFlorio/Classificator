A SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) is an agreement between an investor and a company that provides rights to the investor for equity in the company similar to a warrant, except without determining a specific price per share. The SAFE investor receives the futures shares when a priced round of investment or liquidation event occurs. Startup accelerator Y Combinator released the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) investment instrument as an alternative to convertible debt in late 2013.
