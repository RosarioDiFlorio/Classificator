Ultraperformance (translation of ultrarendimento) is an advanced concept of performance that goes beyond mere financial profit to include a series of positive, non-monetary but measurable effects generated by investment in the real economy. It normally goes hand-in-hand with a conception of a company in which people are central and all stakeholders - shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers and the local community - are involved. It promotes seeing monetary returns in the light of sustainable economic, social and environmental principles, where company success is viewed in a medium/long-term perspective.
