Sitra (Finnish: Suomen itsenäisyyden juhlarahasto), the Finnish Innovation Fund, was founded in 1967 as a part of the Bank of Finland. Currently it is an independent public foundation which operates directly under the supervision of the Finnish Parliament. Sitra aims to make Finland succeed as a pioneer of sustainable well-being by anticipating the direction societal trends are taking, exploring alternatives for development, and bringing together partners from different sectors for open-minded trials and reforms.
Sitra’s organizational structure makes it an internationally unique operator in the field of sustainable development and well-being. Sitra was a present given by Parliament to Finland on the country’s 50th anniversary. Its duties are stated in legislation. Although Sitra operates directly under the Finnish Parliament, it is not answerable to the government in power, nor to a certain party or a trend at any time.
Sitra’s operational independence has been further strengthened by its funding model. Its operations are funded with endowment capital originally granted by the Finnish Parliament and returns from capital investments. According to law, the funds must be invested securely and in a profitable manner. Although the return from Sitra’s endowment fluctuates, it averages approximately 30 million euros a year. Sitra does not spend the endowment or receive any tax-generated government funding. Compared to Tekes, which is a part of the government through a ministry, Sitra invests in companies and startups to create new profitable business, whereas Tekes funds research in companies or universities without an explicit profit motive.
Sitra’s independent position has enabled it to bring government, officials, researchers, artists, companies, and NGOs together to work for the better tomorrow.
