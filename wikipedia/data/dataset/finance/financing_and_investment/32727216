Legal Alpha is the extra performance generated in a specific, diversified investment portfolio by using opportunistic and selective legal activism to obtain compensation for under-performance related to legally relevant unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances.
Traditionally, fund managers have been focusing on generating economic alpha by making effective investment decisions before the investment assets are allocated and deployed, followed by an active performance and benchmark related monitoring of the portfolioâ€™s performance. Several methods and theories for the generation of alpha exist and new methods and theories are constantly developed and tested. Legal alpha represents an additional method of improving performance. This can be achieved by actively monitoring a portfolio for legal opportunities to obtain compensation for under-performance related to unforeseen and uncontrollable events involving non-transparent market information. Thus, Legal Alpha is generated by recovery efforts, thereby limiting the downside of any performance cycles and adding to the economic alpha generated by effective investment decisions.
