The G33 (or the Friends of Special Products in agriculture) is a coalition of developing countries, established prior to the 2003 Cancun ministerial conference, that have coordinated during the Doha Round of World Trade Organisation negotiations, specifically in regard to agriculture.
Dominated by India, the group has "defensive" concerns regarding agriculture in relation to World Trade Organisation negotiations, and seeks to limit the degree of market opening required of developing countries. The group has advocated the creation of a "special products" exemption, which would allow developing countries to exempt certain products from tariff reductions, and also a "special safeguard mechanism" which would permit tariff increases in response to import surges.
