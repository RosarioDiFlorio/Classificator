Unlike an angel investor, a vulture investor buys up assets and financial instruments below cost from distressed entities. This could take the form of securities, debt, held assets, real estate, etc. A vulture investor may purchase the controlling shares of a company in order to liquidate, thereby realizing a higher yield return on investment than the original purchase price. Real estate could be purchased from a borrower who is no longer able to make payments on their loan and needs to sell the property in order to improve their balance sheet or retain their credit rating.
