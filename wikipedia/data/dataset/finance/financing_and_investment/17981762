Stock market cycles are the long-term price patterns of stock markets and are often associated with general business cycles. They are key to technical analysis where the approach to investing is based on cycles or repeating price patterns.
The efficacy of the predictive nature of these cycles is controversial and some of these cycles have been quantitatively examined for statistical significance.
Well known cycles include:
The lunar cycle
Annual seasonality, also known as Sell in May or the Halloween indicator As well as the January effect and July effect.
The four-year United States presidential election cycle in the US.
The 17.6 Year Stock Market Cycle
The 60 year Kondratiev cycles
Investment advisor Mark Hulbert has tracked the long-term performance of Norman Fosbackâ€™s a Seasonality Timing System that combines month-end and holiday-based buy/sell rules. According to Hulbert, this system has been able to outperform the market with significantly less risk. According to Stan Weinstein there are four stages in a major cycle of stocks, stock sectors or the stock market as a whole. These four stages are (1) consolidation or base building (2) upward advancement (3) culmination (4) decline.
