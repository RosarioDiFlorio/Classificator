Investment value is the value of a property to a particular investor. In the U.S. and U.K., it is equal to market value for the investor who has the capacity to put the property to good useâ€”its highest-and-best-use, its most valuable use. For other investors with limited capacity or vision, investment value is lower because they cannot put the property to use in a way that is maximally productive.
