This article is about the LIFFE, until the takeover by Euronext

The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE, pronounced 'life') is a futures exchange based in London.
LIFFE is now part of Intercontinental Exchange group following a series of takeovers. Euronext acquired LIFFE in 2002, and were then in turn taken over by NYSE in 2007, to form NYSE Euronext. The main rationale for this transaction was to gain ownership of LIFFE. In the same manner, Intercontinental Exchange then purchased NYSE Euronext in 2013, principally to acquire LIFFE. Euronext then completed an IPO in 2014, but LIFFE remained in the portfolio of the ICE NYSE group under the name ICE Futures Europe.
