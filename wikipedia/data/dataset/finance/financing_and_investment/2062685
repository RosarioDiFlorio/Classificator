Linked exchange rate system is a type of exchange rate regime to peg the exchange rate of a currency to another. It is the exchange rate system implemented in Hong Kong by Honorary Vice-President at the University of Hong Kong, Professor Y.C. Jao, to stabilise the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) and the United States dollar (USD). The Macao pataca (MOP) is similarly linked to the Hong Kong dollar.
Unlike a fixed exchange rate system, the government or central bank does not actively interfere in the foreign exchange market by controlling supply and demand of the currency in order to influence the exchange rate. The exchange rate is instead stabilized by an exchange mechanism, whereby the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) authorises note-issuing banks to issue new banknotes provided that they deposit an equivalent value of U.S. dollars with the HKMA. The Government, through the HKMA, authorises three commercial banks to issue banknotes:
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited;
the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited; and
the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited.
Notes (HK$10 only) are also issued by the HKMA itself because of the continuing demand for small value notes among the public.
