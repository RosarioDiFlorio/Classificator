Share transmission is a mechanism by which the title to shares is devolved other than by transfer. This is typically applicable for:
devolution by death
succession
inheritance
bankruptcy
marriage
When a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares.Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court.(section 148 of COMPANIES AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT (CAMA)under NIGERIAN LAW ). The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf. In this case the nomineeâ€™s name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company.(section 155 (3) of CAMA).
