A coin wrapper, sometimes known as a bank roll or roll, is a paper or plastic container for a number of coins.
In the United States, empty rolls are available free at most banks in every denomination (though it is becoming increasingly difficult for half dollar and dollar to be readily made available). The rolls come flat and one side will have to be folded to allow for coins to be placed inside. When the roll is full, the top side will need to be folded. Typically, the full rolls are brought back to the banks in exchange for currency or to be deposited.
In the Eurozone, empty plastic rolls are used at banks in every denomination, with five-coin staggered rows. Their main advantages are:
Reliability
Their five-coin staggered rows and transparency make quick verification of contents possible.
Certainty
They provide a high degree of certainty (transparency, reliable and legible contents).
Cost effective 
The high certainty means less time spent processing coins, while the solidity and two-way closure system increase the number of times the coin roll can be used, effectively reducing its overall cost.
In Japan, machine-wrapped coin rolls with plastic container are circulated exclusively, handmade coin rolls are rare. All rolls contains 50 coins. Customers can change bills into coin rolls easily by automatic money changer at Japanese banks.
