A hotel loyalty program or hotel reward program is a loyalty program typically run by a hotel chain. The hotel loyalty program is a key strategy from the hotel chain in attracting business to its properties.
A hotel loyalty program works to entice business travellers or other frequent hotel guests to favour that particular brand or group of hotels over others when selecting a hotel.
A hotel loyalty program will generally have multiple levels. Newly joined members are offered some privileges, such as free internet  to encourage them to join the scheme. This ensures that the guest has an incentive to use their loyalty card, even if they do not anticipate reaching the next rewards level. In addition, joining the scheme and staying nights in a hotel will typically accrue points, which are similar to frequent flyer miles, and can be redeemed for free nights in hotels (the number of points required to stay a night may vary based on the normal cost of the hotel, and on the day of the week or season).
Higher levels in the scheme will typically offer a combination of benefits including free room upgrades, bonus points, rolling 24-hour check-in, and free access to more of the hotel's facilities, such as buffet breakfasts, executive lounges, spas, and other features. Higher levels are typically reached by staying a certain number of nights during the membership year.
The world's largest hotel chains, including Marriott, Starwood, Hyatt, Hilton, and others, all operate reward programs, however some luxury brands such as Four Seasons have eschewed the concept, saying they prefer building loyalty through personalised service.
