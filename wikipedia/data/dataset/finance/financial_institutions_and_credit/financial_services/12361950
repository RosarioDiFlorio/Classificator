Frozen state pensions refers to the practice of the British government of "freezing" state pensions for pensioners who live in the majority of overseas countries. There are many anomalies. Most Commonwealth countries are included in the frozen list, and some non-Commonwealth, non-European countries are in the list where UK pensioners get the same indexation as pensioners resident in Britain.
All British State pensioners receive their pension based on the level of their compulsory and voluntary contributions to the National Insurance Fund. However, if the beneficiary moves abroad, their level of pension is then dependent upon where they live.
Freezing starts with the first payment received in the frozen country.
