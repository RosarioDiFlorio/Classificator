The Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 (H.R. 3211) is a bill that would direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to amend its regulations related to qualified mortgages to reflect new exclusions made by this bill. The CFPB released new regulations regarding the definition of a Qualified Mortgage that took effect in January 2014, a definition that this bill would modify.
The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.
