Pawnbroking is one of the earliest businesses in Hong Kong. The pawnshop is a financial institution that receives movable and immovable property as collateral, lending money to the others. Private sole proprietorship or partnership were the common type of ownership. Clients have to pay interest in order to redeem goods. Pawnshop is a place for people to deal with financial difficulties. There are around three to five employees for a small pawn shop and a dozen of employees for a large one.
