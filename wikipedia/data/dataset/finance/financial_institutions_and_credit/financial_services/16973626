A No-Doc or Low-doc loan (abbr: No/Low Documentation Loan) refers to loans that do not require borrowers to provide documentation of their income to lenders or do not require much documentation. It is a financial product commonly offered by a mortgage lender to consumers who cannot qualify for normal loan products because of fluctuating or hard-to-verify incomes, such as the self-employed, or to serve long time customers with strong credit. Applicants are often required to provide a substantial down payment, i.e. a larger deposit either through equity in security or personal savings.
Self-employed, unemployed, seasonal workers, and new immigrants generally struggle to meet strict requirements to qualify for loans. A loan with few to no documentation or credit history requirements is easier to qualify for, but generally carries a significantly higher interest rate.
