The pension system and its financing are some of the most important but also some of the most difficult roles of a modern country. Every prosperous community has a pension system at present; the citizens rely on its stability and the system provides most of them with the main part of their income in old age. The system's stability and financial sustainability are some of the key preconditions for successful operation of the state and satisfaction of its citizens. It is therefore very important to have a sound database for pension system analyses and a reliable model for pension system simulations and projections, for an example of a complex pension model see e.g. (Deloitte, 2011)
