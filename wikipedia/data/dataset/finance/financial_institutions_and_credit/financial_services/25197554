Integrity in Mobile Phone Financial Services is a book published by the World Bank that analyses the risks of financial crime through cellular phones. In particular the book looks at money laundering risks and counter-terrorism. Using fieldwork in seven countries as a basis (Hong Kong, Macao, the Philippines, South Korea, Malaysia, Brazil and South Africa), the paper provides guidance on the best means of assessing perceived versus actual risks. It then identifies specific measures that countries use to mitigate them. The authors of the book are Pierre-Laurent Chatain, Raul Hernandez-Coss, Kamil Borowik and Andrew Zerzan.
The book has been presented a number of fora with some of the authors, Chatain and Zerzan, being guest speakers to present their findings at the global Mobile Money Summit in Barcelona, Spain in June 2009. Their speech covered the mobile banking regulations in developing countries.
The book was recognised by the United Nations in 2009 in its report called Tackling the Financing of Terrorism. As a response to the demand of this book, the World Bank plans to release a second edition in late 2009
