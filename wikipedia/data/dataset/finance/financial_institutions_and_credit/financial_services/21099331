Mortgage to Rent is part of the Home Owners' Support Fund, run by the Scottish Government. It is used by homeowners who are threatened with eviction due to non-payment of their mortgages.
Under the scheme, a homeowner's property is bought by a housing association, which then rents the property back to the owner, who is able to stay on as a social tenant.
To qualify, the homeowner needs to have:
legal action threatened
consent of all property owners (e.g., both husband and wife)
proof of primary residence
no inhibition contract against sale of the property
