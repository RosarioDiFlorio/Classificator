Barclaycard (stylized as barclaycard) is a multinational credit card and payment services provider, and a division of Barclays plc. The Barclaycard was the first British credit card introduced in the United Kingdom, coming into service in 1966. It enjoyed a monopoly, until the introduction of the Access card in 1972.
The 'Barclaycard' was not the first payment card to be issued in the United Kingdom though; Diners Club and American Express launched their charge cards in 1962 and 1963 respectively. At the time, American Express was seen as Barclaycard's main competitor.
Barclaycard later became part of the Visa network, but now offer MasterCard, Visa and American Express versions. As of May 2016, Barclaycard remains one of Europeâ€™s leading credit card issuers with over 10 million customers in the United Kingdom. Barclaycard's main offices are in Northampton, along with several floors at Barclays' corporate headquarters, One Churchill Place in Canary Wharf, London.
