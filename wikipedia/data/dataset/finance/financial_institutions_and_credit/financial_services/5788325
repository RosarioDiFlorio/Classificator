Property Use
Pertaining to residential mortgages and their risk-based pricing methods, the property use is sub-categorized as follows:
Primary residence,
Second home,
Non-owner occupied or investment property
A primary residence is viewed and priced as the lowest risk factor of Property Use. There are no adjustments to pricing or rate.
A second home is viewed and priced according to lender, some will assess the same risk factor as a primary residence while others will factor in a 0.125% to 0.5% pricing increase to mitigate the perceived risk. Lenders perceive that the borrower is less likely to value the second home if the borrower was faced with financial difficulties.
A non-owner occupied property is viewed and priced as the highest risk factor of property use. Lenders will factor in a 0.5% to 2.5% pricing increase to mitigate the perceived risk.
Ask a corresponding mortgage broker, mortgage banker, or retail banker for specific pricing adjustments according to property use.
