The J.P. Morgan Palladium Card (now formally re-branded the J.P. Morgan Reserve Card) was an invitation-only Visa credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. The laser engraved card was minted out of solid brass and plated with palladium. The card and its successor dominates a category of ultra exclusive, invitation-only credit and charge cards, which includes the American Express Centurion Card.
