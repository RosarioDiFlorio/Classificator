Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) is the "Advanced Financial Planning" designation awarded by The American College of Financial Services. Charter holders use the designation ChFC on their resumes and are qualified to provide comprehensive advanced financial planning for individuals, professionals, and small business owners. The authority to use the ChFC mark is granted by the Certification Committee of the Board of Trustees of The American College and is contingent on adherence to a set of ethical guidelines. According to the American College, "[a]ll ChFC advisors are required to do the same for clients that they would do for themselves in similar circumstances, the standard of ethical behavior most beneficial for their clients." Since 1982, approximately 40,000 people have earned the ChFC through regionally accredited program courses and exams.
