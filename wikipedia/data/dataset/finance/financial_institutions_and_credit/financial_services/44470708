A financial network is any collection of traders, firms, banks and financial exchanges (intermediaries), with links between entities representing a direct transaction or the ability to mediate a transaction. Security holdings (e.g. stock of publicly traded companies) of firms can also be included in this network, where an edge between a stock and a firm would represent firmâ€™s ownership of the stock.
