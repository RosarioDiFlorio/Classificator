Solo was a debit card in the United Kingdom introduced as a sister to the then existing Switch. Launched on 1 July 1997 by the Switch Card Scheme, it was designed for use on deposit accounts, as well as by customers who did not qualify for a Switch card (or, later, Maestro card) on current accounts such as teenagers. The Solo card scheme was decommissioned permanently on 31 March 2011.
