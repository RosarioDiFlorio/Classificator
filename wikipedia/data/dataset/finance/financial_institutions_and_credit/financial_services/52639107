The United Precious Metals Association is a Utah-based non-profit dedicated to offering its members gold and/or silver denominated accounts. UPMA was founded shortly after the passage of the Utah Legal Tender Act in 2011. This Act explicitly recognizes the circulation of U.S minted legal tender gold and silver coins as a non-taxable event. Only Utah has legal tender laws on the books.
