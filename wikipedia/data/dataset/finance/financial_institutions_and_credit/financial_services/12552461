A Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM) is a professional certification issued by the Association of Government Accountants (AGA) in the United States. It was created in 1994 to provide a professional standard of financial expertise and ethics in government and a standard by which government financial management professionals are measured. Its education, experience and ethics requirements have served to elevate the most seasoned financial professionals. More than 14,000 individuals have received the designation.
The certification requires experience, education, and an examination. Candidates must have a minimum of two years' experience in government financial functions. Candidates must have a bachelor's degree and complete 24 credit hours of instruction. The examination consists of 3 two-hour tests which must be taken within 3 years of the instruction. A CGFM must complete Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits to maintain certification.
The curriculum of the CGFM certification applies to federal, state, and local government. Since 2001, federal agencies have been allowed to use appropriated funds to acquire certifications for their employees. As of 2007, seven states have recognized the CGFM: Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Maine, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington. Various counties have also recognized the CGFM.
