The strangely named Credit (Repossession) Act [1997] regulates repossessions in New Zealand. This Act replaced the limited repossession sections in the Hire Purchase Act [1971]  (now repealed).
The Act outlines the rights of the debtor, the steps required for repossession, the creditors right of entry, as well as steps the creditor must take once they have repossessed goods.
When the Act was passed, it gave protection to all goods subject to a hire purchase agreement, but it was amended in 1999 to limit its protection to only the purchase of consumer goods.
