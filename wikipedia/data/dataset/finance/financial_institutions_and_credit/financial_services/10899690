William P. Bengen is a retired financial adviser who first articulated the 4% withdrawal rate ("Four percent rule") as a rule of thumb for withdrawal rates from retirement savings in Bengen (1994); it is often known as the "Bengen rule" in his honor. The rule was later further popularized by the Trinity study (1998), based on the same data and similar analysis. Bengen later called this rate the SAFEMAX rate, for "the maximum 'safe' historical withdrawal rate", and revised it in Bengen (2006) to 4.5% if tax-free and 4.1% for taxable.
