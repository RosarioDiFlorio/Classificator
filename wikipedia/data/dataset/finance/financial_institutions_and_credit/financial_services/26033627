Mortgage elimination is a type of debt elimination in the United States. In this process, the promoter first convinces a mortgage holder (lender) that the debt that has been contracted is invalid or legally unenforceable, usually due to a combination of technicalities in the note, deed of trust, or other loan documentation signed; the promoters often link their rationale for debt elimination to illegality of certain lending practices, the Federal Reserve, and the monetary system of the United States in general. Through a series of illegal maneuvers involving the creation of a trust, a demand letter, and a false re-conveyance of title, the promoter and the original mortgage holder concert to create the appearance of a title free of liens and encumbrances so that another loan may be taken out on the property.
The United States FBI has put out specific warnings regarding this. 
The Dorean Group is a high-profile promoter of this type of scam.
