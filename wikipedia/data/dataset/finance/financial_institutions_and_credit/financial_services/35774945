Mortgages in English law are a method of raising capital through a loan contract, typically with a bank, where if the borrower does not repay, the bank may take a mortgaged asset, typically a home or building. Mortgages are an important part of English land law and property law. These concern, first, the common law, statutory and regulatory rules to protect the mortgagor (i.e. the borrower) at the time of concluding the mortgage agreement. Second, English law defines and restricts the process for taking possession of property in the event of default. Third, it places duties on mortgagees (i.e. lenders, like banks) on the price it achieves when selling property.
