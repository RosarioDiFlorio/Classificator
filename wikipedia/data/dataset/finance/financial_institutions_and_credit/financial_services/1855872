An eMortgage is an electronic mortgage where the loan documentation is created, executed, transferred and stored electronically.
In the United States eMortgages are made legally enforceable by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Standardization of eMortgages is being facilitated in the United States by the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO) eMortgage workgroup, which builds on the existing MISMO data standards, adding data elements and electronic signature capabilities to create an infrastructure for fully electronic mortgages. The eMortgage infrastructure is built around the concept of a SMART Document and the SMART DOC implementation guide.
