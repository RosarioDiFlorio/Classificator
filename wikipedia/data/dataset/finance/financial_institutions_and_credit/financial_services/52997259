Insureon is an online insurance agency headquartered in Chicago. Launched in 2011, Insureon built a FinTech platform that gives small-business owners access to property and casualty insurance quotes from multiple carriers and allows them to manage their policies.
Insureon has been cited as a company shaping InsurTech and a disruptor of the property and casualty market, because its digital platform allows small-business owners direct access to insurance quotes, providing an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar agencies.
In October 2015, Insureon received a $31 million private investment led by Oak HC/FT, a venture capitalist firm specializing in financial technology companies. The company was also backed by Accretive LLC as part of a Series A funding in 2010.
In 2015, Insureon placed $150 million in premium and was the third fastest growing private insurance company in the United States with a three-year growth of 1,742% and one of the fastest growing companies in Chicago.
On March 15, 2016, Insureon launched its first national television campaign during March Madness.
In 2013, UFC Fighter Ronda Rousey appeared in a promotional video for Insureon, playing the character of the Insureon Protector.
