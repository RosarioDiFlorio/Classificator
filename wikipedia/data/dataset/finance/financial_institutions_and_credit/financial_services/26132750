Financial data processors are the next layer in the service chain between users of financial data and financial data vendors. Most data is now delivered as bits and bytes and not in a physical format. Data is fed through web pages and as "raw" data files. Files are either processed by banks or by third-party companies â€“ financial data processors who provide additional added value to those companies who choose to use them.
