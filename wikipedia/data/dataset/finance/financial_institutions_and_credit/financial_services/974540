The Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) was a program established by Visa USA to ensure the security of cardholder information as it is being processed and stored by merchants and service providers.
CISP has since been superseded by the PCI Data Security Standard, a multi-vendor initiative to tackle Payment Card Industry security issues.
