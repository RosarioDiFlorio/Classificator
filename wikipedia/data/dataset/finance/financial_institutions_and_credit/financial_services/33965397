Credit card kiting refers to the use of one or more credit cards to obtain cash and purchasing power they do not have, or pay credit card balances with the proceeds of other cards. Unlike check kiting, which is illegal under nearly all circumstances, laws against credit card kiting are not completely prohibitive of the practice, thereby allowing it to be done to some degree. It is up to the banks to detect the practice and when necessary, stop it.
In order for prosecution to occur in a credit card kiting scheme, a bank must prove intent to deceive. Eq seq reference infers paying credit card minimum balances with credit card proceeds is de facto evidence of deceit.
