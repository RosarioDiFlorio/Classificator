Unbiased is a free-to-use technology platform that connects millions of consumers to financial and legal advisers, including independent financial advisers, mortgage brokers, solicitors and accountants.
It also campaigns to raise awareness of the value of independent financial advice. It was founded in 1989 by 19 financial product providers, to raise the profile of independent financial advice and promote the sale of financial products to consumers via independent financial advisers (IFAs).
Unbiased has the UK's largest selection of professional advisers, and is the most extensively used by consumers. Its search has been described by The Times as the "only database in the UK which lists truly independent financial advisers".
The platform also provides free information, tools and checklists to consumers to help them make their financial and legal decisions.
