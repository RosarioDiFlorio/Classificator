A listed investment company (LIC) is an Australian closed-end collective investment scheme similar to investment trusts in the UK and closed end funds in the United States. Instead of regularly issuing new shares or cancel shares as investors join and leave the fund, investors buy and sell to each other on ASX. They are traded as other securities on the Australian stock market.
