A market-linked CD (MLCD) is also referred to as an equity-linked CD, market-indexed CD or simply an indexed CD as well. It is a specific type of certificate of deposit that is linked to the performance of one or more securities or market indexes, like the S&P 500. Additionally, the term length is usually much longer, with periods ranging over many years rather than several months.
Not all investors are as familiar with this type of certificate of deposit as compared to conventional CDs and similar deposit accounts because market-linked CDs are not as common. New York Times writer, Leonard Sloane, explains, "only a few financial institutions have created such certificates, [though] many others are testing or considering similar products."
Market-linked CDs are also a type of "structured" investment, which means they are created in order to meet an investor's specific financial goals. They combine the long-term growth potential of equity or other markets with the security of a traditional certificate of deposit.
