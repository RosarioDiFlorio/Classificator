A Sharia Board (also Shariah Supervisory Board, Advisory Board or Religious Board) certifies Islamic financial products as being Sharia-compliant (i.e. in accordance with Islamic law). Because compliance with shariah law is the underlying reason for the existence of Islamic finance, Islamic banks (and conventional banking institutions that offer Islamic banking products and services) should establish a Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) to advise them on whether their products comply, and to ensure that their operations and activities comply with Shariah principles. There are also national sharia boards in many Muslim majority countries that regulate Islamic financial institutions nationwide.
