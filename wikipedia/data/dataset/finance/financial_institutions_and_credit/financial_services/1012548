The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Program is a professional credential offered internationally by the American-based CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research, or AIMR) to investment and financial professionals. The program covers a broad range of topics relating to investment management, financial analysis, stocks, bonds and derivatives, and provides a generalist knowledge of other areas of finance.
A candidate who successfully completes the program and meets other professional requirements is awarded the "CFA charter" and becomes a "CFA charterholder". As of June 2016, there are approximately 132,000 charterholders around the world. Successful candidates take an average of four years to earn their CFA charter. According to the CFA Institute, fewer than 20% of candidates who begin the program receive the CFA Charter.
The top employers of CFA Charterholders globally are JP Morgan, UBS, RBC, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.
