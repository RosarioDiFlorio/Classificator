The International Financial Control (Greek: Διεθνής Οικονομικός Έλεγχος) was the supervision of the public finances of Greece which was imposed by European powers, who had lent Greece in autumn of 1897, when the country bankrupted four years earlier. The goal was the payment of the country's debts to its creditors. The control was exercised by a six-person commission, the International Financial Commission (official name, in French: Commission Internationale Financière de la Grèce).
