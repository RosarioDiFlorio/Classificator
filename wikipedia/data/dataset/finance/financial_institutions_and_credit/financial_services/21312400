Offshore credit cards are credit cards issued by an offshore bank in a jurisdiction that is different from that of the cardholder. Real 'unsecured' offshore credit cards with credit lines are very difficult for the average person to obtain because banks refuse to issue them. Most banks will need possession of reliable credit histories and a means of getting their money back. If a customer is somewhere 'offshore' the risk of extending a credit line is too great and so as a result these cards are only issued to clients that have long standing relationships with the bank in question.
Since it is almost impossible to get one, if you see an 'unsecured' offshore credit card advertised online beware it is probably a scam.
