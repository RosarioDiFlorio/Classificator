Financial institutions are corporations which provide services as intermediaries of financial markets. Broadly speaking, there are three major types of financial institutions:
Depository institutions – deposit-taking institutions that accept and manage deposits and make loans, including banks, building societies, credit unions, trust companies, and mortgage loan companies;
Contractual institutions – insurance companies and pension funds
Investment institutions – investment banks, underwriters, brokerage firms.
Some experts see a trend toward homogenisation of financial institutions, meaning a tendency to invest in similar areas and have similar business strategies. A consequence of this might be fewer banks serving specific target groups, and small-scale producers may be under-served.
