Plain Green Loans is an online installment loan company providing emergency cash via the internet and is owned by the Chippewa Cree Tribe on the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. It is known for its high annualized interest rates of up to 379 percent.
Its activities are considered to be challenging "the ability of state regulators to enforce the loan market to police caps and other consumer protection measures," while raising questions in regard to tribal sovereignty.
