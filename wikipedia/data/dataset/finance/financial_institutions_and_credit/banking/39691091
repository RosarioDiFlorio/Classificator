The Bischoffsheim family is a family of German-Belgian Jewish descent known for success in banking. It can be traced back to Raphaël Nathan Bischoffsheim, an army contractor native of Tauberbischofsheim, in the Electorate of Mainz. The family was entangled particularly with the Goldschmidt family of Frankfurt am Main, leading to the conjointly managed Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt & Cie bank, which they eventually merged into Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas in 1863.
