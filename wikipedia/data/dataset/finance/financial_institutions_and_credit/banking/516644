Financial privacy refers to the maintenance of confidentiality of customer information about transactions and finances by financial institutions. The primary principle is that customers of a financial institution are entitled to a high level of privacy for their personal and transaction information. However, complete anonymity poses other community issues, such as combating criminal activity, tax evasion, money laundering, as well as national security issues in order to stop the financing of terrorism. Such community concerns can only override the principle of personal privacy by express law to that effect.
The term financial privacy is also used to describe the issue of financial institutions selling customer information to third parties for marketing purposes, especially for telemarketing purposes. However, this issue is mixed with the issue of financial institutions sharing information within themselves, which could be considered "sharing information between companies" or "affiliate sharing", since a financial institution is not allowed to be one single company for regulatory reasons but instead must assume a holding company structure.
