FASTER settlement is a New Zealand-based financial settlement system operated by the New Zealand Exchange (NZX). It is based on the principles of delivery versus payment with simultaneous irrevocable transfer of securities and cash. FASTER is not a full central securities depository (CSD), because it does not record the holdings of all the shareholders. Only holdings belonging to participants are recorded in FASTER, holdings related to individual shareholders who are not participants are delegated to a number of registries.
The alternative settlement system in New Zealand is Austraclear system operated by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
