A net settlement is the process by which banks calculate the collective total of all transactions on any given day.  Credit and debit transactions are recorded on the clearing house books throughout the business day; final settlement of the net transactions, the credits less the debits, occurs when funds due to a bank are credited to its reserve account by a Federal Reserve Bank.
