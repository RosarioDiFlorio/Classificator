Billon is a peer-to-peer payment system based on digital cash blockchain solution. As contrasted to widely known bitcoin it is not a currency and therefore technically it is a not cryptocurrency, but rather cryptocash. The uniqueness of this system lies in the fact that while it brings the huge cost advantage of infrastructure based on a distributed blockchain, it is fully legal and based on national currency. It is entirely software based solution. Other known approaches to digital cash rely on hardware tokens like Canadian MintChip backed by Royal Canadian Mint. Billon blockchain system is backed by large Polish banks: Alior Bank and PlusBank and it is based on Europe specific legal regulations: EU directive 2009/110/WE passed on 16 September 2009. Based on this regulation the exchange rate of digital cash to national currency is fixed at 1:1 ratio (in case of Billon to Polish z≈Çoty). Legally it is recognized as another form of cash and as such it is legally accepted tender, provided of course that a receiving party has appropriate software.
