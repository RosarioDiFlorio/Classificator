Target Two Point Zero is an interest rate challenge for students in the UK set by the Bank of England and The Times. Students aged 16 to 18 are asked to analyse the economic outlook and recommend what interest rate should be set. The students make a 15-minute presentation and are judged by Bank of England staff, through three rounds with an ultimate winner being selected in a national final. The Bank of England has announced that 2017 will be the last year of the competition.
