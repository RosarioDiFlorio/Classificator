In Australia, fossil fuel divestment is being led by Universities and Local Councils. In 2015, the number of Australian councils with divestment commitments increased dramatically from 2 to 17. On 15 September 2016, the status of Australian council divestment was:
Fossil free investment funds held by Australian Local Councils: $6,181,195,620
Number of Local Councils with fossil free divestment commitments: 27
Most Australian councils cannot invest in shares, meaning they have no investments directly in climate-change-contributing fossil fuel companies. However, most councils have exposure to fossil fuels via their term deposit accounts with the big Australian banks whom in turn are financing billions of dollars worth of coal and gas projects across the country. Many councils have been identifying their exposure to 'fossil' banks and have found that the majority of Australian banks (particularly banks other than the 'big four') do not provide finance for the fossil fuel industry.
Research on which banks fund the fossil fuel industry, and those that do not, has been completed and is routinely updated by Market Forces an independent research organisation. Although there have been some public commitments  indicating the Australian 'big four' banks will not invest in certain fossil fuel related projects, at 30 June 2016, the 'big four' remain heavily invested in fossil fuel.
