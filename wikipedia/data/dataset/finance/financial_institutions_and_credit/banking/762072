Wood Gundy Inc. was a leading Canadian stock brokerage and investment banking firm.
The firm, which was founded in 1905 was acquired by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in 1988 as it attempted to build an investment banking business. The Wood Gundy name was used extensively by the bank's investment banking business, which was known as CIBC Wood Gundy until 1997. Today, CIBC's investment banking business is known as CIBC World Markets and CIBC Wood Gundy is used as the brand for the bank's retail brokerage business.
