Hong Kong Inter-bank Offered Rate, (or HIBOR, Chinese: 香港銀行同業拆息), is the annualized rate charged for inter-bank lending on Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) denominated instruments, for a specified period ranging from overnight to one year. It is calculated daily at 11:00 a.m. local time based on quotations from 20 banks designated by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB).
On 24 June 2013, an additional fixing was launched for off-shore Chinese renminbi (CNH), designated as CNH HIBOR.
