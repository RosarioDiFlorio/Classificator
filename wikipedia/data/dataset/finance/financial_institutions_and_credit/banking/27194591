The Savings Deposit Insurance Fund of Turkey (Turkish: Tasarruf Mevduatı Sigorta Fonu), a.k.a. TMSF in abbreviated form, is the governing body concerned with matters of fund management and insurance in the Turkish banking system.
The body was founded in 1933 with the name Deposit Protection Act (Turkish: Mevduatı Koruma Kanunu). In 1960, the name was changed to Bankalar Tasfiye Fonu (Turkish: Bankalar Tasfiye Fonu). The current name was adopted in 1983.
