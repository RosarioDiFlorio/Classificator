Mobile Money is a mobile payments system based on accounts held by a mobile operator and accessible from subscribersâ€™ mobile phones. The conversion of cash into electronic value (and vice versa) happens at retail stores (or agents). All transactions are authorised and recorded in real-time using SMS.
In 2009, GSMA made a grant to Safaricom to support the development of a social transfer payment project via M-Pesa.
M-PESA was developed by Vodafone and first deployed by its Kenyan affiliate Safaricom. In May 2012, there were over 15 million customers of M-PESA in Kenya.
