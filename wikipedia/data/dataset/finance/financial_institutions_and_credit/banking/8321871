A system not used on any ATM; ATM SafetyPIN software is a software application that would allow users of automated teller machines (ATMs) to alert the police of a forced cash withdrawal by entering their personal identification number (PIN) in reverse order. The system was patented by Illinois lawyer Joseph Zingher (U.S. Patent 5,731,575).
SafetyPIN is not currently used in ATM systems, despite widely circulated rumors originating from a chain letter e-mail, mainly due to issues regarding reversible PINs being incompatible with the system and potential security vulnerabilities that could arise if implemented.
