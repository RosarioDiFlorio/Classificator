The Russian Bank for Foreign Trade was one of a group of banks in Saint Petersburg that played an important part in Russian international trade in the second half of the nineteenth century and up to the Russian Revolution in 1917. The bank was one of the largest in Russia prior to the revolution. The bank was nationalised by a decree of 14 December 1917 leading to a legal battle in France over its deposits in that country.
