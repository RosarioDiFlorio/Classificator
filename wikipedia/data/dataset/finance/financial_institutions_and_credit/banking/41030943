Tree credits is concept of community-based agroforestry whereby the tree planter/ caretaker is rewarded during several years for her/his climate services. The system has been developed in response to the need for a simple way to get carbon credits to the individual planter with a minimum of overheads. And to simplify implementation and monitoring of such projects by using for-profit methods, much like microfinance.
