Muamalat (also muʿāmalāt, Arabic: معاملات‎, literally "transactions" or "dealings") is a part of Islamic jurisprudence, or fiqh. Sources agree that muamalat includes Islamic "rulings governing commercial transactions" (Islamic Banking and Finance Institute of Malaysia and Majallah al-Ahkam al-Adliyyah) but other sources (Oxford Islamic Studies Online, Brian Kettell, and Wahbah al-Zuhayli’) give it a broader definition including civil acts and in general all aspects of fiqh that are not Ibadat (acts of ritual worship such as prayer or fasting). (See organizational chart of the structure of Islam below in "Principles" section.)
Mu'amalat provides much of the basis for Islamic economics, and the instruments of Islamic financing, and deals not only with Islamic legality but also social and economic repercussions and the rationale of its prohibitions (according to Monzer Kahf).
