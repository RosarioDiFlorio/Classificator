GrIDsure was a personal identification system which extends the standard ‘shared-secret’ authentication model to create a secure methodology whereby a dynamic ‘one-time’ password or PIN can be generated by a user. It was invented by Jonathan Craymer and Stephen Howes in November 2005. It has received positive media reception.
GrIDsure went into liquidation in October 2011 after investor funding dried up.
On the 18th of November 2011 Cryptocard announced it has acquired the intellectual property of GrIDsure which includes 8 patents that have been granted and a further 16 pending. Cryptocard was already a GrIDsure OEM partner and uses the product in their portfolio.
