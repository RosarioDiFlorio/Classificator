The Banking Ombudsman Scheme in New Zealand, is an independent dispute resolution scheme.
Started in 1992, it was originally a voluntary organisation of banks.
Whilst membership is still technically voluntary, since the enactment of the Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008, most members use its membership to comply with the requirement under this Act to have an Approved Dispute Resolution Scheme.
The current Banking Ombudsman is Nicola Sladden.
