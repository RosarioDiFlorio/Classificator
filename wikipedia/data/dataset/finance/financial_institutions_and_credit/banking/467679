Montana Management is a trust fund once owned by Saddam Hussein. It has a 2% holding in the Lagard√®re Group; however all its holdings are frozen.
Not coincidentally, "Montana Management, Inc." was also the name of a money-laundering front company controlled by fictional drug lord Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the 1983 film Scarface. Hussein, and his sons Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein, were allegedly big fans of the cult classic.
