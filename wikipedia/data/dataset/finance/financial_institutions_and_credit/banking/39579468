The Goldmanâ€“Sachs family is a family of German Jewish descent known for the leading investment bank Goldman Sachs. Marcus Goldman's youngest daughter, Louisa, married Samuel Sachs, the son of close friends and fellow Lower Franconia, Bavaria immigrants. Louisa's older sister and Sam's older brother had already married. His oldest son, Julius Goldman, married Sarah Adler, daughter of Samuel Adler. In 1882, Goldman invited his son-in-law Samuel to join him in the business and changed the firm's name to M. Goldman and Sachs. For almost fifty years, all the partners came from the extended family.
