Large multinational corporations want to streamline their banking practices. To do this, they need all of their bank billing electronically, and in a common format.
Corporations do not know with any degree of accuracy what is being paid to international banks for their services. Main concerns were:
No way of accurately verifying international bank fees
Analysis of bank fees is labor-intensive
No way to provide management with global bank relationship metrics
International cash management fees are decentralized with few controls in place
Compliance issues, like Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Normally billing in banking has following aspects.
It must be periodic (at pre agreed duration...)
Details of the transaction must contain ref no. of client
It also covers statutary payment details if any
Format can be customised as per the clients requirement
Mode of presentation can also be selected per clients selection (fax, mail, hard copy...)
Grouping of services done at various levels
Tracking of repayment
Reconciliation for repayment
