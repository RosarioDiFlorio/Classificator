Actinomycetoma, the bacterial form. It shouldn't be confused with actinomycosis, which is a different entity caused by Actinomyces species mostly by Actinomyces israelii.
Eumycetoma, the fungal form, caused by true fungi.
Aspergilloma, is a misnomer or false usage because it is not a subcutaneous infection, but is fungal ball in lungs.
