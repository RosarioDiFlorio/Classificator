A nonossifying fibroma (also called fibroxanthoma) is a common benign bone tumor in children and adolescents. However, it is controversial whether it represents a true neoplasm or rather a developmental disorder of growing bone. Radiographically, the tumor presents as a well marginated radiolucent lesion, with a distinct multilocular appearance. These foci consist of collagen rich connective tissue, fibroblasts, histiocytes and osteoclasts. They originate from the growth plate, and are located in adjacent parts of the metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones, most often of the legs. No treatment is needed in asymptomatic patients and spontaneous remission with replacement by bone tissue is to be expected.
Multiple nonossifying fibromas occur in Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome in combination with cafe-au-lait spots, mental retardation, hypogonadism, ocular and cardiovascular abnormalities.
