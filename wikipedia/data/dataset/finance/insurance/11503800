Hand–Schüller–Christian disease is associated with multifocal Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
It is associated with a triad of exophthalmos, lytic bone lesions (often in the skull), and diabetes insipidus (from pituitary stalk infiltration).
It is named for the US-American pediatrician Alfred Hand Jr, the Austrian neurologist and radiologist Arthur Schüller, and the US-American internist Henry Asbury Christian, who described it in 1893, 1915/16 and 1919
