Alien abduction insurance is an insurance policy issued against alien abduction. The insurance policy is redeemed if the insured person can prove they were abducted by aliens and returned to Earth. GEICO insurance (which does not sell alien insurance policies) and The Daily Telegraph report that one English company has sold over 30,000 policies. Some companies offer policies for alien pregnancy, alien examinations and death caused by aliens.
