A Gartner's duct cyst (sometimes incorrectly referred to as vaginal inclusion cyst) is a benign vaginal cystic lesion that arises from the Gartner's duct, which is a vestigial remnant of the mesonephric duct (wolffian duct) in females. They are typically small asymptomatic cysts that occur along the lateral walls of the vagina, following the course of the duct. They can present in adolescence with painful menstruation (Dysmenorrhea) or difficulty inserting a tampon. They can also enlarge to substantial proportions and be mistaken for urethral diverticulum or other structures.
There is a small association between Gartner's duct cysts and metanephric urinary anomalies, such as ectopic ureter & ipsilateral renal hypoplasia. Because of this, imaging is recommended before excision.
