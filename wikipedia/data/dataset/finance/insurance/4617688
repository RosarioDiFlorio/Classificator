The Royal Association of Belgian Actuaries is the former name of the national association for actuaries in Belgium. It was known as the ARAB/KVBA, an acronym of its names in Dutch—Koninklijke Vereniging van Belgische Actuarissen—and French—L’Association Royale des Actuaires de Belgique. The association was founded in 1895, and was an original member of the International Actuarial Association, founded that same year. In 2009, the association changed its name to IA|BE, standing for Instituut van Actuarissen in België (in Dutch), Institut des Actuaires en Belgique (in French) and Institute of Actuaries in Belgium (in English).
