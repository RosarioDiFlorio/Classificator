Chronic actinic dermatitis (also known as "Actinic reticuloid," "Chronic photosensitivity dermatitis," "Persistent light reactivity," and "Photosensitive eczema") is a condition where a subject's skin becomes inflamed due to a reaction to sunlight or artificial light. Patients often suffer from other related conditions of the skin that cause dermatitis in response to a variety of stimuli (e.g., flowers, sunscreens, cosmetics, etc.).
Diagnosis can occur at any age, ranging from soon after birth to adulthood. A GP may refer a patient to a dermatologist if the condition is not showing clear symptoms, and a variety of tests - usually completed at a hospital - can then determine the exact nature and cause of the patient's condition.
Reactions, which vary depending on the severity of the case, include rashes, flared 'bumpy' patches, affected areas being extremely hot to touch, and outbreaks shortly (or within 24 hours) after direct or indirect exposure to UVA and/or UVB light. The skin most likely reacts on the upper chest, hands and face, however it is not unlikely for reactions to happen all over the body. The patient may feel burning, stinging or throbbing sensations in these areas, which causes mild, yet uncomfortable pain.
