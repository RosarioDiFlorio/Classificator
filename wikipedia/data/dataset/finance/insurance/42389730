It is also known as "atypical lung carcinoid tumour", " atypical lung carcinoid" or "moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma".
It is a more aggressive than typical carcinoid tumors: nodal metastases in 70% vs. 5%. The 5 year survival is 49-69%.
Atypical carcinoid tumors have increased mitotic activity (2-10 per 10 HPF), nuclear pleomorphism or foci of necrosis.
