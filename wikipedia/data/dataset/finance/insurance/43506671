The Pacak-Zhuang syndrome is a recently described disease manifestation in females that includes multiple paragangliomas and somatostatinomas (in some), both neuroendocrine tumors, and secondary polycythemia associated with high erythropoietin levels. Paragangliomas in these patients are mainly localized to the abdomen whereas somatostatinomas are found in the second portion of the duodenum, as shown by imaging or biochemistry. This syndrome is of special interest as finding more than one type of neuroendocrine tumor in one individual is unusual. Such co-occurrences are usually seen in patients carrying hereditary syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.
