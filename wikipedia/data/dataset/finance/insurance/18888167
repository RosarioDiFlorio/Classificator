A lichenoid eruption is a skin disease characterized by damage and infiltration between the epidermis and dermis.
Examples include lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and lichen nitidus. It can also be associated with abrasion or drug use. It has been observed in conjunction with the use of proton pump inhibitors.
The term "lichenoid" derives from a resemblance to a lichen.
