Cerebral creatine deficiencies (CCD's) are a small group of disorders mainly concerned with creatine biosynthesis and utilization in the brain at the blood-brain interface. The most common CCD is:
creatine transporter defect (CTD), an X-linked condition caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene.
The two other forms of CCD are creatine enzymatic defects (CED's) in creatine biosynthesis, i.e. the enzyme deficiencies:
L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency, and
guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency.
