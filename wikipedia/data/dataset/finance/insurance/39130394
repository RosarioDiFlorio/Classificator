William Matthews Makeham (1826–1891) was an English actuary and mathematician.
Makeham was responsible for proposing the age-independent Makeham term in the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality that, together with the exponentially age-dependent Gompertz term, was one of the most effective theories to describe human mortality.
Makeham was responsible for two important studies on human mortality:
"On the Law of Mortality and the Construction of Annuity Tables." J. Inst. Actuaries and Assur. Mag. 8, 301–310, 1860.
"On an Application of the Theory of the Composition of Decremental Forces." J. Inst. Actuaries and Assur. Mag. 18, 317–322, 1874.
