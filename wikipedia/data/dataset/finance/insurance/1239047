Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition in which a change from lying to standing causes an abnormally large increase in heart rate. This occurs with symptoms that may include lightheadedness, trouble thinking, blurry vision, or weakness. Other commonly associated conditions include irritable bowel disease, insomnia, chronic headaches, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fibromyalgia.
The cause of POTS is poorly understood. Often it begins after a viral infection, surgery, or pregnancy. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. Diagnosis in adults is based on an increase in heart rate of more than 30 beats per minute within ten minutes of standing up which is accompanied by symptoms. Low blood pressure with standing, however, does not occur. Other conditions which can cause similar symptoms, such as prolonged bedrest, dehydration, hyperthyroidism, anemia, and certain medications, must not be present.
Treatment may include avoiding factors that bring on symptoms, increasing dietary salt and water, compression stockings, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medications. Medications used may include beta blockers, pyridostigmine, midodrine, or fludrocortisone. More than 50% of people whose condition was triggered by a viral infection get better within five years. About 90% get better with treatment. It is estimated that 0.5 to 3 million people are affected in the United States. The average age of onset is 20 years old and it occurs more often in females.
