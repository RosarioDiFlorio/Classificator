The John Darwin disappearance case was an investigation into the faked death of the British former teacher and prison officer John Darwin. Darwin turned up alive in December 2007, five years after he was believed to have died in a canoeing accident.
John Darwin was arrested and charged with fraud. His wife, Anne, was also arrested and charged for helping Darwin to collect his life insurance of £25,000. The fraudulent death also allowed the couple to pay off their £130,000 mortgage. In December 2007, after being caught photographed together in Panama a year earlier, Anne confessed to knowing Darwin was alive. Anne admitted that he had been secretly living in their house and the house next door, which allowed him to get the insurance money illegally for his own personal gain. On 23 July 2008 John and Anne Darwin were each sentenced to over six years imprisonment.
