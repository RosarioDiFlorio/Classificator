Linburgâ€“Comstock syndrome is an abnormal tendinous connection between the flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus of the index, the middle finger or both. It is an anatomical variation in human, which may be viewed as a pathology if causes symptoms. It was recognised as early as the 1800s, but was first described by Linburg and Comstock in 1979.
