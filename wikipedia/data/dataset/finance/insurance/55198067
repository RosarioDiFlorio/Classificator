Relapsing–remitting is a medical term referring to a presentation of disease symptoms that become worse over time (relapsing), followed by periods of less severe symptoms that do not completely cease (remitting). The term is sometimes applied to groupings of presentations of particular diseases that display this pattern, such as:
