Scedosporiosis is an infection caused by fungi from the genus Scedosporium which includes two hyphomycetes of emerging medical importance, Scedosporium apiospermum and Scedosporium prolificans.
Pseudallescheria boydii is the teleomorph (sexual state) distinguished from its anamorph (asexual state) S. apiospermum. During the past decades, both states have undergone several sequential name changes having been referred to as Petriellidium boydii, Allescheria boydii, Pseudallescheria sheari and Monosporium apiospermum.
Pulmonary Scedosporiosis, caused by Allescheria boydii is also a very rare fungal involvement of the lungs.
