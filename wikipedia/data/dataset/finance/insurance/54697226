Deposit bonds are a type of Surety bond â€• a financial instrument commonly used in Australia as an alternative to a cash deposit. Deposit bonds facilitate residential or commercial real property purchases. They are sometimes confused with deposit insurance, by which a bank's deposits are protected, but they are actually financial instruments that apply to real estate transactions.
A buyer can use a deposit bond in the place of cash, by giving the seller a deposit bond at the time of purchase. The buyer and seller both must agree that the buyer will pay the seller the total sum for the property purchased at a future date; ownership of the property transfers from the seller to the buyer on this date.
Deposit bonds provide the seller assurance that the buyer's deposit is insured, and that they will receive it in the case where the buyer fails to fulfill his or her obligation to the seller.
