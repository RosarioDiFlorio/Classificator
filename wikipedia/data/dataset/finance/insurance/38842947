Robin Lee Row (born 12 September 1957) is a death row inmate in Idaho, having been convicted of the murders of her husband and two children. The murders took place on February 10, 1992, when a fire broke out on the first floor of the apartment in which Row's husband, from whom she was separated, and her two children were living. When fire crews reached the scene of the burning structure, they found three bodies that were subsequently identified as her husband Randy and children Joshua, 10, and Tabitha, 8. All three had died due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
