The Esscher principle is an insurance premium principle. It is given by

  , where 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   is a strictly positive parameter. This premium is the net premium for a risk

The Esscher principle is a risk measure used in actuarial sciences that derives from the Esscher transform. This risk measure does not respect the positive homogeneity property of coherent risk measure for
