Constitutional symptoms refers to a group of symptoms that can affect many different systems of the body.
Examples include weight loss, fevers, fevers of unknown origin, hyperhidrosis, generalized hyperhidrosis, chronic pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and malaise.
Other examples include chills, night sweats, and decreased appetite.
Generally, they are very nonspecific, with a vast number of diseases and conditions as potential cause, thereby requiring further evaluation for any diagnosis.
