Hughes–Stovin syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by the combination of multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms and deep vein thrombosis. It is named after the two British physicians, John Patterson Hughes and Peter George Ingle Stovin, who first described it in 1959. It is a rare variant of Behçet's disease, which entails more general problems with the circulatory system. Most patients are young adult males between the age of 20-40. Common clinical presentations include fever, cough, dyspnea and hemoptysis. Radiological features are similar to those of Behçet's disease. There is no satisfactory treatment for this disease.
