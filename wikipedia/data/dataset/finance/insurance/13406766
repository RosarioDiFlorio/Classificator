CAMFAK syndrome (or CAMAK syndrome) is an acronym used to describe a rare inherited neurologic disease, characterized by peripheral and central demyelination of nerves, similar to that seen in Cockayne syndrome. The name "CAMFAK" comes from the first letters of the characteristic findings of the disease: cataracts, microcephaly, failure to thrive, and kyphoscoliosis. The disease may occur with or without failure to thrive and arthrogryposis.
