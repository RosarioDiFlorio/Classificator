Diseases of Abnormal Polymerization, termed DAPs for short, are a class of disorders characterized by a novel alteration in base unit proteins that results in a structure with pathogenic potential. This functional alteration in a protein in relation to its thermodynamic and kinetic properties enacts an extended chain response among neighboring proteins until an extensive and potentially harmful polymerized structure is formed. Due to this endogenous foreign formation, these diseases are often untreatable and very severe in clinical manifestation. Although DAPs are rare infections, the poor outcome in patients and the need for further understanding makes this class of diseases a pillar for future research.
