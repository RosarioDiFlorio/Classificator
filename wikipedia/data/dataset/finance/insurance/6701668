Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (also known as "anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia", and "Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome") is one of about 150 types of ectodermal dysplasia in humans. Before birth, these disorders result in the abnormal development of structures including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.
