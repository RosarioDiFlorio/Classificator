Adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome is a provisional name for a newly diagnosed immunodeficiency illness. The name is proposed in the first public study to identify the syndrome. It appears to be chronic and non-contagious, affecting mainly people of Asian descent aged around 50. Cases first started appearing in 2004, primarily in Thailand and Taiwan.
