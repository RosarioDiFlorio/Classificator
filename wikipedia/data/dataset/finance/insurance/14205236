Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), or noninfectious pneumonia are a class of diffuse lung diseases. These diseases typically affect the pulmonary interstitium, although some also have a component affecting the airways (for instance, Cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis). There are seven recognized distinct subtypes of IIP.
