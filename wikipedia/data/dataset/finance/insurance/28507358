Leiner's disease is a systemic disease, a skin disorder and extends to erythroderma, typically diagnosed in early infancy. Leiner’s disease is characterized by a long-lasting seborrhea dermatitis associated with increased likelihood to infection. Other characterizations found on newborns with Leiner’s disease are a patch or a large patch of red skin normally on the bottom and spreads to the rest of the body. This disease is also listed as a "rare disease", meaning that a small percent of the population, fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, will have this disorder.
