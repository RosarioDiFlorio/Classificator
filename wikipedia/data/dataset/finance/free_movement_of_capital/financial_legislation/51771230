The Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB) is non-profit international group of hedge funds which was established in 2007, based in London, England.
It is a standard setting organisation for the hedge fund industry and sets the voluntary standard of best practice principles and practices endorsed by its members. Known as the Hedge Fund Standards these are designed to create a “… framework of transparency, integrity and good governance” in the way the hedge fund industry operates.
The board was established in 2007 by 14 leading hedge fund managers and chaired by Sir Andrew Large to develop the standards. By 2016 it had almost 200 hedge fund managers and institutional investors as members who between them manage or invest US$ 3tn. In 2014 the board became an affiliate membership of International Organization of Securities Commissions and in 2016 established mutual observer relationship with the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds.
