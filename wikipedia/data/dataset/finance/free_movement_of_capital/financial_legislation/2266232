Cookie Jar Group is a Canadian media production and distribution company that now operates as an in-name-only unit of parent company DHX Media. The company was first established as Cinar, a Montreal-based studio that was heavily involved in children's entertainment. The company's business model, which included the licensing of its properties into educational markets, had a significant impact on its success; by 1999, Cinar held CDN$1.5 billion of the overall children's television market.
However, at the turn of the century, Cinar became the subject of multiple business scandals, including accusations that the company had plagiarized the concept of one of its series, having been accused of obfuscating the involvement of U.S. screenwriters in its productions in order to continue collecting government credits for the production of Canadian content, as well as the use of offshore accounts to transfer money out of the company. Over a decade later, the latter scandal would result in criminal charges, convictions, and fines for co-founder Ronald Weinberg, and three other suspects.
Having lost a large amount of its value, Cinar was sold in 2004 for CA$190 million to a group led by Nelvana founder Michael Hirsh, and re-named Cookie Jar Group. In 2008, Cookie Jar announced its intent to acquire the U.S. animation studio DiC Entertainment.
On August 20, 2012, DHX Media announced its intent to acquire Cookie Jar Group, in a deal that would make DHX the largest independent owner of children's television programming. The sale closed on October 22, 2012. Cookie Jar Group continues to exist as an in-name-only unit of DHX Media.
