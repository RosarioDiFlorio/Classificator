Since 2003, Lyoness has been the registered trademark name for a group of globally distributed (mostly privately owned, limited-liability) corporate structures, which originated in Austria. Lyoness comprises at least seven corporations registered in Switzerland, nine corporations registered in Austria and approximately 42 additional national and regional corporations all around the globe. The name ‘Lyoness’ was derived from the Celtic mythological kingdom ‘Lyonesse’. "Lyconet" was introduced in 2014 as a new trademark name for the same group of corporations.
The main corporation, then called ‘Lyoness Holding Europe AG’, was registered in 2003 by Iwan J. Ackermann, Max Meienberg and Uwe Proch. In 2004, the publicly known CEO of Lyoness, Hubert Freidl, was hired by this corporation as a director. Lyoness, in its entirety, has an estimated annual turnover of 1.2 billions euros (2012). The shopping community has a self-proclaimed membership of more than five million (as of July 2016). Lyoness is currently active in more than 40 countries, spread over six continents.
