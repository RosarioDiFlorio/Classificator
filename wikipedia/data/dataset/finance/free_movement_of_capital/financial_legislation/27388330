The Joint Forum (previously known as The Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates) is an international group bringing together financial regulatory representatives from banking, insurance and securities. It works under the international bodies for these sectors, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The group develops guidance, principles and identifies best practices that are of common interest to all three sectors.
It was initially set up in response to an increasing number of large financial organisations providing services in all three sectors across multiple countries. Today the Forum deals with issues that are common to all three sectors, including financial regulation of conglomerates.
