Cifas is a fraud prevention service in the United Kingdom. It's a not-for-profit membership association representing organisations from across the public, private and voluntary sectors. In 2016, Cifas had over 360 member organisations. Cifas states its mission is ‘to detect, deter and prevent fraud in society by harnessing technology and working in partnership’.
Cifas operates two core fraud prevention databases that are the largest in the UK: the National Fraud Database and the Internal Fraud Database. Its systems are also used by banks and building societies to access Home Office immigration data through a specialist portal.
Data from Cifas' members revealed that instances of identity fraud in the UK had reached record levels in 2016, particularly among people aged under 30.
