The Panama Papers case (officially titled Imran Khan Niazi v. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif) or the Panamagate case was a legal case before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, heard between 1 November 2016 and 23 February 2017. The case was brought to court by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party leader Imran Khan. It alleges money laundering, corruption, and contradictory statements by Nawaz Sharif, then-incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan in the aftermath of the Panama Papers leak, which uncovered links between Sharif's family and eight offshore companies.
The Court reserved its judgment on 23 February 2017. The case has been described as the most publicized in Pakistan's history, as well as a "defining moment" for the country. On 20 April 2017, the court announced the formation of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) to probe the Sharif family's involvement in corruption as stated in the Panama leaks.
On 28 July 2017 the Supreme Court of Pakistan disqualified Sharif from holding public office in a unanimous verdict.
