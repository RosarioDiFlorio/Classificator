Dennis B. Levine (born August 1952) was a prominent player in merger and acquisition business and the Wall Street insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. As a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert, he was at the center of the 1980s financial merger and acquisition boom. His career on Wall Street ended with his indictment for insider trading, making him one of the first of several high-profile insider trading defendants indicted and convicted by U. S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani.
