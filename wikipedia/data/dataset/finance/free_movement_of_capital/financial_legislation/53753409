On 11 April 2017, the tour bus of German football team Borussia Dortmund was attacked with roadside bombs in Dortmund, Germany. Three bombs exploded as the bus ferried the team to the Westfalenstadion for the first leg of their quarter-final against Monaco in the UEFA Champions League. One of the team's players, Marc Bartra, and a policeman were wounded, but the strengthened windows of the bus prevented further casualties.
The initial line of inquiry assumed that it was an Islamist terrorist attack due to letters found at the scene, which claimed the attack was an act of retaliation for Muslims killed in the German military intervention against Islamic State, and threatened further attacks unless Germany withdraws and the US military base in Ramstein is shut down. However, discrepancies in the evidence eventually led investigators to consider it a false flag attack. Additional claims of responsibility, supposedly from far-left and far-right groups, were also investigated.
On 21 April 2017, German police arrested a man on suspicion of planting bombs to drive down the Borussia Dortmund share price and profit by put warrants he bought prior to the attack.
