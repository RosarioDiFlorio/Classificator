Finance Watch is a European non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on financial regulation. Based in Brussels, the organization focuses on financial regulation in the European Union and its member states.
Set up in 2011 as a counterbalance to the financial lobby on the initiative of members of the European Parliament, Finance Watch states its mission is "to strengthen the voice of society in the reform of financial regulation by conducting advocacy and presenting public interest arguments to lawmakers and the public as a counterweight to the private interest lobbying of the financial industry".
