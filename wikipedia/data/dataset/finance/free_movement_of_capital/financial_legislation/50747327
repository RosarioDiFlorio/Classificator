It was originally adopted by the European Commission on February 4, 2014 and Member states had to transpose the regulations in their national law by March 2016.
The Directive introduces a European framework of conduct standards for firms selling residential mortgages.
The objective of the Directive is to create a Union-wide mortgage credit market, with a high level of consumer protection.
