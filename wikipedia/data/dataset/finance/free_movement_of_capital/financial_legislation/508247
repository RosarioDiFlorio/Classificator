The European Anti Fraud Office (commonly known as OLAF, from the French: Office europ√©en de lutte antifraude) is mandated by the European Union with protecting the financial interests of the European Union. Founded on 28 April 1999 with the European Commission Decision 1999/352, its tasks are three-fold:
to fight fraud affecting the EU budget,
investigate corruption by staff of the EU institutions and
develop anti-fraud legislation and policies.
OLAF achieves its mission by conducting, in full independence, internal and external investigations. It coordinates the activities of its anti-fraud partners in the Member States in the fight against fraud. OLAF supplies Member States with the necessary support and technical know-how to help them in their anti-fraud activities. It contributes to the design of the anti-fraud strategy of the European Union and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation.
OLAF conducts administrative investigations. It has no judicial powers to oblige national law enforcement authorities to act on its follow-up recommendations.
