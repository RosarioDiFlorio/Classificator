The Guinness share-trading fraud was a major British business scandal of the 1980s. It involved the manipulation of the stock market to inflate the price of Guinness shares to thereby assist Guinness's Â£4 billion takeover bid for the Scottish drinks company Distillers. Four businessmen were convicted of criminal offences for taking part in the manipulation. The scandal was discovered in testimony given by the US stock trader Ivan Boesky as part of a plea bargain. Ernest Saunders, Gerald Ronson, Jack Lyons and Anthony Parnes, the so-called Guinness four, were charged, paid large fines and, with the exception of Lyons, who was suffering from ill health, served prison sentences. The case was bought by the Serious Fraud Office.
