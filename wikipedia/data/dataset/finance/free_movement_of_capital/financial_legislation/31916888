Pyramid schemes in Albania were Ponzi schemes that precipitated the 1997 unrest in Albania. They started operations in 1991 with the first being formed by Hajdin Sejdia,. After starting works for the construction of an alleged hotel in central Tirana, he escaped to Switzerland with several million dollars. The area became known as Hajdin Sejdia's Hole. Later it was filled back by crews to create a local park, but since then quickly turned into an area used by the local prostitution scene. Following the events, some creditors were liquidated while others not. It is alleged that most of the sums are still held in foreign banks.
Former economic advisor of Prime Minister Fatos Nano was arrested  and imprisoned  for his opposition to these schemes.
