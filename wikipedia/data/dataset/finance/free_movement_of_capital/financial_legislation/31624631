'Lexi Holdings' plc was a United Kingdom based finance company, established in 2000 that went into Administration in 2006. At its height it was one of the largest and fastest growing independent short-term finance companies in the UK. It entered Administration after a failure to reach terms on a new facility with its Bank Barclays and its Corporate Banking Director, Dale Sellers. Sellers has since been involved in a scandal involving the withholding of information from the regulator the Financial Services Authority in respect of miss-selling banking products.
