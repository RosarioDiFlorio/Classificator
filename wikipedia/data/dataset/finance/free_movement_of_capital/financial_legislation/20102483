The Energy & Water Ombudsman NSW (EWON) is the approved dispute resolution scheme for all electricity and gas customers in New South Wales, Australia, and water customers of Sydney Water, Hunter Water, Country Water, Gosford City Council, Shoalhaven Water, State Water Corporation, Wyong Shire Council and many other localised providers.
EWON is an industry-based ombudsman scheme, which means it is funded by its members. As with other Ombudsmen in Australia and around the world, EWON's service is free for consumers.
EWON models and evaluates its service against the six industry-standard benchmarks for complaint-handling agencies:
Accessibility
Independence
Fairness
Accountability
Efficiency
Effectiveness
In line with the benchmarks, EWON's decision-making process is independent. EWON is not a consumer advocate and does not represent industry. EWON works towards a fair and reasonable outcome for the parties involved in a dispute.
EWON's website http://www.ewon.com.au provides a range of free factsheets and information for consumers.
