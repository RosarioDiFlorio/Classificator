The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes consists of OECD countries and jurisdictions that agreed to implement tax related transparency and information exchange, founded in 2000, restructured in September 2009 including non-OECD economies. It addresses tax evasion, tax havens, offshore financial centres, tax information exchange agreements, double taxation and money laundering. The forum works under the auspices of the OECD and G20. In 2000 it had published a blacklist of 35 taxhavens, but by 2009 the list had shrunk to zero. It has since focused on increasing the standard for information exchange.
