An International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.
