The Financial Guard (Romanian: Garda FinanciarÄƒ) was the control agency, subordinated to the Romanian Ministry of Economy and Finance, tasked with the enforcement of the tax laws, prevention and investigation of tax evasion and tax-related fraud. In November 2013 the Financial Guard was disbanded and replaced by the General Directorate for Fiscal Anti-Fraud, a department of the National Agency of Fiscal Administration.
