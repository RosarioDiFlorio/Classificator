Renzo Bossi (born 8 September 1988) is an Italian politician and son of Umberto Bossi, founder and former leader of the Lega Nord party. In 2010 he was elected as a member of the Regional Council of Lombardy, he resigned after two years because of his involvement in a party corruption scandal.
He is known as "il trota" (Italian for "the trout") since 2008, when Umberto Bossi was asked if he considered Renzo to be his dauphin (dauphin and dolphin are homonym in Italian) and he jokingly compared him to a trout instead.
