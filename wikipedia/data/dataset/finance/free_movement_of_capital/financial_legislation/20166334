In November 2008 Munaf Kalia (Chief Executive Officer of Khanani and Kalia International (Pvt.) Ltd.), Yusuf Kalia, and associates, were charged for illegally transferring funds from Pakistan to Afghanistan. In light of the charges, the State Bank of Pakistan revoked the license for Khanani and Kalia International to operate its foreign exchange business and forced it to shut its offices.
On March 5, 2011, the directors of Khanani and Kailia International and four bankers were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence. The judge said that the prosecution failed to present evidence that directly implicated the defendants.
