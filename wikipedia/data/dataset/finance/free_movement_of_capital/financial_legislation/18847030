The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC; Organisme Canadien de réglementation du commerce des valeurs mobilières or OCRCVM in French) is a non-profit, national self-regulatory organization (SRO). Established through the merger of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) and Market Regulation Services Inc. (RS) on June 1, 2008, IIROC oversees all investment dealers and trading activity on debt and equity markets in Canada.
The organization sets regulatory and investment industry standards and has quasi-judicial powers in that it holds enforcement hearings and has the power to suspend, fine and expel members and registered representatives, such as advisers. However, it has often been criticized by investor advocates as ineffective.
