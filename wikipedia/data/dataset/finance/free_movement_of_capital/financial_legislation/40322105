The Durbin amendment is a provision of United States federal law, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1693o-2, that requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for debit card processing. It was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation in 2010, as a last-minute addition by Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, after whom the amendment is named.
After the rule to limit fees, 12 C.F.R. ยง235, went into effect, a coalition of merchants sued the Federal Reserve. The rule was upheld when the Supreme Court denied petition for certiorari in 2014.
