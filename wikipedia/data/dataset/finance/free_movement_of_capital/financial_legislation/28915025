Adam C. Hochfelder (born 1971) is an American real estate executive who co-founded the real estate firm Max Capital in 1996, with members of the powerful Kalikow real estate family. At its peak, Max Capital had ownership or management stakes in 8,000,000 square feet (740,000 m2) of space, including the Helmsley Building and the Conde Nast Building. His portfolio was valued at as much as $2.7 billion at its peak. Some of the nation's largest institutions invested side by side with Hochfelder including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Fidelity. He bought out Peter S. Kalikow from his partnership because of a soured relationship in 2002. Hochfelder paid Kalikow $35 million, of which $18 million was Hochfelder's own money, and he borrowed  $17 million from banks to help finance the buyout of Kalikow. Some of the loans were collateralized in a manner inconsistent with reporting regulations. Hochfelder voluntarily paid back all of the money to complete the transaction. Due to NYS regulations, he was obligated to serve 14 months in a NYS program. Hochfelder is known as the "Wharton Whiz Kid" for his ability to financially structure and acquire some of NYC's largest properties which helped him generate multimillion-dollar deals as well as an impressive portfolio. Several times he out-maneuvered NYC's biggest landlords, like Donald Trump and Bernard H. Mendik, to acquire properties such as the Helmsley Building, the Associated Press Building, the Tommy Hilfiger Building and Westin Aruba Resort and Casino.
Currently, Hochfelder is the Managing Director of Real Estate Acquisitions & Development at Merchants Hospitality.
