WeRe Bank is a concept created by Alan Peter Smith, trading as "Peter of England," based on his concept of "Universal Energy Transfer" and closely linked with his "Re Movement." The Movement is described as providing an alternative to the present banking system which Smith describes as "fraudulent." Smith claims to have support "both on planet and off planet" for his project. The concept has gained publicity mainly via websites promoting alternative lifestyles, conspiracy theories and fringe theories.
The basis of WeRe Bank is the Re unit of currency, effectively a time-based currency where members can be credited with units according to the "energy" they expend. The most prominent feature of the concept is the "WeRe cheques" provided by Smith to Re Movement members. These have the appearance of a standard British bank cheque, and several websites have encouraged their readers to become WeRe members and attempt to use the "cheques" to settle debts such as mortgage arrears, loan repayments or utility bills. Because WeRe Bank is not a bank within the British Cheque and Credit Clearing Company system or even a company, and because WeRe Bank does not subscribe to the standards of the UK Payments Administration nor any of the world's clearing houses, the payees will not receive payment of the amounts on the fake cheques, meaning that the debt is unpaid, and can be increased by late payment fees, return check charges and legal costs.
Financial regulators in the UK (including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service) and in several other jurisdictions have published warnings to the public about WeRe Bank.
