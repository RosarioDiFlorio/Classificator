SOS Rasisme was a Norwegian organisation, whose stated goal was to "fight racism and nazism." It was founded in 1985, as the Norwegian sister organisation of the French SOS Racisme. It went bankrupt in 2013 after being convicted of defrauding the government and the Norwegian Children and Youth Council by reporting grossly exaggerated membership figures in order to obtain public funding. The police subsequently opened an investigation of the organisation and indicted ten of its key officials for fraud, embezzlement and money laundering.
It claimed to be Europe's largest anti-racist membership organisation, with more than 40,000 members, but the claims were found to be false by Haugaland district court. The last president before its bankruptcy was Trond Thorbjørnsen and the last executive director was Kjell Gunnar Larsen. SOS Rasisme claimed to have more than 270 local chapters all over Norway.
SOS Rasisme faced strong criticism from the media in Norway and from all mainstream political parties over several years due to its dominance by the stalinist party Serve the People – The Communist League. SOS Rasisme has described its critics, including the Norwegian Children and Youth Council, as "Nazis."
