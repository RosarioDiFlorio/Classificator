The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is a North American non-profit membership organization located in Des Plaines, Illinois. It was created by the insurance industry to address insurance-related crime and works closely with law enforcement agencies. Much of NICB's focus is on motor vehicle theft.
It has advocated for better insurance fraud statutes in the criminal codes drafted by state legislatures.
