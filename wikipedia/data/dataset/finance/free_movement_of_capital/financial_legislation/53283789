Careful Pricing (Spanish: Precios cuidados) is an Argentine Price controls program. It was established during the presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, because of the high inflation. Mauricio Macri kept it, but intends to remove it as soon as the inflation is lowered.
The current list includes fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fresh bread and meat, as well as some diet soft drinks. It was drafted by nutritionist Alberto Cormillot. This became controversial when it was revealed that some of the products benefited by the program were part of the Cormillot brand. Those products were removed, and Cormillot clarified that he had already sold his shares of the brand that bears his name and he's not commercially related to it any more.
