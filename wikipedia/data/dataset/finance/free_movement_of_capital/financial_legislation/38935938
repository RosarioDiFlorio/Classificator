The Business Anti-Corruption Portal (BACP) is a one-stop shop for business anti-corruption information offering tools on how to mitigate risks and costs of corruption when doing business abroad. All the information on the Portal is produced by GAN Integrity Solutions, a Denmark-based IT & Professional Services firm. The Portal was established in 2006 and is supported by the European Commission and a number of European governments.
The BACP is referred to by several government and non-government organisations, amongst others, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the OECD Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), and the World Bank. In addition, the BACP is the only externally cited tool for anti-corruption risk assessment in the UK Bribery Act 2010 Quick Start Guide. The BACP is listed in the UN Global Compact Anti-Corruption Tools Inventory as an effective resource to help companies address and implement the 10th principle: "Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery."
