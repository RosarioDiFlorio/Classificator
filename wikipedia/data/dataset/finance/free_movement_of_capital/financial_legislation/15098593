The Church of God, Preparing for the Kingdom of God (COG-PKG) is an apocalypticist splinter sect of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) that claims to provide "support, education and warning" to former members of the WCG. It is one of many groups that left the WCG after its sweeping doctrinal changes in the late 1980s, and forms a part of the seventh-day Sabbatarian Churches of God, following the teachings of the WCG's founder, Herbert W. Armstrong. Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, the COG-PKG is an international church which is mostly active on the Internet. It was founded in 1998 by Ronald Weinland, a former WCG minister and convicted tax evader who has made a number of public end times predictions. In November 2012, Weinland was sentenced to 42 months in prison for tax evasion; he began his prison term in February 2013, though he continued to issue sermons and prophecies to his followers.
