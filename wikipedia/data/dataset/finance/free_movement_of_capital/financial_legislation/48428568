Mow Pang Tzu (Chinese: 毛邦初; also transcribed as Mow Pang Tsu, Mow Pong Tsu, Mow Pang Chu or Mao Bangchu; March 5, 1904 –  June 22, 1987) was a high-ranking military officer in the Chinese Chiang Kai-shek government. He was the main figure in an embezzlement scandal that pitched him against the Taiwan government in the early fifties. The charges and countercharges of fraud and misappropriation of millions of dollars, ensuing legal battles, and John-le-Carré-like plots involving private detectives, Mexican prisons, night-club dancers, US Congressmen, suspicious deaths, and the US Supreme Court, were covered in over 2,000 articles published in the US, China, Australia, India, and many other countries around the world.
