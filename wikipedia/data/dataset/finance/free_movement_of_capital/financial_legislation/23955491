Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (Chinese: 香港商品交易所; abbreviated as HKMEx) was an electronic commodities exchange established in Hong Kong for the trading of commodity futures, options and other financial derivatives. The exchange was originally pitched as a platform to trade oil futures. In fact, it ended up trading mainly silver and gold futures.
The exchange provided standardised, cleared, and exchange-traded products on a transparent pricing platform to the Asia-Pacific time zone. It was created to eliminate market liquidity risks associated with Asian market participants trading in faraway commodities exchanges such as New York and London.
On 18 May 2013, the exchange ceased to trade upon surrendering its authorisation to provide automated trading services. The Hong Kong Police have made a series of arrests in connection with the exchange, and are investigating its chairman, Barry Cheung.
