The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) is a non-profit international group of sovereign wealth funds managers which was established in 2009, based in London, England.
As of 2016 it has 30 funds as members including some of the largest including China Investment Corporation, Kuwait Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. It was set up by the funds, so they could come together and create an organisation to promote best practice within their field. Its focus is “… to exchange views on issues of common interest and to facilitate an understanding of sovereign wealth funds' activities and of the Santiago Principles.”
The 24 Santiago Principles are a voluntary standard of best practice principles and practices endorsed by the IFSWF members for the management of the Sovereign Wealth Funds. Its member funds collectively have about USD 5.5 trillion under management, representing 80% of assets managed by sovereign funds globally.
When established the IFSWF formalized a limited number of partnerships with world leading financial and academic partners. The inaugural meeting of IFSWF was held in Baku on October 8–9, 2009 and it was hosted by the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijan Government. In 2016 IFSWF and Hedge Fund Standards Board establish a mutual observer relationship to share knowledge and experience with the objective to raise Standards in the financial industry.
Looking at the most recently published accounts at Companies House, IFSWF Limited made a Net profit of £176,758 GBP as of December 31, 2015. This included a nonrefundable capital transfer form the International Monetary Fund in relation to accumulated membership fees of £884,194 GBP.
