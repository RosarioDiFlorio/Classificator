The Qatar Financial Information Unit (QFIU) is a Qatari government regulatory agency responsible for financial intelligence efforts to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism. Like other national Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) around the world, it requires banks, investment companies, insurers and other financial institutions to report suspicious financial transactions. QFIU then analyzes the information and disseminates the relevant data to law enforcement authorities for further investigation and action.
Founded in 2004, QFIU is led by Ahmad bin Eid al-Thani. Its mission is to “[protect] the integrity and economy of the State of Qatar through effective exchange of information, transparency enhancement and capacity building to help detect and deter money laundering and terrorism financing activities.” The QFIU is a “semiautonomous component” of Qatar’s National Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Committee (NAMLC), and is housed in the Qatar Central Bank. Other national partners include the Qatar Financial Centre, State Security Bureau, Ministry of Interior, Criminal Investigation Department Section of Fighting Economic Crimes, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Business and Trade, Public Prosecution, General Directorate of Customs, Financial Institutions, and Ministry of Social Affairs.
