Financial Fraud Action UK (FFA UK) is the name the financial services industry uses to coordinate its fraud prevention activities.
FFA UK is sponsored by the UK Cards Association for its attempts to prevent fraud on credit and debit cards and the Fraud Control Steering Group on non-cards fraud matters. They also work with the Cheque & Credit Clearing Company (C&CCC) to eliminate credit clearing and cheque fraud.
The Fraud Control Steering Group is an unincorporated group of retail banking providers in the UK. In addition to devising and implementing policies, the association ensures a united industry approach to combating payment, cheque and lending fraud.
