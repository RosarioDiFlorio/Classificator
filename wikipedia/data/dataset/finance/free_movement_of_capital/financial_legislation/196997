The National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF) was a not-for-profit, US-based organization, run by Dr. Stephen Barrett, a retired American psychiatrist and author, that described itself as a "private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud, and quackery as public health problems." The NCAHF has been criticized by the supporters of the treatments it opposes, including practitioners of alternative medicine.
