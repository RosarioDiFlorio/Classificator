Eddy Tansil or Tan Tjoe Hong or Tan TJU Fuan (born in Makassar, South Sulawesi, February 2, 1953, age 63 years) is an Indonesian businessman of Chinese descent who escaped from the Cipinang Prison, Jakarta, on May 4, 1996, during a 20 year prison sentence for embezzling 565 million US dollars of loan money acquired from Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, a former major Indonesian bank which is now part of the Mandiri group of banks.
In 1994, Tansil was sentenced to 20 years in prison and given a fine of 30 million rupiah, ordered to pay 500 billion rupiah compensation, and pay the state losses of 1.3 trillion rupiah. Tansil's escape in 1996 was suspected to have been helped by several prison officials. An anti-corruption watchdog determined in 1999 that Tansil was conducting business under a corporate license of German beer, Becks Beer Company, in Putian, Fujian, China. In 2013, Eddy Tansil's presence in China since 2011 was confirmed, and an extradition request was submitted to the Chinese government. In 2015 Tansil was suspected to reside in Macau.
Tansil is an uncle of Rudy Kurniawan who was arrested and sentenced for wine fraud in California in 2012, and a brother of Hendra Rahardja, a banker who lent money to his own and his family's businesses which were not paid back, resulting in losses of $264 million, and who died in custody in Australia during the process of deporting him back to Indonesia for prosecution. Tansil's sister Tan Lee Chuan is married to Paulus Tumewu, the founder of the Indonesian Ramayana department store chain.
