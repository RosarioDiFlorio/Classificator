The Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) (Manx: Barrantee Oaseirys Argidoil) was the financial regulator of the Isle of Man.
The commission was established in 1983. The Chairman was previously a Member of Tynwald until 2004 when legislation forbid this.
In 2015, the FSC merged with the Insurance and Pensions Authority (IPA) to form the Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA).
