The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) was an independent advisory group on banking supervision in the European Union (EU). Established by the European Commission in 2004 by Decision 2004/5/EC, and its charter revised on 23 January 2009, it was composed of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks of the European Union. On 1 January 2011, this committee was succeeded by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which took over all existing and ongoing tasks and responsibilities of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS). The European Banking Authority was established by Regulation (EC) No. 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010.
Its role was to:
Advise the European Commission, on the latter's request, or within a time period the Commission may have set depending on the urgency of the matter, or acting on its own behalf, in particular as regards the preparation of draft measures in the scope of lending activities.
Contribute to the consistent implementation of EU directives and the convergence of financial supervisory practices in all member states of the entire European Community.
Improve supervisory cooperation, including exchange of information.
European Economic Area countries which are not EU members participated as permanent observers.
The other level-3 committees of the European Union in the Lamfalussy process are the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors.
