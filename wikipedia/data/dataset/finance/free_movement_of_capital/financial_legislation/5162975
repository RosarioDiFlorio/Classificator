The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is an association of organisations that regulate the worldâ€™s securities and futures markets.
Members are typically the Securities Commission or the main financial regulator from each country. IOSCO has members from over 100 different countries, who regulate more than 95 percent of the world's securities markets. The organisation's role is to assist its members to promote high standards of regulation and act as a forum for national regulators to co-operate with each other and other international organisations.
IOSCO is structured into a number of committees that meet several times per year at different locations around the world and it has a permanent secretariat based in Madrid.
