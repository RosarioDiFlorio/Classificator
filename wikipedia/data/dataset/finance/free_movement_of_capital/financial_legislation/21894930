Frank DiPascali, Jr. (October 28, 1956 â€“ May 7, 2015) worked for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC for 33 years and was a key lieutenant of Bernard Madoff. He referred to himself as the company's "director of options trading" and as "chief financial officer". For a number of years, he played a key part in the daily operation of the Madoff investment scandal, later recounting how he helped manipulate billions of dollars in account statements so clients would believe that they were creating wealth for them. On August 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to ten counts related to the fraud. He was denied bail before sentencing and spent two weeks in jail before being released. He died of lung cancer in 2015 while awaiting sentencing.
