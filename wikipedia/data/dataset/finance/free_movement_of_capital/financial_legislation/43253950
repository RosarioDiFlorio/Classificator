The Counter Fraud Centre is the UK’s national centre of excellence on counter fraud.
The Centre has taken on the lead for the national counter fraud and anti-corruption strategy for local government 'Fighting Fraud Locally' and will develop new tools and services for the public sector on counter fraud and anti-corruption as well as providing thought leadership and horizon scanning. With the impending closure of the Audit Commission (United Kingdom) the Centre will take responsibility for the Audit Commission’s counter fraud tools.
The Centre has taken responsibility for research, training and generating codes of practice for public sector professionals tasked with addressing the estimated £20.6 billion of public sector fraud and error in the UK. The Centre will provide services within the UK and Internationally.
The Centre is due to launch in July 2014, and is hosted by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) the professional institute for accountants working in the public services. The Centre is headed by Rachael Tiffen, former Deputy Director of the National Fraud Authority.
