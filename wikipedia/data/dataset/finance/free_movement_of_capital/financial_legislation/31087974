The ADP National Employment Report (also popularly known as the ADP Jobs Report or ADP Employment Report) is sponsored by ADP, and was originally developed and maintained by Macroeconomic Advisers, LLC. The report's methodology was revised in November 2012 by Moody's Analytics. The report is a measure of non-farm private sector employment which is obtained by utilizing an anonymous subset of roughly 400,000 U.S. businesses which are clients of ADP. During the twelve-month period, this subset averaged over U.S. business clients and over U.S. employees working in all private industrial sectors.
