The Mantria Corporation Ponzi scheme has been described as the "biggest green energy scam" in United States history. It has gone unprosecuted by the Department of Justice, though a Federal judge in the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil case found Mantria had scammed more than $54.5 million “by egregiously, recklessly, knowingly, and shamelessly perpetrating a fraudulent scheme” that used “misrepresentations, omissions, and blatant lies to induce unsuspecting and unwitting victim investors to liquidate the equity in their homes and take out bank loans to invest in Defendants’ scheme, which was nothing more than smoke and mirrors.” On November 16, 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged four people who targeted those nearing retirement age who were seeking real estate and "green" investments. Many of these securities were offered by Mantria Corporation.
The SEC said Mantria's environmental and real estate initiatives had not generated any significant profits, and returns paid to investors had been funded from other investors' contributions. They targeted those nearing retirement age to finance the "green" initiatives of Mantria Corporation, such as a “carbon negative” housing community in rural Tennessee, waste-to-energy plants, and a “biochar” charcoal substitute made from organic waste. Mantria Corporation operated using 55 different LLCs in the scheme, which made it very difficult for investigators to follow the funds.
