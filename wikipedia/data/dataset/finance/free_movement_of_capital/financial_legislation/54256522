Defeating ISIS: Who They Are, How They Fight, What They Believe is a non-fiction book about counterterrorism against ISIS. It was written by Malcolm Nance, a former cryptology analyst, with a foreword by Richard Engel. Nance's thesis in the work is that ISIS is not part of Islam, and instead functions as destructive extremist group. He emphasizes a majority of those harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and discusses their combat and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four-point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states.
Defeating ISIS made The New York Times Best Seller list at number nine for the week of July 3, 2016, in the section for "E-Book Nonfiction". U.S. President Donald Trump stated he read Defeating ISIS while he was a candidate for president in 2016.
U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations retired Colonel Millard E. Moon reviewed the book for Journal of Strategic Security, and wrote, "This book is a good reference source for anyone in the professional field and for individuals seeking to understand the enemy and what we and our allies face." Current Affairs reviewed the book and called the work, "One of the more intelligent, incisive mass-market books on ISIS". The Australian gave the work a negative review. Spencer Ackerman said Nance's books The Terrorists of Iraq and Defeating ISIS reflected the caliber of his expertise in the subject matter.
