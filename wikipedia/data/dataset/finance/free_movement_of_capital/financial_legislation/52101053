Also known as the Anubhav Teak Plantations Scam
Anubhav plantations (1992-1998) was an Indian Chennai based plantation company. It sold shares in teak plantations on guaranteed interests and later diversified to other schemes through four principal companies: Anubhav Agrotech, Anubhav Green Farms & Resorts, Anubhav Plantations, and Anubhav Royal Orchards Exports.
The company suddenly closed down in 1998, when the company could not pay its depositors any longer, leaving its thousands of investors in the lurch and unpaid. Its chairman Natesan went underground and the other directors claimed ignorance and innocence. It was subsequently revealed to have scammed its depositors by defrauding them of nearly Rs. 400 crore through Ponzi schemes. Investigations revealed that the company was a scam based on fraud as teak being an agriculture based commodity could not promise sure returns. The Anubhav case is often termed by the Indian media as "The Great Plantation Scam of the 1990s".
