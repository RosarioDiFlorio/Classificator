e-file.lu is an electronic filing and communication platform in Luxembourg for secure transmission of data, documents and regulatory reports between financial institutions and Luxembourg authorities. It is broadly equivalent to the SEC’s EDGAR system in the USA or the FSA’s GABRIEL platform in the UK.
E-file was conceived and developed by Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Finesti in cooperation with the CSSF, Luxembourg’s financial regulatory authority.
