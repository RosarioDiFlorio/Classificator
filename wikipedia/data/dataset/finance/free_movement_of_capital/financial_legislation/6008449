The Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units is an informal network of 156 financial intelligence units (FIUs). National FIUs collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspected of being money laundering or terrorism financing. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies, with their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution agencies.
The Egmont Group defines an FIU as a central, national agency responsible for receiving (and, as permitted, requesting), analyzing and disseminating to the competent authorities, disclosures of financial information:
concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism, or
required by national legislation or regulation, in order to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.
