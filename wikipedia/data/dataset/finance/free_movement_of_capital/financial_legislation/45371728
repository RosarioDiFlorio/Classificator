The Wolfsberg Group is a non-governmental association of thirteen global banks, founded in 2000 at the Ch√¢teau Wolfsberg, near Ermatingen (Switzerland). Its goal has been to develop financial industry standards for Anti-money laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) policies. Its work is similar to what the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) does on a government level. The Wolfsberg Group has criticized FATF's draft AML revision as "too prescriptive and too narrowly conceived". The Group operates in relative obscurity without press coverage.
