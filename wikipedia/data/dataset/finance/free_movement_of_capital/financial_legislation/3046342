The Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino (CBSM), (Italian "Banca Centrale della Repubblica di San Marino"), is the central bank of San Marino. The current president is Wafik Grais.
The CBSM was established through a merger between the Istituto di Credito Sammarinese – San Marino Credit Institute - (a body with public and private shareholders acting as the central bank of the Republic of San Marino) and the Ispettorato per il Credito e le Valute - Inspectorate for Credit and Currencies - (a Public Administration Office charged with supervisory and combating money-laundering activities). The Central Bank’s endowment fund is currently 12,911,425.00 Euros divided into 2,500 indivisible registered shares worth 5,164.57 Euros each. The possessory title of these shares is reserved to the State, as majority shareholder, and to San Marino undertakings engaged in credit, financial and insurance activities. Pursuant to art. 3 of its Statutes the Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino will exercise its powers for the purpose of:
promoting the stability of the financial system and protecting savings, whose substantial social value is recognised by the Republic, through supervision of the credit, financial and insurance activities in which authorised intermediaries are engaged;

providing adequate support to the financial system of the Republic, to include performing the functions of incentive and guidance;
