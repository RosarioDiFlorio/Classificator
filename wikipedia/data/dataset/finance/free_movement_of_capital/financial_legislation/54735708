Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) is an international body that sets standards and offers guidance for Islamic banking and finance regulatory and supervisory agencies. It is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and began operations in early 2003. As of April 2017, it has 183 members (including full members, associate members, or observer members). As of 2 August 2017, the IFSB Acting Secretary-General is Zahid Ur Rehman Khokher.
It was founded by "a consortium of central banks" and the Islamic Development Bank. The country of its location, Malaysia, passed a special law the year the IFSB was established -- the Islamic Financial Services Board Act 2002 -- giving the IFSB the usual "immunities and privileges" international organizations receive. In 2005 the IFSB mandate was extended to include supervisors and regulators of insurance and securities markets. A of 2013 the IFSB has issued 19 "Standards, Guiding Principles and Technical Note".
The International Islamic Financial Market is a part of IFSB that standardizes Islamic capital market products and operations, though as of 2013 its recommendations were "not implemented by most Islamic banks". It was founded in November 2001 through the cooperation of the governments and central banks of Brunei, Indonesia and Sudan. It's secretariat is located in Manama Bahrain.
According to one source (Faleel Jamaldeen) the Islamic Financial Services Board differs from the other Islamic financial standards organ, the AAOIFI, in that
the AAOIFI sets "best practices for handling the financial reporting requirements of Islamic financial institutions";
IFSB standards are "mainly concerned with the identification, management, and disclosure of risk related to Islamic financial products".
