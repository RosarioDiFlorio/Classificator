As defined by the U.S. Supreme Court, a bucket shop is "an establishment, nominally for the transaction of a stock exchange business, or business of similar character, but really for the registration of bets, or wagers, usually for small amounts, on the rise or fall of the prices of stocks, grain, oil, etc., there being no transfer or delivery of the stock or commodities nominally dealt in."
A person who engages in the practice is referred to as a bucketeer and the practice is sometimes referred to as bucketeering.
