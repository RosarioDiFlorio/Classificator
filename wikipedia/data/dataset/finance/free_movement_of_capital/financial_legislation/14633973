In Bosnia, the two political entities Republika Srpska and the Federation have each taken separate responsible for the regulation and development of capital markets within their own territories. In June 1998, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska adopted the Securities Market Law which included the establishing of the Republika Srpska Securities Commission. The commissions jurisdiction is limited to the territory governed by the Republica Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina. The equivalent Federation agency, is the "Securities Commission of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina" (Bosnian: Komisija za vrijednosne papire Federacije Bosne i Hercegovina)
