Martin Shkreli (, born March 17, 1983) is an American businessman, former hedge fund manager, and convicted felon. He is the co-founder of the hedge funds Elea Capital, MSMB Capital Management, and MSMB Healthcare; co-founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of the biotechnology firm Retrophin; and founder and former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli is also the CEO of start-up software company GÃ¶del Systems, which he founded in August 2016.
In September 2015, Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 (from US$13.5 to US$750 per pill), leading him to be referred to as "the most hated man in America" and "Pharma Bro".
In December 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after being indicted on federal charges of securities fraud. He subsequently resigned as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and was replaced by the company's board chairman, Ron Tilles. Shkreli was convicted of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiring to commit securities fraud in August 2017.
