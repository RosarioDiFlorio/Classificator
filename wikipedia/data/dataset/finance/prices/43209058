Zero-rating is the practice of providing Internet access without financial cost under certain conditions, such as by only permitting access to certain websites or by subsidizing the service with advertising. Commentators discussing zero rating often present it as a subtopic of net neutrality. While most sources report that use of zero-rating is contrary to the principle of net neutrality, there are mixed opinions among advocates for net neutrality about the extent to which people can take some benefits from zero-rating programs while not sacrificing net neutrality protections. Typical supporters for zero rating include commercial companies selling data service or advertising. Those supporters argue that zero-rating enables consumers to make choices to access more data and leads to more people using online services. Typical opposition against zero rating includes consumer protection groups and net neutrality advocates. That opposition argues that zero-rating exploits the poor, creates opportunities for censorship or restrictions on freely accessing information, and that it disrupts the free market which net neutrality protects.
