The Tampa Hillsborough County Expressway Authority (THEA) is a regional expressway authority based in Hillsborough County, Florida, which includes the city of Tampa.
The Authority owns the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway in Tampa as well as two non-tolled feeder roads - Brandon Parkway in Brandon and Meridian Avenue in Tampa. Additionally, THEA owns and operates the Selmon Greenway, a multipurpose recreational pathway running beneath and alongside the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway.
THEA was established by statute in 1963 but did not being operations until 1973. THEA was established as a way to bring roadway infrastructure projects online sooner than with conventional department of transportation funding.
THEA originally planned the neighboring Veteran's Expressway.
The state legislature has attempted to shut down THEA on numerous occasions during its history and transfer ownership to the Florida's Turnpike Enterprise. The most recent attempt occurred in March, 2011 when the legislature attempted to pass a bill that would eliminate THEA, the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority, and Mid-Bay Bridge Authority ostensibly to save the state money. The plan was later abandoned when the state's budget was written [1].
