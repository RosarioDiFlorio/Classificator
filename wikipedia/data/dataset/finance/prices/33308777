Good–deal bounds are price bounds for a financial portfolio which depends on an individual trader's preferences. Mathematically, if 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is a set of portfolios with future outcomes which are "acceptable" to the trader, then define the function 
  
    
      
        ρ
        :
        
          
            
              L
            
          
          
            p
          
        
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho :{\mathcal {L}}^{p}\to \mathbb {R} }
   by

  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        X
        )
        =
        inf
        
          {
          t
          ∈
          
            R
          
          :
          ∃
          
            V
            
              T
            
          
          ∈
          
            A
            
              T
            
          
          :
          X
          +
          t
          +
          
            V
            
              T
            
          
          ∈
          A
          }
        
        =
        inf
        
          {
          t
          ∈
          
            R
          
          :
          X
          +
          t
          ∈
          A
          −
          
            A
            
              T
            
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho (X)=\inf \left\{t\in \mathbb {R} :\exists V_{T}\in A_{T}:X+t+V_{T}\in A\right\}=\inf \left\{t\in \mathbb {R} :X+t\in A-A_{T}\right\}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{T}}
   is the set of final values for self-financing trading strategies. Then any price in the range 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        ρ
        (
        X
        )
        ,
        ρ
        (
        −
        X
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-\rho (X),\rho (-X))}
   does not provide a good deal for this trader, and this range is called the "no good-deal price bounds."
If 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        
          {
          Z
          ∈
          
            
              
                L
              
            
            
              0
            
          
          :
          Z
          ≥
          0
          
          
            P
          
          −
          a
          .
          s
          .
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\left\{Z\in {\mathcal {L}}^{0}:Z\geq 0\;\mathbb {P} -a.s.\right\}}
   then the good-deal price bounds are the no-arbitrage price bounds, and correspond to the subhedging and superhedging prices. The no-arbitrage bounds are the greatest extremes that good-deal bounds can take.
If 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        
          {
          Z
          ∈
          
            
              
                L
              
            
            
              0
            
          
          :
          
            E
          
          [
          u

          Z
          )

          ≥
          
            E
          
          [
          u
          (
          0
          )
          ]
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\left\{Z\in {\mathcal {L}}^{0}:\mathbb {E} [u(Z)]\geq \mathbb {E} [u(0)]\right\}}
   where 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is a utility function, then the good-deal price bounds correspond to the indifference price bounds.
