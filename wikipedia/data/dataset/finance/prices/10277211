Connector Motorways was an Australian toll road operator. Connector owned the Lane Cove Tunnel and the Falcon Street Gateway in northern Sydney. Both projects opened to the public in March 2007.
On 19 January 2010, Connector Motorways went into receivership when traffic through the tunnel failed to reach the projected volumes. Connector Motorways was supposed to operate the tunnel concession until 2037.
International toll road operator Transurban bought the tunnel in May 2010 for $630 million and became the new operator.
