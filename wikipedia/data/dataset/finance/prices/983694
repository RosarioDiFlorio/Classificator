The Touch 'n Go or TnG smart card is used by Malaysian toll expressway and highway operators as the sole electronic payment system (EPS). The credit card-sized smart card is made of plastic with Philips' MIFARE Classic microchip technology embedded in it.
The Touch 'n Go systems are designed to process up to 800 vehicles per hour to ease the queue congestion at toll plazas and if used together with SmartTAG (a non-stop electronic toll collection system), will be able to process up to 1,200 vehicles per hour.
