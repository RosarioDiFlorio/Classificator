The Incheon Bridge (Hangul: 인천대교; RR: Incheon-daegyo) is a reinforced concrete bridge in South Korea. At its opening in October 2009, it became the second connection between Yeongjong Island and the mainland of Incheon. The Incheon Bridge is South Korea's longest spanning cable-stayed bridge. In comparison, it is the world's seventh longest cable-stayed bridge as of October 2010. The bridge provides direct access between Songdo and Incheon International Airport, reducing travel time between them by up to one hour.
The section of the bridge crossing the sea, whose concessionaire is Incheon Bridge Corporation, is funded by the private sector. Korea Expressway Corporation and the Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) managed the project.
