Salik (In Arabic: سالك meaning "clear and moving") is the name given to the electronic toll road system in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which is based on RFID technology, automatically deducting a fee when a toll gate is passed under. The Salik toll was launched by Dubai's Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) on 1 July 2007.

Motorists are required to buy a 100 AED pre-paid card that is affixed to their windscreens. 4 AED ($1.08) is deducted from their account each time they pass through a toll gate. Initially, there were two toll gates, one near Al Garhoud Bridge, and one near Mall of the Emirates on Sheikh Zayed Road, but later in September 2008 two more gates were installed on Maktoum Bridge and at Safa. A further pair of gates was installed on Ittihad Road, the principal route from Dubai to neighbouring Sharjah and by the Dubai Airport Tunnel.
The maximum charge per day per car using the tolled roads was 24 AED ($6.48). However, as of July 1, 2013 this has been scrapped and there is no longer an upper limit that vehicles will be charged. Alternative routes include Business Bay Crossing, Floating Bridge (close to Al Maktoum Bridge; connects Al Ittihad Road (in Deira) with Al Riyadh Street (in Bur Dubai)), Al Khail Road, and Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road.
