Contribution margin-based pricing (German:Deckungsbeitrag) is a pricing strategy which works without any mention of gross margin percentages. It maximizes the profit derived from a company's assortment, based on the difference between a product's price and variable costs (the product's contribution margin per unit), and on one’s assumptions regarding the relationship between the product’s price and the number of units that can be sold at that price. The product's contribution to total firm profit (i.e., to operating income) is maximized when a price is chosen that maximizes the 'Contribution Margin Per Unit X Number of Units Sold'.
