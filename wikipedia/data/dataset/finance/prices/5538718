On April 27, 1986, American electrical engineer and business owner John R. MacDougall, using the pseudonym Captain Midnight, jammed the Home Box Office (HBO) satellite signal on Galaxy 1 during a showing of the film The Falcon and the Snowman. He broadcast a message lasting four and a half minutes, protesting HBO's rates for satellite dish owners, which he considered too expensive. MacDougall was working at his second job as an operations engineer at the Central Florida Teleport uplink station in Ocala, Florida, and fought with a technician at HBO's communications center in Hauppauge, Long Island, for control of the transmission. The technician attempted to increase uplink power but gave up because of the risk of damaging the satellite. MacDougall eventually abandoned his control of the satellite.
Although the intrusion was a minor annoyance to viewers, the Federal Communications Commission with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the jamming. MacDougall surrendered to the authorities and was served with a court subpoena after a tourist overheard him talking about the incident while on a pay phone off Interstate 75. Under an agreement with his attorney, he plea bargained and received a $5,000 fine, one year unsupervised probation, and his amateur radio license was suspended for one year. The jamming received much attention in American society, with one executive dubbing the intrusion an act of "video terrorism". As a consequence of the Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. ยง 1367), making satellite hacking a felony. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System was also developed in response to this incident.
