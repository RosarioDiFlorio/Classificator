Everyday low price (also abbreviated as EDLP) is a pricing strategy promising consumers a low price without the need to wait for sale price events or comparison shopping. EDLP saves retail stores the effort and expense needed to mark down prices in the store during sale events, and is also believed to generate shopper loyalty. It was noted in 1994 that the Walmart retail chain in the United States, which follows an EDLP strategy, would buy "feature advertisements" in newspapers on a monthly basis, while its competitors would advertise weekly. Other firms that have implemented or promoted EDLP are Procter & Gamble, Food Lion, Gordmans and Winn-Dixie.
