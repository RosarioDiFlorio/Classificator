AutoExpreso (English: AutoExpress) is an electronic toll collection system used on tollways in Puerto Rico. The system uses passive transponders (similar to SunPass Mini in Florida) where payment status is indicated by a light at the toll plazas. AutoExpreso transponders can be replenished at all Puma and select Total stations in Puerto Rico or at designated replenishment lanes (designated with a green "R") at select toll plazas.
In 2012, AutoExpreso became the exclusive form of payment on most of Puerto Rico's tollways, with cash no longer being accepted. However, until 2015, cash was still accepted on PR-5 and PR-22 due to the privatization of those tollways.
In addition to window transponders, a card form of AutoExpreso known as MovilCash is also available. MovilCash cards can be replenished at lanes designated with "R+". As of 2017, MovilCash replenishment lanes are not currently available on PR-22 and PR-5.
AutoExpreso is not interoperable with other electronic toll collection systems outside Puerto Rico (such as E-ZPass in the northeastern United States or SunPass in Florida).
