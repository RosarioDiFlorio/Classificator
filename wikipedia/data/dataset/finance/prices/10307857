Relationship-Based Pricing (RBP), also known as Relationship based Pricing is a concept in the banking industry. RBP is a pricing and billing framework where pricing is determined based on a customer's overall purchases and circumstances, rather than being delivered on a product-by-product basis. RBP enables banks to use customer-centric parameters to determine pricing, such as the level of overall business the customer does with a bank or the types of services purchased.
Financial services industry analysts like Celent and TowerGroup endorse relationship-based pricing to improve profitability. A regional US bank and subsidiary of BNP Paribas, Bank of the West, recently completed an RBP project.
