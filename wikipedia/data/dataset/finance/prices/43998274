The Addis Ababaâ€“Adama Expressway is a toll road that connects Addis Ababa to Adama. It is the first expressway in Ethiopia. The road was built between 2010 and 2014 by the China Communications Construction Company. The government opened the highway for traffic on September 14, 2014. The Government of Ethiopia covered 43 percent of the road's construction cost, while the remaining 57 percent was supplied by a loan from the Exim Bank of China. 
The highway, with six lanes on two sides for its 84.7-kilometre (52.6 mi) length, aims to abate the heavy traffic between its two endpoints. It reduces the time required to reach Adama from Addis Ababa to 45 minutes, a reduction of more than 50 percent over the time on previously available routes.
