Cost-plus pricing is a pricing strategy in which the selling price is determined by adding a specific dollar amount markup to a product's unit cost. An alternative pricing method is value-based pricing.
Cost-plus pricing is often used on government contracts (cost-plus contracts), and was criticized for reducing pressure on suppliers to control direct costs, indirect costs and fixed costs whether related to the production and sale of the product or service or not.
Cost breakdowns must be deliberately maintained. This information is necessary to generate accurate cost estimates.
Cost-plus pricing is especially common for utilities and single-buyer products that are manufactured to the buyer's specification such as military procurement.
