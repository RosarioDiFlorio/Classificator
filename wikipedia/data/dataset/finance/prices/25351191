In economics, a doorbuster deal is an offer which is handed out early into the business's opening hours. These deals are designed to attract large numbers of shoppers into the business. A typical doorbuster deal is an item or selection of items which is given a special discount price for a limited amount of time. This offer is referred to as a 'doorbuster' in reference to literal incidents in which doors were broken down by a flood of people struggling to get the goods before they sold out. Doorbuster deals are usually employed on major shopping days, such as Black Friday and Boxing Day.
