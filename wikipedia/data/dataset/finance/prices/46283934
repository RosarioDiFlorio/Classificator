A police auction is an auction of goods which have been confiscated by the police and cannot or may not be returned to their original owners. They may also contain surplus and retired police equipment, such as used police cars.
Police auctions may be found in most countries but differ in their format. In nations such as the United States, they are held by local police departments, and proceeds go to that vendor. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, they are open to the public.
