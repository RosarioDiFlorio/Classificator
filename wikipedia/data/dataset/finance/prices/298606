King's Highway 407 (pronounced "four-oh-seven") is a tolled 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. Comprising a privately leased segment as well as a publicly owned segment, the route begins in Burlington and travels through the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) suburbs of Oakville, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, Pickering and Whitby before ending in Oshawa. The segment between Burlington and Brougham in Pickering is leased to and operated by the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited and is officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route (407 ETR). It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Highway 403 in Burlington, and travels 107.9 km (67.0 mi) across the GTA to Brock Road in Pickering. East of Brock Road the freeway continues east as Highway 407 East (Highway 407E), a toll route operated by the provincial government, for 21.2 km (13.2 mi) to Harmony Road in Oshawa. Highway 407 is the first electronically operated toll highway opened in the world; there are no toll booths along the length of the route. Distances are calculated automatically using transponders or licence plates, which are scanned at entrance and exit points. Major interchanges along the route include the QEW, Highway 403, Highway 401, Highway 410, Highway 427, Highway 400, Highway 404, and Highway 412.
Highway 407 was planned in the late 1950s as a freeway bypassing the Toronto segment of Highway 401, the busiest highway in the world. However, construction did not begin until 1987. During the early 1990s, the provincial government proposed tolling the highway to alleviate a revenue shortfall. The central sections of Highway 407 opened 1997. The remaining sections were built quickly over the following four years, with the final segment of opening in mid-2001. Despite being included in the 400-series network, the Highway 407 ETR section is not considered part of the provincial highway network due to it now being privately operated. The route is operated privately under a 99-year lease agreement with the provincial government. The lease was sold in 1998 for approximately C$3.1 billion to a consortium of Canadian and Spanish investors operating under the name 407 International Inc. The privatization of the Highway 407 ETR section has been the source of significant criticism, especially regarding the increases in tolls, plate denial, and false charges. In addition, the safety of segments constructed following the sale of the freeway has been called into question. Many have come to regard Highway 407 ETR as a luxury, as opposed to the bypass of Highway 401 it was originally conceived to be.
The first phase of a provincially owned and tolled extension of the route, known solely as Highway 407 (and not as Highway 407 ETR) opened to traffic from Brock Road in Pickering to Harmony Road in Oshawa on June 20, 2016. Included as part of this extension, was the construction of a tolled north-south link between Highways 401 and 407 known as Highway 412. Construction is currently underway to extend the provincially owned portion of Highway 407 easterly to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington. This construction is set to open in two stages, with the first phase opening in 2017, and the second phase opening in 2019. This construction includes an additional link to Highway 401 east of Oshawa that will be known as Highway 418.
Even though the highway does not enter the City of Toronto proper, Toronto is used as a control city in Halton and Durham Regions due to the similar sizes of the suburban municipalities the highway passes through making selection of an obvious example among them difficult.
