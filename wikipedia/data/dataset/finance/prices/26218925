The Deh Cho Bridge is a 1.1 km (0.68 mi) long Canadian bridge across a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) span of the Mackenzie River on the Yellowknife Highway (Highway 3) near Fort Providence, Northwest Territories. Construction began in 2008 and was expected to be completed in 2010 but faced delays due to technical and financial difficulties. The bridge officially opened to traffic on November 30, 2012. The bridge replaced the prior MV Merv Hardie ferry, the ferry in operation at the time of opening, and ice bridge combination used for river crossing.
Deh Cho is the Dene name for the Mackenzie River.
