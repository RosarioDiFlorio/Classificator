MnPASS is an electronic toll collection system operated by the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
The MnPASS transponder has a minimum first time charge of US$40 per switchable tag. If you opt for the sticker tag, the cost is $25 per tag. Rush hour tolls for I-394 are usually between $1 and $4, though highly congested periods may see it go as high as $8. The price of the toll is determined by the density of the traffic. When there is more traffic, the toll is priced higher. Electronic sensors monitor the traffic density and tolls are changed every three minutes. During non-rush hours, tolls are $0.25 for the reversible lanes between I-94 and Highway 100, and free (signed simply as "OPEN") between Highway 100 and Interstate 494. During "OPEN" periods, any single passenger vehicle may use the lane regardless of whether or not they have a transponder installed.
Currently, the MnPASS is not interoperable with other transponder-based toll systems, such as E-ZPass, I-Pass, or FasTrak.
