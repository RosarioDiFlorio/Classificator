eFlow is the tolling brand name of Irish company Emovis (formerly Sanef ITS Operations Ireland, formerly BetEire Flow) which manages the collection of tolls electronically. It is best known for operating the "barrier-free" tolling system which was introduced on the M50 motorway around Dublin on 30 August 2008.
Like other eToll systems, eFlow allows cashless payment on all of Ireland's toll roads. eFlow uses overhead cameras on the M50 and detectors to read electronic tags or number plates on vehicles.
In 2007 the National Roads Authority awarded the contract to construct and operate the new tolling system for the M50 to Sanef ITS Operations Ireland, a French consortium of toll operator SANEF and tolling system designer CS. Both companies have worked on similar electronic tolling systems in Europe and North America.
eFlow tags are "interoperable", allowing motorists to use them on other eToll plazas on Ireland's road network. Electronic tags from other providers - MiniTag, Eazy Pass, eTrip, Eirtag, PassDirect and Tolltag - can also be used on the M50.
With the introduction of the electronic system, the existing barrier toll barriers began to be dismantled in September 2008, and drivers now pass through the toll point at normal driving speed. Bottlenecks at the old toll barriers often caused long tailbacks, which were often featured in the roadwatch traffic reports of AA Ireland.
