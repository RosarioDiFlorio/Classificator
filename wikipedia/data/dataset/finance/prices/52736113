Peach Pass is an electronic toll collection system in use by the U.S. state of Georgia and is expanding rapidly for congested highways around Atlanta. Peach Pass is fully interoperable with Florida's SunPass and E-PASS along with North Carolina's Quick Pass.
By 2018 most major highways leading into Atlanta will use Peach Pass. In the future the Peach Pass toll system is expected to be implemented around the perimeter of Interstate 285 (I-285) between major activity centers surrounding Atlanta. This will ease traffic congestion for suburban commuters traveling inside perimeter city limits during peak commuting times. The goal is to keep traffic moving consistently above 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) in the Peach Pass lanes and help reduce traffic times for everyone.
