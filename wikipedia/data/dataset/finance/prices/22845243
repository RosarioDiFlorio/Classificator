The Banghwa Bridge crosses the Han River in South Korea and connects the Gangseo-gu in Seoul and Goyang in Gyeonggi Province. The bridge is a part of the Incheon International Airport Expressway. At over 2.5 km in length, it is the longest bridge to cross the Han River. Though mostly a girder bridge, the middle 540m section is an arch truss, resembling the shape of an airplane taking off.
