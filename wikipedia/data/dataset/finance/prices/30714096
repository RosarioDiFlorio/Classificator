The Berbice Bridge is a pontoon bridge over the Berbice River near New Amsterdam in Guyana. The bridge is tolled and was opened on 23 December 2008.
With the completion of the Berbice Bridge, and the earlier completion of the Coppename Bridge in Suriname in 1999, the Courantyne River is the only river between the Guyanese capital of Georgetown and the Surinamese capital of Paramaribo still left without a bridge. This is due to change in the near future, with plans for a bridge on the Courantyne near South Drain becoming increasingly concrete in January 2011.
