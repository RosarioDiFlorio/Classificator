The Australian Two Airlines Policy (or Two Airlines Agreement) was a policy of Australian Federal Governments from the late 1940s to the 1990s. Under the policy, only two airlines were allowed to operate flights between state capital city and major regional city airports. For most of the period of the policy, the "two airlines" were the privately owned Ansett Airlines and the government-owned Trans Australia Airlines. Though persisting for some decades, the policy finally fell into abeyance in the world-wide airline deregulations of the 1990s.
