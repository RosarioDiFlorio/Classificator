Storage Wars: Miami (stylized as STORAGE WAR$: Miami) is an American reality television series on the A&E Network that premiered in October 6, 2015.
When rent is not paid on a storage locker for three months in Florida, the contents can be sold by an auctioneer as a single lot of items in the form of a cash-only auction. The show follows professional buyers who purchase the contents based only on a five-minute inspection of what they can see from the door when it is opened. The goal is to turn a profit on the merchandise.
