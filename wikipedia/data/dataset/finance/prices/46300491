"Remember about the Gas –  Do not buy Russian goods!" (Ukrainian: Пам'ятай про газ –  не купуй російських товарів!) is a nonviolent resistance social boycott of Russian goods in Ukraine what had arisen as reaction to political pressure of Russian Federation to Ukraine in the gas conflict of 2005–2006 years. The campaign had started in December 2005, probably with putting up flyers by unknown activists in Kirovohrad. After publicity this idea had been taken by other social and political organizations. Active actions were being continued in this campaign mainly in the gas conflict of 2005–2006 and 2008–2009 between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.
