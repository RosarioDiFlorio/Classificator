Rent regulation is a system of laws, administered by a court or a public authority, which aim to ensure the quality and affordability of housing and tenancies on the rental market for land. Comprehensive rent regulation is common in Commonwealth and European Union countries, including Canada, Germany, Ireland, Cyprus and Sweden, and also some states in the United States. Generally a system of rent regulation involves:
price controls, limits on the rent that landlord may charge, with rent control and rent stabilization
standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy (an equivalent of unfair dismissal from employment in tenancies)
obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property
a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and Ombudsman
The classic objective is to limit the price that would result from the market, where an inequality of bargaining power between landlords and tenants produces continually escalating prices without any stable market equilibrium. In 1992, a survey of 464 American economists found that 76.3% "generally agreed" that "a ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available", while 6.5% disagreed and 16.6% agreed but with provisos. However, many US states maintain rent controls, and a majority of OECD countries maintain rent-regulation laws, some changing to softer rent controls, which enjoy considerable popular support, and support in economic theory.
