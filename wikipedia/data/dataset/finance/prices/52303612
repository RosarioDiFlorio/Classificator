Tiancheng International Auctioneer Limited (also known as Tian Cheng International or Tiancheng International) is a niche auction house that specialises in the sale of Chinese art as well as jadeite. Its headquarters is in Hong Kong, with other offices in Shanghai and Beijing.
Although recently established, Tian Cheng International is considered to be a significant auction house given the increase in its market share and high-profile auctions since its inception. However, between the four auction houses of China Guardian, Christie's, Sotheby's and Tian Cheng International, the latter is considered to be the smallest of the four in terms of overall market share in Asia.
