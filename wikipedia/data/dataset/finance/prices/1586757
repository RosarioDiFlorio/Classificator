Fast Lane was the original branding for the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system used on toll roads in Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Turnpike, Sumner Tunnel, Ted Williams Tunnel, and Tobin Bridge. It was introduced in 1998, and later folded into the E-ZPass branding in 2012. Fast Lane transponders were fully interoperable with member agencies of the E-ZPass Interagency Group, however Fast Lane transponders (or the "E-ZPass MA" replacement transponders exclusive to Massachusetts) afford users discounted tolls in some junctions that out-of-state users are not offered.
In 2012 the Department of Transportation began the process of converting all existing Fast Lanes to E-ZPass lanes and will phase out the Fast Lane name. The Fast Lane website is now branded as E-ZPass MA. With the change, the toll collection system has ceased to have corporate sponsorship. Towards the end of 2016 and into 2017, the entire toll road system in the Commonwealth was converted to open-road tolling, thus the system no longer has any booths.
