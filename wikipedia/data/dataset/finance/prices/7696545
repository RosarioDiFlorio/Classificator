Dickinson's Real Deal is a UK modern antiques and collectables television programme presented by David Dickinson. It is broadcast on ITV as part of the afternoon schedule.
A US version of the show, produced by Zodiak USA and titled simply Real Deal, was aired for one series on the History channel. The format was the same except that the US show lacked the on-screen host for intervention on the deals.
