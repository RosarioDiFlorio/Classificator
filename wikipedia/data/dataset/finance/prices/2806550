SK hynix Inc. (KRX: 000660) is a South Korean memory semiconductor supplier of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and flash memory chips. Hynix is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker (after Samsung Electronics) and the world's fifth-largest semiconductor company. Founded as Hyundai Electronic Industrial Co., Ltd. in 1983 and known as Hyundai Electronics, the company has manufacturing sites in Korea, the United States, China and Taiwan. In 2012, when SK Telecom became its major shareholder, Hynix merged to SK Group (the third largest conglomerate in South Korea). The company's shares are traded on the Korea Stock Exchange, and the Global Depository shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Hynix memory is used by Apple in some of their iMac, MacBook and MacBook Pro computers. Apple's A9 chipset is onboard together with a SK Hynix RAM module believed to be "likely the same 2 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM found in the iPhone 6s". Hynix memory is also used by Asus in their Google-branded Nexus 7 tablet (both 2012 and 2013 models, respectively), an OEM provider for IBM System x servers, and is used in desktop PCs and laptops as well as the Asus Eee PC. Dell, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard) have also used Hynix memory as OEM equipment. Other products that use Hynix memory include DVD players, cellular phones, set-top boxes, personal digital assistants, networking equipment, and hard disk drives.
