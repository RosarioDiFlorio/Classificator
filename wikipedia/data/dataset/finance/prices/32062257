Watkins Ferry Toll House was an historic toll house located at Martinsburg, Berkeley County, West Virginia. It was built in 1837, and was a small rectangular stone building, measuring approximately 17 feet wide by 23 feet deep. It had a gable roof and featured Greek Revival-style architectural details. While being used as a private dwelling, it burned on February 8, 1985. The remains of the foundation were finally removed in early 2004 to make room for a housing development.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
