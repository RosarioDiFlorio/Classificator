The Goldenrod Road Extension is a 2.7 miles (4.3 km) long toll road in southeastern Orlando, Florida, United States, owned and operated by the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX). It extends from Cargo Road at the north end of the Orlando International Airport north to Hoffner Avenue (State Road 15) near the south end of State Road 551. It is a four-lane surface road with several at-grade intersections. A toll (of 50 cents for two-axle vehicles) is required to drive only the section between State Road 528 and Lee Vista Boulevard; the rest can be driven without paying. It is not assigned a state road number, as it will be given to the City of Orlando once the cost of building the road is paid off.
