GameTZ.com is an online trading community established in late 1996 which allows people to trade video games, books, music, movies, and other items through negotiating with other traders from countries worldwide. Once a trade is completed, a record is created on the site for future reference.
GameTZ.com has forums and a trading/matching system that contains a large number of tools necessary for tracking and recording online trading transactions. GameTZ.com's offer system provides users with the ability to send and receive offers, check out trade details, shipping methods, and so on. GameTZ.com also operates a simple IRC chatroom which allows users to create trades and discuss various topics.
Multi-platform gaming magazine GamePro and Forbes magazine have cited trading sites, specifically GameTZ.com, to be excellent alternatives to selling games back to retail outlets at significantly reduced value. GameTZ.com has also been featured in other magazine articles and online reviews, as well as in a short TV news segment syndicated to stations across the United States.
