The Busan–Geoje Fixed Link (or Geoga Bridge) is an 8.2 kilometers (5.1 mi) bridge-tunnel fixed link that connects the South Korean city of Busan to Geoje Island. The name of the bridge is Geoga Bridge (거가 대교). The route opened on December 13, 2010 and shortens the travelling distance between Geoje Island and Busan by about 60 kilometers (37 mi). The new road has two lanes in each direction and carries National Road 58.
The fixed link opens Geoje Island to tourist-related development and saves US$300 million in costs related to traffic delays from the longer route.
