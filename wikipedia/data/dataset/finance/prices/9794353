Negotiated cartelism (sometimes called a bilateral monopoly by economists) is a labor arrangement in which labor prices are held above the market clearing level through union leverage over employers. The phrase was coined by Peter Swenson, an economics professor at Yale university.
Labor finds this desirable because it can point to the increased wages it offers as signs of its achievement, and labor receives more money. Capitalists may find this desirable because there are "worse alternatives," i.e., strikes, workplace disruptions, etc. Furthermore, it acts as a barrier to entry against upstart firms. If all firms are required to pay higher than normal wages, it is difficult to compete on price, and an employer can take out an undercutting competitor by encouraging strikes.
In areas where the cartelists wage is higher than other local employers using the same labor pool, they have the advantage of being able to cherry pick the best workers and can often expect extra effort from their employees.
Although this arrangement would appear to be to the detriment of consumers, it doesn't actually eliminate price competition. It simply removes wages from being a factor, which in turns forces employers to seek new and more entrepreneurial methods of cost saving.
