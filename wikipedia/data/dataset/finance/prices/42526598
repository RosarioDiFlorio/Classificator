Lee Aubrey “Speed” Riggs (February 18, 1907 – February 1, 1987) was an American tobacco auctioneer in Durham, North Carolina, United States. For more than three decades Riggs appeared on the radio show Your Lucky Strike Hit Parade for the American Tobacco Company as the voice of Lucky Strike cigarettes. Riggs' career came to an end in 1969, when the United States Federal Trade Commission banned tobacco advertising over all forms of broadcast media.
Later in life, Riggs moved to California and started “Your Community Fund,” a nonprofit with the mission to teach handicapped children various labor skills. Riggs is remembered today as a public figure and star performer of the 1940s and 1950s, having gained fame as part of the last generation of mass media tobacco advertisers.
