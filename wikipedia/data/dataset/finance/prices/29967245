Best rate guaranteed, often abbreviated as BRG, is a variable-pricing, revenue management technique that hotel managers use to set different nightly rates for the same room based on expected room demand. Best available rate (BAR) pricing guarantees that guests are given the lowest available rate for each night of a multiple-night stay.
Best rate guaranteed is the most generous rate-matching program a hotel guest can get (only when communicating directly with the hotel).
There are several interpretations and executions of BRG in the hotel industry. Galileo, a Global Distribution System provider, defines best available rate as "a rate available to the general public that does not require pre-payment and does not impose cancellation or change penalties and/or fees, other than those imposed as a result of a hotel property's normal cancellation policy."
Cornell University School of Hotel Administration carried out a study surveying the reactions of 153 travelers to BRG pricing. Respondents explained that being given the best available rate for every night of their stay was more fair than paying a single blended rate for a multiple-night stay.
