Platon (Russian: Платон) is an electronic toll collection system established in Russia in November 2015. The toll is collected from trucks over 12 tons, with the proceedings going to a federal fund for road maintenance. A subsidiary of the state-owned Rostec corporation holds a 50% stake in the collection system operator, with the Putin-associated Rotenberg oligarchs owning the other half.
The objective of the system is to offset the damage caused by heavy trucks to the country's major highways. As of April 2017, road users who drive vehicles included in the scheme are required to pay a levy of 1.90 rubles ($0.03) per kilometer. Rosavtodor, the Russian federal agency for road transport, asserts that 58% of the damage to roads is caused by heavy trucks. Revenues from the system amounted to 22 billion rubles in 2016.
The implementation of the system sparked protest among truck drivers across Russia, especially in the Dagestan region. Most truckers in Russia own and operate their vehicles as independent contractors, and many fear the levy will render their business unprofitable.
