Price Intelligence (or Competitive Price Monitoring) refers to the awareness of market-level pricing intricacies and the impact on business, typically using modern data mining techniques. It is differentiated from other pricing models by the extent and accuracy of the competitive pricing analysis. The technique can be applied by companies seeking to optimize their own pricing strategy relative to their competition, or by buyers seeking to optimize their purchasing strategies.
