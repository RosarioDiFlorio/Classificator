The Malacca Strait Bridge (Indonesian: Jembatan Selat Malaka, Malaysian: Jambatan Selat Melaka or JSM and Jembatan Selmal) is a proposed bridge that would connect Telok Gong, near Masjid Tanah, Malacca state in Peninsula Malaysia, Malaysia to Rupat Island and Dumai in Sumatra island, Indonesia. The project has been submitted for government approval, and is expected to take 10 years to complete. Once completed, the 48-kilometre-long (30 mi) bridge will be the longest sea-crossing bridge in the world. The project will have two cable-stayed bridges and one suspension bridge, both the longest in the world.

The construction of a bridge of this kind would have numerous implications, including for the management of ship movements through the Malacca Straits, one of the busiest shipping channels in the world.
