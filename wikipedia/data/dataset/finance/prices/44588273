The Montgomery County Toll Road Authority (MCTRA), formerly the Montgomery County Transportation Program (MCTP), operates the State Highway 242 (SH 242) Direct Connectors to Interstate 45 (I-45), with the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) collecting tolls for MCTRA. In future, MCTRA will also operate tolled mainline portions of SH 249 (Tomball Parkway). These toll projects are located inside of Montgomery County, in the U.S. state of Texas.
