Halifax Harbour Bridges is the operating name of a Nova Scotia provincial Crown corporation legally named the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission.
The Halifax Dartmouth Bridge Commission was created in 1950 by a statute of the General Assembly of Nova Scotia and currently operates under a new statute passed in 2005 named the Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission Act. The Commission is responsible for constructing, operating, maintaining two suspension bridges that cross Halifax Harbour between the communities of Halifax and Dartmouth. The Commission also maintains authority over any other bridge or tunnel structures crossing the harbour limits, including across the Northwest Arm, although no such bridge or tunnel currently exists.
In March 2009 the Commission launched its current operating name, Halifax Harbour Bridges, as well as an updated logo. The Commission reports to the Minister of Finance and the Nova Scotia Cabinet approves the Commission's financing. The Commission has nine board members, five of whom are appointed by the Province, including the Chair and Vice-Chair; the Halifax Regional Municipality appoints four Councillors for the remaining seats on the board. The Commission's toll rates are approved by the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.[1]
