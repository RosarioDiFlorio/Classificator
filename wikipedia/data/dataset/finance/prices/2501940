The Johor–Singapore Causeway (Chinese: 新柔长堤, Malay: Tambak Johor) is a 1,056-metre causeway that links the city of Johor Bahru in Malaysia across the Straits of Johor to the town of Woodlands in Singapore. It serves as a road and rail link, as well as water piping into Singapore.
As Woodlands Checkpoint is designated as a vehicular checkpoint only, travellers are not allowed to enter the checkpoint on foot and must proceed to Woodlands Bus Interchange to use existing cross-border bus service or the nearby Woodlands Train Checkpoint for train services.
