Tiroche Auction House (Hebrew: תירוש מכירות פומביות‎) is an auction house in Israel.
Tiroche was founded in 1992 by Dov Hazan and Micky Tiroche. Today Tiroche is managed and directed by Orna and Dov Hazan. Tiroche is set apart from all other Israeli auction houses as the largest auction house in the country covering all areas of the Fine and Decorative arts (paintings, sculpture, bronze, silverware, Judaica, antique furniture, porcelain, jewelry, Asian art, African and Pre-Columbian art).
Tiroche has come a long way since it opened in 1992 from sales of up to 200 items per sale to sales that auction over 1000 items during three consecutive days, four times a year. Its showroom is in Herzliya Pituah.
Tiroche has achieved world record prices for paintings by artists such as Abel Pann, Reuven Rubin, Moshe Gershuni, Yochanan Simon, Avraham Naton, Ruth Schloss, work on paper and others.
Tiroche also holds the sole right to auction items on behalf of Israel's General Custodianship (part of the Israeli Ministry of Justice).
Among many of the high profile sales held at Tiroche in the past years were estate auctions belonging to the late Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild and the late philanthropist Gitta Sherover from Jerusalem.
