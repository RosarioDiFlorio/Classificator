Tradus was an online auction company operating in Central and Eastern Europe whose flagship Allegro was (and is) by far the most popular auction site in Poland. In March 2008, the company was acquired by the South African media group Naspers. Between 2015 and 2016 the brand Tradus vanished from NaspersÂ´ classifieds portfolio for a few months. But, it came back late in 2016, when Tradus.com was launched as a heavymachinery classifieds site by the OLX Group. The site is based in Amsterdam. Tradus.com lists ads for used, heavy machinery and vehicles in the felds of construction, transport, and farming, and also spare parts for such machines.
