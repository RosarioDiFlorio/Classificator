Cost reduction is the process used by companies to reduce their costs and increase their profits. Depending on a companyâ€™s services or product, the strategies can vary. Every decision in the product development process affects cost.
Companies typically launch a new product without focusing too much on cost. Cost becomes more important when competition increases and price becomes a differentiator in the market.
