GNSS road pricing or GNSS tolling is the charging of road users using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors inside vehicles. Advocates argue that road pricing using GNSS permits a number of policies such as tolling by distance on urban roads and can be used for many other applications in parking, insurance and vehicle emissions. Critics argue that GNSS could lead to an invasion of peopleâ€™s privacy.
