The Koshiji Bridge (越路橋, Koshiji-bashi) carries Japanese Kashiwazaki Takahama Horinouchi Line Road No. 23 in Niigata Prefecture. The bridge replaced others on this site. Possibly the most notable was a bridge originally constructed by Andrew Handyside & Co of Derby. This bridge had been designed as a bridge for the Japanese National Railway in 1896 named Shinanogawa Bridge (信濃川橋梁) and saw good service until 1952. In 1959 it was remodeled to be the Koshiji Bridge as a road bridge. This was eventually made redundant when a bypass was constructed in 1998 and in 2002 the old Handyside bridge was shortened and moved to a park to preserve it.
