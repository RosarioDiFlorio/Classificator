EMSR stands for Expected Marginal Seat Revenue and is a very popular heuristic in Revenue Management. There are two versions: EMSRa and EMSRb, both of which were introduced by Belobaba. Both methods are for n-class, static, single-resource problems. Because the models are static some assumptions apply: classes are indexed in such a way that the fare for the highest class, 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{1}}
  , is higher than the fare for the next highest class, 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{2}}
  , so 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{1}}
   > 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{2}}
   > ... > 
  
    
      
        
          r
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r_{n}}
  ; demand arrives in a strict low to high order in stages that are indexed with j as well; demand for class j is distributed with cdf 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            j
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{j}(x)}
  . For simplicity it is also assumed that demand, capacity and the distributions are continuous, although it is not very difficult to drop this assumption.
