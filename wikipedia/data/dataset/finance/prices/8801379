Video tolling (sometimes referred to as video billing) is a form of electronic toll collection, which uses video or still images of a vehicle's license plate to identify a vehicle liable to pay a road toll. The system dispenses with collection of road tolls using road-side cash or payment card methods, and may be used in conjunction with "all electronic" open road tolling, to allow drivers without an RFID device (often referred to as a "Tag") to use the toll road.
