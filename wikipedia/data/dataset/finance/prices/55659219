The Comptoir MÃ©tallurgique de Longwy (Longwy Metal Sales Counter) was a cartel of iron producers based in Longwy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France. During the late 19th century and early 20th century it had a virtual monopoly on sales of pig iron produced in the region to metallurgical firms that relied on other iron makers for supplies.
