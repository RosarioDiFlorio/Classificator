The Office of Distance Education (ODE) was founded in July 1998 on the campus of the Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts in Hot Springs, Arkansas and is now a part of the University of Arkansas System. Originally established in order to expand educational opportunities in Arkansasâ€™ rural schools, the Office of Distance Education uses H.323-based video conferencing to provide highly qualified, fully certified teachers to school districts nationwide unable to hire qualified faculty locally.
