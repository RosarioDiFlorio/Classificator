The LIDÈ Haiti Foundation is an educational initiative in rural Haiti that uses the arts and literacy to empower at-risk adolescent girls and help them transition into school or vocational training. Established by actor Rainn Wilson, author Holiday Reinhorn, and executive director Dr. Kathryn Adams in response to the devastating earthquake of 2010, LIDÈ programs now seek to uplift girls and young women who have been denied equal access to education. LIDÈ programs provide participants with life and leadership skills to help foster the community support they need to begin their educational journey. The LIDÈ Foundation believes that arts in education inspire personal empowerment, build resilience, and promote self-efficacy. LIDÈ means both “Leader” and “Idea” in Haitian Creole.
LIDÈ currently serves almost five hundred at-risk girls in rural Haiti with a Haitian National staff of 26 teachers and apprentices, plus additional coordinating, managing, and support staff. LIDÈ partners with local grassroots organizations and communities so that each program is sensitive to the needs and connected to the strengths of the community that comes to “own” that program.
