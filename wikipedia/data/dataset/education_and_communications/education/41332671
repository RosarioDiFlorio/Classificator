Trans Student Educational Resources (TSER) is a United States-based organization that seeks to promote the wellbeing of transgender youth. It was founded in 2011 by activists Eli Erlick and Alex Sennello. It is the only national organization led by transgender youth.
TSER provides resources to the public on how to support trans students, such as "safe schools" trainings for teachers, online infographics, and workshops at conferences. It is most notable for its members' work in media focused on transgender educational justice.
