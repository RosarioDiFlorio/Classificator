The Physics Aptitude Test (PAT) is a 2-hour subject-specific admissions test for applicants to the University of Oxford for undergraduate degree courses in Engineering, Materials Science and Physics undergraduate degree courses.
The PAT is held pre-interview stage at the beginning of November. Test results are not published automatically, but candidates may request their test score as part of the usual University of Oxford feedback process.
