National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) were work based awards in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that are achieved through assessment and training. In Scotland the equivalent qualifications are known as Scottish Vocational Qualification (SVQ). The regulatory framework supporting NVQs was withdrawn in 2015 and replaced by the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF), although the term "NVQ" may be used in RQF qualifications if they "are based on recognised occupational standards, work-based and/or simulated work-based assessment and where they confer occupational competence".
To achieve an NVQ, candidates had to prove that they had the ability (competence) to carry out their job to the required standard. NVQs were based on National Occupational Standards that described the "competencies" expected in any given job role. Typically, candidates worked towards an NVQ that reflected their role in a paid or voluntary position. For example, someone working in an admin office role may take an NVQ in Business and Administration.
There were five levels of NVQ ranging from Level 1, which focuses on basic work activities, to Level 5 for senior management.
