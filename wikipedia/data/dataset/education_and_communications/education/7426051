New York City HOLD (Honest Open Logical Decisions on Mathematics Education Reform) is an American national education advocacy organization, founded in January 2000 by a group of Manhattan parents and NYU mathematicians. The organization was first established in order to support parent, teacher and mathematician objections to mathematics curricula based on NCTM Standards in New York City schools. The organization has grown over the years into "a nonpartisan national advocacy organization that provides parents, educators, mathematicians and other concerned citizens information, resources and networking opportunities to support systemic improvements in the quality of mathematics education in our nation's schools". Their mission is to support K-12 mathematics programs that give (1) all students opportunity to acquire the essential knowledge and skills in school mathematics (2) all students adequate preparation for the broadest options in high school math and science courses and for opportunity to advance into mathematics based college courses and careers".
