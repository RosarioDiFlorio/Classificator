A virtual learning environment (VLE) in educational technology is a Web-based platform for the digital aspects of courses of study, usually within educational institutions. VLEs typically:
allow participants to be organized into cohorts, groups and roles
present resources, activities and interactions within a course structure
provide for the different stages of assessment
report on participation; and have some level of integration with other institutional systems.
For those who edit them, VLEs may have a de facto role as authoring and design environments. VLEs have been adopted by almost all higher education institutions in the English-speaking world.
