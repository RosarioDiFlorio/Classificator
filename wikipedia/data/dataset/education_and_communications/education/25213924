Social learning tools are those tools used for pedagogical and androgogical purposes that utilize social software and/or social media in order to facilitate learning through interactions between people and systems. The idea of setting up "social learning tools" is to make education more convenient and widespread. Therefore, people can acquire knowledge by distance learning tools, for instance, Facebook, Twitter, whatsapp and so on. Social learning tools may mediate in formal or informal learning environments to help create connections between learners, instructors and information. These connections form dynamic knowledge networks. Companies are using social learning to improve knowledge transfer within departments and across teams and use a variety of tools to create a social learning environment.
These tools are used for people who are willing to share their good ideas with someone else. The ideas can be related to either the academic studies or any other daily skills that we want to share with others. It does not simply meant by being about teaching, instead, it is more about thinking and practice of those educators who look to accompany learner, who are willing to care about the learners and exactly brings the learning into our daily life. Through creating social learning tools, practitioners will be able to combine both learning and caring by using these tools.
