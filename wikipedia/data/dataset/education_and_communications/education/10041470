In the curriculum of the Waldorf schools, much of the education in academic subjects takes place in blocks, generally of 3â€“5 weeks duration. Each pupil generally writes and illustrates a self-created textbook representing the material learned in the block. These blocks are supported by on-going classes in subjects such as music, art and crafts, and foreign languages that continue throughout the year.
