A learning store is a specialised retailer of materials expressly for the education and development of children of all ages. These materials include toys, books, games, building blocks and music, along with traditional teaching resources and curriculum materials. Some learning stores offer materials for developmentally disabled adults as well. The term learning store was coined in 1984  by the Golden Apple Learning Store. Large chains such as Early Learning Centre now exist and learning stores can now be found in many urban and suburban areas.
