The Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC) provides a centralised tertiary study application system and publishes entry requirements and course information for prospective applicants. Established in 1990, QTAC is a non profit, public company.
QTAC currently processes tertiary study applications for universities in Queensland, Tasmania and northern New South Wales, TAFE Queensland and various tertiary colleges. The institutions that participate in QTAC have complete autonomy in determining their own admission requirements. Once these are determined, QTAC's role is to ensure that the admission rules are correctly administered on behalf of these institutions.
QTAC operates a year-round application system with tertiary offers being made throughout the year for courses commencing in first, second, third and summer semesters.
