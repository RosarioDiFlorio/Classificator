The NTH Ring known by many names in Norway, NTH-ringen, first known as Høiskoleringen, also known as Ringen, Sivilingeniørringen, NTNU/NTH-ringen or Master-ringen. The ring, depicted to the right, is worn only by graduates of the former sivilingeniør or sivilarkitekt programmes, now graduates of the Master of Science in engineering or architecture programmes, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), formerly known as NTH (Norwegian Institute of Technology).
The ring was designed by architectural student Tormod Kristoffer Hustad, who had won an international competition in 1914.
