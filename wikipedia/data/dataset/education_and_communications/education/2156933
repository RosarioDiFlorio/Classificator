School refusal is the refusal to attend school due to emotional distress. School refusal differs from truancy in that children with school refusal feel anxiety or fear towards school, whereas truant children generally have no feelings of fear towards school, often feeling angry or bored with it instead. Children's Hospital Boston provides a chart showing the difference between the school refusal and truancy.
Besides calling it School Refusal, it can also be called schooliophobia, school phobia was coined by a former editor. Schooliophobia is coined as all phobias are derived from Greek. In such cases, School in Greek is σχοείο. The term school refusal was coined to reflect that children have problems attending school for a variety of different reasons and these reasons might not be the expression of a true phobia, such as separation or social anxiety.
