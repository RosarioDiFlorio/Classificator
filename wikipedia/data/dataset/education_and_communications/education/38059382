The Universities Act 1825 (Ch 97 6 Geo 4, long name An Act for the better Preservation of the Peace and good Order in the Universities of England) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which provides for officers of police constable status within Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Sections 3 and 4 have been repealed. In 2003 the University of Oxford closed its police force to avoid the complexity and costs of complying with new standards.
