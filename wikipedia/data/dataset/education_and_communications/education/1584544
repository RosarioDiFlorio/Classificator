Open educational resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. There is no universal usage of open file formats in OER.
The term OER designs publicly accessible materials and resources for any user to use, re-mix, improve and redistribute under some licenses.
The development and promotion of open educational resources is often motivated by a desire to provide an alternate or enhanced educational paradigm.
