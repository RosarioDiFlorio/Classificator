A voluntary aided school (VA school) is a state-funded school in England and Wales in which a foundation or trust (usually a religious organisation), contributes to building costs and has a substantial influence in the running of the school.
Such schools have more autonomy than voluntary controlled schools, which are entirely funded by the state. In most cases the foundation or trust owns the buildings. In some circumstances local authorities can help the governing body in buying a site, or can provide a site or building free of charge.
