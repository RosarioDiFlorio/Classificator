Wear it Purple Day is an annual LGBTQI+ awareness day especially for young people, based in Australia. Supporters wear purple to celebrate diversity and rainbow young people.
The focus is to give pride, empower and advocate equality of wellbeing or rainbow young people, and create safe spaces. Anyone can be involved regardless of whether they self-identify or are straight allies and supporters.
The Day is organised by Wear it Purple, a student run, not-for-profit organisation, providing presentations and workshops.
Businesses, councils, schools, community groups and clubs can participate by wearing purple and hosting events.
