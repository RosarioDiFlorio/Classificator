Course reserve is a term used in academic libraries to describe materials set aside for a specific academic course or other use. Most often materials are put on course reserve by library staff at the request of the course's instructor. Materials on reserve typically have shorter loan periods than other library materials to allow access to a high volume of library patrons - for example, the students taking the course in question. Reserve materials usually return to normal circulation at the end of the term.
