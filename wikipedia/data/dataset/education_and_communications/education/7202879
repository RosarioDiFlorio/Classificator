Co-coaching is a structured practice of coaching that involves peers alike with the ultimate goal to gain peer knowledge in learning how to coach or bettering their coaching techniques. This is usually done with one peer being the coach while the other peer is the coachee and vice versa during a set amount of time. This technique enables each peer to receive constructive criticism, or even praise, from one another and also create a better foundation to coaching. This practice of co-coaching is especially important in the development within management and sports, as leadership skills are a priority.
