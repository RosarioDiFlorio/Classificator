The Education Act provides for free and compulsory education in Saint Lucia from the ages of 5 to 15. In 1999, the gross primary enrollment rate was 115.1 percent. Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for St. Lucia for 2001. While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect childrenâ€™s participation in school.
