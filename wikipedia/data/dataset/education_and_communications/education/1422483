A mathlete is a person who competes in mathematics competitions at any level or any age. The term is a portmanteau of the words mathematics and athlete.
Top mathletes in the United States compete on the AIME, USAMO, and ARML. Those in other countries generally participate in national olympiads to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad.
Participants in World Math Day are commonly referred to as mathletes.
