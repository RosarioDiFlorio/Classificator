The Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (in French: Ministère de l’Éducation, de l'Enseignement supérieur, abbreviated as MEES) is the government ministry of Quebec that governs education, recreation, and sports. The minister is the individual who has the political responsibility for the regulation and oversight of educational services offered in the province of Quebec as well as for the Ministry of Education.
The Quebec government abolished the Ministry of Public Instruction in 1875 to submit to the ultramontane Roman Catholic clergy which considered education the domain of the family and the Church, not the state. Under the new provincial government of Premier Jean Lesage, in 1964 a Ministry of Education was established with Paul Gérin-Lajoie appointed the first Minister of Education since 1875. For the majority of the time since the creation of the position, the minister has been responsible for both the period including up to and including secondary education and post-secondary education.
