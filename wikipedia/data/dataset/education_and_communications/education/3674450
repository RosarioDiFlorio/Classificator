Wilderness therapy (also known as outdoor behavioral healthcare) is an adventure-based therapy treatment modality for behavior modification and interpersonal self-improvement, combining experiential education, individual and group therapy in a wilderness setting. The success of the Outward Bound outdoor education program in the 1940s inspired the approach taken by many current-day wilderness therapy programs, though some adopted a survivalist methodology. Clients typically range in age from 10–17 for adolescents, and 18–28 for adults. There are a variety of different types of wilderness therapy programs. The most common models are sustained expedition or base camp models with a typical stay of 8–12 weeks, while other single expedition-style models involve single 25–35 day trips. Their aim is to guide participants toward self-reliance and self-respect.
By exposing patients to interpersonal problems, therapy and group activities in an unfamiliar context away from home, wilderness therapy encourages the development of healthy self-esteem and social skills. Encountering familiar problems in an unfamiliar context may shed new light on existing problems. By solving the natural challenges posed by a wilderness environment, patients may build up courage to face real-world problems on their own. Additionally, physical activity alone may improve physical and mental health.
