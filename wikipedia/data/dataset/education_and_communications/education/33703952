Underground education, or clandestine education refers to various practices of teaching carried out at times and places where such educational activities were deemed illegal.
Examples of places where widespread clandestine education practices took place included education of Blacks during the Slave Period in the USA and the Secret Teaching Organization in Poland under the Nazis.
There is a Greek - mostly oral - tradition claiming that secret schools (Krifo scholio) operated during the Ottoman period. There is scant written evidence for this and many historians view it as a national myth. Others believe that the Greek secret school is a legend with a core of truth. According to certain sources, secret schools for Albanians operated in late 19th century by Albanian-speaking communities and Bektashi priests under Ottoman rule.
Secret schooling was organized in Jewish Ghettos during the Nazi regime and the German occupation in Europe.
