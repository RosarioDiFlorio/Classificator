Lecture recording refers to the process of recording and archiving the content of a lecture, conference, or seminar. It consists of hardware and software components that work in synergy to record audio and visual components of the lecture. It is widely used in universities and higher education in the UK to provide support for students. 71% of institutions replying to a UCISA survey in 2016 indicated that this technology was available in their institution. Where lecture recording is done at scale the recording system may be integrated with the timetabling system and the collection of metadata may be automated.
