St. Xavier's Institution, at Farquhar Street in George Town, Penang, Malaysia, is the oldest Catholic Lasallian school in Malaysia. While it has a history dating back to 1787, the present-day institution, named after St. Francis Xavier, was only established in 1852.
This secondary school has been an all-boys school since its establishment, although girls are now admitted for Form 6. In addition, the school is renowned for producing several notable Malaysian and Singaporean personalities, including Wong Pow Nee, Karpal Singh, Cecil Rajendra and Hon Sui Sen. Students of the school are colloquially known as 'Xaverians' or 'La Sallians'.
To this day, St. Xavier's Institution maintains its historical rivalry with Penang Free School, another premier school in George Town which holds the honour of being Malaysia's oldest school. The school has two suburban feeder primary schools at Pulau Tikus and Air Itam.
