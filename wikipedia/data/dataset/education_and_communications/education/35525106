The National Quality Framework (NQF) is part of the Australian Government’s agenda for early childhood education and child care focused on providing Australian families with high-quality, accessible and affordable integrated early childhood education and child care. The NQF aims to raise quality and drive continuous improvement and consistency in education and care services through:
a national legislative framework
a National Quality Standard
a national quality rating and assessment process
a new national body called the Australian Children’s Education & Care Quality Authority.
The National Quality Framework took effect on 1 January 2012 with key requirements being phased in over time. Requirements such as qualification, educator-to-child ratios and other key staffing arrangements will be phased in between 2012 and 2020.
