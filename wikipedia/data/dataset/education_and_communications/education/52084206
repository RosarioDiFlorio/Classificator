A flexible seating classroom is one in which traditional seating chart are replaced with seating arrangements that allow the students to seat where they choose. One of its principal objectives is to reduce the number/duration of sedentary periods of time, which research has identified as a danger to health. The Albemarle County Public School system in Virginia adopted this approach with reported success.
