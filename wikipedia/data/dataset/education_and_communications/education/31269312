A Textbook Excellence Award ("Texty") from the Text and Academic Authors Association recognizes current textbooks and learning materials based on criteria established by the group. Judges are veteran authors in appropriate subject areas. Nominations from eight subject areas are reviewed each year from titles with a current or prior year date of publication. A maximum of one award per category is granted annually. The first year this award was granted was 1992.
Subject areas awarded are:
Accounting, business and economics
Communication, education and performing and visual arts
Computer science and engineering
Humanities and social sciences
Languages and literature
Life sciences
Math and statistics
Physical sciences
Texty Awards are presented at the TAA Awards Ceremony, held during the associationâ€™s annual conference in June.
