The Passport to Teaching is an alternative teacher certification offered by the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence. The Passport to Teaching certification is a program for individuals who wish to pursue a career as a teacher but do not have a degree in education. The program works with and prepares candidates by offering online courses, exam preparation, and advisors who are current or former teachers. Candidates demonstrate their ability to enter the classroom as an effective teacher by showing proficiency on rigorous ABCTE certification examinations.
Candidates with their Passport to Teaching can receive initial licensure to teacher in states that accept the certification and subject area.
Currently this certification is accepted in 12 states: Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Oklahoma, Utah, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire.
