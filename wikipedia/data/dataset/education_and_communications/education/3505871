Student skywriting is scholarly skywriting done in a teaching/learning context. The idea is to deepen students' interaction with texts by not only having them read them and do essays on them, but also to do interactive quote/commentary on them. "Skyreadings" are posted on the course website and the students' assignment is to quote/comment them, and then also to quote/comment one another's comments. The instructor participates as well.
Professor Louis Holden at North Dakota State University has done something along these lines as part of a study in how dynamic teacher/learner relationships maybe explored through multithreaded/multidimensional interfaces (REF?].
