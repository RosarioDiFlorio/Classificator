The suicide of Tyrone Unsworth (August 16, 2003 â€“ November 22, 2016) occurred on November 22, 2016, in Brisbane, Australia. Unsworth, a 13-year-old boy, committed suicide after years of bullying motivated by his homosexuality. His death garnered considerable national attention in Australia, as well as international attention.
Unsworth's suicide was particularly controversial because it took place in the context of a number of vigorous debates in Australia about LGBTI issues, notably same-sex marriage and LGBTI-specific anti-bullying programs in schools. Throughout 2016, there had been significant controversy over one such program: the Safe Schools Coalition Australia, of which the federal government had curtailed the operation. Unsworth's death renewed criticism of that decision, and was cited as evidence that the program was needed.
There are ongoing criminal proceedings regarding some of the bullying Unsworth faced from his school peers.
