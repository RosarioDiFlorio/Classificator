Irwin Leroy Fischer ((1903-07-05)July 5, 1903-May 7, 1977(1977-05-07) (aged 73)) was the former long-standing Dean of Faculty of the American Conservatory of Music, a former chief organist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for 22 years, a prolific composer recording artist, radio performer and author. He received his MMus from American Conservatory of Music in 1930 and his BA from the University of Chicago in 1924. After being appointed to teach at the American Conservatory of Music in 1928, Fischer also studied with Boulanger in Paris in 1931 and with Kod√°ly in Budapest in 1936.
In the 1930s he invented a new polytonal technical he termed "biplanal." His compositions showed a wide variety of techniques and styles, often showing a mixture of French and German influences.
His works were received "entirely enthusiastic" critic reviews, which described him as "modernistic, but not cacophony." His compositions received less attention following World War II (causing him to turn to conducting and work as an organist, radio, and recording artist), but received renewed serious study in universities beginning in the 1980s. His works were favorable reviewed by notable critics such as the Chicago Tribune's "fearsome" Claudia Cassidy.
