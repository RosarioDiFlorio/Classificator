Aubertine Woodward Moore (sometimes misspelled "Albertine"; pen name, Auber Forestier; September 27, 1841 – 1929) was an American musician, writer, musical critic, translator, and lecturer.
She gave piano recitals and concerts in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City. Early on, she also devoted herself to literary pursuits, and translated extensively from the French and German. She was occupied in translating from the Scandinavian tongues with Rasmus B. Anderson in 1876, and for 12 years was busy preparing English versions of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's novels (Boston, 1881-82), and of Georg Brandes' Authors of the Nineteenth Century (New York. 1886). She resided in Madison, Wisconsin, since 1877, was a founder of the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, and lectured extensively, especially on Norwegian literature and music.
Moore has published most of her writings under the pen name of "Auber Forestier". They include, besides the translations that have been mentioned, English versions from the German of Robert von Bayer's (pen name, Robert Byr) Sphynx (Philadelphia, 1871); The Struggle for Existence (1873); Sophie Alberti's (pen name, Sophie Verena) Above the Tempest and the Tide (1873); "Samuel Brohl & Co.," from the French of Victor Cherbuliez (New York, 1877); Echoes from the Mist Land, or the Nibelungen-Lied Revealed (Chicago, 1880); The Spell-Bound Fiddler, from the Norse of Kristofer Janson (1881); The Norway Music Album, Norway folk-songs, dances, and so forth, edited and furnished with English text (Boston. 1881); and Voice-Culture from the German (1885).
