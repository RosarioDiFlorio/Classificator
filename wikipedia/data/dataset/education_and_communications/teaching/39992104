Mike Feerick is an Irish social entrepreneur, and CEO and founder of ALISON, an Irelandâ€“based educational technology (also called e-learning) company which has delivered 60 million online lessons with some 250,000 graduates of its 500+ courses as of January 2013. He is an Ashoka Fellow and cited as a pioneer in the modern online education industry. Paul Glader noted that Feerick is 'a key figure in the open-source learning world and a rival of sorts to Salman Khan.' ALISON has been identified by some as the first MOOC platform to be established, beginning in 2007, a year before the now popular phrase was even coined. Feerick is also the founder of Ireland Reaching Out, a "reverse" genealogy project based in Ireland that seeks to establish and reconnect the Irish diaspora with their unknown ancestral roots in rural Ireland.
