Guy Thornton McBride (1919 - 2011) was an American chemical engineer who was a professor at Rice University, president of the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and as an executive of a major American corporation. McBride earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Texas (UT) in 1940, where he was valedictorian, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 1948.
McBride worked in both industry and academia, although he said that he preferred teaching. He first taught at Rice University from 1948 to 1954. Then he worked as an executive for Texas Gulf Sulphur Company until he was appointed president of Colorado School of Mines in 1970. He retired as president in 1984, but continued to teach chemical engineering courses. He died in 2011.
McBride was a strong believer in the necessity to develop young engineers who could think and work more effectively in society with people who had diverse cultures and backgrounds. He argued that this required more exposure to subjects and experiences than were customarily presented in traditional engineering curricula. The result of his work at CSM was later named, "The Guy T. McBride Honors Program in Public Affairs for Engineers."
