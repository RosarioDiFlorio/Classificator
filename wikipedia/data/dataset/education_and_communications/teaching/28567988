Teach: Tony Danza is an American reality show about actor Tony Danza becoming a tenth-grade English teacher at Northeast High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the 2009â€“2010 school year. The show premiered October 1, 2010 on A&E. Filming took place predominantly during the first semester of the school year, with a few unaired scenes shot at the end of the second semester. Production was halted at the end of the first semester after the producers felt that existing footage was not dramatic enough, and after Danza refused to allow the producers to try to generate drama among his students. The existing footage was used to create the seven episodes that aired.
