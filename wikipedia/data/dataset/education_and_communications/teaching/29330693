Attilio Salvaneschi (1873â€“1938) was an Italian operatic tenor. He had an active international singing career from the late 1890s until his retirement in 1924. He then embarked on a second career as a voice teacher, first in Italy and later in the Netherlands. Possessing a voice of remarkable beauty, he made recordings for Blue Amberol Records, His Master's Voice, and Odeon Records.
