Blessed Benedict Daswa (16 June 1946 – 2 February 1990), born Tshimangadzo Samuel Daswa, was a South African school teacher and principal. He was given the name of "Samuel" by his parents when he started to attend school and assumed the name "Benedict" upon his conversion. A local mob murdered him when he refused to fund their anti-Catholic witchcraft superstitions. He had been viewed as a martyr after his death and his martyrdom was confirmed in 2015, paving the way for his beatification.
He was beatified in Limpopo on 13 September 2015. Cardinal Angelo Amato – on behalf of Pope Francis – presided over the beatification Mass.
