Human Science Pedagogy is the branch of the Human Sciences concerned with education, upbringing, teaching and individual growth or formation (Bildung). It is oriented to teaching and learning practice, to the relational experience of the teacher and student, to questions of ethics, history and to what it is to be human. It was the dominant approach to educational scholarship teacher education, and the philosophy of education, and in Germany from the Weimar Era to the late 1960s. Human Science Pedagogy is based on the educational work of Friedrich Schleiermacher, which was integrated by Wilhelm Dilthey into his conception of a multidisciplinary human science. It was subsequently consolidated by Herman Nohl and developed further by Otto Friedrich Bollnow, Theodore Litt, Jakob Muth and others. Human science pedagogy has endured in the work of Klaus Mollenhauer, Max van Manen and other other recent and contemporary scholars.
