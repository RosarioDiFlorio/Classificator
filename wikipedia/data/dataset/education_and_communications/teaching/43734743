Anita Moorjani (born Anita Shamdasani) (born 16 March 1959) is a New York Times best selling author of the book Dying to be Me, speaker, and intercultural consultant for multinational corporations. In 2006, after suffering cancer for almost four years, Anita's organs started shutting down and she slipped into a deep coma. She was in coma for 30 hours. She was rushed to the hospital where she claims to have crossed into the afterlife during what is often referred to as a Near Death Experience (NDE). Upon returning from her NDE, her body healed from the end-stage lymphoma within a matter of days and within months was completely cancer free.
