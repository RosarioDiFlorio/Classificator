Jean Bernabé (1942 in Le Lorrain, Martinique – 12 April 2017 in Fort-De-France, Martinique) was a writer and linguist.
Bernabé was a professor of language and culture at the Université Antilles-Guyane. He was an important figure in the créolité movement, having co-authored the seminal 1989 essay on the subject, Eloge de la créolité (In Praise of Creoleness), with Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphaël Confiant.
Although Bernabé's work lauds the Créole language, on which he has written seminal works, his literary creation is exclusively in the French language.
