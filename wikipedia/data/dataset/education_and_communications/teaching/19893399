Lawrence W. Sherman (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of evidence-based policing.
Sherman's use of randomized controlled experiments to study deterrence and crime prevention has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as domestic violence, saturation patrol, gun violence, crack houses, and reintegrative shaming. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world.
Sherman holds the posts of Wolfson Professor of Criminology Emeritus at the University of Cambridge, Chair of the Cambridge Police Executive Program and a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland's Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice in College Park. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing and Editor-in-Chief of the centre's Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing. He is also founding director of the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology.
