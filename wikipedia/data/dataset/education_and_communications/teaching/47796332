Reality pedagogy is a teaching and learning approach which is introduced by Christopher Emdin, professor in the Department of Mathematics,science and technology at Teachers College, Columbia University. This approach focuses on the understanding of students by the teacher. Here the teaching and learning is based on the reality of the student's experience. The teacher recognizes each student and from where he/she has come, it can be their culture or the community they belong to. Based on the information got by the teacher of the student, he/she uses that in the classroom as a point for instruction.
This approach also points out the need to create a space or environment where reality is brought into the classroom. The students should be able to relate to what the teacher teaches in class. The student's reality is the determinant of his/her behavior in the classroom. Therefore, the teacher needs to know the students,in order to have effective teaching and learning experience. Reality Pedagogy also brings to light critical thinking, where the role of the teacher is to create situations and engage students in critical thinking. This also allows them to express their views and voice out their opinion or ideas.
