(ECDL), also known as International Computer Driving Licence (ICDL) in non-European countries, is a computer literacy certification programme provided by ECDL Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation.

ECDL / ICDL certification is a globally recognised information and communication technology (ICT) and digital literacy qualification. Other than the name, there is no difference between ECDL and ICDL and they are recognised as equivalent. According to ECDL Foundation, over 14 million people in over 100 countries had registered as candidates for ECDL.
In 1995, the ECDL certification programme was developed through a task force of the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) and was recommended by the European Commission High Level Group, ESDIS, to be a Europe-wide certification scheme. The task force compared several national certification schemes and chose the CDL from Finland as the basis for piloting and later adoption into the ECDL.
In the UK, it is used by the National Health Service as the benchmark IT qualification and as such it is available without charge to all staff.
