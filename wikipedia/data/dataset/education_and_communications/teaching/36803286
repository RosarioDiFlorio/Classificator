Wilhelmina Weber Furlong (1878â€“1962) was a German American artist and teacher.
Among America's earliest avant-garde elite modernist painters, Weber Furlong was a major American artist who pioneered modern impressionistic and modern expressionistic still life painting at the turn of the twentieth century's American modernist movement.
She has been called the first female modernist painter in the early American Modernism scene, and she represents the struggles of many women artists in the late 1800s and early 1900s as they became subjugated to the many realists who opposed the American modernist movement and serious women artists.
