Herbert F. Standing was a paleontologist, medical missionary in Madagascar, author of the book The Children of Madagascar (1887). He was also the Headmaster of the Boys' High School of the Friends' Foreign Mission Association in Antananarivo.
Standing is responsible for describing four species of subfossil lemur, including Archaeoindris fontoynontii (1909), Mesopropithecus pithecoides (1905), Palaeopropithecus maximus (1903), Megaladapis grandidieri (1903), and other subfossil taxa that have since become taxonomic synonyms. Standing's day gecko (Phelsuma standingi) is named after him.
