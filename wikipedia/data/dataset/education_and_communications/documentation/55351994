Eximiae devotionis declared on 3 May 1493 is one of three papal bulls of Pope Alexander VI delivered purporting to grant overseas territories to kings of Castile and León. The document in addition to Inter caetera delivered on 4 May 1493 and Dudum siquidem delivered on 26 September 1493 make up what is known as the Bulls of Donation.
Eximiae devotionis recognized the claims of the kings of Castile and León and their successors to any discovered lands not already held by a Christian prince, and protected their previous rights in the regions of Africa, and Guinea.
