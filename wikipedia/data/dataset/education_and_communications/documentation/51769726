Pastorale officium was a Apostolic Brief issued by Pope Paul III, May 29, 1537, to Cardinal Juan Pardo de Tavera which declares that anyone who enslaved or despoled indigenous Americans would be automatically excommunicated. It was subsequently annulled the following year in "Non Indecens Videtur" after complaints by Charles V arguing tha it was injurious to the Imperial right of colonization and harmful to the peace of the Indies. The weakened position of the pope and the memory of the Sack of Rome (1527) a decade earlier by imperial troops, made the ecclesiastical authorities hesitant in engaging in any possible confrontation with the Emperor.
The Pastorale officium has been seen as a companion document for the papal bull Sublimis Deus.
