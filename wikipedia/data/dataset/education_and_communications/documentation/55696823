The Golden Letter is a manuscript written on rolled gold in the Burmese language, which was sent on 7 May 1756 by King Alaungpaya of Burma to the King George II of Great Britain in London. It is now preserved at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library in Hanover. In October 2015, the Golden Letter was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, as a common heritage of Myanmar, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
