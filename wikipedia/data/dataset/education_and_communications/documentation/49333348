Deolinda Rodríguez de Almeida (   ) (also, Deolinda Rodrigues Francisco de Almeida; pseudonym, Langidila; nickname, "Mother of the Revolution"; 10 February 1939 – 1968) was an Angolan nationalist, heroine, militant, writer, and translator, who also taught, wrote poetry, and worked as a radio host. Born into a Methodist family, she received a scholarship to study in Brazil, from where she corresponded with Martin Luther King, Jr. Fearing extradition, she continued her education in the United States before returning to Angola. Rodríguez was a member of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and co-founded its women's wing, the Organização da Mulher de Angola (Organization of Angolan Women; OMA). Due to her support of the growing Angolan Independence movement, she was captured, tortured, and executed. A documentary of her life was released in 2014.
