More Letters of Charles Darwin, a sequel to The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin of 1887, was a book in two volumes, published in 1903, edited by Francis Darwin and A. C. Seward, containing as the title implies, additional publications of 782 letters from the correspondence of Charles Darwin.
The Times noted that "the two volumes of More Letters of Charles Darwin form a fitting supplement to The Life and Letters", which it had in turn described as "one of the best biographies ever written". In the Darwin letters trilogy it was followed by Emma Darwin: A Century of Family Letters (1905/1915)
R. B. Freeman noted that it "contains almost entirely new matter although some extracts and a few whole letters are also found in Life and letters. It also contains a brief autobiographical piece (pp. 1-5) which is sometimes found in modern editions and translations of his main autobiography."
The book is dedicated "with affection and respect, to Joseph Hooker in remembrance of his lifelong friendship with Charles Darwin".
It contains a timeline of Darwin's life.
The Darwin Correspondence Project has further letters available, many published online.
