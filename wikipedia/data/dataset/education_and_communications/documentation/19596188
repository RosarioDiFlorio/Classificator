Vince malum bono or Vince in bono malum is a Latin phrase meaning Overcome evil with good or Defeat Evil with Good.
The motto comes from partial quotation from the Bible, Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans, 12:21: "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" (noli vinci a malo sed vince in bono malum; Greek: Μὴ νικῶ ὑπὸ τοῦ κακοῦ, ἀλλὰ νίκα ἐν τῷ ἀγαθῷ τὸ κακόν, Mē nikō hypo tou kakou, alla nika en tō agathō to kakon).
The phrase is used as a motto at a number of institutions:
Anahuac Universities Network
Bishop Cotton School, Shimla
Old Swinford Hospital
St. Paul's Senior High School, Denu, Ghana (formerly St. Paul's Secondary School)
Catholic Memorial School, Boston
