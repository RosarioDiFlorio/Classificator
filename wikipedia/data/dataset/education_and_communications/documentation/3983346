Gallomo was the name of a circle of literary correspondence between Alfred Galpin, H. P. Lovecraft, and Maurice W. Moe in the first few decades of the 20th century. The name is derived from the first syllable of each author's last name. It is mostly notable for Lovecraft's involvement, as he often used it to workshop stories on which he was working (for example, "The Statement of Randolph Carter") or discuss strange dreams he had recently had. The other two members went on to publish stories in magazines such as The Vagrant, The Californian, or All-Story Magazine, but are generally not as well known as Lovecraft.
