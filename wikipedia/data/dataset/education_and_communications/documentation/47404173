Amarna letter EA 256, titled: Oaths and Denials, is a square, mostly flat clay tablet letter written on both sides; it is also written on the bottom, top (=bottom of reverse side), and the last 3 lines are written on the left edge (obverse), where the start of lines on the obverse form a 'straight' margin.
The reverse of the letter (see Rohl), has a list of towns in, or associated with the Golan Heights. The surface of the letter is rough (partially eroded?), or photos of the reverse especially, do not easily highlight the cuneiform characters.
The topic of the letter is the whereabouts of Ayyab, supposedly in Pella, Jordan (Pihilu of the letters, or Pella).
The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 20â€“25 years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.
