The Fonthill Letter is a letter sent by Ordlaf, ealdorman of Wiltshire, to King Edward the Elder (r. 899-924) detailing a property dispute between Ordlaf and Aethelhelm Higa, a rival claimant. While Ordlaf is never explicitly identified as the author, it is apparent due to tenses and position of the speaker throughout the letter. The property in question was five hides of the Fonthill Estate in Ordlaf's county, which Ordlaf had given to the Bishop of Winchester.
While the letter is not exactly dated, it is suggested that the dispute took place from approximately 897-899/901. This means it starts within the final years of Alfred's reign and the formative period of King Edward the Elder.
The letter, which survives in the original or a contemporary copy, largely believed to be an elaborate copy, traces the intricate history of the estate's ownership, telling of its former owner Helmstan, Ordlaf's Godson and a twice convicted thief of King Alfred's intervention, and of how the land subsequently passed into Ordlaf's sole ownership after Helmstan's second conviction for stealing a neighbour's oxen.

The letter was intended to be used as evidence in the ongoing lawsuit between Ordlaf and Higa over ownership of the land. Eventually, the letter served its purpose when Higa withdrew from the suit.
The letter is clearly not the work of a professional scribe or experienced writer due to numerous edits and corrections.
