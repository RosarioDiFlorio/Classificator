This is a list of the British Liberal Party, SDPâ€“Liberal Alliance, and Liberal Democrat general election manifestos since the 1900 general election.
From 1900 to 1918, the Liberal Party general election manifesto was usually published as a form of a short personal address by the leader of the party. From 1922 the party usually published a more formal document.
From the 1900 general election to the 1979 general election, the party went to the polls as the Liberal Party. In 1983 and 1987, the party went to the polls under the banner of the "Alliance", as a result of the pact between the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party (formed 1981). Since 1992 it has gone to the polls as the Liberal Democrats, due to the merger of the Liberals and the SDP in 1988.
From 2010 to 2015, the Liberal Democrats, having signed an agreement with the Conservatives, served as junior partner in the first coalition government in Britain since 1945.
