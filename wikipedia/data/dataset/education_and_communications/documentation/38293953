Royal Succession Bills and Acts are pieces of (proposed) legislation to determine the legal line of succession to the Monarchy of the United Kingdom.
A Succession to the Crown Bill is a proposed piece of legislation in the United Kingdom, presented as a Private Members Bill or Government Bill, in either the House of Commons or House of Lords, which aims to alter the laws of succession to the UK Monarchy.
The Crown is a corporation sole that represents the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, or judicial governance. It evolved as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch. In this context it should not be confused with any physical crown.
A bill is a proposed law under consideration by a legislature. A bill is not law until passed by the legislature and, in most cases, approved by the executive, Privy Council and monarch by Royal Assent. Once a bill is enacted into law it is called an "act" or "statute".
