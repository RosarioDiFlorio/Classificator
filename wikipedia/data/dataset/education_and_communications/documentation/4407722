Ushu (in the Amarna Letters Usu) was an ancient mainland city that supplied Tyre, Lebanon, with water, supplies and burial grounds. Its name was based upon the mythical figure Usoos or Ouso√ºs, a descendant of Genos and Genea whose children allegedly discovered fire, as recorded by Sanchuniathon (Sankunyaton).
