The Scottish Record Society is a text publication society founded at Edinburgh in 1897, but with earlier roots as the Scottish section of the British Record Society (founded 1889). Since its establishment it has published numerous volumes of calendars and indices of public records and private muniments and original manuscripts relating to Scotland and Scottish affairs. It is a registered Scottish charity.
Membership of the Society is open to all persons and institutions interested in its work. There is a governing council which manages the affairs of the society. George MacKenzie, former Keeper of the Records of Scotland and Registrar General, is President. The Chairman is Tristram Clarke. The Honorary Treasurer is Tessa Spencer. The Honorary Secretary is Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown.
During its first decade the Society concentrated on transcribing and publishing detailed indices of testaments (wills) proved in Scottish Commissariot Courts.
