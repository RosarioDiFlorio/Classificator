The Second Epistle of Clement (Ancient Greek: Κλήμεντος πρὸς Κορινθίους, translit. Klēmentos pros Korinthious, lit. 'Clement to Corinthians') often referred to as 2 Clement or Second Clement, is an early Christian writing. 2 Clement was not accepted in the canonical New Testament, but was included in the Apostolic Fathers collection.
