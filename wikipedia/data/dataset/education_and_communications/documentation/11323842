Yidya, and also Idiya, was the mayor/ruler of ancient Ašqaluna/Ashkelon in the 1350-1335 BC Amarna letters correspondence.
Yidya is mainly referenced in the Amarna letters corpus, in his own letters: EA 320–326, (EA for 'el Amarna'). However, the other reference to Yidya is a letter from the pharaoh to his vassal Yidya, letter EA 370.
The titles of Yidya's letters are as follows:
EA 320—title: "Listening carefully (1)"
EA 321—title: "Listening carefully (2)"
EA 322—title: "Listening carefully (3)"
EA 323—title: "A royal order for glass"
EA 324—title: "Preparations completed (1)"
EA 325—title: "Preparations Completed (2)"
EA 326—title: "A new commissioner"
