Community Archives are archives created or accumulated, described, and/or preserved by individuals and community groups, sometimes without the traditional intervention of professionals like archivists, historians, and librarians. The shared experience of the members of a community often determine or impact the scope of a community archive. Community archives are created in response to needs defined by the members of a community, who also exert a certain amount of control over how materials may be used.
Since the late 1990s, community archives have begun to be created in ever greater numbers. As the term 'community archive' has gained in popularity, it has been applied in a variety of ways, including as a way to denote community participation in knowledge creation and as a moniker that challenges existing historical and political narratives. Community archives may be brought together in physical or virtual space, including through digitization of dispersed physical materials.
