A speech corpus (or spoken corpus) is a database of speech audio files and text transcriptions. In Speech technology, speech corpora are used, among other things, to create acoustic models (which can then be used with a speech recognition engine). In Linguistics, spoken corpora are used to do research into phonetic, conversation analysis, dialectology and other fields.
A corpus is one such database. Corpora is the plural of corpus (i.e. it is many such databases).
There are two types of Speech Corpora:
Read Speech - which includes:
Book excerpts
Broadcast news
Lists of words
Sequences of numbers

Spontaneous Speech - which includes:
Dialogs - between two or more people (includes meetings);
Narratives - a person telling a story (one such corpus is the Buckeye Corpus);
Map-tasks - one person explains a route on a map to another;
Appointment-tasks - two people try to find a common meeting time based on individual schedules.

A special kind of speech corpora are non-native speech databases that contain speech with foreign accent.
