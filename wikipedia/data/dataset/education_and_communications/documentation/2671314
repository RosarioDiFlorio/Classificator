Uniclass 2015 is a unified classification system for all sectors of the UK construction industry. It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like anchor plates, flue liners or LED lamps.
Originally released in 1997, Uniclass allows project information to be structured to a recognised standard. This original version has now been heavily revised, to make it more suitable for use with modern construction industry practice, and to make it compatible with BIM (Building information modeling) now and in the future.
Led by the National Building Specification (NBS), experts from across the industry have developed the new system, known as Uniclass 2015. This significantly extends the scope of the previous version, and responds to industry feedback on the draft tables known as Uniclass 2, published by CPI in 2013.
Uniclass 2015 provides:
A unified classification system for the construction industry. For the first time, buildings, landscape and infrastructure can be classified under one unified scheme
A hierarchical suite of tables that support classification from a university campus or road network to a floor tile or kerb unit
A numbering system that is flexible enough to accommodate future classification requirements
A system compliant with ISO 12006 that is mapped to NRM1 and supports mapping to other classification systems in the future
A classification system that will be maintained and updated by NBS.
