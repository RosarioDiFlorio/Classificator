An architectural brief is a statement of a client's requirements, which form the basis for appointing an architect. The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. The term program is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a synonym of, an 'architectural brief'. 'Program' is used more often in the United States whereas 'brief' is used more outside the United States, internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program.
