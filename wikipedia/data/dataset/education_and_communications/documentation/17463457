The EDP (Electronic Document Professional) is a professional designation awarded by Xplor International for participants in the electronic document industry who have satisfied a number of criteria.
The EDP is not a measure of specific knowledge, but awardees normally have a broad knowledge of the electronic document industry along with specific knowledge in one or more areas. Thus, the EDP differs from certifications such as the CDIA+ from CompTIA in which the awardee has passed a formal exam. Rather, the EDP is more closely related to the older MIT and LIT designations from AIIM. Generally, the EDP does show that the awardee has been in the industry for at least 5 years, and has participated in at least 3 major projects showing competence in a number of 'bodies of knowledge'.
The EDP program is regulated by the EDP Commission of Xplor International, which is a body of senior professionals in the electronic document industry who set the standards and judge the qualifications of the applicants.
