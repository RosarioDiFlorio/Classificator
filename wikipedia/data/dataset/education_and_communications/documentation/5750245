PropBank is a corpus that is annotated with verbal propositions and their argumentsâ€”a "proposition bank". Although "PropBank" refers to a specific corpus produced by Martha Palmer et al., the term propbank is also coming to be used as a common noun referring to any corpus that has been annotated with propositions and their arguments.
The PropBank project has been extremely influential in recent research in natural language processing. It led to wide popularity for the semantic role labelling task.
