The Crónica Mexicayotl is a chronicle of the Aztec Empire that was written in the Nahuatl language by Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc around 1598.
It chronicles the history of the Aztecs from the first Tlatoani Acamapichtli to the Spanish appointed "puppet rulers" in the mid 16th century. Given that its author belonged to the Aztec royal lineage, the manuscript documents the Aztec version of the history of central Mexico.
It was written in both Spanish and Nahuatl by the bilingual author.
The Nahuatl document was found by Joaquín García Icazbalceta in the Boturini collection, later moved to the French national Library in Paris and first published in 1949 in translation by Adrián Leon.
