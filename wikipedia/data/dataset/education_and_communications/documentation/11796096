Yabitiri was a mayor/ruler of an unknown city/city-state in southern Canaan, during the 1350-1335 BC Amarna letters correspondence. The city he represented is in proximity to the two cities mentioned in his only Amarna letter, EA 296, (EA for 'el Amarna'). The two cities are Hazzatu-(modern city: Gaza), and Yapu-(biblical "Joppa", modern Yafo).
Yabitiri is not referenced by name, in any other letters of the 382â€“letter Amarna letters corpus.
The letter is presumably by the same scribe, with identical multiple phrasing, for the letters EA 266, 292, and 296, from southern Canaan cities/city-states.
