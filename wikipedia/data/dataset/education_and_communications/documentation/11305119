Pu-Ba'lu, (another spelling, also Pu-Bahla) was ruler/mayor of Yursa, (a city/city-state in Canaan(?)), of the 1350-1335 BC Amarna letters correspondence. His name translates in Akkadian as: "word/mouth (of) Baal", the 'Spokesman (of) Baal' , (–or 'Baal's Voice').
Pu-Ba'lu of Yursa is the author of three letters to pharaoh. See: Yursa
The three Amarna letters, (EA for 'el Amarna') to pharaoh from Pu-Ba'lu of Yursa are:
EA 314—Title: "A shipment of glass"
EA 315—Title: "Like a command of the Sun"–See: Reanap
EA 316—Title: "Postscript to the royal scribe"–See: Tahmašši
Of the entire Amarna letters 382–letter corpus, Pu-Ba'lu of Yursa is only referenced in letters 314, and 315, as: "..Pu-Ba'lu, the ruler of Yursa", and EA 316, as "Pu-Ba'lu". One other reference in EA 104, entitled: "Ullassa taken" is to Abdi-Ashirta's son, "Pu-Bahla", presumably a separate 'Pu-Baal'.
