The Cambridge Edition of the Letters of Ernest Hemingway is an ongoing scholarly multi-volume publication of the letters of Ernest Hemingway undertaken by the Cambridge University Press. Out of the projected 16 volumes, the first volume, covering years from 1907 to 1922, was published in 2011. The project, when completed, will collect every extant Hemingway letter, numbering over 6,000, and is being edited by Sandra Spanier, professor of English at Pennsylvania State University. The second volume, covering years from 1923 to 1925, was scheduled to be published in the fall of 2013. The project may take 20 years to finish.
