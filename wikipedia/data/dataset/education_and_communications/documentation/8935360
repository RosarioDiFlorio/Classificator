Selected Letters I, 1911-1924 is a collection of letters by H. P. Lovecraft. It was released in 1964 by Arkham House in an edition of 2,504 copies. It is the first of a five volume series of collections of Lovecraft's letters and includes a preface by August Derleth and Donald Wandrei.
The five-volume series represents only a fragment of Lovecraft's correspondence, and many of the entries in the Arkham house edition are highly abridged by the editors. In recent years, S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz have co-edited numerous volumes of Lovecraft's unabridged letters to various correspondents. For further details see S. T. Joshi.
