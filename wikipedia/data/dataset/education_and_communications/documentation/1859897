The Apocalypse of Paul (Apocalypsis Pauli, more commonly known in the Latin tradition as the Visio Pauli or Visio sancti Pauli) is a third-century text of the New Testament apocrypha. The original version of the Apocalypse is lost and must be reconstructed from later versions and translations, but must originally have been in Greek. The text is not to be confused with the gnostic Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, which is unlikely to be related.
The text purports to present a detailed account of a vision of Heaven and Hell experienced by Paul the Apostle; "its chief importance lies in the way it helped to shape the beliefs of ordinary Christians concerning the afterlife".
