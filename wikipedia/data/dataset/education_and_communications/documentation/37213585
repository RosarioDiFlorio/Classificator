Jinkela (Chinese: 金坷垃; literally: "Golden Clumps of Earth/Golden Clod") is a fertilizer supplement product made in China. Its maker claims that the product can help plants increase the absorption of minerals (i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium compounds) and have better yields. This fertilizer supplement was sold in Henan Province, People's Republic of China circa 2007, and its advertisement was broadcast on various regional television stations in China. Inspired by its exaggerated television advertisements, netizens in mainland China and Taiwan have made many online parodies (kuso) mocking the product, making it a famous internet meme. Its influence on the cyberculture in Greater China remains to this very day, and its impact has been noted by various mainstream media outlets.
