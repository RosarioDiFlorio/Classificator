A message in a bottle (abbreviated MIB) is a form of communication in which a message is sealed in a container and released into a medium, archetypically a bottle released into a large body of water.
Messages in bottles have been used in crowdsourced scientific studies of ocean currents, as well as to send distress messages, memorial tributes, sending deceased loved ones' ashes on a final journey, final reports and letters from those believing themselves to be doomed, invitations to prospective pen pals, and letters to actual or imagined love interests.
Message-in-a-bottle lore has often been of a romantic or poetic nature.
