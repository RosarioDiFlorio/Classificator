The Letter to the Trallians by Ignatius, an early-second-century Bishop of Antioch and martyr, was written to the church in Tralles during the bishop's transport from Antioch, Syria, to his execution in Rome. Trallians is one of seven epistles written by Ignatius to early centers of Christianity in Anatolia.
In Trallians 7:1, the phrase "God Jesus Christ" appears. This phrase is also found in Polycarp's letter to the Philippians.
Trallians mentions the resurrection of Jesus in chapter (9:1-2):
"Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and drink. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, his Father having raised him up, as in the same manner his Father will raise up us who believe in him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life."
