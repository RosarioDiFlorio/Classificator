The Heidelberg Manifesto of 17 June 1981 was signed by 15 German university and college professors to warn about the "infiltration of the German people" and of the "Ãœberfremdung" (roughly, 'over-foreignisation') of German language, culture and 'Volkstum' (roughly 'national/ethnic character'). It is widely deemed to have been the first time after 1945 that racism and xenophobia were publicy - albeit controversially - legitimised by academics in Germany.
