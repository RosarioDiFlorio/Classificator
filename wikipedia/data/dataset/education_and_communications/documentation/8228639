The Dalpat Vilas is the surviving fragment of a historical manuscript. Written in the Rajasthani language, it is the earliest known Rajput source of Mughal-Rajput relations. The initial portion of the manuscript covers the genealogy of the Rathores (of Marwar) and the Sur dynasty. The bulk of the manuscript chronicles events in Marwar and adjoining areas during the reign of Akbar.
