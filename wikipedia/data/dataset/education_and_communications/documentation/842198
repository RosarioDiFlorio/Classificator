A purchase order (PO) is a commercial document and first official offer issued by a buyer to a seller, indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It is used to control the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers.
The issue of a purchase order does not initiate a contract. If no prior contract exists, then it is the acceptance of the order by the seller that forms a contract between the buyer and seller. Purchase orders can be an essential part of ERP system orders.
