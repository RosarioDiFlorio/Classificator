Daniel Irvin Rather Jr. (born October 31, 1931) is an American journalist and the former news anchor for the CBS Evening News. He was most recently managing editor and anchor of the television news magazine Dan Rather Reports on the cable channel AXS TV. Rather was anchor of the CBS Evening News for 24 years, from March 9, 1981, to March 9, 2005. He also contributed to CBS's 60 Minutes. Rather became embroiled in controversy about a disputed news report involving President George W. Bush's Vietnam-era service in the National Guard and subsequently left CBS Evening News in 2005, and he left the network entirely after 44 years in 2006.
Along with Peter Jennings at ABC News and Tom Brokaw at NBC News, Rather was one of the "Big Three" news anchors in the U.S. during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. The three all hosted their network's flagship nightly news programs for over 20 years, and all three started and retired or died within a year of one another.
