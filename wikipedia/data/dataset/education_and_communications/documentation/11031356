Tell Ashtara (Arabic: تل عشترة‎) also Aštartu, was a site south of Damascus mentioned in the Amarna letters correspondence of 1350 BC. In the Amarna letters the city is named Aštartu, and is usually identified with the Biblical 'Ashteroth Karnaim'.
Aštartu is only referenced in two letters of the 382 letter corpus, in letters EA 256, and EA 197: (titled: "Biryawaza's plight"), -(EA is for 'el Amarna'). Biryawaza was the mayor of Damascus-called Dimasqu.
EA 256 is a story concerning Mutbaal, the son of Labaya, and the Habiru, and concerns the whereabouts of Ayyab, who may be in Pihilu, modern day Pella, Jordan, and is a letter of intrigue, titled: "Oaths and denials", and lists 7 cities located in the Golan area. Ayyab is the king of Aštartu and does author one letter to the Egyptian pharaoh, letter EA 364.
