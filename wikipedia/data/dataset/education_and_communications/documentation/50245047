The TÃ­tulo C'oyoi is an important early colonial K'iche document documenting the mythical origins of the K'iche' people and their history up to the Spanish conquest. It describes K'iche' preparations for battle against the Spanish, and the death of the K'iche' hero Tecun Uman. The document was written in Q'umarkaj, the K'iche' capital city, by the C'oyoi Sakcorowach lineage, which belonged to the Quejnay branch of the K'iche', and who held territory just to the east of Quetzaltenango, now in Guatemala. The document was largely written by Juan de Penonias de Putanza, who claimed to be the relative of a C'oyoi nobleman who was killed during the Spanish conquest. It was composed with the assistance of the K'iche' officialdom at Q'umarkaj, and portions of the text reflect the official version of K'iche' history as produced in the capital. An illustration in the document shows that the Maya nobility of Quetzaltenango adopted the double-headed Hapsburg Eagle as their family crest.
