Achshaph was a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Canaan (Josh. 11:1; 12:20; 19:25). The name means "sorcery." It was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher. There are several opinions as to its exact location, including Tell Harbaj and Tell an-Nakhl. In the Greek Septuagint, in various manuscripts, depending on the passage, its name is given in the forms Azeiph, Achsaph, Achas, Keaph, Achiph, Acheib, and Chasaph.
