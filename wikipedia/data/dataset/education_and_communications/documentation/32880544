The Five Pauline Epistles, A New Translation is a partial Bible translation produced by Scottish scholar William Gunion Rutherford, of five books of the New Testament. The Bible books that were translated into English by Rutherford are a number of Pauline Epistles or "didactic letters", believed to be written by the Jewish Christian Apostle Paul. The work was a translation of the Bible books of Romans, first and second Thessalonians, and first and second Corinthians, with a brief analysis. The work was commenced in 1900, and was completed in 1908. The entire work was brought together in one volume in 1984.
