The cuneiform sign LÃš (ð’‡½) is the sign used for "man"; the opposite is the symbol for woman: Å¡al (ð’Š©). Cuneiform LÃš, (or lÃº as rendered in some texts) is found as a sumerogram in the Epic of Gilgamesh. It also has a common usage in the 1350 BC Amarna letters as the sumerogram for "man".
In the Epic of Gilgamesh, LÃš is only used as the sumerogram, LÃš-(58 times).
Both lÃº, for "man", and Å¡al for "woman" are also considered as determinatives. In the Amarna letters' Rainey's glossary (Rainey 1970) which is the glossary for Akkadian language words, sumerograms, etc., for Amarna letters EA 359-379, uses for both LÃš and lÃº are recorded. For the Amarna letters in Rainey's glossary, "LÃš" as the sumerogram becomes Akkadian amÄ“lu, for "man".
