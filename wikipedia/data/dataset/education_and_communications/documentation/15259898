Auctorem fidei is a papal bull issued by Pius VI, 28 August, 1794, in condemnation of the Gallican and Jansenist acts and tendencies of the Synod of Pistoia (1786).
The bull catalogued and condemned eighty-five articles from the Synod of Pistoia. After the publication of the Bull, Scipione de' Ricci submitted. In 1805, he took occasion of the presence of Pius VII in Florence, on his way to Rome from his exile in France, to ask in person for pardon amid reconciliation.
The document has been cited as a source of doctrinal orthodoxy when later popes were called to combat doctrinal errors in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is mentioned in Indulgentiarum doctrina, Quo graviora, Commissum divinitus, Mysterium fidei, and Pascendi dominici gregis.
