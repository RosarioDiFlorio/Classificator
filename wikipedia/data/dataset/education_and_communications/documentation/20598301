A hero card is a custom-printed card designed to promote a race team with emphasis on the primary driver(s) and their sponsors. Bigger than a baseball card, hero cards have two standard sizes: 6 x 8 and 8 x 10 (inches).
Card information and driver depiction vary, but most hero cards include photos, information about the driver, race history/highlights, sponsors' names, and contact information. Drivers use hero cards as an oversized business card for autograph sessions, and teams sometimes include hero cards in their media kits.
