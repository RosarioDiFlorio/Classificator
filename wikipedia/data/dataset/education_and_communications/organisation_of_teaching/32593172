Haus Steineck was originally the summer home of the Stein family of Cologne. Until 2008 it was owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. "Auf der anderen Seite der Fährstrasse steht das stattliche Haus Steineck, eine frühere Sommervilla der Familie Stein aus Köln. Nach verschiedenen Besitzern war es zuletzt als Gästehaus des Königreich Saudi-Arabien."
"About two decades ago [1954?], a non-profit organization incorporated itself for the purpose of furthering international understanding through civic education. To implement its programs, Haus Steineck was acquired and converted in an institute where groups of all nationalities could meet and exchange their views. Ever since, students, functionaries, trade unionists and many other political and professional groups have gathered at Haus Steineck for informal discussions, lecture series and social get-togethers. The impact of its activities has carried the name and reputation of the institute far beyond the geographical confines of Bonn... Haus Steineck and its facilities are superbly suited for accommodating the ECU campus abroad. The three-story building is in a secluded location- accessible only by way of a dead-end lane and guarded by a stand of ancient oak trees on one side and the swirling waters of the Rhine on the other. It was formerly the manor house of a large estate, and its architecture as well as its interior design testify to its regal past."
By July 1955, the Junge Union of Germany held a meeting at Haus Steineck, because they could not afford a more expensive location. during these days, the home was called "Jugendhaus Steineck."
