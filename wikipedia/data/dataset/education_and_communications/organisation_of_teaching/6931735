A general education liceum (Polish:Liceum ogólnokształcące [liˈt͡sɛum ɔˌɡulnɔkʂtau̯ˈt͡sɔnt͡sɛ]) is an academic high school in the Polish educational system. They are attended by those who plan to further their academic education (i.e. attend university).

On completing the liceum, students take a final exam called a "matura" (or "maturity exam") which is an equivalent of to British A-Level. About 100 days before the exam the traditional "studniówka" (prom ball) is organized.
Liceums are attended by students aged from 16 to 19 or 21. There are several types:
General Liceum (16-19)
Specialized Liceum (16-19)
Supplementary Liceum (18-21)
