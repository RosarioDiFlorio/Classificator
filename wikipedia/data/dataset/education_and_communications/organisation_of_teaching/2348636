Darul uloom (Arabic: دار العلوم‎, transliterated dar al-ʿulūm), also spelled darul ulum etc., is an Arabic term which literally means "house of knowledge". The term generally means an Islamic seminary or educational institution—similar to or often the same as a madrassa or Islamic school—although a darul uloom often indicates a more advanced level of study. In a darul uloom, Islamic subjects are studied by students, who are known as Tulahb or Ṭālib.
The conventional darul ulooms of today have their roots in the South Asia, where the first darul ulooms were founded by the Indian Islamic scholars (ulema) of the past. Darul ulooms followed—and today continue to follow—the age-old Islamic curriculum known as the Dars-e-Nizami syllabus, which has its origins in the Nizamiyya Islamic schools of the Seljuk Empire, but was developed in the South Asia under Islamic thinkers and ulema, such as Shah Waliullah. The Dars-e-Nizami syllabus comprises studies in Tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis), Hifz (Qur'anic memorisation), Sarf and Nahw (Arabic syntax and grammar), Persian, Urdu, Taarikh (Islamic history), Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Shari'ah (Islamic law) etc.
