Albert-Einstein-Schule was a Gymnasium for boys and girls from grades 5–13 in Bochum, Germany. It had about 900 students. Just south of downtown Bochum, the school was in the Wiemelhausen section of town and shared a campus with the Hans Böckler Realschule. The school had an emphasis in natural science and English. It had a bilingual program, where some classes were taught in English, rather than German. Albert-Einstein-Schule was certified as a European School in February 2008. The school's last day of classes was July 14, 2010.
The "Comenius Project," dedicated to exchanging ideas to solve environmental problems, is a joint project of the former Albert-Einstein-Schule, in cooperation with Wath Comprehensive School in Rotherham, England and Col·legi Pare Manyanet in Barcelona, Spain.
In August 2010, the Albert-Einstein-Schule merged with the Gymnasium am Ostring to form a new school, named Neues Gymnasium Bochum. The new school was temporarily located at the Erich Kästner Schule while the new buildings were under construction. It opened following the fall recess on October 22, 2012. The new buildings are on the site of the former buildings, which were razed to permit the new construction.
