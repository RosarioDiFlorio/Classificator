International Schools Association of Thailand (ISAT) is an association of private schools in Thailand, headquartered in Pak Kret, Nonthaburi Province in Greater Bangkok. Its principal 'raison d'etre' is to act as a link between its 45-member international schools, on the one hand, and the Ministry of Education and the Office of the Private Education Commission in particular.
