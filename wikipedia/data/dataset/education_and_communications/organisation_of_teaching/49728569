Baby Ivies are prestigious schools that provide early educational skills to infants. Baby Ivies provide high standard sets and engage their students by giving them a desire to learn. Therefore, these high expectations of academic rigor account for above-average grades. Baby Ivies are private schools owned and governed by entities that are independent of any government â€” typically, religious bodies or independent boards of trustees. Private schools also receive funding primarily from nonpublic sources: tuition payments and often other private sources, such as foundations, religious bodies, alumni, or other private donors. Private schools receive all their funding from local, state, and federal governments and sometimes from donations or parent fundraising.
