The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) is an independent agency created in 1970 by the Ryan Act and is the oldest of the autonomous state standards boards in the nation. In the capacity of P-12 public school education, the CTC is responsible for setting the standards for educator preparation and accrediting the programs that offer it, licensing educators, and, when necessary, disciplining license holders. The website has a searchable database for California teachers' credentials.
The commission operates out of Sacramento, CA.
