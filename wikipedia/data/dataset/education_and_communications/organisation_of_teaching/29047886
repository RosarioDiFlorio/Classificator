School fundraising or school fund raising is the practice of raising money to support educational enrichment programs by schools or school groups mostly known from the United States (e.g., parent-teacher organizations, booster clubs, etc.). One of the most prevalent practices in the United States is product fundraising. Schools and other non-profits raise $1.7 billion each year by selling popular consumer items. Eight out of 10 Americans support these types of programs. In addition, schools and school groups such as their Parent Teacher Organization and Parent Teacher Association find many creative ways to raise fundsâ€”from bake sales, dinner events, auctions and school carnivals to more aggressive advertising, affinity programs, grant writing and straight forward donation requests.
