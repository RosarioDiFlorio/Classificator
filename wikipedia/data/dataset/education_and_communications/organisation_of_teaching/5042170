Saint John's School of Alberta (SJSA) was a small private boys' boarding school in Stony Plain, Alberta, Canada which operated from 1967 to 2008, the last of three such schools founded on conservative Anglican ideas and the notion that children were not challenged by present-day society. It closed in June 2008. Ted Byfield was one of the school's founders.
The school provided a strict, traditional education with corporal punishment and an extensive outdoor program that included snowshoeing, hiking, canoeing, ice hockey, lacrosse and other rigorous and challenging activities.
Two other 'Saint John's Schools' had already closed. They were Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School in Selkirk, Manitoba (near Winnipeg), and Saint John's School of Ontario (Toronto area).
