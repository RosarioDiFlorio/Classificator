A night school is an adult learning school that holds classes in the evening or at night to accommodate people who work during the day. It can also apply to a community college or university that hold classes for the aforementioned purpose, but also admits undergraduates.
Certain high schools, almost always private or charter do exist in fact, but are usually hard to find.
