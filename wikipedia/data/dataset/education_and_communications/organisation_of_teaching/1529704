Extracurricular or Extra Academic Activity (EAA) are those that fall outside the realm of the normal curriculum of school or university education, performed by students. Extracurricular activities exist for all students. And generally, volunteer activities aren't always extracurricular activities.
Such activities are generally voluntary (as opposed to mandatory), social, philanthropic, and often involve others of the same age. Students and Staff direct these activities under faculty sponsorship, although student-led initiatives, such as independent newspapers, are very common.
