Jakarta Intercultural School (JIS), formerly the Jakarta International School, is a private, international school in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was established in 1951 for expatriate students living in Jakarta and is the largest international primary and secondary school in Indonesia.
JIS has 2,400 students aged 3 to 18 from about 65 nationalities. The school adheres to North American and other curriculum models from pre-kindergarten through grade 12. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Council of International Schools. The United States Department of State reports the curriculum offered at Jakarta Intercultural School "has a strong international focus", and considers it one of the best schools overseas for preparing students for American university entrance. JIS has three campuses, two solely for elementary students in Pattimura and Pondok Indah, and one much bigger and considered the main campus for junior high and high school students in Cilandak, South Jakarta.
The school changed its name to Jakarta Intercultural School from Jakarta International School in 2014 to comply with the Indonesian government's regulations on prohibiting the use of word "international" in school names.
