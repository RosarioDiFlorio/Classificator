EsaBac is a Franco-Italian high-school double degree program, signed on February 25, 2009 by Italian Minister of Education Mariastella Gelmini, and French Minister of National Education Xavier Darcos.
The agreement, in force since September 2010, allows Italian and French students to consequently obtain two high-school degrees, Italian Maturità and French Baccalauréat, just in one exam.
