The ERA School was a co-educational secondary school that opened in Melbourne in February 1971. The school was regarded as providing an 'alternative’ education curriculum. Attendance at lessons was not mandatory, and students could select their own study program. The school was loosely based on the Summerhill School in England that was founded by A.S. Neill. ERA was an acronym for 'Education Reform Association'.
Students were able to wear casual clothes; there was no uniform. Students were allocated to “home groups” which were convened by specific teachers. The school was governed by a council, and there were occasional “general meetings” involving staff, students and parents to discuss school matters.
