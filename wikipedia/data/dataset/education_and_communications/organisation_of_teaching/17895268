A permission slip is a form that a school or other organization sends home with a student to a parent in which the parent provides authorization for minor children to travel under the auspices of the school or organization for an event, such as a field trip.
Permission slips are required by law in many places in order for an organization to be allowed to take a student on a trip. While laws vary by jurisdiction, they are generally present in accordance with the laws minors must be given by their parents or legal guardians to be transported by another adult.
Information that may be found on a permission slip may include the student's name, the location where the field trip will occur, and emergency contact info.
