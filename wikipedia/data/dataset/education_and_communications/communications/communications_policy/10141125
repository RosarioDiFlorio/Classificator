Organizational network analysis (ONA) is a method for studying communication and socio-technical networks within a formal organization. It is a quantitative descriptive technique for creating statistical and graphical models of the people, tasks, groups, knowledge and resources of organizational systems. It is based on social network theory and more specifically, dynamic network analysis.
ONA is a growing trend in the field of People Analytics, especially around the concept of understanding Diversity and Inclusion as well as understanding how employees really interact with each other to achieve common and personal goals. Using data to understand employee behavior is a growing trend, however, the focus on understanding relationships that drive behavior and provide context on employee sentiments is the key area for leading innovative growth..
"Organizational network analysis (ONA) can provide an x-ray into the inner workings of an organization â€” a powerful means of making invisible patterns of information flow and collaboration in strategically important groups visible."
