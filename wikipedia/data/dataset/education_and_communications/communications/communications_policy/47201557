Flitto (Hangul: 플리토) is a global crowd-sourcing translation platform (iOS, Android, web), where you can request translations as you need or become a translator if you can speak more than one language. You can read various content, such as celebrity's social media, Contents, e-commerce deals, and more, all in your native language.
Flitto provides human-powered translations. Machine translation has its limits as it cannot reflect cultural backgrounds or other specific situation in a given context. Flitto, on the other hand, offers a full human-powered translation service which overcomes these issues. Flitto's goal is to break down all the language barriers.
The service supports text, image, and voice translations, and 1:1 translation in 18 different languages (Arabic, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese).
Flitto’s current user estimate is 5+ million and is being used in 170 countries, with about 300K translations submitted daily.
