Radiate is a mobile app that connects people going to the same music festival as one another. Users can opt into events, and then post images and text for others within the event to see. Users can anonymously say "Hey" to each other, and if both users say "Hey", a chat will open up between them. In addition to the forums, users can also "swipe" through other users, using a mechanic similar to Tinder.
