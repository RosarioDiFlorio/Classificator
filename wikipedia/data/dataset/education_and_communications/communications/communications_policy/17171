A kiosk (from Turkish köşk, from Persian kūshk) is a small, separated garden pavilion open on some or all sides. Kiosks were common in Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and in the Ottoman Empire from the 13th century onward. Today, there are many kiosks in and around the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, and they are still a relatively common sight in Balkan states.
The word is now applied to small booths offering goods and services and to freestanding computer terminals.
