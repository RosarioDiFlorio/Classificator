Project Lingua is an online translation community formed in 2007 with the goal of translating articles from the global citizen media project Global Voices Online from English into other languages, opening lines of communication between bloggers across the world. The project currently translates into 40 different languages, and incorporates an estimated active 570 volunteer translators and translation editors. Along with the Cucumis project and the Wikipedia's own translation projects in every language, such as the Wikipedia:ECHO, Project Lingua is considered one of the largest volunteer-based online translation communities in the world.
