Social network analysis in criminology views social relationships in terms of network theory, consisting of nodes (representing individual actors within the network) and ties (which represent relationships between the individuals, such as offender movement, co-offenders, crime groups, etc.) These networks are often depicted in a social network diagram, where nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines.
