A telecommunications lease is a lease that exists between a telecommunications provider or wireless company, and a landowner. Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landownerâ€™s property for a telecommunications site or cellular tower for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent. Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.
