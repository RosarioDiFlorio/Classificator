A Silver Alert is a public notification system in the United States to broadcast information about missing persons – especially senior citizens with Alzheimer's disease, dementia or other mental disabilities – in order to aid in locating them.
Silver Alerts use a wide array of media outlets – such as commercial radio stations, television stations, and cable television – to broadcast information about missing persons. In some states, Silver Alerts also use variable-message signs on roadways to alert motorists to be on the lookout for missing seniors. In cases in which a missing person is believed to be missing on foot, Silver Alerts have used Reverse 911 or other emergency notification systems to notify nearby residents of the neighborhood surrounding the missing person's last known location. Silver alerts can also be used for children who are missing without being in danger or abducted.
Supporters of Silver Alert point to U.S.A growing elderly population as a reason to support new programs to locate missing seniors. Approximately six in ten dementia victims will wander at least once.  If not found within 24 hours, up to half of wandering seniors with dementia suffer serious injury or death.
