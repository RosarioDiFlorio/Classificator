The Independent Television Commission (ITC) licensed and regulated commercial television services in the United Kingdom (except S4C in Wales) between 1 January 1991 and 28 December 2003. In this context, 'independent' indicates freedom from the BBC, rather than the government, as the latter is taken as being read.
