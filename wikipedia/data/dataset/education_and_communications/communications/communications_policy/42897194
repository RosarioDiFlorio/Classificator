A Ringgold identifier is a unique identifier for organisations in the publishing industry supply chain. The Ringgold database includes over 430,000 institutions and consortia who acquire scholarly publications and content.
The Ringgold identifier was introduced in 2003. Ringgold developed it in response to an issue raised by Oxford University Press, namely how to identify institutional subscribers unambiguously. the system is owned and administered by Ringgold, Inc. and Ringgold, Ltd., who also publish a taxonomy for classifying the subject interests of the listed organisations.
Ringgold is an ISNI registration agency, and as such the US National Information Standards Organization recommended that Ringgold identifiers be used to identify organizations involved in scholarly communications. Ringgold identifiers are used by ORCID, to record the institutional affiliation of individual researchers.
