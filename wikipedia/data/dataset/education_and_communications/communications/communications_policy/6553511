Global information management Metrics eXchange or GMX is a collection of current and proposed standards, primarily targeted at the needs of the translation industry. They are concerned with measuring quantitatively aspects of a document, particularly those with relevance to the translation process (e.g. word counts, complexity) and were being standardised by Localization Industry Standards Association as part of the Open Architecture for XML Authoring and Localization until the demise of LISA. The primary use cases are in quoting, estimating and billing translation work.
