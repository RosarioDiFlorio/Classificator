The primary symptoms of dyslexia were first identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881. The term 'dyslexia' was coined in 1887 by Rudolf Berlin, an ophthalmologist practicing in Stuttgart, Germany. Since then generations of researchers have been investigating what dyslexia is and trying to identify the biological causes. (See History section of article "Dyslexia".) The theories of the etiology of dyslexia have and are evolving with each new generation of dyslexia researchers, and the more recent theories of dyslexia tend to enhance one or more of the older theories as understanding of the nature of dyslexia evolves.
Theories should not be viewed as competing, but as attempting to explain the underlying causes of a similar set of symptoms from a variety of research perspectives and background.
