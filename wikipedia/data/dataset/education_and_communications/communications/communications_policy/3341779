A DEA number (DEA Registration Number) is an identifier assigned to a health care provider (such as a physician, optometrist, ], dentist, or veterinarian) by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration allowing them to write prescriptions for controlled substances.
Though there is no legal basis for preventing its use as a general prescriber identification number, for security reasons the DEA prefers that DEA registration numbers only be used for authenticating and tracking prescriptions for controlled substances. The agency prefers that the National Provider Identifier be used for general identification purposes.
