Congolese Posts and Savings Company, also called the Société des postes et d'épargne du Congo or SOPECO, is a government owned postal company in the Republic of Congo. It is a crown corporation and was created on 1 July 2001 by Ordinance No. 10-2001. There are forty eight post offices, mostly in major cities. Many private corporations provide postal services, often without the permission of the government. Many of these companies have been in business since before any legislation regulating the postal industry had been passed.
Originally the postal administration was admitted into the Universal Postal Union on 3 May 1961 and remains a member. Post codes are not used in the Congo.
