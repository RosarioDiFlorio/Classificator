Gate crashing, gatecrashing, or party crashing is the act of attending an invitation-only event when not invited. The person doing the gate crashing is known as a gate crasher.
Reasons for gate crashing include but are not limited to:
Avoiding entry fees
Joining the No Fees Club
Gaining access to free food and beverages (often alcoholic)
Gaining access to a party to which they wanted to be invited but weren't
Getting casual sex
Taking pictures of famous people (see paparazzi)
Having pictures taken with famous people
And more serious crimes like:
Stalking
Kidnapping
Murder
Rape
Theft
Fraud, and
Causing general disruptions.
Various techniques that involve blending in with the crowd can be used to gain access to some events. Various measures can be taken to prevent gate crashers from gaining access such as collecting invitations at the door and employing staff to identify potential uninvited guests, but such measures can still be thwarted by a skilled gate crasher.
The first "how to" gate-crashing book, Meet the Stars, was written by Charlotte Laws in 1988. She went by the name Missy Laws at the time and details how she crashed dozens of celebrity-filled events, major award shows and even got past Secret Service to interview the president. Her story about Elvis was reprinted in Uncle John's Bathroom Reader.
