In linguistics, an A-not-A question is a polar question that offers two opposite possibilities for the answer. This disjunctive question is predominantly found in Sinitic and some Altaic languages that offers a choice between an affirmative predicate and its negative counterpart. They are functionally regarded as a type of "yes/no" question as they are very similar to a large extent. "A-not-A" questions are often interpreted as having a 'neutral' presupposition or is used in a neutral context. This means that the person asking the A-not-A question does not assume the truth value of the proposition expressed by the question. The “A-not-A” question structure is commonly found in Chinese. The overarching principle is the contrasting of the positive and negative form of a premise side by side. A-not-A questions have a special interrogative type pattern of which YES/NO answers are not permitted, and instead requires an echo response. Therefore to properly answer the query, the recipient must select the positive (affirmative form “A”) or negative (negative predicate form “not-A”) version and use it in the formation of their response.
