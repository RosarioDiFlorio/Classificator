Social invisibility occurs when, to a material degree, the social network that would ordinarily bind a group to the larger society is inadvertently or intentionally pruned, ultimately leaving the subgroup as a social "island". The social influence of a group subject to invisibility is diminished, much like the position of untouchables in a caste society.
Social invisibility also refers to individuals who have been marginalized and are systematically overlooked by the wider public and in effect made as if invisible. It can include homeless people, the elderly, minorities, migrant workers, or anyone who experiences a sense of exclusion from society as a whole.
