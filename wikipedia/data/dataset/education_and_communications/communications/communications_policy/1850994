In Statistical Process Control, the Western Electric Rules are decision rules for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions on control charts. Locations of the observations relative to the control chart control limits (typically at Â±3 standard deviations) and centerline indicate whether the process in question should be investigated for assignable causes. The Western Electric Rules were codified by a specially-appointed committee of the manufacturing division of the Western Electric Company and appeared in the first edition of its Statistical Quality Control Handbook in 1956. Their purpose was to ensure that line workers and engineers interpret control charts in a uniform way.
