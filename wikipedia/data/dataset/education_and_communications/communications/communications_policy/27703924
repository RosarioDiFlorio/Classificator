Language migration may refer to various types of language change, including change associated with human migration and language contact.
Particular language migrations may have names (for example Bantu expansion) and particular languages may have notable migration histories (for example Indo-Aryan).
Language contact describes changes that occur when languages come into contact, including sound change and external history.
