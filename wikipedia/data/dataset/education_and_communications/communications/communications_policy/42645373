Sharenting (or oversharenting) is a term used to describe the overuse of social media by parents to share content based on their children. It is related to the concept of "too much information". There is an ongoing debate as to how parents can balance their right to share with their child's interest in privacy. Pediatricians are starting to consider how sharenting affects childhood well-being and family life.
