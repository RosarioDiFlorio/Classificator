Interpersonal adaptation theory (IAT) is sort of a theory of theories. Multiple theories attempt to describe certain interactions and parts of an interaction in great detail, while IAT, encompassing all of those other theories, makes predictions throughout the entire course of the interaction. For this reason, this theory is often referred to as the interaction adaptation theory. It states that people begin an interaction with a combination of expectations, requirements, and desires.
