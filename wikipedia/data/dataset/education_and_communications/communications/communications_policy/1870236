Bad faith (from French mauvaise foi) is a philosophical concept utilized by existentialist philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir to describe the phenomenon in which human beings, under pressure from social forces, adopt false values and disown their innate freedom, hence acting inauthentically. It is closely related to the concepts of self-deception and ressentiment.
