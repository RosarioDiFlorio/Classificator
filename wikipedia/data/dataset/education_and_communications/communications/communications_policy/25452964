A medical certificate or doctor's certificate is a written statement from a physician or other medically qualified health care provider which attests to the result of a medical examination of a patient. It can serve as a "sick note" (documentation that an employee is unfit for work) or evidence of a health condition.
An aegrotat (; from Latin aegrotat, meaning "he/she is ill") or sick note is a type of medical certificate excusing a student's absence from school for reasons of illness.
