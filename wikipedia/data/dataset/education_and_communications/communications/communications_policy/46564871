Ammar Abo Bakr is a well-known muralist and graffiti artist in Egypt. His work depicts the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Egyptian history, and Islamic culture. Throughout the revolution, Ammar Abo Bakr painted amidst resistance from the police force, which would cover his art with white paint as a sign of criminal justice. His work often challenges government regimes or injustices and is most famously found on Mohamed Mahmoud Street. However, it can also be seen in other places in Cairo, Alexandria, Beirut, Brussels, Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne and Frankfurt. In an interview with Sarah Mousa of Jadaliyya, Abo Bakr said, "...While we [artists] strongly oppose the military and want to mark that stance, we love the people and would also like to present art to the people... I want to present something of beauty to people who can see it, see that their streets have beautiful murals and feel joy."
