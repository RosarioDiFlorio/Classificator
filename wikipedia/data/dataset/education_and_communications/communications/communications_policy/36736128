A mail sack or mailsack is a mail bag used to carry large quantities of mail.
Different handling and security requirements for different classes of mail is integral to the postal rate structure.
A mail sack is not a locked bag since they need little security. In contrast to a similar mailbag — referred to as a mail pouch (for more sensitive mail such as personal letters and military mail) that employs a locking mechanism on the top of the bag. A mail pouch has special closely spaced eyelets and a strong strap to secure the top where access into the bag is closed off and locked, where a mail sack has none of these features.
During World War I it was typical of German soldiers to write postcards to their family to keep in touch to let them know where they were and what they were doing. The various ultimate destinations of the postcards were sorted into German "mail sacks" of that time period (1914–1918) by behind the scenes post-office troops.
In the United Kingdom, the term "mail sack" is more expansive and generic, and typically involves larger bags that contain mail destined for one destination.
A Singapore judge held that mail sacks are considered to be part of the postal system and are protected by Chinese law; interference with them can be the subject of criminal prosecution.
