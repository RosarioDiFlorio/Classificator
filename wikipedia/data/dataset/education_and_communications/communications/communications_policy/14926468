Srbija do Tokija, (Serbian: Србија до Токија), meaning "Serbia to Tokyo", is a slogan and catch-phrase dating back to the early 1990s. At that time, Serbian football club Red Star Belgrade had won the European Cup, and also the worldwide title in Tokyo, Japan, winning the Intercontinental Cup. This was the greatest success of any football club ever in Yugoslavia, and was much envied by the other nations at the time of increased ethnic tensions. The phrase has been used by Serbian soccer fans to taunt fans from rival ethnic groups in the beginning of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. There have been incidents of graffiti containing the message in Vojvodina, Central Serbia, as well as in Republika Srpska and other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such graffiti was also seen in Kosovo during the Kosovo War.
