In other words, this is the way to caliber success of social media marketing strategies used by a company or a brand. It is also used by companies to gauge current trends in the industry. The process first gathers data from different websites and then performs analysis based on different metrics like time spent on the page, click through rate, content share, comments, text analytics to identify positive or negative emotions about the brand.

The expected outcome varies per the goal and is usually measured by variety of metrics.  This is followed by defining possible social strategies to be used to achieve the goal.
