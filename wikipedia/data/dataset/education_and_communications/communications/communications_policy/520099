Siteswap is a juggling notation used to describe or represent juggling patterns. Siteswap may also be used to describe siteswap patterns, possible patterns transcribed using siteswap. It encodes the number of beats of each throw, which is related to their relative height, and the hand to which the throw is to be made: "The idea behind siteswap is to keep track of the order that balls are thrown and caught, and _only_ that." It is an invaluable tool in determining which combinations of throws yield valid juggling patterns for a given number of objects, and has led to previously unknown patterns (such as 441). However, it does not describe body movements such as behind-the-back and under-the-leg. Siteswap assumes that, "throws happen on beats that are equally spaced in time."
Throws are represented, "by [positive] integers that specify the number of beats in the future when the object is thrown again."

The numbers are as follows:
0 = "missing"/rest [empty hand]
1 = pass [between hands]
2 = hold [one hand/no toss]
3 = (3-ball) cascade toss [between hands]
4 = (4-ball) fountain/columns toss [up and into same hand]
5 = high toss [between hands]
...
a = 10 = high toss [up and into same hand]
...
For example, a three-ball cascade may be notated "3", while a shower may be notated "5 1". The height, and thus difficulty, of throws increases exponentially and siteswaps above 5 are rare except in numbers juggling. The name siteswap comes from the ability to generate patterns by "swapping" landing times of any 2 throws in a siteswap. For example, swapping the landing times of throws "5" and "1" in the siteswap "51" generates the siteswap "24".
