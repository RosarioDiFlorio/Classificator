The Prague Society for International Cooperation is an organization dedicated to business, politics and academia in Central Europe. A rigorous agenda is achieved through transparent networking, off-the-record dialogues and numerous international functions in order to develop a new generation of responsible, intellectuals who work towards a common goal in a post-communistic society. The most notable function of the Prague Society would be the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award, jointly given every year with the Global Panel Foundation to those with the vision to work towards the common good. The Society believes that the innovative process has been hindered based on a reluctance to share information and communicate. The organization was established in June 1999 in order to overcome this obstacle and has retained many international ties around the world. In addition, Prague Society also publishes a newsletter that is distributed to the local population in the Czech Republic and other international publications.
