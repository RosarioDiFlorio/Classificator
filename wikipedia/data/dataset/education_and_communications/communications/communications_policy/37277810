Blovel (a portmanteau of blog and novel) is a novel created from serialized blog posts. This differs from a blook, which is a published book that has been made from, or inspired by, blog content.
With a blovel, the story is created in and for the blog. It may later become a blook, should the author or a publisher choose to combine the posts into a single publication, but it is primarily a work of fiction created using the technology of an internet blog.
Various writers contemplating blovels have laid out some criteria for blovels:
Posts should be 250-500 words in length.
Posts should end in cliffhangers or at least with suspenseful elements that keep the reader wanting to read the next days’ post.
Post should be posted regularly, typically every 1–3 days.
Readers should be allowed to comment on the posts.
Authors should create the novel online through the daily posts and not simply cut and paste already written novels into blog posts.
Blovels should be shorter works, typically 40,000-60,000 words in length.
Blovels should follow the same pattern as novels with a beginning, climactic conflict, and dénouement or resolution.
A blovel should run for no more than one year.
