Matrix is an open protocol for real-time communication. It is designed to allow users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, Voice over IP, and Videotelephony. That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email does now for store-and-forward email service.
From a technical perspective, it is an application layer communications protocol for federated real-time communication. It provides HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC, facilitating browser-to-browser applications.
Other attempts at defining an open instant messaging or multimedia signalling protocol of this type and getting it widely adopted (e.g. XMPP and IRCv3) have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political. It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers.
