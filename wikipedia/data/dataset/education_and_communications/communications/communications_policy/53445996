Optimot, linguistic inquiries, is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the Institute for Catalan Studies and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.
