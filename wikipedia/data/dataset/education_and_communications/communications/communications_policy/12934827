Information manipulation theory (IMT) (McCornack 1992) & (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of informationâ€”but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is deceit. The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called information manipulation. Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.
