In communications and electronics, especially in telecommunications, interference is anything which modifies, or disrupts a signal as it travels along a channel between a source and a receiver. The term typically refers to the addition of unwanted signals to a useful signal. Common examples are:
Electromagnetic interference (EMI)
Co-channel interference (CCI), also known as crosstalk
Adjacent-channel interference (ACI)
Intersymbol interference (ISI)
Inter-carrier interference (ICI), caused by doppler shift in OFDM modulation (multitone modulation).
Common-mode interference (CMI)
Conducted interference
Interference is typically but not always distinguished from noise, for example white thermal noise.
Radio resource management aims at reducing and controlling the co-channel and adjacent-channel interference.
