The media engagement framework is a planning framework used by marketing professionals to understand the behavior of social media marketing-based audiences. The construct was introduced in the book, ROI of Social Media. Powellâ€™s background in marketing ROI and Groves' experience and understanding of the applications of social media in business led to a collaboration. Dimos joined as a brand strategist for Litmus Group, a global management consulting firm.
The media engagement framework consists of the definitions of personas (Individuals, Consumers and Influencers), referenced by the competitive set or constraint that applies to that persona and the measurement framework that might be applied to those personas. It is referenced at the center of the marketing process diagram, surrounded by the marketing functions of strategy, tactics, metrics and ROI. The marketing process diagram describes how the media engagement framework can apply to any strategic marketing activity but was developed to establish a completely integrated framework describing how both traditional and social media marketing activities can be planned, executed, measured and improved.
