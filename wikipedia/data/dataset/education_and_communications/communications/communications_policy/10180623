Decision downloading refers to communicating a decision to those who have not been involved in the decision-making process.
The term “decision downloading” is used to set apart those special situations in which decision-makers communicate a decision that has already been made. The communicators cannot, for whatever reason, keep everyone informed in real-time about the decision-making process.
