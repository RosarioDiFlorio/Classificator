A calendar (sometimes historically spelled kalendar) is, in the context of archival science, textual scholarship, and archival publication, a descriptive list of documents. The verb to calendar means to compile or edit such a list. The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.
The term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind. Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has only an indirect relationship to a table of dates.
