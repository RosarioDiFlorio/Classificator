AISDALSLove stands for Attention, Interest, Search, Desire, Action, Like/dislike, Share, and Love/hate, is a hierarchy of effects model in advertising  adapted from AIDA’s hierarchy of effects model (Lewis, 1900; Strong, 1925) which has been used by many researchers, both academicians and practitioners, to measure the effect of an advertisement. This concept of AISDALSLove model was introduced by Bambang Sukma Wijaya in the International Seminar on Scientific Issues and Trends (ISSIT) in 2011 and published in the International Research Journal of Business Studies (IRJBS) in 2012, titled "The Development of Hierarchy of Effects Model in Advertising".
The hierarchy of effects model AISDALSLove can be described as ‘A’ for Attention (the stage where the consumer audience firstly pay attention to the ad), ‘I’ for Interest (stage at which the consumer audience then become interested in that ad), ‘S’ for Search (the stage where the consumer audience will seek for information about the message or the advertised brand, both internally and externally). ’D’ for Desire (the stage where the consumer audience have a passion towards the brand or product after getting information about the brand or additional information regarding the advertising message), ’A’ for Action (stage at which the consumer audience take action in form of purchase of products or the election of a brand to satisfy his/ her desire), ’L’ for Like/ dislike (the stage where after experiencing a product or brand, the consumer audience will like or dislike towards that product). ’S’ for Share (this stage is a continuation from the previous stage, in which the consumer audience will express feelings of likes or dislikes by sharing their experience to other consumers directly or through media), and the last is ’Love’ for Love/hate (the stage when after feeling satisfied or not satisfied, the consumer audience share their experiences with others, and generate long-term feelings towards the product or brand, these feelings can be either love or hate).
