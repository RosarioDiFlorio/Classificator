The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven: A True Story is a best-selling 2010 Christian book that was purported to tell the story of Alex Malarkey's experiences in heaven after a traffic accident in 2004. It was published by Tyndale House Publishers in 2010 and lists Alex's father Kevin Malarkey as an author along with Alex, although Alex described it in November 2012 as "one of the most deceptive books ever." It was adapted into a TV movie in March 2010.
Alex forcefully disavowed the book in an open letter to Christian bookstores almost five years after it was published and more than a million copies were sold, describing his near-death experience as a fabrication. As a result, Tyndale House removed the book from print, and Christian bookstores removed it from their shelves.
Alex had suffered various injuries in the accident, including a severe spinal injury, severe neck injuries, and brain trauma, and he was left a quadriplegic.
