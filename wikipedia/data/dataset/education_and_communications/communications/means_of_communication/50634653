Tracer (also known by her real name, Lena Oxton) is a player character appearing in the 2016 video game Overwatch, a Blizzard Entertainment–developed first-person shooter, and its related animated and literary media. Tracer is from the Overwatch universe, but she was introduced as a playable character in Blizzard's crossover multiplayer online battle arena game, Heroes of the Storm, in an April 2016 update.
The character, who is of British origin, has been noted by video game outlets to be a peppy and energetic character. In game, Tracer is highly mobile, but weak in terms of health. She makes use of her speed through her teleportation and time traveling abilities. Those abilities were caused by an in-universe accident, which left her unable to maintain a physical form in the present until Winston invented the chronal accelerator, a device allowing her to control her physical form.
Tracer is one of the more recognizable Overwatch characters, having prominent roles in the game's official media, including promotional works and the game's cover art, as well as fan art. Her profile rose even more when the character was given additional media attention through online controversies—one surrounding one of her victory poses, and another surrounding her prominence in fan-produced pornography that Blizzard has made efforts to remove. Apart from the video game, Tracer has also made appearances in related animated media, and the Overwatch digital comic series. In her comic debut, she was revealed as a lesbian, a depiction that was met with positive reception from media outlets and players alike.
