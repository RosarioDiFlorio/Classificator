Colleen Madigan (born January 22, 1964) is an American politician and social worker from Maine. Under the name Colleen Lachowicz, the Democrat from Waterville was elected to the Maine Senate from the 25th District. Her race attracted international attention when the Republican Party of Maine issued press releases condemning her for playing the online video game World of Warcraft, claiming her "disturbing alter-ego" and "time-consuming double life" made her unfit to hold public office. She was defeated for re-election two years later by Republican Scott Cyrway.
She returned to her maiden name, Colleen Madigan, in 2014 and was elected to the Maine House of Representatives's District 110 in 2016, winning with 2305 votes to 1661 for Republican Mark Andre. (Democratic incumbent Henry Beck was not a candidate for re-election, and Madigan was unopposed in the primary.)
