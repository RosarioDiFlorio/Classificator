Ross Andrew Parker (17 August 1984 â€“ 21 September 2001), from Peterborough, England, was a 17-year-old White English male murdered in an unprovoked racially motivated crime. He bled to death after being stabbed, beaten with a hammer, and repeatedly kicked by a gang of British Pakistani youths. The incident occurred in Millfield, Peterborough, ten days after the September 11 attacks.
In December 2002, Shaied Nazir, Ahmed Ali Awan, and Sarfraz Ali were all, unanimously, found guilty of Parker's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, each receiving minimum terms ranging from 16 to 18 years. A fourth defendant, Zairaff Mahrad, was cleared of murder and manslaughter.
A memorial plaque for Parker is located in the Netherton area of Peterborough where a football match is played each year in his memory.
