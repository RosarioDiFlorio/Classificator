"Only" is a song by American rapper and singer Nicki Minaj, from her third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014). It was released on October 28, 2014 by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records as the third single from the album. It features additional rap vocals from hip hop artists Drake and Lil Wayne, and also features Chris Brown who sings the chorus of the song. The artists co-wrote the song with its producers, Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and JMIKE, with production assistance from HBM and Rock City. "Only" is a hip-hop song that contains an "icy" production that sits "ominously" underneath dirty lyrical metaphors.
"Only" peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, giving Minaj her fourth number one on the latter chart and making her the only female rap artist to do so. The song was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 58th Grammy Awards.
The song was supported with the release of both a lyric video and an official video. The lyric video was released in November 2014, premiering close to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, with visualizations inspired by the Nazi Regime and the work of Leni Riefenstahl. There was immediate backlash from fans, calling the video anti-semitic and insensitive, although Minaj stated she was not involved in the production of the lyric video and said she regrets not overseeing it before it was posted to YouTube. The song accompanying music video was released the following month and was directed by Hannah Lux Davis; it premiered on December 12, 2014.
