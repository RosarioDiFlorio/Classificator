"All Lives Matter" (#AllLivesMatter) is a slogan that has come to be associated with criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. Some supporters use the slogan as part of a claim that the Black Lives Matter campaign overlooks the importance of other kinds of people, including but not limited to, police officers, who also die due to violence.
All Lives Matter became a larger talking point in the 2016 United States presidential election. During the October 2015 Democratic presidential debate candidates were asked the question "Do all lives matter, or do black lives matter?" All three candidates were careful to avoid using the phrase "All Lives Matter" in their responses and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley apologized for using the alternative "all lives matter" slogan in an earlier campaign stop. The change in discourse away from "All Lives Matter" came after criticism from Black Lives Matter supporters and protests during campaign stops.
