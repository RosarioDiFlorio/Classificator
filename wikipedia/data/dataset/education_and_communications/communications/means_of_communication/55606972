Various publications and commentators offer a range of predictions of Wikipedia's end. Scenarios include the poor quality of Wikipedia's articles preventing the site from functioning, people being unwilling to read or edit its pages, another website killing Wikipedia, and narratives of how disagreements between critics and Wikipedia's moderators will somehow lead to the disbanding of Wikipedia as a project.
Some predictions present a criticism of Wikipedia as exposing a fatal flaw. Some predict that another website will do that Wikipedia does, but without that fatal flaw, thus making it a Wikipedia killer capturing the attention and resources which Wikipedia currently gets. Proposed examples have included Google's since-closed Knol, Wolfram Alpha, and AOL's Owl.
