Press videoconferencing is an international press conference using videoconferencing (a form of teleconference) over the Internet. Journalists can participate in an International press conference from anywhere without leaving their offices or their countries. They need only appear in front of a computer connected to the Internet via video link and ask their questions to the speaker by using a microphone to joint the discussion.
This concept was developed in October 2007 by WEBOconference, a videoconferencing service provider and the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA) to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on the subject of development and good governance.
