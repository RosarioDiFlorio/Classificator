Media & Citizenship Transnational Television Cultures Reshaping Political Identities in the European Union is a three year (2008–2011) research project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission.
This project studies the ways transnational media, in particular Arabic language television, reshape the political landscapes of citizenship in the European Union. It provides the first European wide empirical research on the use of Arabic-language television and its influence on integration in multicultural societies. After collecting data across 7 EU nations (Cyprus, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK), focus group studies explore how Arabic speakers themselves construct citizenship in the light of their media use, and their adopted national cultures.
The Media & Citizenship consortium is coordinated by the Utrecht University and consists of the University of Bielefeld, the London School of Economics, Örebro University and the Paris-Sorbonne University (Paris IV).
