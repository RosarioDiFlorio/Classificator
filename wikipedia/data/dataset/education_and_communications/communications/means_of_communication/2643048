In advertising and communication studies, mass media is transparent when:
there are many, often competing, sources of information
much is known about the method of information delivery
the funding of media production is publicly available
the insights and data that shows the full visibility of fraud, viewability and brand safety to a media agency, tech, or client based on a pre-post bid of the media buy
Full view into the media plan, publishers, inventory, audience, targeting methodology, pricing, and other perimeters
any sources, influences (including payments, favors, free products, etc.), or potential conflicts that may affect the end media products are disclosed and clearly marked.
Aspects of transparent media include open source documentation, open meetings, full view into media investment, financial disclosure statements, the freedom of information legislation, budgetary review, audit, peer review, etc.
