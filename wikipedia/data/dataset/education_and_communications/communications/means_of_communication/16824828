April Media (until 2009, Anti-CNN) is a website established by Rao Jin, who was a 23-year-old Chinese student at the time, in response to what he identified as "the lies and distortions of facts from the Western media" concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest and the People's Republic of China's national unity. The site states its purpose as "collect, classify, and exhibit the misbehavior of Western media". According to the website, the phrase "Anti-CNN" does not exclusively indicate its objection to the American company CNN, but also to many other Western media sources, including the BBC, Der Spiegel, la Repubblica, n-tv, Bild, Fox News and RTL. The website also states, "We are not against the western media, but against the lies and fabricated stories in the media. We are not against the western people, but against the prejudice from the western society."
Rebecca MacKinnon has described the site as an example of a "spontaneous product of [Chinese] nationalist commons".
