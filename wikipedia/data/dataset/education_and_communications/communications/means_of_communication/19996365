Brandon Emmett Crisp (January 18, 1993 â€“ c. October 13, 2008) was a teenage Canadian boy who disappeared on October 13, 2008, when he ran away from his home in Barrie, Ontario, Canada after his parents took away his Xbox 360 due to failing grades and excessive play of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He was last seen alive on a nearby trail.
His body was found at the base of a tree in an overgrown area on November 5, a few kilometres away, by a party of hunters. An autopsy determined that he likely died of injuries due to a fall from a tree.
