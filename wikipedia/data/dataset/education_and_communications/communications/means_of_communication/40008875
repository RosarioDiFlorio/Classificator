The Green Inferno is a 2013 American adventure horror film directed by Eli Roth. The film was inspired by and is a homage to Italian cannibal films of the late 1970s and early '80s "cannibal boom", including Cannibal Holocaust (1980), which features a film-within-a-film titled The Green Inferno. The film follows a group of activists who are forced to fight for survival when they are captured by a cannibalistic tribe.
