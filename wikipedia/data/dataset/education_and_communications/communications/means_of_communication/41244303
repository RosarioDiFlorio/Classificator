The Center for Intercultural Dialogue (CID) was established by the Council of Communication Associations (CCA) in March 2010. Intercultural dialogue occurs when members of different cultural groups, who hold conflicting opinions and assumptions, speak to one another in acknowledgment of those differences. As such, it forms "the heart of what we study when we study intercultural communication." The goal of the CID is double: to encourage research on intercultural dialogue, but to do so through bringing international scholars interested in the subject together in shared intercultural dialogues about their work. The CID is creating an international network, including both scholars and practitioners. The CID broadly represents scholars in the discipline of Communication, but has a specific mandate to directly serve those who are members of any member associations of CCA. As of 2016, these include:
American Journalism Historians Association
Association for Business Communication
Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication
Black College Communication Association
Broadcast Education Association
International Communication Association
National Association for Media Literacy Education
When CID was founded in 2010, two other associations were members:
Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication
National Communication Association
