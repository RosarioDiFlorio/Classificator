A publicist is a person whose job it is to generate and manage publicity for a company, brand, or public figure, especially a celebrity or for a work such as a book, film or album. Most top-level publicists work in private practice, handling multiple clients. The term "publicist" was coined by Columbia law professor Francis Lieber (1800â€“1872) to describe the public-like role of internationalists during the late nineteenth century.
