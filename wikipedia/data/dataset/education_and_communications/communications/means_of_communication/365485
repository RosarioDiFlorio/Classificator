A technical writer is a professional information communicator whose task it is to facilitate the transfer of information (knowledge) between two or more parties, through any medium that best facilities that information transfer and comprehension. Technical writers research and create information through a variety of delivery mediums (electronic, printed, audio-visual and even touch). Example types of information include online help, manuals, white papers, design specifications, project plans, software test plans etc. With the rise of e-learning, technical writers are increasingly becoming involved with creating online training material.
Kurt Vonnegut described technical writers as:

...trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writing. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to the reader.

Engineers, scientists, and other professionals may also be involved in technical writing (developmental editing, proofreading etc), but are more likely to employ professional technical writers to develop, edit and format material, and advise the best means of information delivery to their audiences.
