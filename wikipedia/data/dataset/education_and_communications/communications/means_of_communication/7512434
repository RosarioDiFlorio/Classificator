The Balen Report is a 20,000 word document written by the senior broadcasting journalist Malcolm Balen in 2004 after examining thousands of hours of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The report was commissioned by former BBC Director of News, Richard Sambrook, following persistent complaints from the public and the Israeli government of allegations of anti-Israel bias. It is a legal obligation for the Corporation to be impartial which is why this Report is so important. Eventually one year later Helen Boaden, Head of BBC News admitted this was "an editorial misjudgment".
