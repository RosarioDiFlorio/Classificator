The Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy occurred in response to a cartoon drawn by the cartoonist Mana Neyestani and published in the Iranian holiday-magazine Iran-e-jomee on 12 May 2006.
The cartoon describes nine methods of dealing with cockroaches by depicting a Persian-speaking child and a cockroach. During the first method, when the cockroach does not understand him, the child decides to talk to the cockroach in "cockroach language" using different forms of soosk (Persian word for cockroach). But the cockroach does not even understand its "own" language and replies by saying "Namana?" ("What?"). As namana is a word which originates in the Azerbaijani language, the cartoon has been interpreted by some as an insult to Iranian Azerbaijanis.
