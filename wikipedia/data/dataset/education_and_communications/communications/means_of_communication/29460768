Rotana Cinema is a free to air satellite television channel that is owned by Rotana Group network. It was launched in 2005, and broadcasts exclusively old and contemporary films in Arabic.
Rotana Cinema has the largest and richest Arabic movie library in the world; this channel broadcasts premium production films ranging from golden oldies to the latest blockbusters that have never been broadcast on TV, making it the first channel to use the direct -to-TV method by fast forwarding the period between a movie’s premier in theaters and the TV premier
Since 2005, Rotana Cinema has established itself as the Arab family’s very own cinema at home and is set to continue solidifying that position through its 1000+ films not yet seen on TV and its exclusive premiers. The channel airs more than 35 premier movies per year directly from the cinema to the television.
