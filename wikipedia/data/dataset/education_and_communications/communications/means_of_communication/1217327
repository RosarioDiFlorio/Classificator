A master of ceremonies, abbreviated M.C. or emcee, also called comp√®re and announcer, is the official host of a ceremony, a staged event or similar performance.
The term is earliest documented in the Catholic Church since the 5th century, where the Master of Ceremonies was and still is an official of the Papal Court responsible for the proper and smooth conduct of the elegant and elaborate rituals involving the Pope and the sacred liturgy.
The master of ceremonies sometimes also refers to the protocol officer during an official state function, especially in monarchies.
Today, the term (for a male or its female equivalent: Commere) often connotes a master of ceremonies who presents performers, speaks to the audience, entertains people, and generally keeps a contemporary event moving. As such, the term occurs in entertainment industry, including for television game show hosts, as well as in contemporary hip hop and electronic dance music culture, where MCs refer to rap artists or performers who perform vocals for their own original material.
In addition, the term also exists in various chivalric orders and fraternal orders.
