Black Christmas (abbreviated as Black X-Mas) is a 2006 American-Canadian slasher film written and directed by Glen Morgan and starring Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Oliver Hudson, Lacey Chabert, Kristen Cloke, and Andrea Martin. The film takes place several days before Christmas and tells the story of a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by the house's former inhabitants during a winter storm. It is a loose remake of the 1974 film of the same name. The film was produced by Morgan and James Wong through their production company Hard Eight Pictures, along with 2929 Productions and Hoban Segal Productions.
Director Glen Morgan signed on to write and direct the film after the release of his 2003 remake of Willard, and intended to expand on themes and ideas left either dormant or ambiguous in the original 1974 film. Morgan's script developed the introduction of an identifiable villain as well as an additional plot twist. The film was shot on location in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2005 on a budget of USD$9 million. The film was co-distributed by Dimension Films and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. According to director Morgan, he and producer Wong had numerous disputes with Dimension executives Bob and Harvey Weinstein regarding the tone of the script as well as the film's conclusion, which resulted in numerous re-writes and re-shoots.
In December 2006, upon anticipation of its release, the film garnered criticism from religious groups due to its depiction of graphic content in a holiday setting, as well as the distributor's decision to release the film on Christmas Day in the United States. The film opened in the United Kingdom on December 15, 2006, and, premiered in Los Angeles, California on December 19. Despite backlash from some religious organizations, the film received a wide theatrical release in North American theaters on Christmas Day 2006, and went on to gross $21 million internationally.
