God's Little Acre is a 1933 novel by Erskine Caldwell about a dysfunctional farming family in Georgia obsessed with sex and wealth. The novel's sexual themes were so controversial that the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice asked a New York state court to censor it. The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1958. Though controversial, the novel became an international best seller with over 10 million copies sold. God's Little Acre is Caldwell's most popular novel, though his reputation is often tied to Tobacco Road (novel) which was listed in the Modern Library 100 Best Novels.
