The Problem with Apu is a 2017 documentary film written by and starring comedian Hari Kondabolu, produced and directed by Michael Melamedoff. Kondobolu interviews celebrities of South Asian descent about the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon from the animated sitcom The Simpsons. When the show first aired in 1989, Apu was the only figure of South Asian heritage to appear regularly on mainstream American television. In The Problem with Apu, Kondabolu and his peers assert that Apu portrays negative stereotypes of South Asians that were picked up and parroted by non-Indian people in the form of racial microaggressions and slurs against people of Indian and South Asian heritage.
