The Zapple Doctrine was part of a specific provision of the Fairness Doctrine, an FCC policy which required broadcasters to present multiple viewpoints about controversial issues of public importance. The Fairness Doctrine of 1949 allowed station licensees to editorialize, provided that more than one perspective was included in their overall programming. This was a departure from prior policy under the Mayflower Doctrine, which did not allow any editorial content.
The Zapple Doctrine pertained to a particular sort of political speech situation, when a candidate or his supporters buy air time to support the candidate, or criticize his opponent, but the candidate himself does not actually appear in the broadcast.
