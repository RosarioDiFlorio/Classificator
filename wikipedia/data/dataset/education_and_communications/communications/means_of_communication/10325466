As such it was registered on 19 January 2017. In its revamped form the company provides content for its three television and radio channels.
From 1995 until its current name the television predecessor of the current broadcaster was named "National Television Company of Ukraine" (NTU; Ukrainian: Національна Телекомпанія України, Natsionalna Telekompaniya Ukrayiny). Radio Ukraine was its radio predecessor and a stand-alone company until it merged with NTU to be the first public broadcasting company of Ukraine.
Radio broadcasts in Ukraine, at the time part of the USSR, began in Kharkiv in 1924, and a nationwide radio network was initiated in 1928. (In the first years of the USSR Kharkiv was the capital of Ukraine, from December 1919 to January 1934, after which the capital relocated to Kiev.) In 1965 the first nationwide Ukrainian television channel Ukraiinske Telebachennia or UT (‘Ukrainian Television’) was established. (Ukraine was part of the USSR from 1920 until it declared its independence on 24 August 1991.)
