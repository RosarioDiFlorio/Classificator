If Americans Knew is a nonprofit organization that focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the foreign policy of the United States regarding the Middle East, offering analysis of American media coverage of these issues. The group's website declares its aim is to provide "what every American needs to know about Israel/Palestine." The site is generally critical of U.S. financial and military support of Israel. It has accused The New York Times and other mainstream news organizations of being biased against Palestinians.
In addition to the freelance journalist and founder Alison Weir, board members include Paul Findley, a former United States Representative and author of "They Dare to Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel's Lobby", and Andrew Killgore, a former ambassador of the United States to Qatar.
