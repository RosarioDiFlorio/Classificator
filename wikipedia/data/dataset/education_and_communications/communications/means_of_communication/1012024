Nekromantik (stylized as NEKRomantik) is a 1987 West German horror exploitation film co-written and directed by JÃ¶rg Buttgereit. It is known to be frequently controversial, banned in a number of countries, and has become a cult film over the years due to its transgressive subject matter (including necrophilia) and audacious imagery.
