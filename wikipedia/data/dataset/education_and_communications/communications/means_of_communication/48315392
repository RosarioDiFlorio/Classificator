News stories and features, whether in magazine writing or broadcast news, can be categorized in terms of article structures that define the order in which information is introduced to the story. Some writers deny consciously organizing articles according to specific structures, but may use them to describe the writing post hoc. Others recognize a style within a developing story and use it to develop the narrative. Still others may be required to pursue a specific style from the beginning by publisher guidelines.
