James Maybrick (25 October 1838 â€“ 11 May 1889) was a Liverpool cotton merchant. After his death, his wife, Florence Maybrick, was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The "Aigburth Poisoning" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the Atlantic.
More than a century after his death, Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper, through his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In 2017, Bruce Robinson and a team of researchers, who believe the diary to be genuine, found new evidence to support their claim, but it is still (currently) inconclusive. A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed upon the city of Austin, Texas, during 1884 and 1885, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.
