The 7D, which stands for December 7, is a special date in Argentina for the conflict between Fernández de Kirchner government and the media. Feeling that the Clarín newspaper was responsible for the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector and the defeat at the 2009 legislative elections, the government created a media law to force the Grupo Clarín to sell their media assets. Clarín deemed that specific articles of that law that ordered that were unconstitutional, and began a trial over them. Clarín was benefited by an injunction for the duration of the trial, and in 2012 the Court pointed that the injunction should not extend beyond December 7, requesting the judges to make a sentence. The actual events that should take place on December 7 became a huge controversy in Argentina.
