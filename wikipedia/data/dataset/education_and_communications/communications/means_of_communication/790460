Faces of Death II is the first sequel to the 1978 mondo film Faces of Death. Like its predecessor, the film was written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (as "Alan Black" and "Conan Le Cilaire" respectively). Schwartz puts in another cameo appearance, this time as the wounded criminal in front of the drug store. Dr. Francis B. Gr√∂ss (portrayed by Michael Carr) again narrates the proceedings.
This film focuses largely on stunt work gone wrong, as well as death in sports. Several scenes involve the attempt by Kenny Powers to jump a rocket-powered car over the Saint Lawrence River in Morrisburg, Ontario and land over one mile away in New York. Also featured nearly in its entirety is the 1980 boxing match between Johnny Owen and Lupe Pintor, with Owen being knocked out and later dying from the injuries sustained in the match.
