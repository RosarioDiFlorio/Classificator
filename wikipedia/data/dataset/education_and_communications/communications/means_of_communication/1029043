"The Lottery" is a short story by Shirley Jackson, written just months before its first publication, in the June 26, 1948, issue of The New Yorker. The story describes a fictional small town which observes an annual ritual known as "the lottery". It has been described as "one of the most famous short stories in the history of American literature".
The initially negative response to the story surprised both Jackson and The New Yorker. Readers cancelled subscriptions and sent hate mail throughout the summer. The Union of South Africa banned the story.
