An Averkey (AVerkey) is a device that is built by the AVerMedia Group that allows a user to simultaneously display their computer on a TV. Main components in this device are zoom, pan, and picture positioning. Cables used for this device are VGA in (from PC) and VGA out (to PC monitor) and S-Video (or RCA Composite video cable) out (to TV).
