Number 96 is a popular Australian television nightly soap opera/serial set in an small four-storey inner city apartment block at 96 Lindsay Street Paddington (actually Concur Street, Woollahra) hence the title. Creators Don Cash and Bill Harmon of the Cash Harmon Television production company, produced the series for what was then known as the 0-10 Network, (the predecessor of Network Ten) which had requested a Coronation Street-type soap opera serial, and specifically one that explored adult subjects. The premise, original story outlines, and the original characters were devised by David Sale, who also wrote the scripts for the first episodes and continued as script editor for much of the show's run.
The series proved to be a huge success, running nightly five nights a week at 8.30pm from 13 March 1972 until 11 August 1977. Number 96 was so popular it spawned a feature film adaptation, filmed in December 1973, which became one of the most profitable Australian movies ever made. Number 96 was known for its groundbreaking sex scenes and nudity and for its comedy characters. The series was the first in the world to feature an openly gay regular character.
