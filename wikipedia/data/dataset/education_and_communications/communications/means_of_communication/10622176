Fei hua qing han (simplified Chinese: 飞花轻寒; traditional Chinese: 飛花輕寒) is an apocryphal poem falsely attributed to Li Bai, an influential 8th-century Chinese poet. The poem had raised eyebrows in the Chinese Internet community when some people deciphered a hidden message in it that says "Go to hell Japan, Koizumi must die" (日本去死, 小泉定亡). It was later revealed that the poem was written around 2003 to 2004.
"Fei hua qing han" roughly means "a cold and flying chain of flowers".
