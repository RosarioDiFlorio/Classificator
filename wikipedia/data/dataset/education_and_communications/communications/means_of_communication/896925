Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism is a 2004 documentary film by filmmaker Robert Greenwald about Fox News Channel and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, promotion of right-wing views. The film says this bias belies the channel's motto of being "Fair and Balanced".
The documentary had a limited theatrical release, was distributed in DVD format by the Political action committee MoveOn.org, and was sold online through Internet retailers such as Amazon.com. MoveOn.org had helped promote the DVD release by taking out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times.
Following the release of Outfoxed, Greenwald and Brave New Films produced a related series of anti-Fox viral videos, collectively entitled Fox Attacks.
In an interview, Greenwald stated that his goal in making the film: "What we set out to do was to show that, in fact, the entire Fox News was not a news organization. The goal was not just to change that narrative but to change the impact that Fox News often had on legitimate journalists."
