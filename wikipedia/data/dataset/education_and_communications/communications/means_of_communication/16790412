"Man's Best Friend" is an episode that was meant for Nickelodeon's 2nd season of The Ren & Stimpy Show, but it never aired in the original run of the series. However, it was aired later on Spike TV as the pilot of Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon". In this episode, Ren and Stimpy are adopted by George Liquor, who wants to make them champions.
The episode was deemed controversial for the violent scene where Ren beats George with an oar and even tobacco references. In order to make the show "family-oriented," Nickelodeon—who didn't like the episode or the scene—fired series creator John Kricfalusi and his production company Spümcø.
