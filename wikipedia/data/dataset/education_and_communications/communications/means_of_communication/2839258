The Burning is a 1981 slasher film directed by Tony Maylam and written by Peter Lawrence and Bob Weinstein. It is based on an original story by Maylam, Harvey Weinstein, and Brad Grey, with a musical score by Rick Wakeman of the progressive rock band Yes. The film is loosely based on the upstate New York urban legend of Cropsey, a tale that became popular at summer camps in the 1960s and '70s. In the film, a summer camp caretaker named Cropsy who was horribly disfigured from a prank gone wrong is released from the hospital with severe deformities and seeks revenge with garden shears on those he holds responsible, starting with the kids at a nearby summer camp. Lou David stars as the maniacal Cropsy, while Brian Matthews plays the heroic camp counselor that must stop him.
Made at the height of the low-budget slasher-film craze fueled by the success of Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980) in the early 1980s, the film has become notable for being the first release from Miramax Films. Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who in later years would head major companies such as The Weinstein Company, produced the film. The film is also the feature-film debut of Seinfeld's Jason Alexander as well as future Academy Award winners Fisher Stevens and Holly Hunter. Legendary make-up artist Tom Savini, notable for his work on Dawn of the Dead (1978), Maniac (1980), and the original Friday the 13th, created the effects for The Burning.
Theatrically released in the United States by Filmways in May 1981, the rights to The Burning were eventually transferred to Orion Pictures and later, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who currently own the film. While the film did not generate the interest and revenue achieved by other slasher films of the time, it has since became a cult classic and received critical acclaim, currently holding a 86% "fresh" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The film served as an inspiration for the Japanese horror video game Clock Tower.
