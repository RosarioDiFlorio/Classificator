The Center for Medical Progress (CMP) is an anti-abortion organization founded by David Daleiden in 2013.
CMP is best known for producing undercover recordings that prompted a controversy over Planned Parenthood in 2015. A biomedical research company, called Biomax Procurement Services, LLC which has been called a sham and fake company in the media was set up to provide cover for Daleiden and others to pose as buyers of fetal tissue, secretly recording the Planned Parenthood officials during meetings. The videos led anti-abortion politicians to request a criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood for allegedly profiting from the donation of fetal tissue. The full, unedited videos instead show Planned Parenthood requesting a reasonable fee to cover its costs, without any profit. However in December 2017 the United States Department of Justice revealed that it was investigating Planned Parenthood.
A grand jury in Harris County, Texas, took no action against Planned Parenthood and instead indicted Daleiden and a second CMP employee on felony charges of tampering with governmental records and attempting to purchase human organs. The charges were dropped six months later, but on March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in California â€“ one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy.
