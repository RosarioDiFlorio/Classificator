Battle Royale (バトル・ロワイアル, Batoru Rowaiaru) is a 2000 Japanese dystopian film adapted from the 1999 novel of the same name by Koushun Takami. It is the final film directed by Kinji Fukasaku, the screenplay written by his son Kenta, and stars Takeshi Kitano. The film takes place in a dystopian Japan and it follows the story of Shuya Nanahara, a high school student, and his classmates. Their class has been chosen by the government to take part in an annual game where all the students of the class must fight to the death until only one remains alive. The film aroused both domestic and international controversy and was either banned outright or deliberately excluded from distribution in several countries.
The film was first screened in Tokyo on more than 200 screens on December 16, 2000, with a R-15 rating, which is rarely used in Japan, and during the first weekend it grossed 212 million yen (US$1.8 million). It was also the highest grossing Japanese language film for six weeks after its initial release, and it was later released in 22 countries worldwide. It received global audience and critical acclaim and is often regarded as one of Fukasaku's best films. Fukasaku started working on a sequel, Battle Royale II: Requiem, but he died of prostate cancer on January 12, 2003 after shooting only one scene with Takeshi Kitano. His son, Kenta Fukasaku, completed the film in 2003 and dedicated it to his father.
