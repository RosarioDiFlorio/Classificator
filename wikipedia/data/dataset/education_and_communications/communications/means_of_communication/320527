Pink Flamingos is a 1972 American transgressive black comedy exploitation crime film directed, written, produced, filmed, and edited by John Waters. It is part of what Waters has labelled the "Trash Trilogy", which also includes Female Trouble (1974) and Desperate Living (1977). The film stars the countercultural drag queen Divine as a criminal living under the name of Babs Johnson, "the filthiest person alive". While living in a trailer with Edie (Edith Massey) and Crackers (Danny Mills)—her mother and son respectively—and companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), Divine is confronted by the Marbles (David Lochary and Mink Stole), a couple of criminals envious of her reputation. The characters engage in several grotesque, bizarre and explicitly crude situations.
Displaying the tagline "An exercise in poor taste", Pink Flamingos is notorious for its "outrageousness", nudity, profanity, and "pursuit of frivolity, scatology, sensationology [sic] and skewed epistemology." As it features a "number of increasingly revolting scenes" that centre on exhibitionism, voyeurism, sodomy, masturbation, gluttony, vomiting, rape, incest, murder, cannibalism and foot fetishism, the film is considered a preliminary exponent of abject art. The film has received a warm reception from film critics and the LGBT community, and has become a cult film.
