A protective distribution system (PDS), also called protected distribution system, is a US government term for wireline or fiber-optics telecommunication system that includes terminals and adequate acoustical, electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of classified information. At one time these systems were called "approved circuits".
A complete protected distribution system includes the subscriber and terminal equipment and the interconnecting lines.
