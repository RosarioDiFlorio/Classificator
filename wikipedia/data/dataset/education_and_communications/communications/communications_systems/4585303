The INOC-DBA (Inter-Network Operations Center Dial-By-ASN) hotline phone system is a global voice telephony network deployed and managed by Packet Clearing House that connects the network operations centers and security incident response teams of critical Internet infrastructure providers such as backbone carriers, Internet service providers, and Internet exchanges as well as critical individuals within the policy, regulatory, Internet governance, security and vendor communities.
INOC-DBA is a closed system, ensuring secure and authenticated communications, and uses a combination of redundant directory services and direct peer-to-peer communications between stations to create a resilient, high-survivability network. It carries both routine operational traffic and emergency-response traffic. The INOC-DBA network uses IETF-standard SIP Voice over IP protocols to ensure interoperability between the thousands of users and dozens of different station and switch devices. INOC-DBA was the first telephone network of any kind to provide service on all seven continents.
