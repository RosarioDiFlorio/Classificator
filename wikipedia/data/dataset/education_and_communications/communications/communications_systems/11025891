BI/TAS stands for Bill Inquiry/Toll Adjustment System. It was a client/server application in use to create adjustments for disputed long-distance telephone toll calls. It was written for Commonwealth Telephone of Pennsylvania by Alltel Information Services. With the acquisition of Commonwealth Telephone by Frontier Communications, the application will be retired in favour of an alternative method.
