The yottabit is a multiple of the unit bit for digital information or computer storage. The prefix yotta (symbol Y) is defined in the International System of Units (SI) as a multiplier of 1024 (1 septillion, short scale), and therefore
1 yottabit = 1024bits = 1000000000000000000000000bits = 1000 zettabits.
The yottabit has the unit symbol Ybit or Yb.
The yottabit is closely related to the yobibit, a unit multiple derived from the binary prefix yobi of the same order of magnitude, which is equal to 280bits = 1208925819614629174706176bits, or approximately 21% larger than the yottabit.
