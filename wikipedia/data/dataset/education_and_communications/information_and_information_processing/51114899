Information Oriented Software Development is a software development methodology focused on working with information inside a computer program as opposed to working with just data. A significant difference exists between data and information. Information Oriented Software Development relies on data structures specifically designed to hold information, and relies on frameworks that support those data structures. Information oriented software development focuses on the conceptual needs of users and customers rather than the data storage models and object models.
