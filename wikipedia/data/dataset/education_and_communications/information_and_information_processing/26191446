A Guide to Window-Dressing (sometimes stylised as A Guide to Window Dressing or A guide to window-dressing) is an illustrated anonymous publication and handbook on the subject of window-dressing first printed in London in 1883. It is one of the earliest known books printed on the topic specifically, providing detailed instructions and guidelines on window-dressing, drapery and display windows for the use of professional retailers and privately owned homes.
Through its descriptions of virtual topics in business, marketing techniques associated with window product display, and the use of windows as fashionable parts of residential spaces, the book is considered a seminal work on minute advertising procedures and home decor techniques exercised in late-19th-century Europe.
Through a lack of general reprinting, the work is considered extremely rare. As of February 2010, WorldCat.org displays only one result for the book in worldwide public libraries â€“ the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library in Buffalo, New York in the United States. A reprinted version was published in 2008 by the rare and out-of-print book publisher Kessinger Publishing under ISBN 1-4367-3078-3.
The first edition of A Guide to Window-Dressing is designated with the OCLC number 39203562.
