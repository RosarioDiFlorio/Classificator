In the United Kingdom, government policy requires that staff undergo security vetting in order to gain access to government information. There are several levels of vetting which are related to the impact level of the information; "BPSS" is the baseline for all civil servants, but those with access to secret information may be subject to stricter vetting.
Vetting is intended to assure government bodies that the individual has not been involved in espionage, terrorism, sabotage or actions intended to overthrow or undermine Parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means. It also assures the department that the individual has not been a member of, or associated with, any organisation which has advocated such activities or has demonstrated a lack of reliability through dishonesty, lack of integrity or behaviour. Finally the process assures the department that the individual will not be subject to pressure or improper influence through past behaviour or personal circumstances.
