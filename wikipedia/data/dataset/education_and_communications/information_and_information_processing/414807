The pebibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. It is a member of the set of units with binary prefixes defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Its unit symbol is PiB.
The prefix pebi (symbol Pi) represents multiplication by 10245, therefore:
1 pebibyte = 250 bytes = 1125899906842624bytes = 1024 tebibytes
The pebibyte is closely related to the petabyte (PB), its corresponding unit in the decimal set of multiples defined in the International System of Units (SI), and which represents 1015 bytes = 1000000000000000bytes. It follows that one pebibyte (1 PiB) is approximately equal to 1.13 PB.
One pebibyte (1 PiB) is equal to eight pebibits (8 Pibit).
One thousand and twenty-four pebibytes (1024 PiB) is equal to one exbibyte (1 EiB).
