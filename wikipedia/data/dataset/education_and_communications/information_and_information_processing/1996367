The following table lists the various Web Template Engines used in Web template systems and a brief rundown of their features. The content here is a work in progress.
LEGEND:
Engine (implementation) = engine name
Languages = implementation language of the engine (not the template script language)
License = Software license agreement
Platform = Computing platform
Variables = script language power to use variables
Functions = script language power to use functions
Includes = script language power include external files
Conditional inclusion = script language power to conditional includes
Looping = script language power to do loops (for, while) or recursion
Evaluation (language) = script language power to do "eval command" (to the implementation language)
Assignment = set names and references to sub-templates (?)
Errors and exceptions = engine output script errors.
i18n = Internationalization and localization feature
Natural templates = the template can be a document as valid as the final result, the engine syntax doesn't break the document's structure
Inheritance = Supports the ability to inherit a layout from a parent template, separately overriding arbitrary sections of the parent template's content.
