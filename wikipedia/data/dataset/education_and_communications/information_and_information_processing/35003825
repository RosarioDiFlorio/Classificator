Price of Weed (or priceofweed.com) is a user-generated database of marijuana prices. Users may submit prices and quantities for transactions and their location is geolocated in order to generate a price index for states and cities. While user-generated prices have no inherent check on accuracy, the criminal status of marijuana in many countries means a formal price index may be difficult to construct.
