A fact is a statement that is true or can be proved with evidence. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability â€” that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means).
