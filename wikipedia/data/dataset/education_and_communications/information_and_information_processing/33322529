The so-called Fojnica Armorial (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian Fojnički grbovnik/Фојнички грбовник, also known as Ilirski grbovnik "Illyrian armorial") is an early modern roll of arms including heraldry of South Slavic history. The manuscript is named after the Franciscan monastery in Fojnica where it was kept.
