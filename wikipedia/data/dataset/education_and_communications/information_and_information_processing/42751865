DYP, (also known as ‘Digital Yearbook Page’), is an IOS social discovery app that facilitates interaction between mutually interested classmates.  It differs from other social networks and anonymous sharing apps in that it is primarily for reconnecting with former classmates using their yearbook photos.Classmates are kept exclusive to each other, with limited access to other school years.
