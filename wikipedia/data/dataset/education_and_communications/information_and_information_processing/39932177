In graph theory, the Shannon capacity of a graph is a graph invariant defined from the number of independent sets of strong graph products. It measures the Shannon capacity of a communications channel defined from the graph, and is upper bounded by the Lov√°sz number, which can be computed in polynomial time. However, the computational complexity of the Shannon capacity itself remains unknown.
