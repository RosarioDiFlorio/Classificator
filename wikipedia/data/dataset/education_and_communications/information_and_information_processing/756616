The mebibit is a multiple of the bit, a unit of information, prefixed by the standards-based multiplier "mebi" (symbol Mi), a binary prefix meaning 220. The unit symbol of the mebibit is Mibit.
1 mebibit = 220 bits = 1048576bits = 1024 kibibits
This unit is most useful for measuring RAM and ROM chip capacity.
The mebibit is closely related to the megabit which equals 106 bits = 1,000,000 bits.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, video game manufacturers would sometimes report the amount of internal cartridge ROM (in megabits) on their packaging. 1 megabit equaled 128 kibibyte; 8 megabits were 1 mebibyte of ROM containing game instructions and data.
