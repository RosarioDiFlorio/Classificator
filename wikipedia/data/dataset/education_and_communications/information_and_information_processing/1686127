German Army Handbook 1939â€“1945, by W. J. K. Davies, is a small book covering the organization, equipment, and doctrine of the German Heer (and incidentally the Waffen-SS) in during World War II. Though brief, it includes a thorough collection of tables, diagrams, illustrations, and photographs, and is useful as a concise introduction to the nature of the Wehrmacht's ground forces of the period.
