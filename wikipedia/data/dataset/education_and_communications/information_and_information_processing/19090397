A webliography (from web and the suffix -graphy, from Ancient Greek verb γράφω gráphō, "to write") is a list of websites that pertain to a given topic. A webography is much like a bibliography, but is limited to a collection of online resources rather than books and academic journals. Research has been conducted comparing them to traditional bibliographies. In the early days of the internet, web link lists were important because search engines weren't as well-developed, and bookmarking links was essential in order to find a particular website again.
