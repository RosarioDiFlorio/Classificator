The Maroonbook is a system of legal citation that is intended to be simpler and more straightforward than the more widely used Bluebook. It was developed at the University of Chicago and is the citation system for the University of Chicago Law Review. As a simplified and modernized citation method, it tends to be closer to the Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities in its conventions.
