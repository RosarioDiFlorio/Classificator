The exabit is a multiple of the unit bit for digital information or computer storage. The prefix exa (symbol E) is defined in the International System of Units (SI) as a multiplier of 1018 (1 quintillion, short scale), and therefore
1 exabit = 1018bits = 1000000000000000000bits = 1000 petabits.
The exabit has the unit symbol Ebit or Eb.
The exabit is closely related to the exbibit, a unit multiple derived from the binary prefix exbi of the same order of magnitude, which is equal to 260bits = 1152921504606846976bits, or approximately 15% larger than the exabit.
