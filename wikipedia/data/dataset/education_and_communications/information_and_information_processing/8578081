The Complete UK Hit Singles is a book that lists every single to have made it into the UK Singles Chart since its inception in 1952. As well as providing chart data on each of the hits, the book also provides a brief biography on each hit maker, together with facts and trivia about each hit, such as whether it qualified for a BPI sales award, was featured in a film or contains a sample of another track. The book was written by Graham Betts and is the companion volume to Complete UK Hit Albums.
