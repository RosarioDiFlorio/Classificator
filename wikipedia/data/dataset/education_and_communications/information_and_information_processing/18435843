John Bateman (1839–1910) published in 1883 the fourth edition of his 1876 The Acre-Ocracy of England retitled The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland, A list of all owners of Three thousand acres and upwards, worth £3,000 a year; Also, one thousand three hundred owners of Two thousand acres and upwards, in England, Scotland, Ireland, & Wales, their acreage and income from Land, Culled from 'THE MODERN DOMESDAY BOOK, under the Harrison imprint. His source for the data was the government produced survey Return of Owners of Land, 1873, often known as the Modern Domesday Book, the many errors in which he revised and corrected. The preface to his work sets out many of the criticisms of the original 1873 Return and identifies some of the commonest errors contained in it.
This was republished in 1971 by the Leicester University Press, New York. It used text from the 1883 edition (the fourth and last), and had an introduction by David Spring.
