The Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands is a description of the plants discovered in those islands during the Ross expedition written by Joseph Dalton Hooker and published by Reeve Brothers in London between 1843 and 1845. Hooker sailed on HMS Erebus as assistant surgeon. It was the first in a series of four Floras in the Flora Antarctica, the others being the Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc (1845–1847), the Flora Novae-Zelandiae (1851–53), and the Flora Tasmaniae (1853–59). They were "splendidly" illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch.
The larger part of the plant specimens collected during the Ross expedition are now part of the Kew Herbarium.
