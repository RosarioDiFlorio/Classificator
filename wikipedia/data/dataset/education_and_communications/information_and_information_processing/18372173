An information diagram is a type of Venn diagram used in information theory to illustrate relationships among Shannon's basic measures of information: entropy, joint entropy, conditional entropy and mutual information. Information diagrams are a useful pedagogical tool for teaching and learning about these basic measures of information, but using such diagrams carries some non-trivial implications. For example, Shannon's entropy in the context of an information diagram must be taken as a signed measure. (See the article Information theory and measure theory for more information.)
