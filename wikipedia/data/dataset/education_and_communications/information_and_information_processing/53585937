Quantum coin flipping uses the principles of quantum mechanics to encrypt messages for secure communication. Unlike in other types of quantum cryptography, quantum coin flipping is a protocol used between two users who do not trust each other. Since the players do not trust each other, they both want to win the coin toss and, thus, they will try to cheat in various ways.
Quantum coin flipping and other types of quantum cryptography communicate information through the transmission of qubits. The accepting player does not know the information in the qubit until he performs a measurement. The security of quantum cryptography is in the qubits. In each of the qubits, information is carried by a single photon. Once the receiving player measures the photon, it is altered and will not measure the same way again. The fact that a photon can only be read the same way once allows for an easy detection of any other party attempting to intercept the message.
Quantum coin flipping is a secure means of communicating in theory, but difficult to accomplish.
