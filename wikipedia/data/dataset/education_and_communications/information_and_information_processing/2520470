An Advanced Train Control System (ATCS) is a system of railroad equipment designed to ensure safety by monitoring locomotive and train locations, providing analysis and reporting, and automating track warrants and similar orders. ATCS specifications are published by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), and are designed to document the stated requirements of railroad operational and technical professionals concerning ATCS hardware and software.
