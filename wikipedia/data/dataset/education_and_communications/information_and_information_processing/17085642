The International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) was formed in London in 1984 as part of the British government's enterprise initiative, designed to make industry and business more competitive through the implementation of quality principles and practices. Over 30,000 auditors have been awarded professional certification since 1984 and more than 120 countries are represented on the IRCA register.
