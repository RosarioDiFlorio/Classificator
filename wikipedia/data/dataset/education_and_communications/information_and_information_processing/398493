BRD (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ( listen) is an unofficial abbreviation for the Federal Republic of Germany commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the socialist government of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) to refer to West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany).
Unlike the English equivalent FRG, which was used as an IOC country code and a FIFA trigramme, the use of BRD was discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory communist term. The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany. After German reunification, the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (Deutschland), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished.
