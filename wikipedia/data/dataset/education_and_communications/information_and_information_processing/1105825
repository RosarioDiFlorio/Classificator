Purple Numbers is a suite of tools that allows one to address paragraphs of HTML content. It was originally conceived by Douglas Engelbart for his creation of hypertext. The name comes from the faint, purple numbers at the end of each paragraph, which represent the link to that paragraph. The name was coined by Christina Engelbart, Doug's daughter.
