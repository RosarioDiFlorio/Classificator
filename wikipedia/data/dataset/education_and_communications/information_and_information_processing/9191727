Readex, a division of NewsBank since 1984, publishes collections of primary source research materials. In the early 1940s, publisher Albert Boni, co-founder of the Modern Library, formed the Readex Microprint Corporation in New York City and Chester, Vermont. In 1955, the American Antiquarian Society invited Readex to publish in microprint Early American Imprints, Series I: Evans, 1639-1800. This partnership led to the publication of Early American Imprints, Series II: Shaw-Shoemaker, 1801-1819 and Early American Newspapers, Series 1, 1690-1876.
In the 2000s, these collections became available in searchable digital editions as part of the Web-based Archive of Americana, which also includes American Broadsides and Ephemera and other collections. More recent collections created in partnership with the American Antiquarian Society include The American Civil War Collection, 1860-1922; The American Slavery Collection, 1820-1922; and Caribbean Newspapers, 1718-1876. Also part of America’s Historical Imprints is American Pamphlets, Series 1, 1820-1922: From the New-York Historical Society. Further partnerships formed in the 2000s with the Library of Congress, Dartmouth College Library, University of Vermont Libraries, and the United States Senate Library led to publication of digital editions of the American State Papers and the United States Congressional Serial Set.
In 2006, Readex launched America's Historical Newspapers, which includes Early American Newspapers, Series 1 to 12, 1690-1922, and American Ethnic Newspapers. The latter includes Ethnic American Newspapers from the Balch Collection, 1799-1971, published in partnership with the Historical Society of Pennsylvania; Hispanic American Newspapers, 1808-1980, published in partnership with the University of Houston, and African American Newspapers, Series 1, 1827-1998, created from repositories including the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Kansas Historical Society, and African American Newspapers, Series 2, 1835-1956. Subject-specific newspaper collections include American Business: Agricultural Newspapers; American Business: Mercantile Newspapers; American Gazettes: Newspapers of Record; American Politics: Campaign Newspapers; and American Religion: Denominational Newspapers.
In 2007, Readex announced a Web-based edition of the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) Daily Reports, 1941-1996—the fundamental record of political and historical open source intelligence for the United States government. Also developed is a digital edition of Joint Publications Research Service (JPRS) Reports, 1957-1994. In 2008, Readex announced a partnership with the Center for Research Libraries to launch an online World Newspaper Archive. That collection now includes historical newspapers published in Africa, Latin America and South Asia between 1800 and 1922. Readex has created digital supplements to its Early American Imprints collections, featuring newly discovered materials from the Library Company of Philadelphia and the American Antiquarian Society.
Following the creation of African American Newspapers, Readex announced two major collections with a focus on African American history, literature, and culture. First, African American Periodicals, 1825-1995—drawn from holdings of the Wisconsin Historical Society—is based on James Danky's African-American Newspapers and Periodicals: A National Bibliography (Harvard, 1998). Second, Afro-Americana Imprints, 1535-1922, created from the Library Company of Philadelphia’s large collection, includes 12,000 books, pamphlets and broadsides. Available from the Afro-Americana Imprints collection are smaller collections titled African History and Culture, Black Authors, and Caribbean History and Culture.
