The United States Army Information Technology Agency (ITA) is one of the administrative service organizations aligned under the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army (OAA). OAA has three fundamental functions. The primary mission of the organization is to provide direct support to the Secretary of the Army and other Army political appointees. The second mission is to provide administrative support to the Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). The third mission is to provide base operations support to a diverse group of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) customers. OAA is organized into four major divisions: the U.S. Army Resources and Programs Agency (RPA), the U.S. Army Headquarters Services (AHS), the U.S. Army Information Technology Agency (ITA), and the U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH). These divisions support OAAâ€™s goal of providing excellence in service to the Army primarily in areas of IT, logistics, training, and human resources support.
