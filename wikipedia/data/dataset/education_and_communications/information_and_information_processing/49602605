The Flora of Fuegia, the Falkland Islands, etc. is a description of the plants discovered in New Zealand during the Ross expedition written by Joseph Dalton Hooker and published by Reeve Brothers in London between 1845 and 1847. Hooker sailed on HMS Erebus as assistant surgeon. It was the second in a series of four Floras in the Flora Antarctica, the others being the Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands (1843-1845), the Flora Novae-Zelandiae (1851–53), and the Flora Tasmaniae (1853–59). They were "splendidly" illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch.
The larger part of the plant specimens collected during the Ross expedition are now part of the Kew Herbarium.
