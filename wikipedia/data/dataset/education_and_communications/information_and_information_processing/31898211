Master of Business Systems (MBS) is a Postgraduate/Master's degree in Business Systems.
Business Systems programs combine Information Technology (IT) and Business/Management courses and are common in Australia.
Australian universities, like most in the UK education systems, pay more attention on how IT would help the business and financial process online, rather than how IT would be the product itself in conceptualization to be sold as most institutions do in South Korea, Japan and the US. However, for international students interested to enter IT, it would be a good choice of kick-start.
