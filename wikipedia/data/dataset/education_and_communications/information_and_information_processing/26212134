The Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (abbreviated as GW) is an ongoing project of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin to publish a union catalogue of incunabula. The Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke is available in part in print and in its entirety—in draft form—via an online database. The first volume of the print catalogue was published in 1925 (Leipzig: Anton Hiersemann) and the most recent volume was completed in 2009, extending to the entry Horem.
