The three-process view is a psychological term coined by Janet E. Davidson and Robert Sternberg.
According to this concept, there are three kinds of insight: selective-encoding, selective-comparison, and selective-combination.
Selective-encoding insight – Distinguishing what is important in a problem and what is irrelevant. (i.e. filter)Selective-comparison insight – Identifying information by finding a connection between acquired knowledge and experience.Selective-combination insight – Identifying a problem through understanding the different components and putting everything together.
