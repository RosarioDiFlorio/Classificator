Tonalli /to(ː)nalli/ (see also: Tonal) plays a multiplicity of roles; acting as a day sign, body part, and a symbol of the sun’s warmth. Ancient Nahuatl people believed that it was located in the hair and the fontanel area of one’s skull, and that the tonalli provided the “vigor and energy for growth and development”. It often overlaps with the force of teyolía which was often considered both an animating force (soul) and the physical heart in various Mesoamerican cultures.
