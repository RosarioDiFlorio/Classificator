Nuru Energy is an international social enterprise which is working to address the global problem of energy poverty and climate change in Africa and India. This is through the distribution of affordable LED lamps that are recharged using a simple to use human powered generator that is more efficient than current solar.
Nuru Energy's business model uses a unique distribution strategy to sell its products indirectly to rural customers through micro-franchise entrepreneurs who are equipped and trained by the company and financed through Kiva.
