The Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, signed in 2002, was the result of the first Japan-North Korea summit meeting. It was an attempt to resolve the uneasy diplomatic relationship that existed between the two nations, provided for economic assistance to North Korea (including humanitarian aid), low-interest long-term loans, and discussed the future of nuclear missile development.
North Korea agreed to extend its moratorium on missile tests, in place since 1999. However, this may have been breached. (See North Korea and weapons of mass destruction).
