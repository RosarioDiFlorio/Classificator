Chapelcross was a Magnox nuclear power plant located near Annan in Dumfries and Galloway in south west Scotland. It was the sister plant to the Calder Hall plant in Cumbria, England - both were commissioned and originally operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
The primary purpose of both plants was to produce weapons-grade plutonium for the UK's nuclear weapons programme, but they also generated electrical power for the National Grid.
