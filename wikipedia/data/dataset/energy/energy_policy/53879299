The YOG-83 was a gasoline barge built in January 1944 by the Concrete Ship Constructors of National City California for the Maritime Commission. It was in service as a gasoline barge in the Pacific before being moved and used during Nuclear weapon testing. The testing was part of Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll. It was three-hundred and seventy-five feet long with a displacement rated at 10,960 tons. It was noted that the barge had incurred slight damage from general use during its service as a gasoline barge but the damage was not significant and would not effect how the bomb testings would be rated.
