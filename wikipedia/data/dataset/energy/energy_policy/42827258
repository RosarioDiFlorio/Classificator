As of 2013, the Russian Federation is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas, producing an estimated more than 669 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, and the world's largest exporter, shipping an estimated 196 bcm a year.
The Russian Federation provides approximately about 25% of natural gas consumed in the European Union; approximately 80% of those exports travel through pipelines across Ukrainian soil prior to arriving in the EU. According to The World Factbook estimate, the country also has the largest proven reserves (48 trillion cubic meters [tcm]). OPEC figures also place Russia first, with an estimated 49 tcm, 24% of the world's proved reserves; however, BP estimates put Russia second behind Iran with 33 tcm. Additionally, Russia is likely to have the largest volume of undiscovered natural gas deposits, an additional 6.7 tcm, according to US Geological Survey estimations. Russia consumes approximately 457 bcm a year, second only to the United States.
