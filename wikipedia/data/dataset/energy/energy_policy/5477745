Sdot Micha (also known as Sdot HaElla; in Hebrew: שדות האלה) is an Israeli Air Force base located near Zekharia. It is believed that the base is a missile launch facility for nuclear-tipped Jericho 2 and probably Jericho 3 missiles.
It was established on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Al-Burayj.
