The European Nuclear Energy Tribunal (ENET) is an international tribunal, established 1 January 1960, that operates under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Its member states are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
The purpose of the tribunal is to hear cases concerning liability over nuclear accidents. Formerly it also had the role of hearing cases concerning the violation of the European regional nuclear safeguards system operated by the OECD but that jurisdiction was suspended in the 1970s due to its duplication of the IAEA and the Euratom systems.
The tribunal consists of seven judges appointed to five-year terms.
The judges appointed for the term of office commencing 24 May 2006 are: Dr. Peter Baumann (Austria), Ms. Mia Wouters (Belgium), Mr. Olivier Talevski (Denmark), Ms. Marie-Claire Guyader (France), Professor Armin von Bogdandy (Germany), Mr. Engelbertus Albertus [Bert] Maan (Netherlands) and Professor Vaughan Lowe (United Kingdom).
The President of the Tribunal is currently Professor Armin von Bogdandy.
The Registrar of the Tribunal is currently Ms. Julia Schwartz, Head of Legal Affairs at the NEA. The seat of the European Nuclear Energy Tribunal is in Paris, France, at the OECD offices.
In the over fifty years of its existence the tribunal has never been presented with a case.
