African Petroleum Producers Association, APPA (Association des pays africains producteurs de pétrole in French, Associação de Produtores de Petróleo Africanos in Portuguese and رابطة منتجي النفط الأفريقية in Arabic) is an organisation of African countries producing petroleum. It was founded in 1986. The headquarters of the organisation are in Brazzaville in the Congo.
The founding of APPA was spearheaded by Nigeria as an effort to mitigate the nation's dependency on Western technology and Western markets for oil export revenues. The objective of APPA was to promote cooperation in petrochemical research and technology.
