Sukhoy Nos () is a cape on Severny, the northern island of the archipelago Novaya Zemlya, belonging to Arkhangelsk Oblast of the Russian Federation, projecting into the Barents Sea. The site lies near the southwestern corner of the island, very close to the Matochkin Strait, which separates Severny from Yuzhny, the southern island of the archipelago.
The cape is composed of black and reddish shale. Off of its northern shore lie underwater sand bars. Numerous birds nest on the steep cliffs, particularly loons.
It was known for being a site of nuclear testing for the former USSR, being the third detonating site of three on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago (designated "Zone C"), as well as the most northern. It was used between 1958 and 1961 and was the 1961 explosion site of Tsar Bomba.
