One Less Nuclear Power Plant is the flagship energy policy launched in April 2012 by Seoul, the capital city of the Republic of Korea, in its broad effort to respond to climate change and energy crisis in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident and the nationwide rolling blackout in 2011.
The main target of the One Less Nuclear Power plant was to cut energy consumption by 2 million TOE, which is equivalent to the capacity of one nuclear power plant, mainly by directly engaging citizens in energy-saving and renewable energy generation. This target was exceeded in June 2014, six months ahead of schedule, as Seoul reduced the cityâ€™s energy consumption by 2.04 million TOE.
The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced the launch of the second phase of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant, Seoul Sustainable Energy Action Plan, in August 2014.
