The renovation of the nuclear weapon arsenal of the United States is the modernization, refurbishment and rebuilding of the nuclear arsenal of the United States of America.
Facilities for maintenance and refurbishment of U.S. nuclear weapons became dilapidated after the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The United States planned to spend about a trillion dollars over thirty years to rectify this shortfall, which some saw as a reversal from President Barack Obama's 2009 Prague speech that laid out his agenda for further nuclear disarmament, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set its Doomsday Clock closer to midnight to highlight this development.
