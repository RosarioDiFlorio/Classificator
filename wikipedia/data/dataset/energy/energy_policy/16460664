The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (新エネルギー・産業技術総合開発機構), or NEDO, is Japan's largest public management organization promoting research and development as well as deployment of industrial, energy and environmental technologies. In 2003, NEDO was reorganized as an Independent Administrative Agency. NEDO has approximately 1,000 personnel and domestic offices in Hokkaido, Kansai, and Kyushu and international offices in Washington D.C., Silicon Valley (California), Paris, Beijing, Bangkok, Jakarta and New Delhi. Its budget for fiscal year 2009 was 234,700,000,000 yen (approximately $2.6 billion), the vast majority of which was provided by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). Its head office is located just outside Tokyo in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture.
NEDO has a number of projects in the United States, notably a smart grid and alternative energy project with two research laboratories in New Mexico, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In March 2010, NEDO and the laboratories signed agreements in which NEDO will fund a smart grid research facility at LANL and smart house demonstration projects in both Los Alamos and Albuquerque, New Mexico. NEDO is investing $30 million (U.S.) on the projects for a four-year period.
