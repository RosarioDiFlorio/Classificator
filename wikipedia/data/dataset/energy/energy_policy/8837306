The annual World Energy Outlook is the International Energy Agency's flagship publication, widely recognised as the most authoritative source for global energy projections and analysis. It represents the leading source for medium to long-term energy market projections, extensive statistics, analysis and advice for both governments and the energy business. It is produced by the Office of the Chief Economist, presently under the direction of Dr. Fatih Birol.
Using a Reference Scenario based on no change in current policies, it enables policy-makers to evaluate their current path. The WEO has also developed an alternative scenario that puts the global energy systems on a trajectory to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions in line with limiting the increase in temperature to 2Â°C.
