In computing, the term standby of death (also SOD) refers to a problem with some electronic devices where they cannot resume after entering standby. This usually requires the user to forcibly restart the device, typically resulting in the loss of any unsaved work. Although such problems have plagued standby-capable devices since their inception, the specific term "standby of death" is relatively new and uncommon.
