ML-1 was an experimental reactor built as part of the US Army Nuclear Power Program. Unlike the other seven reactors of this program, it did not use a steam turbine, but instead used a nitrogen coolant under several atmospheres of pressure to drive a closed-cycle gas turbine.
Though the concept of a nitrogen closed cycle gas turbine was strong, the design failed to live up to expectations, and was abandoned with the closure of ML-1 in 1965 after several major refits and with only a few hundred hours of testing completed in all. Similar concepts have been more recently proposed as part of the PBMR program as derivatives thereof.
