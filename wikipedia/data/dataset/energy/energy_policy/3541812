The Nuclear Liabilities Fund (formerly the Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund) is a fund of the UK Government to provide arrangements for funding certain long-term costs for the decommissioning of eight nuclear power stations formerly owned by British Energy, now EDF Energy. Responsibility for the Fund within government lies with the Shareholder Executive, on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
The Fund is incorporated as a limited company registered in Scotland and is owned by the Nuclear Trust. It consists of five trustees, three appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and two by the owners of the nuclear power stations, now EDF Energy. The trustees are also directors of the Fund as well as owning the ordinary share capital of the Fund.
