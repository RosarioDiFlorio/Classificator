The 12 megawatt (MW) Wyandot Solar Facility is a solar photovoltaic power plant completed in 2010, located in Salem Township, Wyandot County, Ohio. This system uses 159,200 panels spread over 83.9 acres (34.0 ha).
Juwi Solar developed the Wyandot Solar Facility and Vaughn Industries, based in Wyandot County, was the primary construction contractor. Most of the construction jobs created by the project went to Ohio residents. First Solar supplied the solar panels from their manufacturing plant in Perrysburg, Ohio.
On August 24, 2010, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland joined The Public Service Enterprise Group, Ohio State University President Dr. E. Gordon Gee, and other local leaders to open the solar facility.
