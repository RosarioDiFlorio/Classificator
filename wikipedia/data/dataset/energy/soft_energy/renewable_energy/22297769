The Renewable Energy Certificates Registry (REC-registry) is an internet-based registry system established by the Australian Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the Act), and maintained by the Clean Energy Regulator.
The REC-registry:
facilitates the creation, registration, transfer and surrender of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) and small-scale technology certificates (STCs),
tracks the ownership and status of all certificates,
provides access to the STC clearing house, and
maintains various public registers as required by the Act.
Prior to 1 January 2011, the primary mechanism in the renewable energy target (RET) was the renewable energy certificate (REC). From 1 January 2011 RECs were split into small-scale technology certificates (STCs) and large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). RECs are still used as a general term covering both STCs and LGCs.
All certificates must be created in the REC-registry before they can be bought, sold, traded or surrendered. Participants must hold an account and be registered as a REC-registry user to create, view or transfer certificates.
