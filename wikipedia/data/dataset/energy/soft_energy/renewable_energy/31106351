The Kahuku Wind Farm is a wind farm located above the hills of Kahuku, Hawaii, United States. It has a nameplate power generating capacity of 30 megawatts, enough to supply power to 7,700 homes. It began operation in early 2011. It was developed by Epplament Energy and First Wind. Kahuku Wind Farm is made up of 12 wind turbines.
The project includes a 15 MW energy storage battery system to ensure that power is available when wind speeds are low. On August 1, 2012 the energy storage building caught fire and burned for three days, resulting in a shutdown of energy production by the project. Later power generation resumed without the battery building.
