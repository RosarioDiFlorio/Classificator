The Ukujima Mega Solar Plant project in Japan would be one of the world's largest photovoltaic solar generating facilities at 480 MW(DC) (400 MW(AC)). It would be located on the island of Ukujima, off the west coast of Kyushu, and is in a developing stage. The plan suffered a setback in September 2014 when Kyushu Electric announced it would not buy any electricity from any new solar plants. In November 2015, it was announced that Kyushu Electric would allow 400 MW(AC) to be connected.
