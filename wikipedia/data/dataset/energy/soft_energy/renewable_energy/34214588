The 300 MW Sonoran Solar Project is a proposed solar energy project in the Sonoran Desert, within Maricopa County, Arizona. 
It is a photovoltaic solar power plant, planned by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar of the Obama administration granted approval for the project in December 2011. It would be the first solar project in Arizona to be built on federally owned land.
