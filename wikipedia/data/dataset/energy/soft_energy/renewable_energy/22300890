Discotic liquid crystals are mesophases formed from disc-shaped molecules known as "discotic mesogens". These phases are often also referred to as columnar phases. Discotic mesogens are typically composed of an aromatic core surrounded by flexible alkyl chains. The aromatic cores allow charge transfer in the stacking direction through the Ï€ conjugate systems. The charge transfer allows the discotic liquid crystals to be electrically semiconductive along the stacking direction. Applications have been focusing on using these systems in photovoltaic devices, organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and molecular wires. Discotics have also been suggested for use in compensation films, for LCD displays.
