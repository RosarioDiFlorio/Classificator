Christopher Hills (April 9, 1926 â€“ January 31, 1997) was an English-born author, philosopher, and scientist, popularly described as the "Father of Spirulina" for popularizing spirulina cyanobacteria as a food supplement. He also wrote 30 books on consciousness, meditation, yoga and spiritual evolution, divining, world government, aquaculture, and personal health.
Hills was variously headlined by the press as a "Western Guru Scientist", "Natural Foods Pioneer", "Evolutionary Revolutionary" and a "Modern Merlin".
As a successful commodities trader and art patron in Jamaica, he retired from business at an early age to follow a spiritual quest that took him around the world as a speaker, author, entrepreneur and pioneer of algae as one of the most efficient sources of food and fuel for humanity.
