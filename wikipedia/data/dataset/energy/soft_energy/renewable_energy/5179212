Crookwell Wind Farm, located at Crookwell west of Goulburn, New South Wales, consists of eight 600 kW wind turbines giving a total capacity of 4.8 MW. It was the first grid-connected wind farm in Australia when built by Pacific Power in 1998. It is now owned by Tilt Renewables.
The farm was the largest wind farm in Australia when built, with the energy produced bought and on-sold to customers by then energy retailer Great Southern Energy.
Phase two of the Crookwell Wind Farm, planned to have an installed capacity of 92 MW, is under construction since 2009.
