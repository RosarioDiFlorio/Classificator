Berkshire Hathaway Energy (previously known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company until 2014) is a holding company that is 90% owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire has owned a controlling stake since 1999.
Gregory E. Abel serves as president, chairman and CEO. David L. Sokol was CEO until 2008.
Until 2014, it was known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company from its root as MidAmerican Energy Company; it took on the name of its parent to reflect the diversity of its portfolio.
In July 2017, the company reached an agreement to acquire Oncor Electric Delivery Co for $9 billion, rescuing it from bankruptcy. Completion of that deal, which Berkshire expects in 4th quarter 2017, will require approval from the Bankruptcy court and the Public Utility Commission of Texas.
