A Solar backpack is a backpack (a cloth sack carried on one's back and secured with two straps that go over the shoulders), equipped with thin film solar cells and batteries. The solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, which is stored in the batteries and can be used to power portable electronic appliances like mobile phones and mp3 players.
