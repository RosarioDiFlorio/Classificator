SymbioCity is the trademarked term for Sweden's approach to sustainable urban development. Established in 2008, the program's primary goal is to export Sweden's knowledge and experience with sustainable cities. It was created in order to assist Swedish environmental technology companies with their international marketing by creating a common trademark.
Gunnar Lund, Swedish ambassador to France, said in 2010, "The starting point for SymbioCity is the predicted growth of our population from six billion to nine billion in the next two decades".
SymbioCity aims to "get more for less", creating synergy by integrating different technologies and city functions. For example, waste can turn into energy, waste water can turn into fuel, and the excessive heat from an industry can warm up a household. According to the SymbioCity approach, environmental and economic gains result from unlocking synergies between urban systems. The seven building blocks of SymbioCity are: Architecture; Energy; Landscape Planning; Traffic & Transport; Waste Management; Urban Functions, Industry and Buildings; Water Supply and Sanitation. Several hundred Swedish consultants, contractors and system suppliers are connected to SymbioCity. SymbioCity is scalable, and adaptable to any climate.
SymbioCity as a trademark was launched in 2008, and is administered by the Swedish Trade Council. The name SymbioCity is a play on words, combining "symbiosis" and "city".
The 2008 Environmental Performance Index ranks Sweden third in the world.
