The Royd Moor Wind Farm is located at Penistone, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England, and consists of thirteen 500 kW turbines. The site is located approximately 6 km north west of Penistone, above the A628 trunk road between Barnsley and Manchester. The turbines are set in two parallel, staggered rows of six and seven, on a ridge in hilly fell land lying 320 m above sea level.
These turbines were completed in 1993 and are 35m in height to the hub and have a rotor diameter of 37m. The maximum output is 6.5 MW, equivalent to the annual energy required to power 3300 homes.
