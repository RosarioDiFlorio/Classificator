Acetogenesis is a process through which acetate is produced from CO2 and an electron source (e.g., H2, CO, formate, etc.) by anaerobic bacteria via the reductive acetyl-CoA or Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The different bacterial species that are capable of acetogenesis are collectively termed acetogens. Some acetogens can synthesize acetate autotrophically from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas.
