The Sahara Solar Breeder Project is a joint Japanese-Algerian universities plan to use the abundant solar energy and sand in the Sahara desert to build silicon manufacturing plants, and solar power plants, in a way that their products are used in a "breeding" manner to build more and more such plants. The project's declared goal is to provide 50% of the worldâ€™s electricity by 2050, using superconductors to deliver the power to distant locations.
The project was first proposed by Hideomi Koinuma from the Science Council of Japan, at the 2009 G8+5 Academies' Meeting in Rome.
