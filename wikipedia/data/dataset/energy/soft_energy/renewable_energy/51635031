3-Nitrooxypropanol, abbreviated 3NOP, is an organic compound with the formula HOCH2CH2CH2ONO2. It is the mononitrate ester of 1,3-propanediol. The compound is an inhibitor of the enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR). MCR catalyzes the final step in methanogenesis. When it is fed to ruminants, their methane production is diminished and they gain weight. Ruminants are some of the greatest contributors of methane, a significant greenhouse gas.
