The Kisigmánd Wind Farm is a wind power project in Komárom-Esztergom County, Hungary. It is owned and operated by Iberdrola Renovables, and has an output of up to 50 MW of power, which made it the largest wind farm by power generation in Hungary when it was built. It was Iberdrola's first wind farm in Hungary when it began operation in early 2009.
