Lori 1 Wind Farm is a wind farm located along the Bazum Mountains at Pushkin Pass in Lori, Armenia. It is the country's only wind farm. The wind farm consists of four 660-kW wind turbines and has a capacity of 2.64 MWe. Completed in December 2005 by the Iranian company Sunir with US$3.2 million funding from Iran, it is owned by the High-Voltage Electric Networks of Armenia. In 2006, the Lori 1 generated only 2.6 GWh of electricity (a yearly average of 296.8 KWeâ€”about 11% of installed capacity).

The Armenian and Iranian authorities have agreed to expand the wind farm up to 90 MW.
