Seaweed fuel or seaweed oil is an alternative to liquid fossil fuels that uses seaweed as its source of energy-rich oils. Like fossil fuel, seaweed fuel releases CO2 when burnt, but unlike fossil fuel, algae fuel and other biofuels only release CO2 recently removed from the atmosphere via photosynthesis as the seaweed or plant grew.
Unlike algae, seaweed does not require fresh water and can as such be grown in the sea.
