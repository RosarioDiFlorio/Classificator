The Tianshengqiao-I Dam (locally abbreviated as TSQ-I) is a concrete face rock-fill embankment dam and hydroelectric power station on the Nanpan River straddling the border between Guizhou and Guangxi, People's Republic of China, located in the counties of Anlong and Longlin. The dam is 178 m (584 ft) tall, and was completed in 1998. Water from the dam's reservoir powers four generators with Francis turbines, each with a capacity of 300 MW. Water released from the dam also powers Tianshengqiao-II Dam (TSQ-II) downstream. The power is transmitted to Guangzhou via HVDC Tian-Guang and an AC powerline.
