The SunSaluter is a technology that enables the automatic rotation of solar panels to follow the sun throughout the day to increase their energy generation. The technology was created by Eden Full and is being developed by her company Roseicollis Technologies.
The Roseicollis Technologies website claims that the SunSaluter is cheaper than existing solar panel technologies, and is also simple and flexible. According to the website, the SunSaluter has been deployed in two pilot projects in Kenya and will soon be deployed in Peru and India.
