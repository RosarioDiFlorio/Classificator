Marun Dam, also spelled Maroun, is a rock-fill embankment dam on the Marun River about 15 km (9.3 mi) north of Behbahan in Behbahan County, Khuzestan Province, Iran. The dam serves to provide water for irrigation and to generate hydroelectric power as well. Construction on the dam began in 1989 and it was completed in 1998. A smaller Marun-II regulator dam is planned downstream. The 150 MW power station was commissioned in 2004.
