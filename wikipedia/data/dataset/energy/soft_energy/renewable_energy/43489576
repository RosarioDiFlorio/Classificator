Founded in 2002, First Wind was an independent renewable energy company that develops and operates utility-scale power projects in the United States. It grew to employ more than 220 people across the country.
Headquartered in Boston, the company develops or operates renewable energy projects in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Utah, Idaho, Washington and Hawaii with a combined capacity of nearly 1,300 megawatts. In addition to renewable energy projects, the company developed and operates two generator leads.
First Wind began as a utility-scale wind power developer and operator, but in 2014 the company brought its first solar energy projects online.
In November 2014 First Wind was purchased by SunEdison and its yieldco TerraForm Power for $2.4 billion.
In February 2015, as part of the merger integration, First Wind CEO Paul Gaynor, who led the company since 2004, was appointed EVP Of North America Utility And Global Wind at SunEdison.
