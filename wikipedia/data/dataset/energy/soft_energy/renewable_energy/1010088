Total suspended solids (TSS) is the dry-weight of particles trapped by a filter. It is a water quality parameter used for example to assess the quality of wastewater after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant. It is listed as a conventional pollutant in the U.S. Clean Water Act.
TSS was previously called non-filterable residue (NFR), but was changed to TSS because of ambiguity in other scientific disciplines.
