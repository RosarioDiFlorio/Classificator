Thomas H. Stoner Jr. is an energy entrepreneur and writer. He has been a promoter of sustainable development for over 30 years, having built, financed, and owned and operated renewable energy projects throughout the Americas. He has led three companies in the clean technology space, including one of the original CleanTech venture funds backed by the international development banks, including the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), a division of the Inter-American Development Bank. In 2011, with the aid of David Schimel of the Jet Propulsion Lab (NASA) and other leading climate figures, Stoner founded Project Butterfly, a research organization that primarily advocates for the global capital markets as being a solution to climate change. In 2013, Stoner released “Small Change, Big Gains: Reflections of an Energy Entrepreneur,” which contains research about transforming the global energy supply to be more reliant upon sustainable fuel sources by the end of the century.
Stoner is currently the CEO of Entelligent, a provider of Smart Climate indices, predictive equity portfolio analytics, and advanced data.
