Phycotechnology is the applications of algae for manufacturing or service industries. It refers to the technological applications of micro and macro-algae.
It includes the uses of algae in the fields of agriculture, aquaculture, production of food, feed and value added materials, Energy, Healthcare, Environment, Genomics, Proteomics, Physiological Research, Nanobiotechnology, Bionanotechnology etc. The ecosystem service provided by DiazotrophicCyanobacteria(blue-green algae)by converting atmospheric (molecular) nitrogen into bioaccessible nitrogenous compounds, is an example for Natural Phycotechnology. Use of algae by indigenous populations for human benefits dates back to centuries. Species of Cyanobacteria like Nostoc, Arthrospira (Spirulina) and Aphanizomenonhad been used as a food for human survival during the early centuries. Microalgae are used as excellent food and feed due to their easy digestibility and nutrient content. Algae like Chlorella and Spirulina are used as SCP. Species of Dunaliella provide richest source of high quality products like glycerol, carotenoids,proteins etc. The algal-produced proteins showed biological activity comparable to the same proteins produced by traditional commercial techniques and therefore they can be the best biofactories for the production of therapeutic substances.
