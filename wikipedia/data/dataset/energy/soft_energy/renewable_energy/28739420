Sky footage (skf) is the total exposure of any area being considered for a solar panel installation. This includes roof installation or ground installation where the area is dedicated to the capturing of solar energy.
The term is also applied to the vertical volume that a structure occupies. The sky footage comes into consideration when building power lines, water towers, and radio antennas.
