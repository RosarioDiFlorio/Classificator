The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) was founded in 2000 by the European renewable energy industry, trade and research associations. EREC is located in the Renewable Energy House in Brussels, a monument protected building with 100% renewable energy supply for heating and cooling.
EREC acts as a representative in Brussels of the European Renewable industry and research community and acts as a forum for exchange of information and discussion on issues related to renewables. EREC provides information and consultancy on renewable energies for the political decision makers on local, regional, national and international levels.
In May 2014 the General Assembly of EREC decided for a voluntary dissolution which led to the liquidation of the association.
