The South African Solar Challenge is an alternative fuel vehicle auto racing challenge in South Africa, with classes for hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, solar vehicles, and biofuel-powered vehicles. The first challenge was run in 2008, and it will run every two years thereafter. The race distance is over 4,100 km (2,500 mi). The challenge route may change from year to year, but it is planned to run from Johannesburg to Cape Town to Durban and finish in Pretoria.
