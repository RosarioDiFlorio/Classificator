Langley Park Wind Farm is a wind farm near Langley Park, County Durham, England. It was developed by EDF Energy and is operated by Cumbria Wind Farms, the farm has a nameplate capacity of 8 MW, containing four REpower Systems' MM82 turbines each rated at 2.05MW.
In 2008 EDF accepted that it had failed to check the impact of the turbines on digital television reception, after residents of villages where the turbines lay on a line-of-site to the local TV transmitter complained of a loss of signal strength and severe Freeview Digital Services disruption, particularly when the turbine blades rotate.
