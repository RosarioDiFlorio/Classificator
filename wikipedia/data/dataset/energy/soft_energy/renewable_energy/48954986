Wind power in Uruguay generates a rapidly growing proportion of the country's electricity mix. Projections consider that, by the end of 2017, Uruguay will generate 38 percent of it total electricity from wind power sources.
Overall, the majority of Uruguayan electricity generation is derived from hydroelectric sources.
In 2016, the country’s total installed wind power capacity surpassed 1,000 MW. As of 2016, this figure comprised 17 percent of the country’s overall electricity generation, marking a sudden increase in the overall share from the 2 percent all alternative renewable energy sources made up in 2012.
The national government has supported this nascent but fast-moving wind power transformation by providing a policy environment of incentives like feed-in tariffs and utility-scale bidding. The former helped incentivize small-scale installations, while the latter enabled large-scale projects.
