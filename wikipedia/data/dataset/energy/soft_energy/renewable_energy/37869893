EnergyBus is an open standard for integration of and communication between electric components of light electric vehicles based on DC. It includes standards for both a communications and power distribution bus and a corresponding connector system. Data transmission is based on the CAN bus, specifically CANopen. EnergyBus is standardized through CAN in Automation in CiA-454.
The EnergyBus specification is published through the EnergyBus Association, based in Germany. Members are individuals, as well as manufacturers of components, vehicles, systems, and retailers. Members are from all over the world, and include Bosch, Panasonic, Sanyo, Deutsche Bahn, Philips, and VARTA.
One major goal of the EnergyBus effort is compatibility of charging equipment with different battery types and chemistries for E-Bikes, pedelecs and other light electric vehicles (LEVs).
