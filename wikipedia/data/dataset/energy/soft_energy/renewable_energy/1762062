Energy-Quest (formerly The Hydrogen Expedition) was an organization that sought to educate the public about the risks of an impending energy crisis due to the current worldwide dependence on fossil fuels and the benefits of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy sources. It intended to do so through a series of three record-setting ocean voyages:
The Earthrace
The Aurora Expedition
The Triton Expedition
Started and staffed by university students, the project was endorsed by several organizations and prominent individuals.
