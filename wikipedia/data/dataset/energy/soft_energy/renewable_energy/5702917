Windy Hill Wind Farm is a wind power station near Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, Australia. Windy Hill has 20 wind turbines with a generating capacity of 12 MW of electricity, providing enough power for about 3,500 homes. The cost of the project was A$20 million. It was the first wind farm to be constructed in Queensland and remains the state's largest.
The power station was commissioned in 2000 and was initially operated by the Stanwell Corporation. In December 2007 Windy Hill was sold to Transfield Services Infrastructure Fund (TSIF) as part of Queensland Government's ClimateSmart 2050 strategy. A new substation was built to allow the wind farm's power to connect to the existing 66 kV transmission line. RATCH-Australia Corporation bought TSIF in 2011.
