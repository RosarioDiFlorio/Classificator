This page lists large-scale rooftop photovoltaic installation projects. Photovoltaic arrays in buildings are often either integrated into them, or mounted on to their roofs. Arrays are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure. In 2010, more than four-fifths of the 9,000 MW of solar PV operating in Germany was installed on rooftops.
Most of the large-scale stations are not installed on the roofs, but rather integrated are ground-mounted. Most rooftop applications are done in small and medium-sized installations for consumption within the buildings that host the arrays. There are many significant installation projects which have been completed and many are under construction or proposed.
The following lists the rooftop photovoltaic installation projects that are larger than 1 MW in total installation size. It does not include rooftop installations of non-building structures such as detached carports and tunnels.
