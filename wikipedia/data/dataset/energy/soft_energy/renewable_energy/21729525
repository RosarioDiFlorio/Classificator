The Intuitive Technology and Bio-Architecture School (TIBÁ) is an eco-centre located in the coastal jungle of Brazil (Mata Atlântica), dedicated to demonstrating and teaching sustainable development and 'barefoot' construction techniques. It was founded in 1987 by Rose and Johan Van Lengen, author of the grassroots construction manual 'The Barefoot Architect'. This book has gained popularity worldwide through its advocation and detailed instruction on appropriate technology and natural building techniques for builders, architects and students. The bio-architecture school was established to provide a place in which students can share and learn these techniques hands-on.
The name TIBÁ comes from the Tupi language (Brazilian Amazonian tribe) meaning "A place where many people meet".
