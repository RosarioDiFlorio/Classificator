Amazon Wind Farm Texas is a proposed 253 Megawatt wind farm in Scurry County, West Texas Projected to be open in late 2017, the project will include over 100 turbines and generate 1,000,000 megawatt hours of wind energy annually, enough to power 90,000 typical US homes.
October 19, 2017, Amazon's Jeff Bezos christened the Amazon Wind Farm Texas by smashing a champagne bottle on top of one of the turbines standing more than 300-feet tall. In a statement, Amazon entered into an agreement to purchase 90 percent of the facility's output. The facility was built by Lincoln Clean Energy which also owns & operates the wind farm. This facility represents Amazon's long-term investments into renewable energy.
