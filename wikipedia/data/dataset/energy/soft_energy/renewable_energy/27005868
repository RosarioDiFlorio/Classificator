Sefidrud Dam (originally named Shahbanu Farah Dam and also known as the Manjil Dam) is a buttress dam on the Sefīd-Rūd in the Alborz mountain range, located near Manjil in Gilan Province, northern Iran.
It was constructed to store water for irrigation and produce hydroelectric power. The power station has an installed capacity of 87 MW. It is 106 m (348 ft) tall and forms a reservoir with a capacity of 1.82 km3 (1,475,498 acre·ft). Its structure contains 26 monoliths.
The Tarik Dam is located 35 km (22 mi) downstream and diverts releases from the Sefidrud Dam for irrigation.
The extremely destructive 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake occurred near the dam and caused portions of its concrete to crack. Repairs and mitigation efforts were undertaken in 1991.
