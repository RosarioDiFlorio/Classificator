Starfish Hill Wind Farm is a wind power station spread over two hills near Cape Jervis, South Australia. It has 23 wind turbines, eight on Starfish Hill itself and 15 on Salt Creek Hill, with a combined generating capacity of 34.5 MW of electricity.
Starfish Hill Wind Farm was commissioned in September 2003, making it the first major wind farm in the state.
Starfish Hill Wind Farm was developed by Starfish Hill Wind Farm Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tarong Energy at a cost of A$65 million. RATCH Australia (at that time Transfield Services) acquired the wind farm in December 2007.
