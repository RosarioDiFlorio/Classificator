Hitra Wind Farm is a 24 turbine wind farm located in the municipality of Hitra in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway and operated by Statkraft. The farm is located on top of the Elsfjellet plateau in the central part of the island of Hitra, just 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) south of the village of Straum and about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west of Sandstad. Until the expansion of the Smøla Wind Farm in 2005, Hitra was the largest wind farm in the country and had total cost of 450 million kr.
Each of the 24 wind turbines can produce 2.3 MW of power for a maximum generated power of 55 MW and an annual production of 150 GWh for the whole farm. The farm was opened on 14 October 2004.
The Fosen Vind 1 GW wind farm complex will include the nearby Hitra 2 wind farm.
