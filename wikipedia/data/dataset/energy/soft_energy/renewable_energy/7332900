Woolnorth Wind Farm is a wind power development, comprising two wind farms, at the Woolnorth property at Woolnorth (which includes the location known as Cape Grim), in the far north-west of Tasmania, Australia. Both wind farms are operated by Woolnorth Wind Farm Holdings, a joint venture between Hydro Tasmania (who own a 25% share) and Shenhua Group (75% share).
Bluff Point Wind Farm was constructed in two stages. The first consisted of six Vestas 1.75 MW (2,350 hp) turbines and was commissioned in 2002. Stage two, commissioned in 2004, expanded the wind farm with a further 31 of the same turbines, for a total generating capacity of 65 MW (87,000 hp).
Studland Bay Wind Farm was commissioned in 2007 and consists of 25 Vestas V90 3 MW (4,000 hp) turbines, for a total capacity of 75 MW (101,000 hp).
Tours to the wind farms are available and operated by a private commercial entity.
