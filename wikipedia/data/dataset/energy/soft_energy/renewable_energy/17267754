The Forward Wind Energy Center is a wind farm in Dodge and Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin near Brownsville, Wisconsin. The farm is planned to consist of 86 General Electric 1.5sle Wind turbines. There was significant controversy in selection of the location and delays in construction due to its proximity to Horicon National Wildlife Refuge just to the west of the site and an Air Route Surveillance Radar to the south as well as other issues. "Forward" is also the motto of the State of Wisconsin.
