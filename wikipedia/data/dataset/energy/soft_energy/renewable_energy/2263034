The American Solar Challenge (ASC), previously known as the North American Solar Challenge and Sunrayce, is a solar car race across the United States. In the race, teams from colleges and universities throughout North America design, build, test, and race solar-powered vehicles in a long distance road rally-style event. ASC is a test of teamwork, engineering skill, and endurance that stretches across thousands of miles of public roads.
ASC 2016 took place from July 30 â€“ August 6, on a 1,975 mile (3,178 km) route from Brecksville, Ohio to Hot Springs, South Dakota.
