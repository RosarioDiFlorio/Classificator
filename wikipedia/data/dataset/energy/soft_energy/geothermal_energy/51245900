Geothermal energy in Italy is little used, other than for power production (see main article Geothermal power in Italy), but growing.
Italy stays above a relative thin crust, with four large areas of underground heat:
the first is Tuscany, with the Larderello fields.
the second is in Campania, the Phlegraean Fields
the third, very large and little known, the south of Tyrrhenian Sea
the fourth is the Strait of Sicily, aroung the undersea Empedocles volcano and Lampedusa island
As a result, projects are in development in the coming years and more exploration is expected to find new locations.
