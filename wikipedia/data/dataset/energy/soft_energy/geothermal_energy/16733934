Geothermal energy is thermal energy which is derived from the earth's internal heat. Geothermal power in Turkey began in the 1970s in a prototype plant following systematic exploration of geothermal fields. In the 1980s, a first power plant has grown up out of the pilot facility.Turkey is ranked seventh richest country in the world in geothermal potential. The small-sized geothermal power plant was expanded to the country's biggest one in 2013. Currently, two power plants operate in Turkey. Its theoretical geothermal potential is 60GW  and potential is 4.5GW  In addition to electric power generation, geothermal heat is used directly.
