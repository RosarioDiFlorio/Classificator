The Ngawha geothermal field is a geothermal area in the North Island of New Zealand. It is situated approximately 5 km east of Kaikohe and is centred on the village of Ngawha Springs. The field covers an area of around 25 kmÂ² and as such, is much smaller than the only other geothermal field in New Zealand, the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The hot springs arising in this area are slightly acidic and are rich in ammonia, bicarbonate, boron and mercury, which is not typical of other springs in New Zealand.
