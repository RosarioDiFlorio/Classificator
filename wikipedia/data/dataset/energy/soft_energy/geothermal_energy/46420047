Geothermal energy in Lebanon is a branch of the energy industry, expanding quickly over the last several years. According to a UNDP assessment (CEDRO project), the geothermal energy available in Lebanon is 1,000 million megawatt hours (70 000 fold the amount of energy needed in Lebanon per year). The study includes a geothermal atlas for the country and estimates the current overall potential of geothermal heat and power generation.
