Thermal response test (TRT) is used to determine the thermal properties of the ground. There is no direct way to measure the ground thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance. These tests are vital for designing ground source heat pump and seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) systems. A TRT is an indirect (in-situ) measurement method which is the simplest and most exact way to determine the effective thermal properties, Gehlin 2002. Thermal Response Tests were first suggested by Mogensen (1983) at an international conference in Stockholm. Mogensen suggested a simple arrangement in which heat at constant power is injected into (or extracted from) a borehole while the borehole mean temperature is measured.
