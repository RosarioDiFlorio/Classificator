The Karkar Geothermal Power Plant (Karkar GTPP) (Armenian: Կարկառի երկրաջերմաէլեկտրակայան) is a proposed geothermal power plant to be constructed in Armenia. The plant will be the first of its kind in Armenia and will be situated at the Karkar site in the southernmost province of Armenia, Syunik. Initial studies envisage the construction of a 28-30 MW capacity geothermal power plant with an annual electric output of 250 million kilowatts (kW) according to data provided in 2016. The Karkar GTPP will allow for the production of heat to be used in the heating of greenhouses, residential buildings, and industrial sites. Commissioned in 2008-2009, the Karkar GTPP is a unique project in Armenia in that it does not possess an analogue in the region, and positively differs from other energy producing power plants in its renewability of resources, independence from imported energy sources, as well as its minimal environmental impact.
