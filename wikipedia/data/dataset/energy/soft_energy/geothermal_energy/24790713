Chile represents one of the largest undeveloped geothermal areas of the world. Despite Chile's good economic performance in the late 1980s and 1990s, geothermal energy did not develop, and Chile has been surpassed by other Latin American countries such as El Salvador and Costa Rica in terms of geothermal development and technology. Currently Chile does not produce any geothermal power.
The first geothermal explorations in Chile were carried out by Italians living in the city of Antofagasta in 1908 but it was not until 1968 that systematic exploration started in the north of the country. These later explorations occurred amidst a global wave of research and development of the geothermal power. The exploration were carried out after an agreement between the Government of Chile and United Nations Development Programme were state agency CORFO (Production Development Corporation) created a comit√© to direct and carry out exploration in the northern regions of Chile. These explorations did however end in 1976 when the military government headed by Pinochet withdrew Chile from the cooperation program.
High prices of oil, unreliability in gas imports from Argentina and a continuously growing electricity demand have led the Chilean governments to further promote new energy sources in the late 1990s and 2000s. New interest in geothermal energy resulted in 2000 in the promulgation of the Law of Geothermal Concessions that regulates exploitation and exploration of geothermal resources.
