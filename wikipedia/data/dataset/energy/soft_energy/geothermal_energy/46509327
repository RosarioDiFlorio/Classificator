The Pauzhetskaya power station is located in the south-western part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, 30 km 30 km east of Ozernovskij settlement, located on the coast of the Okhotsk Sea. The geothermal power plant was put into operation in 1966. The power plant has two 6 MW turbines of direct cycle and 2.5 MW binary turbine. The first steam turbine is designed for an inlet pressure of 1.2 bars and a steam flow rate of 24.2 kg/s. The second steam turbine is designed for an inlet pressure of 2.2 bars and a steam flow rate of 25.8 kg/s. The binary turbine is designed for a separated water flow rate of 118 kg/s at 120°C. Presently, one steam turbine is in operation, while the other steam turbine is a reserve.
The geothermal reservoir contains water with a temperature of about 190°C. Proven steam resources of the Pauzhetska field are 35.5 kg/s (steam-water mixture – 424.5 kg/s).This steam-water mixture is produced from 10 wells.
