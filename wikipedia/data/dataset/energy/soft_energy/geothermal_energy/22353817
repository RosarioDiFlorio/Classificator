Russia demonstrated the first single-flash binary cycle power plant at Pauzhetka in 1967 (now it's 15 MW (60 GWh\y)). Two new geothermal plants (one 12 MWe (53 GWh\y) and another 50 MWe (360 GWh\y)) on the north slope of Mutnovsky volcano in Kamchatka, presumably supplying power to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Other small plants are on Kuril Islands â€” 1,8 and 2,5 MWe. Potential resources include the Northern Caucasus, Western Siberia, Lake Baikal, and in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands.
