A binary cycle power plant is a type of geothermal power plant that allows cooler geothermal reservoirs to be used than is necessary for dry steam and flash steam plants. As of 2010, flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today, which use water at temperatures greater than 182 °C (455 K; 360 °F) that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface. With binary cycle geothermal power plants, pumps are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well, through a heat exchanger, and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir. A second "working" or "binary" fluid with a low boiling point, typically a butane or pentane hydrocarbon, is pumped at fairly high pressure (500 psi (3.4 MPa)) through the heat exchanger, where it is vaporized and then directed through a turbine. The vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air radiators or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger.
A binary vapor cycle is defined in thermodynamics as a power cycle that is a combination of two cycles, one in a high temperature region and the other in a lower temperature region.
