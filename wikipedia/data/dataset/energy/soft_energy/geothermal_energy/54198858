Puchuldiza is a geothermal field in the Tarapacá Region of Chile. It is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, close to the active volcano Isluga and several older volcanoes in the neighbourhood; the most recent activity from one of the neighbouring volcanoes was 900,000 ± 300,000 years ago. Geothermal features include geysers and hot springs. Puchuldiza has been inspected for the possibility that it may be suitable as a source for geothermal energy.
The towns of Los Baños de Puchuldiza and Tuja lie in the area, and the active volcano Isluga 27 kilometres (17 mi) northeast of Puchuldiza. Iquique is located 150 kilometres (93 mi) southwest from the field.
