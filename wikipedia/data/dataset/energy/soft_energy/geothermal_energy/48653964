Ground heat exchangers (GHEs), which are also called geothermal heat exchangers, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow geothermal energy, for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a foundation pile of a building, in which a circulating heat-carrying fluid absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground. GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and foundation pile GHEs. The borehole type is the most common. It consists of one or two U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom. The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater. The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment. In a foundation pile GHE (or energy pile), the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a foundation pile. There are various possible shapes. Foundation piles are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.
