Vortex power is a form of hydro power which generates energy by placing obstacles in rivers/oceans in order to cause the formation of vortices which can then be tapped to a usable form of energy such as electricity. This method is pioneered by a team at the University of Michigan who call the technology VIVACE which stands for Vortex Induced Vibrations Aquatic Clean Energy (patent pending through the University of Michigan).
The company Vortex Hydro Power has been created to commercialize the technology. This technology has 10â€“20 years life span which meets life cycle cost targets.
