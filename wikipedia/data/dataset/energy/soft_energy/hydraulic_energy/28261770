The gravitation water vortex power plant is a type of micro hydro power plant which is capable of producing energy using a low hydraulic head of 0.7–3 metres (2 ft 4 in–9 ft 10 in). The technology is based on a round basin with a central drain. Above the drain the water forms a stable line vortex which drives a water turbine.
It was first implemented by Austrian engineer Franz Zotlöterer while attempting to find a way to aerate water without an external power source.
