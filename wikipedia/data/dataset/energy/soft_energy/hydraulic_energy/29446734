A tidal barrage is a dam-like structure used to capture the energy from masses of water moving in and out of a bay or river due to tidal forces.
Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.
Tidal barrages are among the oldest methods of tidal power generation, with projects being developed as early as the 1960s, such as the 1.7 megawatt Kislaya Guba Tidal Power Station in Kislaya Guba, Russia.
