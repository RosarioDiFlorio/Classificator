The Mondovì Funicular (Italian: Funicolare di Mondovì) is a funicular railway in the town of Mondovì, Piedmont, Italy. It links Breo, the old quarter, with Piazza, the upper part of the town.
The line first opened in 1886 and was initially operated using the water counterbalance system. The line was converted to electrical operation in 1926 and was closed to traffic on December 24, 1975. After over thirty years closure, followed by a major rebuild, the line was reopened on December 16, 2006. The rebuild involved the reconstruction of the two terminal stations, construction of a new passing loop, and the provision of two new panoramic cars.
