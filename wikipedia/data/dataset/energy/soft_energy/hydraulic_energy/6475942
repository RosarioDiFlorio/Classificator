The Territet–Glion funicular railway (French: Chemin de fer funiculaire Territet–Glion) is a funicular in Switzerland, which runs between the Territet and Glion suburbs of the town of Montreux. At its upper terminus, the funicular connects with what was the lower terminus of the Chemin de fer Glion-Rochers-de-Naye (GN) mountain railway, which opened in 1892. This later line was joined, in 1909, in an end on junction at Glion with the newly constructed Chemin de fer Montreux-Glion (MGl).
