The Brokke Power Station is a hydroelectric power station located in the municipality Valle in Aust-Agder county, Norway. It is located on the west shore of the river Otra, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north of the village of Rysstad. The Norwegian National Road 9 runs past the station. The facility operates at an installed capacity of 330 megawatts (440,000 hp). The average annual production is 1,416 gigawatt-hours (5,100 TJ). The power station receives its water from the lake Botnsvatnet via a 30-kilometre (19 mi) long tunnel from the lake high up in the mountains. The water flowing down through the tunnel is used to produce the hydroelectric power.
