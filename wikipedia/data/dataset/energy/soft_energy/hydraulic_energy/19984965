The Koman Hydroelectric Power Station is a large hydroelectric power station, for which a dam on the Drin River was built. The dam is near the settlement of Koman, northern Albania. It is the second of three dams on the Drin River; the Fierza Hydroelectric Power Station upstream, and the Vau i DejÃ«s Hydroelectric Power Station downstream. The dam, 130m tall, was completed in 1985 and the reservoir was filled with water at full capacity in 1986.
Completed in 1986, the power station consists of four turbines of French origin with a nominal capacity of 150 MW each, totalling the installed capacity to 600 MW.
