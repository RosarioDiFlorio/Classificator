The University of Maine (UMaine) Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, located nearly 3 miles south west of Monhegan Island, Maine is available for use by commercial and non-commercial entities in partnership with the University of Maine, or the University of Maine itself, to research and develop ocean energy devices, such as floating wind turbines or wave energy converters.
The University of Maine asserts that the test site is among the most extensively studied in the Gulf of Maine.
The site was established under Maine law in 2009. The legislation formally designates the test site as the "Maine Offshore Wind Energy Research Center."
Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC, is pursuing a 12 MW demonstration offshore wind pilot project in the Test Site, with deployment and commercial operations planned for 2020.
