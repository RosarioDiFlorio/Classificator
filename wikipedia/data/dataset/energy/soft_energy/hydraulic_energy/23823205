The Kapichira Power Station is a hydroelectric power plant on the Shire River in Malawi. It has been designed for an eventual power generating capacity of 128 megawatts (172,000 hp), enough to power over 86,000 homes with 4 x 32 megawatts (43,000 hp) generating sets, however in Phase 1 only 2 x 32 MW generating sets were installed, with civil structures constructed for the later addition of the remaining two units. Phase I of the power station was officially opened in September 2000. Each unit operates at a nominal head of 54 metres (177 ft) and discharge of 67 cubic metres per second (2,400 cu ft/s).
