The Tyson Turbine is a hydropower system that extracts power from the flow of water. This design doesn't need a casement, as it is inserted directly into flowing water. It consists of a propeller mounted below a raft, driving a power system, typically a generator, on top of the raft by belt or gear. The turbine is towed into the middle of a river or stream, where the flow is the fastest, and tied off to shore. It requires no local engineering, and can easily be moved to other locations. The Tyson Turbine is a very common way to reuse energy.
