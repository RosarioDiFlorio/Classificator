Gavoshan Dam is an embankment dam on the Gaveh River 40 km (25 mi) south of Sanandaj in Kordestan province, Iran. It was created for the primary purpose of irrigation but also supports an 11 MW hydroelectric power station. Water from the dam's reservoir is transferred for irrigation in Kordestan and Kermanshah provinces via 20 km (12 mi) Gavoshan Water Conveyance Tunnel. About 189,000,000 m3 (153,225 acre·ft) can be transferred annually for the irrigation of 310 km2 (120 sq mi). Additionally, water from the reservoir is used to provide drinking water for the city of Kermanshah in the amount of 63,000,000 m3 (51,075 acre·ft) annually. Construction on the dam began in 1992 and was completed in 2004. It was inaugurated by Iran's President Mohammad Khatami on 13 February 2005.
