The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) Ltd is a UKAS accredited test and research centre focusing on wave and tidal power development based in the Orkney Islands, UK. The Centre provides developers with the opportunity to test full-scale grid-connected prototype devices in unrivalled wave and tidal conditions. The operations are spread over five sites:
Billia Croo wave energy test site, Mainland (wave power)
Fall of Warness tidal energy test site, off the island of Eday (tidal power)
Scale wave test site at Scapa Flow, off St Maryâ€™s Bay
Scale tidal test site at Shapinsay Sound, off Head of Holland
Stromness (office and data facilities)
EMEC was established by a grouping of public sector organisations following a recommendation by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in 2001. In addition to providing access to areas of sea with high wave and tidal energy potential, the centre also offers various kinds of support regarding regulatory issues, grid connection and meteorological monitoring as well as local research and engineering support.
