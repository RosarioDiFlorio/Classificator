Dynamic tidal power or DTP is an untried but promising technology for tidal power generation. It would involve creating a long dam-like structure perpendicular to the coast, with the option for a coast-parallel barrier at the far end, forming a large 'T' shape. This long T-dam would interfere with coast-parallel tidal wave hydrodynamics, creating water level differences on opposite sides of the barrier which drive a series of bi-directional turbines installed in the dam. Oscillating tidal waves which run along the coasts of continental shelves, containing powerful hydraulic currents, are common in e.g. China, Korea, and the UK.
The concept was invented and patented in 1997 by Dutch coastal engineers Kees Hulsbergen and Rob Steijn.
A short video explaining the concept was completed in October 2013 and made available in English on YouTube  and in Chinese on Youku.
