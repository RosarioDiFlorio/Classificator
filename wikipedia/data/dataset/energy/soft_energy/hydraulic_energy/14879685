The House Mill is a major Grade I listed building on the River Lea in Bromley-by-Bow, London. Although the Three Mills date back to the Domesday book, the present house mill was rebuilt in 1776 by Daniel Bisson. It was damaged by fire in 1802, and then rebuilt by Philip Metcalfe.
It is one of only four grade I listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham. The House Mill remains the "largest tidal mill left standing in Britain", although the water wheels are not in operation.
The south facade of the House Mill displays a coat of arms dated 1776 and the initials "D S B" (which could be Daniel and Sarah Bisson), with forty cast iron wall plates, which tie the ends of the floor beams.
The Miller's House was rebuilt in 1995 with a modern interior, but retaining the original facade. The Miller's House and a house on the other side of the House Mill were originally built for the Miller and his family. A Second World War bomb landed on a nearby bonded warehouse and damaged both houses on 15 October 1940 which were later demolished. The Mill stopped operating and was used as a warehouse.
