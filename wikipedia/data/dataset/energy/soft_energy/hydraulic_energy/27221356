Kjofossen Power Station is a hydroelectric power plant at Sogn og Fjordane built during World War II. Part of its power is used as railway traction current, i.e. single-phase electric power at 16 2/3 hertz, fed directly into the overhead wire of the railway to Bergen. The only other power station in Norway to produce traction current is Hakavik Power Station.
