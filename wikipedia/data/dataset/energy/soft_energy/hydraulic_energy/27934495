The Mist lift, Mist flow or Steam lift pump is a gas lift technique of lifting water used in a form of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) where water falls to operate a hydro-electric turbine. The water is pumped from the level it drops to using rising steam which is combined into a multiphase flow. Independent of energy production, the technique can be used simply as a thermally powered pump used to raise ocean water from depths for unspecified uses.
