The Petřín funicular is a funicular railway in the Czech capital city of Prague. It links the Malá Strana district with the top of Petřín hill. The funicular has three stops: Újezd (at the bottom of the hill), Nebozízek (the middle station) and Petřín (at the top of the hill).
According to Czech legend, the name of the middle station Nebozízek stems from an incident in which little son of Emperor Charles IV, requesting food, was unable to properly pronounce the Czech letter "ř" when he requested for a schnitzel, so instead of "nebo řízek" (meaning, "or schnitzel"), he expressed the word Nebozízek which actually means diminutively one of types of auger.
