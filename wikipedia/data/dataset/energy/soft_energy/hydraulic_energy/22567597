The Murum Dam is a gravity dam on the Murum River in Sarawak, Malaysia. Construction began in 2008. The dam's reservoir began to fill in July 2013 and the first generator was commissioned in December 2014. The fourth and final turbine began operations on 8 June 2015. Concerns have been raised about the displacement of the Dayak people and the removal of rainforest due to the construction of the dam.
The dam site is located on the Murum River, which is in the uppermost part of the Rajang River basin, 200 km (124 mi) from Bintulu. The upstream of Rajang river includes four steps, which are Pelagus, Bakun, Murum, and Belaga. The Murum Hydroelectric Project is the second Step-Hydroelectric Project of the four steps, and is 70 km (43 mi) from the constructing Bakun Hydroelectric Project downstream.
