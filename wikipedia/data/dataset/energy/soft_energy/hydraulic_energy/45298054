Tailrace fishing is angling immediately below natural or man-made dams or restrictions to the flow of water on rivers, canals, streams or any other flowing current. Fishing in a tailrace requires a distinct set of skills in that lures or bait must be moved through the flowing water to the feeding spots in the currents. Hydro tailrace fishing occurs in the discharge of hydroelectric power stations below a dam. Fishing below spillways is another form of tailrace fishing in which the turbulent water below the dam creates pockets of water that trap bait fish and attract gamefish.
