An equalizing basin (German: Ausgleichsbecken) or equalizing reservoir regulates the flow of water below an intermittently operated hydropower station or peaking power plant. This could be a part-load power station (Teillast-Durchfluss-Kraftwerk) or a storage power station. Also called a balancing reservoir.
