Bicaz-Stejaru Hydro Power Plant is a hydropower development on the Bistri≈£a River, near Bicaz, Romania.
The project was started and finished in the 1950s. It consists of a dam, a reservoir and a hydro power plant.
The dam is a reinforced concrete structure with a height of 127 m; it formed and holds Bicaz Lake reservoir, also known as Mountain Spring Lake ("Lacul Izvorul Muntelui").
The reservoir is the largest artificial lake in Romania; it manages river levels downstream, provides fishing, attracts tourism, fuels the power plant, and controls flooding.
The Oak Hydro-power plant ("Hidrocentrala Stejaru") is equipped with six turbines (four-27.5 MW and two-50 MW turbines) for a total installed capacity of 210 MW. The plant generates an average of 500 GWh of electricity per year, at a capacity factor of 30%; it has produced over 20 billion MWh of electricity in the first 50 years since commissioning.
