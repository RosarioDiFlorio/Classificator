Tarik Dam is a dam on the Sefīd-Rūd river in the Alborz mountain range, about 32 km (20 mi) south of Rasht in Gilan Province, northern Iran.
It is located 35 km (22 mi) downstream of the Sefidrud Dam. The dam was completed in 1977 to distribute releases from the Sefidrud Dam for irrigation and river regulation purposes.
A hydroelectric power station, with an installed capacity of 2.8 MW, was under construction in 2013 as part of the dam's structure.
