The Sant'Anna funicular (Italian: Funicolare Sant'Anna) is a funicular railway in the Italian city of Genoa connecting the Piazza Portello, on the edge of the historic city centre, to the Corso Magenta. The line is one of several true funiculars in the city, including the Zecca–Righi funicular and the Quezzi funicular, although the Principe–Granarolo rack railway is also sometimes erroneously described as a funicular.
