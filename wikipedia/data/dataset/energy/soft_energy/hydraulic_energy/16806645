Mangahao Power Station is a hydroelectric power station near the town of Shannon, New Zealand. After being delayed by war, access roading and foundation testing was started by late 1919 and the station opened in November 1924. It makes use of Mangahao River, through a series of tunnels and pipelines totaling 4.8 kilometers, in the Tararua Ranges. Mangahao Power Station became the power station for Wellington, Horowhenua, Taranaki, Hawkes Bay, and the Wairarapa. As of 2012, it is jointly owned and operated by Todd Energy and King Country Energy.
