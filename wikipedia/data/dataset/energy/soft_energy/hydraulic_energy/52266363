Wave Energy Scotland (WES) is a technology development body set up by the Scottish Government to facilitate the development of wave energy, particularly in Scotland. It was set up in 2015 following the demise of Pelamis Wave Power in November 2014, and is part of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) based in Inverness. WES manages a number of competitive project calls, funding the development of key strategic areas.
