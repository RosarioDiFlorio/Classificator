Hardeland hydroelectric power station is a power plant in Etne in western Norway. The site is owned and operated by Haugaland Kraft.
The station uses water from two sets of reservoirs. Hardeland H is a 400 m vertical fall from Løkjelsvatnet, while Hardeland K uses Grindheimsvatnet, Ilsvatnet, Basurde-/Krokavatnet and Hjørnås via a 305 m fall from the Hjørnås lake.
Hardeland is connected to the grid with a 22 kV line to Litledalen. The site uses three pelton wheels with 14 MW generators, and average yearly output is 123 GWh.
