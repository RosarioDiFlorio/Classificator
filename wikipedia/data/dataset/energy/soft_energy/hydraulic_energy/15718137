The Energen Wave Power device is a new invention that uses the motion of near shore ocean surface waves to create electricity. It is an attenuating wave device designed for efficiently extracting all the energy available from a single wave over a large surface area. It has a simple robust design that will enable it to withstand harsh sea conditions. The design of the generator allows for single or modular installations. Modular installations will reduce costs making power generating sites more financially viable. The size of each generator can be changed to accommodate regional wave conditions to maximise power output and reduce energy unit costs.
All proprietary power generating equipment is housed in the parallel floating pontoons, providing essential protection from the harsh corrosive sea conditions. All hydraulic and electrical power generating equipment are standard and readily available.
