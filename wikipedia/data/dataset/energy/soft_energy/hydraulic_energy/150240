The use of water power in Britain was at its peak just before the Industrial Revolution. The need for power was great and steam power had not yet become established. It is estimated that at this time there were well in excess of ten thousand watermills in the country. Most of these were corn mills (to grind flour), but almost any industrial process needing motive power, beyond that available from the muscles of men or animals, used a water wheel, unless a windmill was preferred.
Today only a fraction of these mills survive. Many are used as private residences, or have been converted into offices or flats. A small number have been preserved or restored as museums where the public can see the mill in operation.

This is a list of some of the surviving and demolished watermills and tide mills in the United Kingdom.
