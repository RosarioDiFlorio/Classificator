The Denali National Park Improvement Act (S. 157) is a bill that was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. If enacted, the bill would do four main things. First, it would allow the United States Department of the Interior to "issue permits for microhydroelectric projects in the Kantishna Hills area of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska." Second, the bill would authorize the Department of the Interior and a company called Doyon Tourism, Inc. to exchange some land in the area. Third, the bill would authorize the National Park Service (NPS) to "issue permits to construct a natural gas pipeline in the Denali National Park." Finally, the bill would rename the existing Talkeetna Ranger Station the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station.
