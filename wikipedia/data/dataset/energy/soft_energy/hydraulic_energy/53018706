The Langvann Hydroelectric Power Station (Norwegian: Langvann kraftverk or Langvann kraftstasjon) is a hydroelectric power station in the municipality of Gildesk친l in Nordland county, Norway. It is sometimes referred to as the Langvatn kraftverk, which should not be confused with the Langvatn Hydroelectric Power Station in Rana.
The plant utilizes a drop of 64 meters (210 ft) between two lakes: Fellvatnet (Lule Sami: Roavggoj치vrre), regulated between an elevation of 393 m (1,289 ft) and 333 m (1,093 ft), and Langvatnet (Lule Sami: G친ddumj치vrre), regulated between an elevation of 331 m (1,086 ft) and 299 m (981 ft).
The plant has a 5 MW turbine and an average annual production of about 21 GWh. Its catchment area is 93 square kilometers (36 sq mi). The plant is owned by Salten Kraftsamband and it came into operation in 1979. The plant is built into the mountainside at the end of a drain tunnel and the water it discharges is later used by the Sundsfjord Hydroelectric Power Station.
