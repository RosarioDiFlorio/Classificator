Gulf Stream Turbines LLC is start up company that is trying to create a renewable energy source using the Gulf Stream current. The Gulf Stream, which is produced by the earthâ€™s rotation, contains an enormous amount hydrokinetic energy. To tap into this immense source of renewable energy to produce electricity Gulf Stream Turbines plan on creating submersible power plants that can operate for extremely long periods without servicing. The Gulf Stream Turbine can do this because of its failure-proof design that depends on the laws of physics and has few moving parts.
