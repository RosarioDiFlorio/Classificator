The Festungsbahn is a funicular railway providing public access to the Hohensalzburg Castle at Salzburg in Austria. It links the castle with Festungsgasse, under the north side of the castle walls. The Festungsbahn opened in 1892, and should not be confused with the much older Reisszug funicular that provides goods access to the castle.
The line is operated by Salzburg AG, who also operate the city's buses and the Salzburger Lokalbahn.
