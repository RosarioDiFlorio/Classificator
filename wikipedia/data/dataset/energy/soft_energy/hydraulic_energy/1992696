The Petty Harbour Hydro Electric Generating Station is a hydroelectric generating station in Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador. It was constructed in 1898 and it was the first hydroelectric generating station in Newfoundland. It was built by the St. John's Street Railway Company, a company established by Robert Reid. Operation commenced on 19 April 1900. In 1920 Reid renamed the company the St. John's Light and Power Company. On 7 February 1921, an avalanche destroyed 23 m (75 ft) of the wooden penstock that carried water from the dam to the generating station, cutting off all electrical power to St. John's for almost five days. Then, in 1924, the plant changed ownership to the Royal Securities Corporation of Montreal, where they began extensive reconstruction of the plant and watershed area.

On 1 May 1978, the plant was entered in the Canadian Engineering Heritage Record as a model reflecting progressive adaptation to emerging technology, and remains today as one of the few plants of its type still in active service.

Some interesting facts about the generating station:
975 metres (3,199 ft) of woodstave penstock
107 metres (351 ft) of tunnel blasted through Gull Hill
55 metres (180 ft) of steel penstock
500 V, original Westinghouse generator
2,100 horsepower (1.6 MW) Voith turbines installed in 1908
