The facility has eight Francis turbines, four with a capacity of 812 MW and four rated at 800 MW, totalling an installed capacity of 6,448 MW. Xiangjiaba Dam is China's third-biggest hydropower station following Three Gorges Dam and Xiluodu Dam. Construction started on November 26, 2006, and its first generator was commissioned in October 2012. The last generator was commissioned on July 9, 2014.
The output of the generating station is connected to a ±800 kV HVDC link, the Xiangjiaba–Shanghai HVDC system, which transmits much of the power to Shanghai.
