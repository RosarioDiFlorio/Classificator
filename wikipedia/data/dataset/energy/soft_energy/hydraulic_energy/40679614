Hydroelectricity is a critical source of energy in Turkey and substantial amounts of it can be generated due to Turkey's mountainous landscape, abundance of rivers, and it's position surrounded by three seas. The main river basins are the Euphrates (Turkish: FÄ±rat) and the Tigris (Turkish: Dicle) rivers. Many dams have been built throughout the country, and about 23GW of power can be generated by hydroelectric plants. There are many projects currently in progress, such as the Southeastern Anatolia Project, which will allow generation of 15GW through hydroelectric energy. There are many policies that support the usage of hydroelectric energy. A number of dams built are subject to controversy as they have had many negative effects on the environment and the wildlife.
