A spiral tube water wheel is a method of pumping water by using an undershot water wheel which has a scoop connected to a spiral tube. As the wheel turns the scoop will alternatively introduce either water or air into the spiral tube. The pressure generated from the column of water introduced by the scoop is added to the pressure from previous scoops and so as the wheel turns it will increase the water pressure with every turn of the spiral. These wheels have only one moving part and have been known to pump water with no maintenance for several years.
