The Matiri Project is a hydroelectric scheme proposed by New Zealand Energy Limited for Lake Matiri and the Matiri River in the South Island of New Zealand.
The scheme is opposed by environmentalists and kayakers some of whom were angry that the resource consents were not notified nationwide. The proposal was approved and it included a concession granted by the Department of Conservation to build structures on public land. Forest and Bird did not see that there would be any conservation gain in giving the approval.
