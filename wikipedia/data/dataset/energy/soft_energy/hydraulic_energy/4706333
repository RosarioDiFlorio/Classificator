Wavebob was a wave energy converter which was in development between 1999 and 2013 when the company was closed owing to funding difficulties.
It commenced the first of a number of sea trials in Galway Bay in Ireland during which it was tested as a 1/4 scale device for short periods at the SEAI 1/4 Scale Wave Power Testing facility which is located in the inner bay inside the natural Aran Islands breakwater and where devices under test are exposed to c.1/3 of the expected energy of the 'Full Atlantic Ocean'.
