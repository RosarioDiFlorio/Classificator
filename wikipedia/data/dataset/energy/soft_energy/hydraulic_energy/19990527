The Buk Bijela Hydro Power Plant should be one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's largest hydro power plant, if built, having an installed electric capacity of 450 MW (reference missing). However, the project has been under harsh scrutiny of local and national communities and various NGO's from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and abroad, due which is postponed and possibly will be eventually canceled.
This project was a matter of inter-state agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, but it would certainly destroy the magnificent canyon of the Tara river, which is why this project encountered major opposition in both countries.
