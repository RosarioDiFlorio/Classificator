The Orvieto Funicular (Italian: Funicolare di Orvieto) is a funicular railway in the Italian city of Orvieto. It connects the railway station with Piazza Cahen in the city centre, which is situated on a volcanic rock 157 metres (515 feet) above the station. The line passes through the rampart, which surrounds the city centre, in a tunnel.
The line was originally built in 1888, and took the form of water-ballast counterbalanced funicular. This line was in use until 1970, when it was abandoned. Twenty years later, in 1990, a new electrically hauled funicular was built on the route of the old.
The cars of the new line are unmanned, and the whole line is controlled by a single controller in the upper station. The line operates every 15 minutes, or more frequently if traffic demands it. It has the following parameters:
At the upper station, the funicular connects with two routes operated by electric minibuses that serve the city centre.
