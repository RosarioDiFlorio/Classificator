The Dibang Dam is a planned concrete gravity dam, located in the Lower Dibang Valley District in Arunachal Pradesh, India. At the time of its future completion, it will be India's largest dam and the world's tallest concrete gravity dam, standing 288 metres (945 ft) tall. The Dibang Dam is expected to provide up to 3,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, and will also assist with flood control in the Dibang Valley. The foundation stone for the dam was laid on 31 January 2008 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Construction on the project, however, has yet to begin. In 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests rejected the project's application but NHPC Limited will resubmit it in 2014. The dam has also been under intense local and international opposition to its tentative negative environmental impacts and forced relocations.
