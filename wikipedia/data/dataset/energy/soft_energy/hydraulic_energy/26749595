The Perkins Tide Mill was one of the last surviving 18th-century tide mills in the United States. Located on Mill Lane in Kennebunkport, Maine, it was built in 1749 and operated until 1939. It was destroyed by an arsonist in 1994. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, the property's present owners, the Kennebunkport Conservation Trust, are contemplating construction of a replica.
