The 6500 Packet-Optical Platform (formerly called the Optical Multiservice Edge 6500 or OME 6500 during the product's time at Nortel) in telecommunication, computer networking and optical communications is a Multi-port multi-protocol system designed by Ciena that supports TDM/WDM/GigE/10G/40G and 100G ports. 
The system supports high bandwidth demands from applications like IPTV, Internet Video, HD programming, and mobile video by increasing the speeds over existing fiber. Normally increasing the speeds from 10G to 40G to 100G typically entails trade-offs such as shortening the distance of each network segment or increasing optical dispersion because of the weakening of optical signals as they travel. Prevention of this signal loss would normally require amplifiers or repeaters, or in some cases new better quality fiber would need to be installed. Nortel prevents this by using a signal modulation technology called dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DPQPSK).
