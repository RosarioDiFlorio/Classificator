Daintree Networks, Inc. is a building automation company that provides wireless control systems for commercial and industrial buildings. Commercial building control and lighting control systems can reduce energy consumption, cost, and carbon footprint, and comply with "green" building regulations.
Daintree's ControlScope wireless control includes switches, sensors, LED drivers, programmable thermostas, and plug load controllers. Wireless communication is achieved either by wirelessly adapting traditional wired devices (such as sensors), or by building wireless communications capabilities directly into devices.
Daintree has produced a design verification and operational support tool, the Sensor Network Analyzer (SNA), which supports wireless embedded technologies including IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, ZigBee RF4CE, 6LoWPAN, JenNet (from Jennic Limited), SimpliciTI (from Texas Instruments), and Synkro (from Freescale Semiconductor).
Founded in 2003, Daintree is headquartered in Los Altos, California with an R&D lab in Melbourne, Australia.
