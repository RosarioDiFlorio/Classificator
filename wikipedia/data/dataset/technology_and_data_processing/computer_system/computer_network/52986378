CAN FD (CAN with Flexible Data-Rate) is an extension to the original CAN bus protocol specified in ISO 11898-1. Developed in 2011 and released in 2012 by Bosch, CAN FD was originally created in response to the requests of automakers for more accurate, "real-time" data. Just like with classic CAN, this protocol is designed to record and transmit data, including errors, between devices and microcontrollers without the use of a central, "host" computer. CAN FD is primarily designed to meet the needs of automakers, however, the pervasiveness of classic CAN indicates the inclusion of this improved protocol across a variety of applications, including defense, industrial automation, autonomous devices, underwater vehicles and medical equipment.
