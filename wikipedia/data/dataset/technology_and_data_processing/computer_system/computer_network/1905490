The Alberta SuperNet is a high speed performance network connecting 429 communities in both urban and rural Alberta. The network consists of over 13,000 kilometers of trenched fibre optic cables and 2,000 kilometers of high-speed wireless links. One of the two main network components is owned and operated by Bell Canada and covers 27 cities in Alberta. The network covering the other 402 communities in rural Alberta is owned by the Government of Alberta, but the network is operated by Axia SuperNet Ltd in Calgary, Alberta. Service providers may connect to the Alberta SuperNet through Axia SuperNet Ltd when they have completed an agreement to provide high-speed Internet access for rural residents and small businesses. The network connects 1425 government locations, 516 health-care facilities, 2,203 schools, 333 libraries, and 244 municipalities. First Nations, Treaty 6, 7 and 8 have also connected 157 education facilities, 95 schools and 44 federal health care facilities. Eight Metis settlements have also connected.
Prior to the Alberta SuperNet, only seven service providers operated outside of Albertaâ€™s two largest metropolitan centres. Now 81 service providers have contracts with Axia to connect to the SuperNet. Approximately 500 service connections and 223 communities have retail access to high-speed connectivity. Currently, 80 percent of Alberta residents have the option of high-speed Internet access. Once service providers have a presence in all SuperNet communities, 95 percent of Alberta residents will have the option of high-speed Internet access.
