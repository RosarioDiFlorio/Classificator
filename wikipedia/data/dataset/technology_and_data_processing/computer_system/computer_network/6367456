RawFlow was a provider of live p2p streaming technology that enables internet broadcasting of audio and video. The company's technology is similar to Abacast and Octoshape.
Rawflow was incorporated in 2002 by Mikkel Dissing, Daniel Franklin and Stephen Dicks. Its main office was in London, UK. Velocix acquired RowFlow in July 2008. Alcatel-Lucent acquired Velocix in July 2009. The streaming media CDN solution by Alcatel-Lucent is called Velocix Digital Media Delivery Platform.
A peer-to-peer (or P2P) computer network relies on the computing power and bandwidth of the participants in the network rather than concentrating it in a relatively low number of servers. When using this technology, the bandwidth requirement of the broadcast is intelligently distributed over the entire network of participants, instead of being centralised at the broadcast's origin; as the audience grows so do the network resources available to distribute that broadcast without adding any additional bandwidth costs.
