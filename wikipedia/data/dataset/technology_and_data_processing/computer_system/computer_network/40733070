AMRES (Akademska mreža Srbije) is the National Research and Education Networking organisation (NREN) in Serbia. After it was founded in 2010 (22. april) as an institution by the Serbian government, AMRES took over the responsibility for the academic network and the associated services from the Computer Centre of the University of Belgrade. AMRES represents Serbia in international forums such as TERENA, but the University of Belgrade is still the organisation representing Serbia in the project that provides the funding for the European backbone network GÉANT.
