In computer networking: resilience is the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.‚Äù Threats and challenges for services can range from simple misconfiguration over large scale natural disasters to targeted attacks. As such, network resilience touches a very wide range of topics. In order to increase the resilience of a given communication network, the probable challenges and risks have to be identified and appropriate resilience metrics have to be defined for the service to be protected.
These services include:
supporting distributed processing
supporting network storage
maintaining service of communication services such as
video conferencing
instant messaging
online collaboration

access to applications and data as needed
Note that resilience and survivability are interchangeably used according to the specific context of a given study.
