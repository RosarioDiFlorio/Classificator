To an embedded anchor: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to an anchored part of a page on the subject.
An {{anchor|(anchor name)}} template, a <span id="(anchor name)"> element, or an |id=(anchor name) parameter might be installed at the beginning of a paragraph, in or near a section header or within a table. The anchor might also be an old section header that has been edited and is anchored within or near the new header to prevent broken internal and external links.
Even though section headers of the general form ==(Header name)== are themselves a type of anchor, use {{R to section}} instead.
