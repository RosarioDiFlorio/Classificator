Source route bridging is used on token ring networks, and is standardized in Section 9 of the IEEE 802.2 standard. The operation of the bridge is simpler (spanning tree protocol is not necessary) and much of the bridging functions are performed by the end systems, particularly the sources, giving rise to its name.
Source-route transparent bridging, abbreviated SRT bridging, is a hybrid of source routing and transparent bridging, standardized in Section 9 of the IEEE 802.2 standard. It allows source routing and transparent bridging to coexist on the same bridged network by using source routing with hosts that support it and transparent bridging otherwise.
The source-route bridging algorithm was developed by IBM and was proposed to the IEEE 802.5 committee as the means to bridge between all the LANS.
