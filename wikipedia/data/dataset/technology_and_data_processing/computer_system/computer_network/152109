The Scalable Coherent Interface or Scalable Coherent Interconnect (SCI), was a high-speed interconnect standard for shared memory multiprocessing and message passing used in the 1990s. The goal was to scale well, provide system-wide memory coherence and a simple interface; i.e. a standard to replace buses in multiprocessor systems without the inherent scalability and performance limitations of buses. The IEEE Std 1596-1992, IEEE Standard for Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) was approved by the IEEE standards board on March 19, 1992.
