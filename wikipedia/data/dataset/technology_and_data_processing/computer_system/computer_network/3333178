SCinet is a high-performance network that is built, once a year, in support of the annual International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis also known as the Supercomputing Conference (SC). It is the primary network for the conference and is used by attendees to demonstrate and test high-performance computing and networking applications.
In addition, SCinet is also a hub for the international networking community. It is the place to share the latest research, technologies, and demonstrations for networks, network technology providers, and even software developers who are in charge of supporting HPC communities at their own institutions or organizations.
More than 125 volunteers from educational institutions, high performance computing sites, equipment vendors, research networks, government agencies and telecommunications carriers work together to design and deliver the SCinet network. Vendor partners loan or donate much of the equipment and services needed to build the impressive network infrastructure.
Originated in 1991 as an initiative within the SC conference to provide networking to attendees, SCinet has grown to become the "World's Fastest Network" during the duration of the conference. For almost 25 years, SCinet has provided SC attendees and the high performance computing (HPC) community with the innovative network platform necessary to internationally interconnect, transport, and display HPC research during SC.
Historically, SCinet has been used as a platform to test networking technology and applications which have found their way into common use.
In the past years, SCinet deployed conference wide networking technologies such as ATM, FDDI, HiPPi before they were deployed commercially.
