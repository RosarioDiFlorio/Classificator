A flat network is a computer network design approach that aims to reduce cost, maintenance and administration. Flat networks are designed to reduce the number of routers and switches on a computer network by connecting the devices to a single switch instead of separate switches. Unlike a hierarchical network design, the network is not physically separated using different switches.
The topology of a flat network is not segmented or separated into different broadcast areas by using routers. Some such networks may use network hubs or a mixture of hubs and switches, rather than switches and routers, to connect devices to each other. Generally, all devices on the network are a part of the same broadcast area.
