Wireless Andrew was the first campus-wide wireless Internet network. Built in 1993, it was located on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University at its Pittsburgh campus before Wi-Fi branding originated. 
Wireless Andrew is a 2-megabit-per-second wireless local area network connected through access points to the wired Andrew network, a high-speed Ethernet backbone linking buildings across the Carnegie Mellon campus. Wireless Andrew consists of 100 access points covering six buildings on the Carnegie Mellon campus. The university tested the current setup with over 40 mobile units before allowing general use by researchers and students in February 1997.
