A LAN Messenger is a instant messaging program designed for use within a single local area network (LAN).
Many LAN Messengers offer basic functionality for sending private messages, file transfer, chatrooms and graphical smileys. The advantage of using a simple LAN messenger over a normal instant messenger is that no active Internet connection or central server is required, and only people inside the firewall will have access to the system.
