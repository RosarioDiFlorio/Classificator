The United States Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP)  was initiated in 1992 in response to Congressional direction to modernize the Department of Defense (DoD) laboratoriesâ€™ high performance computing capabilities. The HPCMP provides supercomputers, a national research network, and computational science experts that together enable the Defense laboratories and test centers to conduct research, development, test and technology evaluation activities.
The program was administered by the Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (now called the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering) through FY2011, at which point it was transferred to the office of the United States Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, where it is managed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology.
The program comprises three primary elements: DoD Supercomputing Resource centers, which provide large scale supercomputers and operations staff; DREN, a nationwide high speed, low latency, R&D network connecting the centers and major user communities; and a collection of efforts in software applications to develop, modernize, and maintain software to address DoD's science and engineering challenges. The current director of the program is David Horner, who was appointed to the position in January 2015.
