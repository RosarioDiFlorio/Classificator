Antilles Crossing is an underwater 20 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) fiber optics ring network connecting several nations and overseas territories of the Caribbean Sea.
It was built by TeleBarbados, and is one of the newer important network connections to the Internet for Caribbean countries in the Windward and Leeward Islands. The company is a joint venture between Leucadia National Corporation and Barbados Light & Power Holdings Limited. It currently extends from Needham's Point, Saint Michael, Barbados to Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands where it interconnects with Global Crossing's worldwide telecommunications network.
The network is being built in 4 phases.
Phase I (The red phase) links Barbados, to the island of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands.
Phase II (The grey phase) will see the linking of Barbados firstly to Tobago and then onward to Trinidad further south.
Phase III (The green phase) will see the link from Trinidad traveling Northward to Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia.
Phase IV (The blue phase) will see a link extended from Saint Lucia Northward to Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Kitts and Saint Croix in United States Virgin Islands
