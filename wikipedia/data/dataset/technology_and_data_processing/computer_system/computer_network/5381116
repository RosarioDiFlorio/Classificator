LANcouver is a LAN party first hosted on the North Shore of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was started in January 2004 and has hosted seven successful events, with the last event in July 2011. The event has attracted an average of approximately 50â€“120 attendees per event. LANcouver is a BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) event, which means that everyone attending brings their own PC desktop or laptop. Network resources (such as switches and network cable) and power connections are supplied and connected by the administrators on-site during the event, who also host the various servers required for playing LAN based games such as Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Unreal Tournament. LANcouver organizers have also been responsible for running tournaments at other events such as GottaCon 2012.
