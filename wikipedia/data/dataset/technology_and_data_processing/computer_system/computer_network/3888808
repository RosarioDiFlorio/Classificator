PAX (originally known as Penny Arcade Expo) is overall term used to refer to a series of gaming culture festivals that involve; tabletop gaming, arcade gaming, computer gaming and video gaming. PAX festival events are held annually in Seattle, Washington, Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, San Antonio, Texas and Melbourne, Australia. PAX was originally created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, the authors of the Penny Arcade webcomic, because they wanted to attend a show exclusively for gaming.
PAX was first held in 2004. Defining characteristics of the festivals include an opening keynote speech from an industry insider, game-culture inspired concerts, panels on game topics, exhibitor booths from both independent and major game developers and publishers, a LAN party multiplayer, tabletop gaming tournaments, and video game freeplay areas. Every PAX also features the Omegathon, a festival-long tournament consisting of a group of randomly selected attendees competing for a grand prize. The final round of the Omegathon makes up part of the closing ceremonies of PAX. Past games for the final round of the Omegathon have included Tetris, Pong, Halo 3, and skee-ball.
