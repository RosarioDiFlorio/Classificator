CANpie (CAN Programming Interface Environment) is an open source project and pursues the objective of creating and establishing an open and standardized software API for access to the CAN bus.

The project was established in 2001 by MicroControl and is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. The current version of the CANpie API covers both classical CAN frames as well as ISO CAN FD frames. The API is designed for embedded control applications as well as for PC interface boards: embedded microcontrollers are programmed in C, a C++ API is provided for OS independent access to interface boards. The API provides ISO/OSI Layer-2 (Data Link Layer) functionality. It is not the intention of CANpie to incorporate higher layer functionality (e.g. CANopen, SAE J1939).
