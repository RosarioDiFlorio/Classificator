MiWi and MiWi P2P are proprietary wireless protocols designed by Microchip Technology that use small, low-power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs). It is designed for low data transmission rates and short distance, cost constrained networks, such as industrial monitoring and control, home and building automation, remote control, low-power wireless sensors, lighting control and automated meter reading.
The MiWi protocols are supported on certain Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers. When developing for these platforms, proprietary SDKs and hardware development tools, such as the ZENA wireless packet sniffer, may be used.
