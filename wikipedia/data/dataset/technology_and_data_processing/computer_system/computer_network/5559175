The Ethernet physical layer is the physical layer component of the Ethernet family of computer network standards which defines the electrical or optical properties of the physical connection between a device and the network or between network devices. It is complemented by the MAC layer and the logical link layer which provide features like framing, addressing, checksums, virtual LANs, and link aggregation.
The Ethernet physical layer has evolved over its existence starting in 1980 and encompasses multiple physical media interfaces and several orders of magnitude of speed. The speed ranges from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Gbit/s, while the physical medium can range from bulky coaxial cable to twisted pair and optical fiber. In general, network protocol stack software will work similarly on all physical layers.
10 Gigabit Ethernet was already used in both enterprise and carrier networks by 2007, with 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gigabit Ethernet ratified. Higher speeds are under development.
Many Ethernet adapters and switch ports support multiple speeds, using autonegotiation to set the speed and duplex for the best values supported by both connected devices. While this can practically be relied on for ports supporting twisted-pair cabling, only few optical-fiber ports support multiple speeds. If auto-negotiation fails, some multiple-speed devices sense the speed used by their partner, but will assume half-duplex. A 10/100 Ethernet port supports 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. A 10/100/1000 Ethernet port supports 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T. A 10GBASE-T port usually supports 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T.
