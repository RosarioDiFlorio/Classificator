The 5-4-3 rule also referred to as the IEEE way (contrary to the Ethernet way) is a design guideline for Ethernet computer networks covering the number of repeaters and segments on shared-access Ethernet backbones in a tree topology. It means that in a collision domain there should be at most 5 segments tied together with 4 repeaters, with up to 3 mixing segments (10BASE5, 10BASE2, or 10BASE-FP). Link segments can be 10BASE-T, 10BASE-FL or 10BASE-FB â€“ for prompt collision detection, a full-duplex medium (not transmission) is required. This rule is also designated the 5-4-3-2-1 rule with there being two link segments (without senders) and one collision domain.
The 5-4-3 rule was created when 10BASE5, 10BASE2 and FOIRL were the only types of Ethernet network available. The rule only applies to shared-access 10 Mbit/s Ethernet segments connected by repeaters or repeater hubs (collisions domains) and FOIRL links. The rule does not apply to switched Ethernet because each port on a switch constitutes a separate collision domain. With mixed repeated and switched networks, the rule's scope ends on a switched port.
