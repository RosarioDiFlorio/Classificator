Host-based zoning can include WWN or LUN masking, and is typically known as “persistent binding.”
In storage networking, ”persistent binding” is an option of zoning.
Host-based zoning is usually referred to as persistent binding or LUN, and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct in order to avoid zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for administrative errors and conflicting access to targets. Moreover zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's — increasing the possibility for administrative errors. If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. Host-based zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specific target IDs. However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting host-based zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security.
Basically, A given LUN has it SCSI id assigned by its RAID device (typically a SAN ). But for some purposes it's useful to have the SCSI id assigned by the host itself: that's persistent binding.
