The Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is a firewall module integrated by Cisco into its Komodo blade on Catalyst 6500 Switches and 7600 Series Routers.
Installed inside a Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch or Cisco 7600 Internet Router, the FWSM allows any VLAN on the switch to be passed through to the device to operate as a firewall port and integrates firewall security inside the network infrastructure.
The FWSM is based on Cisco PIX technology and uses the same Cisco PIX Operating System, a secure, real-time operating system. The Cisco FWSM enables organizations to manage multiple firewalls from the same management platform.
It has reached end of support status as of September 26, 2007 and replaced by the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series 7600 Series ASA Services Module.
