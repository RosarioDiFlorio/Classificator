Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a broadband wireless access technology originally designed for digital television transmission (DTV). It was conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. LMDS commonly operates on microwave frequencies across the 26 GHz and 29 GHz bands. In the United States, frequencies from 31.0 through 31.3 GHz are also considered LMDS frequencies.
Throughput capacity and reliable distance of the link depends on common radio link constraints and the modulation method used - either phase-shift keying or amplitude modulation. Distance is typically limited to about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) due to rain fade attenuation constraints. Deployment links of up to 5 miles (8 km) from the base station are possible in some circumstances such as in point-to-point systems that can reach slightly farther distances due to increased antenna gain.
