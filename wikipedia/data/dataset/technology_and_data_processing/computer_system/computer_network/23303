A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for data transmission amongst devices such as computers, telephones, tablets and personal digital assistants. PANs can be used for communication amongst the personal devices themselves (interpersonal communication), or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet (an uplink) where one master device takes up the role as internet router. A PAN may be carried over wired computer buses such as USB and FireWire.
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a low-powered PAN carried over a short-distance wireless network technology such as:
INSTEON
IrDA
Wireless USB
Bluetooth
Z-Wave
ZigBee
The reach of a WPAN varies from a few centimeters to a few meters.
