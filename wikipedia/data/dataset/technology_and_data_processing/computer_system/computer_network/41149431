The history of PAX (originally known as Penny Arcade Expo) began in 2004, with the first event held in Bellevue, Washington, and held annually in Seattle since then. In 2010, a new event was also held in Boston, Massachusetts at which point the two events were differentiated with the names PAX West (on the West Coast; previously PAX Prime) and PAX East (on the East Coast). In 2011, an event was held in Seattle, Washington, and dubbed Pax Dev. In 2013, an event was held in Melbourne, Australia, and dubbed PAX Australia. In 2015, an event was held in San Antonio, Texas, and dubbed PAX South.
