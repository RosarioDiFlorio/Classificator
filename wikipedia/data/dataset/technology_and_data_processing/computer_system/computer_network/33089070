Windows To Go is a feature in Windows 8 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education that allows them to boot and run from certain USB mass storage devices such as USB flash drives and external hard disk drives which have been certified by Microsoft as compatible. It is a fully manageable corporate Windows environment.
It is intended to allow enterprise administrators to provide users with an imaged version of Windows that reflects the corporate desktop. Creation of Windows To Go drives is not officially supported by non-Enterprise (or Education) Windows 8.1 editions; however, Enterprise and Education versions of Windows 10 are supported. Some information has been published describing various ways to install Windows To Go using any version of Windows 8.x and 10 and any bootable USB device. Reported restrictions of some unofficial versions include unavailability of Bitlocker protection, no access to the Windows Store, and inability to boot on both BIOS and UEFI machines.
