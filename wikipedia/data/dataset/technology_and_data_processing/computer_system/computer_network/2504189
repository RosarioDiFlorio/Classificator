AUSTPAC was a public X.25 network operated by Telstra. Started by Telecom Australia in 1982, AUSTPAC was Australia's first public packet-switched data network, supporting applications such as online betting, financial applications (the Australian Taxation Office has made use of AUSTPAC) and remote terminal access to academic institutions, some of which maintained their connections to AUSTPAC up until the mid to late 1990s. Austpac could be accessed by dial-up to a PAD or by linking an X.25 node to the network permanently.
The Austpac general access telephone number was 01924 within Australia.
