Bluetooth advertising is a method of mobile marketing that utilizes Bluetooth technology to deliver content such as message, information or advertisement to mobile devices such as cellular phones or tablet computer. Bluetooth advertising can also be received via laptop or PDA.
Bluetooth advertising is permission based advertising, which means that when a mobile device has received a Bluetooth message, the recipient has the choice to either accept or decline the message. The recipient needs to positively indicate that they wish to receive marketing messages.
While not all Bluetooth enabled mobile devices users leaves their Bluetooth activated, they can interact with a sign to encourage them to turn on their Bluetooth to receive the content. The advertiser is required to explain that those marketing messages may contain information about other companiesâ€™ products and services, if appropriate. It is highly recommended that the Direct Marketing Associations guidelines are used.
