The wlan slovenija open wireless network of Slovenia is an initiative for deployment of open and free community wireless network across all Slovenia through collaboration and with use of off-the-shelf widely available equipment. The main idea is that if everyone deploys a node of the open network in their home and share part of their Internet connectivity with others around them, then whole Slovenia will be covered with the wireless network which will allow everyone free basic connectivity to Internet. With this idea it operates since 2009 onward.
The network is based on open source software and hardware which has been developed by participants as well. It is one of largest Slovenian open source projects and has participated multiple times in Google Summer of Code.
