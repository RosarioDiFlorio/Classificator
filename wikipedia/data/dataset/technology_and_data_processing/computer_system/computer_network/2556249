Weatherpixie was a service offering web graphics that showed a representation of the current weather derived from a METAR report gathered in one of 6000 locations around the world. A customisable avatar changes clothing or sports an umbrella according to the weather conditions, and the background of the box around the figure shows a graphic representation of current weather, day or night sky and current moon phase. Text below the graphic indicated air temperature, relative humidity, collection time, wind velocity and atmospheric pressure, respectively.
The Weatherpixie application was created by Tamsin Bowles, a web developer and server-side programmer in London, in 2002. Its website provided free code to put weather badges on web sites, or on a computer's desktop using Active Desktop or Konfabulator.
The Weatherpixie site suffered a hard disk crash in March 2010 and the application has not been operational since.
