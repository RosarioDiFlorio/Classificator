BlueChat is a multi-platform messaging app that will include virtual reality (Oculus Rift platform). It is currently available on iOS, Android and Desktop web browsers.
To start chatting, users can go to the Public tab on their device and see all the nearby conversations that are going on. After selecting one, they can type in a message in the input box and start chatting. Once they do enter a message they will automatically be joined into that chat and they will get an instant notification whenever a new message arrives.
Users can enter in profile information like first name, last name, sex, and age.
BlueChat users can chat with other users nearby. This means that complete strangers can communicate with others using the BlueChat app. Users are also allowed to turn on their "anonymous" flag so that they can chat anonymously without revealing their names or other profile information.
