The MEF, founded in 2001 as the Metro Ethernet Forum, is a nonprofit international industry consortium, dedicated to adoption of Carrier Ethernet networks and services.
The forum is composed of service providers, incumbent local exchange carriers, network equipment vendors, and other networking companies that share an interest in Metro Ethernet. It had 217 members as of September 2015.
The MEF is a combination of a technical and a marketing forum to promote the adoption of Metro Ethernet. This contrasts with standard bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The forum makes recommendations to existing standards bodies and creates specifications that are not being developed by (or fall within the scope of) other standards bodies.
