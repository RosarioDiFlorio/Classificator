A Private Shared Wireless Network (PSWN) is a wide area wireless radio telecommunications network developed and provided by MetroConnect specifically for the use of public safety, utilities, machine to machine, and business communications. Its broad area coverage allows for a greater signal range and a lower cost of implementation. Public safety agencies and businesses utilize a Private Shared Wireless Network to send and receive data, communicate, and receive diagnostics information on their fixed equipment, vehicles and/or employees.
A Private Shared Wireless Network is built to operate on frequencies that are separate from those of public cellular communications networks and other publicly accessible wireless cellular or radio networks so to avoid their associated network congestion and security vulnerabilities.
