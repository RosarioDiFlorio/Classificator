Community network is the use of networking technologies by, and for, a local community. Free-nets and civic networks indicate roughly the same range of projects and services, whereas community technology centers (CTCs) and telecentres generally indicate a physical facility to compensate for lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).
A community network is a computer-based system that is intended to help support geographical communities by supporting, augmenting, and extending already existing social networks.
