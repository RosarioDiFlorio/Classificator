Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is a Cisco Systems proprietary networking protocol, which is used for the automated, logical aggregation of Ethernet switch ports, known as an ether channel. The PAgP is proprietary to Cisco Systems. A similar protocol known as LACP— released by the IEEE and known as 802.3ad or 802.1ax recently — is an industry standard and is not tied to a specific vendor.
PAgP can be configured on a Cisco switch to operate in three different modes.
auto - passive negotiation of the channel
desirable - active negotiation of the channel
on - no protocols are used: it assumes the other side has enabled link aggregation
On Cisco network devices running CatOS, a single switch module may only be configured to run in either LACP or PAgP modes. Cisco devices that run IOS (native and/or non-hybrid mode boxes) support individual port configuration for LACP and are not restricted to per module settings as with CatOS.
PAgP messages are always sent to the well known Cisco multicast address 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC with protocol type code 0X0104. PAgP uses the same multicast group MAC address of CDP.
