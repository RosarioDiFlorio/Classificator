Kashchenism (Russian: Кащенизм) is a specific style of conversation in forums and blogs used on Russian FidoNet and Internet. Its main feature is provocativeness and mockery while being formally polite. Historically, Kashchenist style uses many words and idioms of Jewish origin; in conversations, Kashchenists often pretend to be Jews, in order to troll antisemites while also causing others to make excuses to prove that they are not antisemites. Kashchenist style also typically uses medical terms, especially from psychiatry; this is because Kashchenists consider themselves jocularly as "network psychiatrists", and imitate either medical staff or, conversely, patients in a mental hospital. The word "Kashchenism" also denotes a philosophy of people who use Kashchenist style in electronic conversations.
