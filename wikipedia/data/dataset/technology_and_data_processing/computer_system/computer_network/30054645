Intelligent Resilient Framework (IRF) is a proprietary software virtualization technology developed by H3C (3Com). Its core idea is to connect multiple network devices through physical IRF ports and perform necessary configurations, and then these devices are virtualized into a distributed device. This virtualization technology realizes the cooperation, unified management, and non-stop maintenance of multiple devices. This technology follows some of the same general concepts as Cisco's VSS and vPC technologies.
