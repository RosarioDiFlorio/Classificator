Data in transit is defined into two categories, information that flows over the public or untrusted network such as the internet and data which flows in the confines of a private network such as a corporate or enterprise Local Area Network (LAN). 
Data in transit is used as a complement to the terms data in use, and data at rest which together define the three states of digital data.
