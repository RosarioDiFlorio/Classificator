Launch Time is a new concept for handling Ethernet packets proposed for the Linux kernel. It is an attempt to add some isochronous capability to the kernel by hinting at what time a packet should be sent out. When sending a packet to socket, an additional bit (MSG_LAUNCHTIME) is specified in the "sendto" flags field. If this bit is set, then the buffer passed to the socket includes the desired send time or "launch time". The sendto syscall will shave off the launchtime from the packet and add it to the msghdr passed to the lower layers of the network stack.
The UDP + IPv4/IPv6 are planned to be extended to support this, and if launchtime is requested, they will try to call a new send message routine in the network driver which allows passing the launchtime parameter, in addition to those of the normal send message present in the driver. Before Launch time is used the network driver will have to be initialized using an ioctl.
