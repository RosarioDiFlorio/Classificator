The Bi-State Optical Network (BiSON) is a collaboration of research and educational institutions in Colorado and Wyoming that utilize fiber optic links for high-speed optical networking. BiSON members provide redundant access to regional and Wide Area Network (WAN) services.
BiSON utilizes optical Wave division multiplexing (WDM) equipment to deliver multiple lambdas to each member institution. Each lambda provides a capability for multiple Gigabit Ethernet links, which are used for transport to member institutions and WAN services provided by the Front Range GigaPoP (FRGP). BiSON uses a ring configuration design to provide redundancy in the event of a fiber cut or equipment failure.
