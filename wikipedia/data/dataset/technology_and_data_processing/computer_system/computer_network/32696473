TuiaNet or Tuia was the first national research and education network in New Zealand established in 1992, and essentially provided the first Internet backbone for the country. This backbone provided a 48kbit/s connection between every New Zealand university, many Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) and the National Library, along with an international connection of 128 kbit/s (1992) to 512 kbit/s (1994) to NASA Ames. By 1993, the parties involved in the network rarely met again and private Internet companies soon emerged.
The major international connection was soon replaced with the Southern Cross Cable, and a new national research and education network emerged through the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network (KAREN) in 2006.
