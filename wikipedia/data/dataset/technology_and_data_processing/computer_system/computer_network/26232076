PROFIenergy is a profile of the PROFINET communications protocol that allows the power consumption of automation equipment in manufacturing (such as robot assembly cells, laser cutters and sub-systems such as paint lines) to be managed over a PROFINET network. It controls energy usage during planned and unplanned breaks in production. No external hard-wired systems are required.
