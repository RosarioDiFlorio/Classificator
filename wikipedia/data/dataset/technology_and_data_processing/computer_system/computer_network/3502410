Open Transport Network (OTN) is a flexible private communication network based on fiber optic technology, manufactured by OTN Systems.
It is a networking technology used in vast, private networks with a great diversity of communication requirements, such as subway systems, pipelines, the mining industry, tunnels and the like (ref). It permits all kinds of applications such as video images, different forms of speech and data traffic, information for process management and the like to be sent flawlessly and transparent over a practically unlimited distance. The system is a mix of Transmission and Access NE, communicating over an optical fiber. The communication protocols include serial protocols (e.g. RS232) as well as telephony (POTS/ISDN), audio, Ethernet, video and video-over-IP (via M-JPEG, MPEG2/4, H.264 or DVB) (ref).
