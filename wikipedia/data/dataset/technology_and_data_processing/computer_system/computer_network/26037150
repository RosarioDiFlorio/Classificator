Sudanese Universities Information Network (SUIN) is the national research and education network in Sudan. In 2004, SUIN was first founded and developed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. Since the beginning of October 2009, SUIN has been operational under the umbrella of the Association of Sudanese Universities, which is a non-governmental organization (NGO) body for all tertiary education and research institutions in Sudan. An MoU was signed between thirty universities (ASU members), with a main objective to support the establishment of SUIN as a legal independent body.
