Bitwalking is a digital currency introduced by project founders, Franky Imbesi and Nissan Bahar. Each Bitwalking dollar (BW$) is earned by walking approximately 10,000 steps, or 5 miles (8 km). While each BW$ will be equivalent to $1 in the Bitwalking online store, the real-world conversation rate of each BW$ is not known.
A free mobile application is used to count and convert a user's steps into Bitwalking dollars. The Bitwalking dollars generated by the app accumulate daily in the user's account until transferred or spent. The app is available on Android devices and in a limited number of countries including the UK, Japan, Malawi, and Kenya. The amount of Bitwalking dollars a user can claim per day was capped at 3BW$ at launch. Bitwalking dollars can't now be spent neither in the Bitwalking in-app marketplace nor exchanged for cash, but the company have stated future plans to set up an automatic online exchange.
The mobile app is only available for Android phones now, but the company will support iOS devices and wearable products in the future. Users can also join its Bitwalking Beta Program to try new features of latest beta version app.
