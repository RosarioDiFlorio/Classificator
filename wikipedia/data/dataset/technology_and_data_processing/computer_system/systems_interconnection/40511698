Red Hat Gluster Storage is a computer storage product from Red Hat. It is based on open source technologies such as GlusterFS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
The latest release, RHGS 3.1, combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 6 and also RHEL 7) with the latest GlusterFS community release, oVirt, and XFS File System.
In April 2014, Red Hat re-branded GlusterFS-based Red Hat Storage Server to "Red Hat Gluster Storage".
