Peer-to-peer web hosting is using peer-to-peer networking to distribute access to webpages. This is differentiated from the clientâ€“server model which involves the distribution of Web data between dedicated web servers and user-end client computers. P2P web hosting may take the form of P2P web caches and content delivery networks like Dijjer and Coral Cache which allow users to hold copies of data from single web pages and distribute the caches with other users for faster access during peak traffic.
