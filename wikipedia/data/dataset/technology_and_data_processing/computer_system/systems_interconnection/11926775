Perfect Dark (パーフェクトダーク) is a peer-to-peer file-sharing (P2P) application from Japan designed for use with Microsoft Windows. It was launched in 2006. Its author is known by the pseudonym Kaichō (会長, lit. "The Chairman"). Perfect Dark was developed with the intention for it to be the successor to both Winny and Share software. Japan's Association for Copyright of Computer Software reports that in January 2014, the number of nodes connected on Perfect Dark (24000) was less than on Share (44000), but more than on Winny (12000). The number of nodes for all three networks has been falling since 2007 when ACCS first started surveying nodes.
As of version 1.02 (2008), code-named "STAND ALONE COMPLEX", there is support for the program to run in English, an option that can be selected when the program is installed.
