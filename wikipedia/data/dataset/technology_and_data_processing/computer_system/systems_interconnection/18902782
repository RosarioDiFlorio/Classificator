Admon is a Zabbix-based open-source computer system and network monitoring application software. It watches hosts and services specified by users, alerting them via e-mail or short-message service when issues arise.
Created under Zabbix v1.1.1 beta, Admon was modified to run under Linux only, but it also runs on other Unix variants. Admon is free software licensed under a GNU General Public License, version 2, as published by the Free Software Foundation.
Compared to Zabbix, most of the original functions have been shrunk, including supports for windows, multiple databases, simple network management protocol, and auto-discovery; and only some core functions are reserved. Its alerting subsystem has been rewritten for easier use in large-scale networks. Admon is a smart version of Zabbix, and more reliable. It is maintained by Admon.org.
