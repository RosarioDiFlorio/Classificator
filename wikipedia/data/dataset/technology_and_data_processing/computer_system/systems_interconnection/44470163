BTGuard is a Virtual Private Network service specifically designed for anonymous filesharing through the BitTorrent network operated in Canada. Established in 2008, the service legally reroutes a customer's internet traffic through a different IP address.
It has received attention and positive reviews by websites such as TorrentFreak.com, and offers both a traditional VPN as well as versions of common BitTorrent clients such as uTorrent that have been specifically modified to transfer files anonymously through their anonymous proxy.
