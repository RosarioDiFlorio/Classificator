Apache Hama is a distributed computing framework based on Bulk Synchronous Parallel computing techniques for massive scientific computations e.g., matrix, graph and network algorithms. It is a Top Level Project under the Apache Software Foundation. It was created by Edward J. Yoon, who named it (short for "Hadoop Matrix") and was inspired by Google's Pregel large-scale graph computing framework described in 2010.
