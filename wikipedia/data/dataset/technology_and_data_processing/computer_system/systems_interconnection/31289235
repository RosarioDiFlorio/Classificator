An email backbone is typically the middleware of an email infrastructure that manages SMTP-based applications, internal and external email message routing, and policy management and enforcement. The email backbone is normally the portion of the email infrastructure that "sits between" the gateway DMZ layer and the “email groupware system” layer of the messaging infrastructure, such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes/Domino. The email backbone is sometimes referred to as the messaging fabric or a messaging infrastructure layer
