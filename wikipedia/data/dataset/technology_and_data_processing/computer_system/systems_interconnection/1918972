Fibre Channel point-to-point (FC-P2P) is a Fibre Channel topology where exactly two ports (devices) are directly connected to each other.
It is the simplest topology, no network addressing is needed, because each message has only one possible receiver.
The bandwidth is dedicated.
Point-to-point uses N_port.
