Netatalk is a free, open-source implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol. It allows Unix-like operating systems to serve as file, print, and time servers for Macintosh computers.
Netatalk was originally developed by the Research Systems Unix Group at the University of Michigan and moved to SourceForge in 2000. In October 2004 Netatalk 2.0 was released, which brought major improvements, including: support for Apple Filing Protocol version 3.1 (providing long UTF-8 filenames, file sizes > 2 gigabytes, full Mac OS X compatibility), CUPS integration, Kerberos V support allowing true "single sign-on", reliable and persistent storage of file and directory IDs and countless bug fixes compared to previous versions.
Since version 2.0.5, Netatalk supports the use of Time Machine over a network in a similar fashion to Apple's own Time Capsule. Starting with version 2.2, Netatalk supports AFP protocol level 3.3, which is inter-operable with MacOS up to at least 10.13 (High Sierra).
Version 3.0 of Netatalk was released in July 2012 and added ini style configuration, AppleDouble backend using filesytem Extended Attributes as default, and removed AppleTalk networking support. The latest version supports the AFP level 3.4.
Currently Netatalk supports the FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OpenSolaris operating systems. Also there are packages for iOS and Mac OS X. Netatalk is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
