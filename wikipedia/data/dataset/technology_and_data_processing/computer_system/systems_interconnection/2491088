Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) is a peer-to-peer protocol designed by Microsoft. PNRP enables dynamic name publication and resolution, and requires IPv6.
PNRP was first mentioned during a presentation at a P2P conference in November 2001. It appeared in July 2003 in the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP, and was later included in the Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. PNRP 2.0 was introduced with Windows Vista and is available for download for Windows XP Service Pack 2 users.  PNRP 2.1 is included in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 and Windows XP SP3. PNRP v2 is not available for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition or any edition of Windows Server 2003. 
Windows Remote Assistance in Windows 7 uses PNRP, Teredo and IPv6 when connecting using the Easy Connect option. 
The design of PNRP is covered by US Patent #7,065,587, issued on June 20, 2006.
