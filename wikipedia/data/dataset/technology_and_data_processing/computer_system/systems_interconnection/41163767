Fast automatic restoration (FASTAR) is an automated fast response system developed and deployed by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) in 1992 for the centralized restoration of its digital transport network. FASTAR automatically reroutes circuits over a spare protection capacity when a fiber-optic cable failure is detected, hence increasing service availability and reducing the impact of the outages in the network. Similar in operation is real-time restoration (RTR), developed and deployed by MCI and used in the MCI network to minimize the effects of a fiber cut.
