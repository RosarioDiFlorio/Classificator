Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for application layer protocol negotiation. ALPN allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol should be performed over a secure connection in a manner that avoids additional round trips and which is independent of the application layer protocols. It is needed by HTTP/2 which improves the compression of web pages and reduces their latency. The ALPN and HTTP/2 standards emerged from development work done by Google on the now withdrawn SPDY protocol.
