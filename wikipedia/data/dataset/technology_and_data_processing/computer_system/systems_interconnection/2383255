CHAOS is a small (6Mbyte) Linux distribution designed for creating ad hoc computer clusters. CHAOS is a Live CD which fits on a single business card sized CD-ROM. This tiny disc will boot any i586 class PC (that supports CD booting), into a working openMosix node, without disturbing (or even touching) the contents of any local hard disk.
Designed for large-scale ad hoc clusters, once booted, CHAOS runs from memory allowing the CD to be used on the next node (and allowing for automated rebooting into the host operating system). CHAOS aims to be the most compact, secure and straightforward openMosix cluster platform available.
Note that the operating system described here is not related to the Clairmont High School Advanced Operating System (also called CHAOS) which ran on a MITS Altair 8800 modified using a custom bank-switched memory controller to allow time sharing.
