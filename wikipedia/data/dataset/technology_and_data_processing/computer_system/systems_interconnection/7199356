A circuit ID is a company-specific identifier assigned to a data or voice network between two locations, usually local telephone exchanges. The circuit is then leased to a customer by that ID. A subscriber having an issue with a circuit contacts the Controlling Local Exchange Carrier (Controlling LEC) telecommunications provider to provide this circuit ID for action on the designated circuit.
