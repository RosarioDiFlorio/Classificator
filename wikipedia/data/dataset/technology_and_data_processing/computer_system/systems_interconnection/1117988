IP aliasing is associating more than one IP address to a network interface. With this, one node on a network can have multiple connections to a network, each serving a different purpose.
In the Linux kernel, it was first implemented by Juan Jos√© Ciarlante in 1995. On Solaris this was called logical network interface and was first available in Solaris 2.5 in 1995. It has also been possible in Microsoft Windows NT since (at least) Windows NT 3.51, released in 1995.
IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. This demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example you could have one server that is acting as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server and DNS using 3 different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or indeed the opposite you could decide to replace the 3 different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration overhead.In this case you can have 3 different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install lots of physical network interfaces. Another reason is that you want to have the computer on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single physical interface.
