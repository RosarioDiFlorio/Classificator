Cascading is a software abstraction layer for Apache Hadoop and Apache Flink. Cascading is used to create and execute complex data processing workflows on a Hadoop cluster using any JVM-based language (Java, JRuby, Clojure, etc.), hiding the underlying complexity of MapReduce jobs. It is open source and available under the Apache License. Commercial support is available from Driven, Inc.
Cascading was originally authored by Chris Wensel, who later founded Concurrent, Inc, which has been re-branded as Driven  Cascading is being actively developed by the community and a number of add-on modules are available.
