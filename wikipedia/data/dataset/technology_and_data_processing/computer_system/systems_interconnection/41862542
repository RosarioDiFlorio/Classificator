Timable, an original word, means "able to time" according explanation on its website. The letter "e" is omitted in the word based on common English grammar, like "scalable", "writable". Timable represents vision of the platform - to search by time. Users can search for events, matching their spare time. However, the name is often mistaken as "timeable" or "timetable".
