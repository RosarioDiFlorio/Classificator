A microdatacenter is a small, self contained data center consisting of computing, storage, networking, power and cooling. Micro data centers typically employ water cooling to achieve compactness, low component count, low cost and high energy efficiency. Its small size allows decentralised deployment in places where traditional data centers cannot go, for instance edge computing for Internet of things.
