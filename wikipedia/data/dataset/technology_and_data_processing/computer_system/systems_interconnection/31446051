TorrentPier is a BitTorrent-tracker engine (primarily Russian-speaking) based on phpBB2. It is mainly used by Russian users, because of its use by the bittorrent tracker Rutracker.org.
The engine is completely written in PHP, including announcer. The organisation principle is torrent â†’ topic, that is each torrent is linked to a single topic on a forum. Torrent file is uploaded to the first message of a topic by the author, and then torrent is registered at the tracker. The tracker part of the engine is tightly integrated into the forum part, and it uses separate tables in the database, so it is possible to separate the tracker part (announcer) and make it work, for example, on a separate server.
At the moment there is an alternative version of announcer based on XBT Tracker written in C++.
