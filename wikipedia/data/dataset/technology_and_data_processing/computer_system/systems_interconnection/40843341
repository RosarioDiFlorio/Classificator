Discovery and Launch (DIAL) is a protocol co-developed by Netflix and YouTube with help from Sony and Samsung. It is a mechanism for discovering and launching applications on a single subnet, typically a home network. It relies on Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), and HTTP protocols. The protocol works without requiring a pairing between devices. It was formerly used by the Chromecast media streaming adapter that was introduced in July 2013 by Google. (Chromecast now uses mDNS instead of DIAL.) DIAL enables what the TV industry calls "2nd screen" devices, such as tablet computers and mobile phones to send content to "1st screen" devices, such as televisions, Blu-ray players, and set-top boxes.
