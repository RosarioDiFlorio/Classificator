G.ho.st (usually pronounced ghost) was the trading name of Ghost Inc. and the service name and URL of the company's hosted computer operating system or web desktop service. Its name is an acronym of Global Hosted Operating SysTem. The old URL G.ho.st was a domain hack (using the São Tomé and Príncipe .st country extension); the service later moved to https://web.archive.org/web/20091218032931/http://ghost.cc/. As of April 2010 Ghost has closed its service due to competition and lack of funding.
