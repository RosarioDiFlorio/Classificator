Protected Streaming is a DRM technology by Adobe. The aim of the technology is to protect digital content (video or audio) from unauthorized use.
Protected Streaming consists of many different techniques; basically there are two main components: encryption and SWF verification.
This technique is used by the Hulu desktop player and the RTÃ‰ Player. Fifa.com also uses this technique to serve the videos on the official site. Some videos on YouTube also use RTMPE, including those uploaded there by BBC Worldwide.
