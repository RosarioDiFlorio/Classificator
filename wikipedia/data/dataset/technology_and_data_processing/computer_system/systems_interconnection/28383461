BeeGFS is a parallel file system, developed and optimized for high-performance computing. BeeGFS includes a distributed metadata architecture for scalability and flexibility reasons. Its most important aspect is data throughput. BeeGFS is developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITWM) in Kaiserslautern, Germany and was initially known under the name FhGFS, short for Fraunhofer Gesellschaft File System (or Fraunhofer FS).
On ISC'14 in Leipzig, Fraunhofer presented the new name for the first time to the public, even though the renaming process had begun with the founding of a Fraunhofer spin-off.
The software can be downloaded and used free of charge from the projectâ€™s website.
