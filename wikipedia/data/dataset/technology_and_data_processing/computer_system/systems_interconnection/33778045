In cloud computing a carrier cloud is a class of cloud that integrates wide area networks (WAN) and other attributes of communications service providersâ€™ carrier grade networks to enable the deployment of highly demanding applications in the cloud. In contrast, classic cloud computing focusses on the data center, and does not address the network connecting data centers and cloud users. This may result in unpredictable response times and security issues when business critical data are transferred over the Internet.
