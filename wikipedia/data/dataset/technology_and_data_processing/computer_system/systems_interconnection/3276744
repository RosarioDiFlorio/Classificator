Internet Gateway Device (IGD) Standardized Device Control Protocol is a protocol for mapping ports in network address translation (NAT) setups, supported by a certain number of NAT-enabled routers. It is a common communications protocol of automatically configuring port forwarding, and is part of an ISO/IEC Standard  rather than an Internet Engineering Task Force standard.
