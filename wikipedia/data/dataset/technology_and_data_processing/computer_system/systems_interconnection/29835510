Task Analysis, Environment Modeling, and Simulation (TAEMS or TÃ†MS) is a problem domain independent modeling language used to describe the task structures and the problem-solving activities of intelligent agents in a multi-agent environment.
The intelligent agent operates in environments where:
responses by specific deadlines may be required
the information required for the optimal performance of a computational task may not be available
the results of the computations of multiple agents to interdependent subproblems may need to be aggregated together in order to solve a high-level goal
an agent may be contributing concurrently to the solution of multiple goals
