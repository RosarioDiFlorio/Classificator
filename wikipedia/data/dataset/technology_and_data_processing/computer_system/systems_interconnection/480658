There are a variety of specifications associated with web services. These specifications are in varying degrees of maturity and are maintained or supported by various standards bodies and entities. These specifications are the basic web services framework established by first-generation standards represented by WSDL, SOAP, and UDDI. Specifications may complement, overlap, and compete with each other. Web service specifications are occasionally referred to collectively as "WS-*", though there is not a single managed set of specifications that this consistently refers to, nor a recognized owning body across them all.
“WS-“is a prefix used to indicate specifications associated with web services and there exist many WS* standards including WS-Addressing, WS-Discovery, WS-Federation, WS-Policy, WS-Security, and WS-Trust. This page includes many of the specifications that might be considered a part of "WS-*".
