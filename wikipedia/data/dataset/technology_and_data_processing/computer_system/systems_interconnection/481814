A leased line is a private bidirectional or symmetric telecommunications circuit between two or more locations provided in exchange for a monthly rent. Sometimes known as a private circuit or data line in the UK.
Unlike traditional PSTN lines it does not have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected and dedicated to the other. Leased lines can be used for telephone, Internet, or other data services. Some are ringdown services, and some connect to a private branch exchange or router.
Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically distant offices. Unlike dial-up connections, a leased line is always active. The fee for the connection is a fixed monthly rate. The primary factors affecting the monthly fee are distance between end points and the speed of the circuit. Because the connection does not carry anybody else's communications, the carrier can assure a given level of quality.
An Internet leased line is a premium internet connectivity product, normally delivered over fiber, which provides uncontended, symmetrical speeds with full duplex. It is also known as an ethernet leased line, dedicated line, data circuit or private line.
For example, a T1 can be leased and provides a maximum transmission speed of 1.544 Mbit/s. The user can channelize the T1 to separate the 24 DS0 circuits for voice communication, partial the T1 for data and voice communications, or multiplex the channels into a single data circuit. Leased lines, as opposed to DSL, are being used by companies and individuals for Internet access because they afford faster data transfer rates and are cost-effective for heavy users of the Internet.
