Qi (pronounced  CHEE; from the Chinese word qi, "energy flow") is an open interface standard that defines wireless power transfer using inductive charging over distances of up to 4 cm (1.6 inches), and is developed by the Wireless Power Consortium. The system uses a charging pad and a compatible device, which is placed on top of the pad, charging via resonant inductive coupling.
Mobile device manufacturers that are working with the standard include Apple, Asus, HTC, Huawei, LG Electronics, Motorola Mobility, Nokia, Samsung, BlackBerry, and Sony.
First released in 2008, the Qi standard had by 2016 been incorporated into more than 140 smartphones, tablets and other devices.
