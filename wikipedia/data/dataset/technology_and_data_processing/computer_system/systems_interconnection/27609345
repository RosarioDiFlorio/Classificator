Decentralized network 42 (also known as dn42) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network built using VPNs and software/hardware BGP routers.
While other darknets try to establish anonymity for their participants, that is not what dn42 aims for. It is a network to explore routing technologies used in the Internet and tries to establish direct non-NAT-ed connections between the members.
The network is not fully meshed. Dn42 hardly uses physical links between the single networks but virtual ones. These virtual links use the Internet as transport but are logically independent from it, you can treat a virtual link more or less like a fiber or copper line. Everybody has a VPN connection to one or more participants. The connections are bound to a public IP address. If you decide to use GRE or SIT the diactc (Diac24 Tunnel Controller) updates the public IP address of the connection endpoint on IP changes. OpenVPN is capable of doing this without external help. Over the VPN connection BGP is used for inter AS routing and by default OSPF for intra AS routing, but participants may obviously use any protocol they see fit for the purposes of routing inside of their own AS.
