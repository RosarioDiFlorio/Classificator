The fat tree network is a universal network for provably efficient communication. It was invented by Charles E. Leiserson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985.
In a tree data structure, every branch has the same thickness, regardless of their place in the hierarchyâ€”they are all "skinny" (skinny in this context means low-bandwidth). In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are "fatter" (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy. In a telecommunications network, the branches are data links; the varied thickness (bandwidth) of the data links allows for more efficient and technology-specific use.
Mesh topology and the "hypercube" topology of Connection Machines have communication requirements that follow a rigid algorithm, and cannot be tailored to specific packaging technologies.
