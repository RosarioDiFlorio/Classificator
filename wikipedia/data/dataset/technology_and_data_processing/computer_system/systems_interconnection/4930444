A semantic Web service, like conventional Web services, is the server end of a clientâ€“server system for machine-to-machine interaction via the World Wide Web. Semantic services are a component of the semantic Web because they use markup which makes data machine-readable in a detailed and sophisticated way (as compared with human-readable HTML which is usually not easily "understood" by computer programs).
