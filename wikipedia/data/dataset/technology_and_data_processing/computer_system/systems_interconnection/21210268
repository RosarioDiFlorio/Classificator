WebSphere Business Events is IBM's implementation of an event-processing engine.
Event processing involves altering the existing server software in an organization to emit events (these are just small messages) whenever a notable event occurs. Event-processing software (such as this software) can monitor these events and look out for certain patterns of interest. This is useful for the prevention of Credit card fraud or for giving executives a high-level view of what's going on in their company (e.g. when share price drops for an extended period of time). For a more detailed description see complex event processing.
