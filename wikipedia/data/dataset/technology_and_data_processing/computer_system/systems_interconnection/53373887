Fermat is a collaborative, open-source technology project advocating for a free, secure, decentralized and disintermediated information space in which people's interests are placed ahead of those of corporations, states and unnecessary third parties in general.
Fermat leads the development of the Internet of People (IoP), a technology infrastructure consisting of interconnected peer-to-peer networks hosting peopleâ€™s profiles, reputation and identity information. The Internet of People allows the discovery of both known and unknown people and, ultimately, enables direct device-to-device communication over the Internet and direct person-to-person interactions via person-to-person applications. The Internet of People incorporates blockchain-based native tokens, IoPs, as incentive for operators running IoP software.
The Internet of People is meant to enable the person-to-person economy, a potentially disruptive innovation resulting from disintermediation in which people hold direct control and ownership of their data, digital footprint and purchasing power.
