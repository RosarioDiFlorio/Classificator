The Avast SecureLine is an internet security application developed by Avast Software that provides a subscription based virtual private network (VPN) service. It is available on Android, Microsoft Windows, macOS and iOS.
SecureLine users' internet traffic is encrypted and redirected through a tunnel via Avast data centers in order to anonymize their online activity, protect users from hacking and some forms of surveillance and allow an unrestricted access to the Internet. A VPN also prevents user's browsing data and history from being collected and sold by ISPs or other entities that would normally have access to them.
