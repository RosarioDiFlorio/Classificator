AMX192 (often referred to simply as AMX) is an analog lighting communications protocol used to control stage lighting. It was developed by Strand Century in the late 1970s. Originally, AMX192 was only capable of controlling 192 discrete channels of lighting. Later, multiple AMX192 streams were supported by some lighting desks. AMX192 has now all but been replaced in favour of DMX, and is typically only found in legacy hardware.
