An Active message (in computing) is a messaging object capable of performing processing on its own. It is a lightweight messaging protocol used to optimize network communications with an emphasis on reducing latency by removing software overheads associated with buffering and providing applications with direct user-level access to the network hardware. This contrasts with traditional computer-based messaging systems in which messages are passive entities with no processing power.
