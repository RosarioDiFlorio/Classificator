VideoLAN is a non-profit organization (just a project name until 1999) which develops software for playing video and other media formats. It originally developed two programs for media streaming, VideoLAN Client (VLC) and VideoLAN Server (VLS), but most of the features of VLS have been incorporated into VLC, with the result renamed VLC media player.
The said VideoLAN project began as a student endeavor at Ã‰cole Centrale Paris (France), but after releasing the software under the free software/open source GNU General Public License, the project is now multinational with a development team spanning 40 nations.
The current President of the VideoLAN non-profit organization is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, who is also one of the project's developers.
