Shadow (SDC) is a peer-to-peer privacy platform, created under an open source license, featuring a built-in cryptocurrency, end-to-end encrypted messaging and E-commerce. The decentralized network aims to provide anonymity and privacy for everyone through a simple user-friendly interface by taking care of all the advanced cryptography in the background. ShadowCash was created as the de facto currency for the peer-to-peer decentralized ShadowMarket (currently under development). The project began in July 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin (BTC) engineered to enhance the bitcoin protocol by adding dual-key stealth addresses and traceable ring signatures for increased transactional anonymity.
ShadowCash consensus is based on an open source protocol known as Proof-of-stake (PoSv3) and is not managed by any central authority, the network regulates itself.
