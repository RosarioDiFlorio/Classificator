Unigine is a proprietary cross-platform game engine, developed by Russian software company Unigine Corp. Apart from its use as a game engine, it is used for virtual reality systems, serious games and visualization. The strongest feature of Unigine is its advanced renderer which currently supports OpenGL 4.0 and DirectX 11. An updated Unigine SDK is released monthly.
Unigine tech demos are included as part of the Phoronix Test Suite for benchmarking purposes on Linux and other systems. A trial version of the engine, called the "Evaluation Kit", is provided to companies working on commercial projects.
