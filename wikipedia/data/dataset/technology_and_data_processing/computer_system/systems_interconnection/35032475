Digital One Line Link (DOLLx8) is a technology architecture that consists of data communications protocol, synchronous serial data bus and a communication system that is designed to make other interdisciplinary development projects within embedded systems and electronics much easier and more accessible to the users. DOLLx8 use ASCII characters in its data protocol, differential signaling in the bus system, where the communication consists of an active long-distance technology based on system logic where handling of the communication is done automatically by the microcontroller and its internal embedded Real-time operating system (RTOS) and software.
In today's world of communications most people knows of Local Area Network (LAN) which is based on Ethernet, a network system used in personal computers where one PC is able to talk to another PCs. In embedded system, RS-232 TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) has dominated the market over a longer period of time as the most common communication standard that also works as an internal embedded network system. With the use of MAX 232 integrated circuit (IC), the RS-232 TTL may connect to an external RS-232 connection where the immediate advantage of using MAX 232 is that there is no need of using positive and negative power supply. It is also possible to connect to USB via RS-232 to USB converter, and even if the original standard for RS-232 was basically a point-to-point system for the serial port on PCs, it is still possible to use RS-232 in small local area network using micro-controller and source code to control the signals and data transmission.
A DOLLx8 embedded network uses its own specific interface system named DOLLx8 Dataport that via DOLLx8 eMaster unit connects to external RS-232 and from there to USB directly, but requires the installation of a separate DOLLx8 driver. DOLLx8 runs on its own internal clock system that allows the DOLLx8 Dataport bus speed to be independent of the RS-232 baud speed set on the PC side, and can thus be determined by the user. With DOLLx8, USB works as an virtual communication port and can be set to a maximum speed of 128,000 Kbps.
