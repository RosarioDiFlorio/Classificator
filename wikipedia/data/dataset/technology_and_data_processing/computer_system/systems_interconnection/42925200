Software-defined protection (SDP) is a computer network security architecture and methodology that combines network security devices and defensive protections which leverage both internal and external intelligence sources. An SDP infrastructure is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure. The SDP architecture partitions the security infrastructure into three interconnected layers. The Enforcement Layer inspects traffic and enforces protection within well-defined network segments. The Control Layer generates security policies and deploys those protections to enforcement points. The Management Layer orchestrates the infrastructure and integrates security with business processes. The SDP architecture supports traditional network security and access control policy requirements, as well as the threat prevention required for enterprises implementing technologies such as mobile computing and software-defined Networking (SDN).
