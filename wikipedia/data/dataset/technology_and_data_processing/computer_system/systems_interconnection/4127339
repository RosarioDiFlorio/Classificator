FreeCast is a free software application which allows peer-to-peer streaming, sometimes called peercasting. It makes possible an audio (Ogg Vorbis) or video (Ogg Theora) stream broadcast to a large number of listeners from a simple DSL connection.
The FreeCast client used by listeners does not require any configuration to work. FreeCast nodes support NAT traversal.
FreeCast is made up of Java applications released under the GNU GPL and is available for most operating systems.
