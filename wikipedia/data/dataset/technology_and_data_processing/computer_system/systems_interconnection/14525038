IncrediBuild is a suite of grid computing software developed by Xoreax Ltd. IncrediBuild is designed to help accelerate computationally-intensive tasks by distributing them over the network, with notable applications including compiling source code, building software generally, and other software development-related tasks. Jobs can be distributed to several computers over a network, giving both the possibility of accelerating the work by using more resources than were available on the initiating computer alone, and potentially freeing local resources for other tasks.
IncrediBuild tools are available for Microsoft Windows and Linux, and have out-of-the-box support for accelerating builds targeting those platforms as well as Android, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and other platforms. Originally sold specifically as a tool to accelerate compiling, IncrediBuild can now be used for other development processes as well as general high performance computing.
