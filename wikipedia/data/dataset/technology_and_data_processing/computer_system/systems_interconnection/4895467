Causal consistency is known as one of the main weak memory consistency models that can be used to assign consistency restrictions to all memory accesses for distributed implementations of data structures in the domain of concurrent programming. For example, in distributed shared memory and distributed transactions.
Other stronger consistency models like sequential consistency and linearizability have downsides such as: they take too long and require more space; also in terms of implementation, they are unattainable in some situations. Due to those reasons, causal consistency was proposed in the nineties  as a weaker consistency model in order to improve the performance and gain in efficiency when defining the semantics of memory accesses in shared memory models. In causality, distributed executions are represented as partial orders based on Lamport's concept of potential causality.
