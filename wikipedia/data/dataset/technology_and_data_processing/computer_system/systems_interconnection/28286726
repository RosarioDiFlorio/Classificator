An electronic leash is the pairing (“leashing”) of one or more wireless devices to a host device that allows the user to find misplaced or out-of-sight objects by activating the host device such that the “leashed” object identifies itself. The system is identical in concept to a key pager, but offers multiple codes that allow a single user-operated device to send codes to a large number of objects. Leash systems generally also offer a form of distance measurement that raises an alarm if the leashed object travels more than a selected distance from the operator. A electronic leash with a paired devices usually includes a power source, transmitter and receiver. Optional elements can include tactile, auditory, or visual indicators to help the user realize the distance traveled from the object is past the maximum. Along with the physical elements, it is very common to have a computer program or mobile application to allow for modification of factory settings of distance allowed from source to receiver and the indication of this event occurring.
