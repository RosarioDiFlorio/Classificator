SIOS LifeKeeper Single Server Protection for Linux is a high-availability cluster software, for Linux computer systems. It provides application cluster capabilities to systems running databases, file sharing on a network, electronic commerce websites, or other applications.
It was originally designed and developed by AT&T Bell Labs in 1992 to ensure high availability of their worldwide voice network system running on Unix-based Star Servers. After AT&T divested the LifeKeeper division to NCR, SIOS, then called SteelEye, acquired the technology in 2000. SteelEye was later acquired in 2006 by SIOS Technology Corp.
