Hola is a freemium web and mobile application which claims to provide a faster, private and more secure Internet. It provides a form of virtual private network services to its users through a peer-to-peer network. It also uses peer-to-peer caching. When a user accesses certain domains that are known to use geo-blocking, the Hola application redirects the request to go through the computers and Internet connections of other users in non-blocked areas, thereby circumventing the blocking. This also means that other users might access the Internet through one's own computer, and that part of one's upload bandwidth might be used for serving cached data to other users. Paying users can choose to redirect all requests to peers but are themselves never used as peers.
