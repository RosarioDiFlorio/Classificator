TNAPS is a freeware .NET cross-platform application server for .NET, Mono, and Java, with component-driven architecture. It is based on the concept of application business logic separation into middleware layer. This is also called three-tier software architecture. Although there are many application servers for Java platform, there are no cross-platform application servers for .NET and Mono. The main principle of TNAPS is that a developer has to write business logic only and would be able to host it and set user access policy, database parameters and other configuration without writing code â€“ just by existing component reusage.
Current version of TNAPS requires .NET 4 (Windows) and Mono 2.10.1 (Linux and Mac OS X)
