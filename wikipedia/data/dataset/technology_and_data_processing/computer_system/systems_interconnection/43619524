The Intermediate System to Intermediate System protocol (IS-IS), is defined in the IETF proposed standard RFC 6329, is used as the control plane for IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB requires no state machine or other substantive changes to IS-IS, and simply requires a new Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) and set of TLVs.
SPB allows for shortest-path forwarding in an Ethernet mesh network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths. This permits SPB to support large Layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology. Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership. IS-IS is therefore augmented with a small number of TLVs and sub-TLVs, and supports two Ethernet encapsulating data paths, 802.1ad Provider Bridges (PB) and 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB).
SPB is designed to run in parallel with other network layer protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6. Standards mandate that the failure of two nodes to establish an SPB adjacency will not have collateral impact, such as the rejection of an adjacency for other network layer protocols (e.g. OSPF).
