In the field of computer security, Libreswan is a fork of the Openswan IPsec VPN implementation created by almost all of the Openswan developers after a lawsuit about the ownership of the Openswan name was filed against Paul Wouters, the release manager of Openswan, in December 2012. The lawsuit was later settled out of court. The Libreswan project has an active community of developers and contributors with regular releases. They can be found on the #swan channel on the Freenode IRC service.
