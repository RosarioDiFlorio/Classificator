The Minimum intrusion Grid (commonly MiG) is an effort to design and develop a modern grid computing system that has minimal requirements for usage yet still maintains a security for all participants in the system.
MiG currently covers three separate projects:
MiGrid is a project to develop the software itself.
MiGrid is a development grid, usually running the latest MiGrid software.
Grid.dk is the national Danish grid, slated to run the MiGrid software, mixed with other Grid middelware, such as NorduGrid.
