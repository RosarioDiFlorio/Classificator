The Digital Media Access Protocol (DMAP) is the family of proprietary protocols introduced by Apple that are used by iTunes, iPhoto, Remote and other software to share media across a local network.
DMAP addresses the same problems for Apple as the UPnP AV standards address for members of the Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA).
