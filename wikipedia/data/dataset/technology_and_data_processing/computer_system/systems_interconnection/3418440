E-Speak was a middleware technology created by Hewlett-Packard in 1999. The platform is considered to be one of the first pre-SOAP web services platforms and was nominated for a Smithsonian award. The goal of this project was to provide the infrastructure for global service interaction over the Internet. Discontinued in 2002, it is a technology similar to CORBA, LDAP and lately, Web service.
