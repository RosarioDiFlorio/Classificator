Virtual Distributed Ethernet is a set of programs to provide virtual software-defined Ethernet Network Interface Controllers across multiple devices, typically computers, which are either virtual or physical. It forms part of the Virtual Square project from the Italian Bologna University whose code is available on public servers using free software licenses, mostly GPLv2. Researchers at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Xavier University, Cincinnati OH are also working on the project.
It is one of the available networking methods for the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and forms part of some Linux distributions such as Ubuntu Precise (12.04 LTS)
