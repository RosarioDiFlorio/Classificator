Sector/Sphere is an open source software suite for high-performance distributed data storage and processing. It can be broadly compared to Google's GFS and MapReduce technology. Sector is a distributed file system targeting data storage over a large number of commodity computers. Sphere is the programming architecture framework that supports in-storage parallel data processing for data stored in Sector. Sector/Sphere operates in a wide area network (WAN) setting.
The system was created by Yunhong Gu (the author of UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol) in 2006 and was then maintained by a group of other developers.
