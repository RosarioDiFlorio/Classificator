The consortium MANCOOSI (MANaging the COmplexity of the Open Source Infrastructure) is a project financed by the European Union that focuses on the creation of a solid yet flexible structure for handling packages, controllers and libraries in operating systems based on Unix, as well as standardizing packages handled by the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) for DEB and RPM.
Several institutions collaborate on this project: University Paris Diderot, University of L'Aquila, Mandriva/Edge-IT, Tel Aviv University, Pixart, and Caixa MÃ¡gica.
