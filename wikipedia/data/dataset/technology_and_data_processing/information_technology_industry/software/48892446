Automatic bug-fixing is the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer.  It is also commonly referred to as automatic patch generation, automatic bug repair, or automatic program repair. The typical goal of such techniques is to automatically generate correct patches to eliminate bugs in software programs without causing software regression.
