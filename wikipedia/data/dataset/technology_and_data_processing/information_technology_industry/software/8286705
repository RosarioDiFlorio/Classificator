Phase One Media Pro (formerly Microsoft Expression Media and iView Media Pro) is a commercial digital asset management cataloging program for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X operating systems. It is the next version of iView MediaPro which Microsoft acquired in June 2006, and sold again in May 2010 to Phase One, which also makes the Capture One raw converter software. The software is aimed at professionals and photo enthusiasts who need a photo manager which makes it easier to manage photo and video assets, especially very large resolution image files and libraries with many items.
