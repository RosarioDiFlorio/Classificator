Retail software is computer software typically installed on PC type computers or more recently (past 2005) delivered via the Internet (also known as cloud-based). Traditionally this software was delivered via physical data storage media sold to end consumer but very few companies still provide their software using physical media. The software is typically sold under restricted licenses (e.g. EULAs) or in the case of cloud-based software sold as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.
