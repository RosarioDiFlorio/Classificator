KnowledgeMan was an early computer database management system (DBMS) created by Micro Data Base Systems (mdbs) of Lafayette, Indiana. KnowledgeMan was introduced in 1983 and was a PC-sized version of the company's mdbs III mainframe computing database software. KnowledgeMan was promoted to users of dBase as faster database and using more sophisticated computing power. It had a macro language and SQL "structured query language" that allowed reports, its own spreadsheet interface and statistical graphics, i.e., pie charts, bar charts, etc. KnowledgeMan was designed by David Bartkus.
KnowledgeMan was the first DBMS to be ported from a mainframe system. It was the first DBMS written for the 16-bit PC processor. KnowledgeMan was the first to separate the database engine from the command interface, something that Microsoft Access was lauded for a decade later.
mdbs developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for KnowledgeMan (by then more frequently called KMan) in 1985, although this was not popular with developers, who preferred to use the software's command line interface. mdbs in 1986 introduced Guru, an expert system that incorporated KnowledgeMan's database and GUI. In the mid-1990s, KnowledgeMan was folded into Guru.
In 2004, mdbs folded and its product line was taken over by Savitar Corporation. Savitar folded in 2008.
