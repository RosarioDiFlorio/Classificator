NetBeans is a software development platform written in Java. The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications based on the NetBeans Platform, including the NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE), can be extended by third party developers.
The NetBeans IDE is primarily intended for development in Java, but also supports other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++ and HTML5.
NetBeans is cross-platform and runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM.
The editor supports many languages from Java, C/C++, XML and HTML, to PHP, Groovy, Javadoc, JavaScript and JSP. Because the editor is extensible, you can plug in support for many other languages.
The NetBeans Team actively supports the product and seeks feature suggestions from the wider community. Every release is preceded by a time for Community testing and feedback. Over 18 million downloads of the NetBeans IDE to date, and over 800,000 participating developers, the NetBeans project is thriving and continues to grow.
A new version 8.2 was released on October 3, 2016. NetBeans IDE is the official IDE for Java 8. With its editors, code analyzers, and converters, you can quickly and smoothly upgrade your applications to use new Java 8 language constructs, such as lambdas, functional operations, and method references.
