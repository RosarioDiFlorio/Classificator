This is a list of old Macintosh software that no longer runs on current Macs. The software might require Mac OS 9 or other versions of the classic Mac OS that can't run on Apple's current Intel machines. Note that most old programs can still be run using emulators, such as SheepShaver, vMac, or Basilisk II.
For a list of current programs, see List of Macintosh software. Third-party databases include VersionTracker, MacUpdate and iUseThis. Since a list like this might grow too big and become unmanageable, this list is confined to those programs for which a Wikipedia article exists.
