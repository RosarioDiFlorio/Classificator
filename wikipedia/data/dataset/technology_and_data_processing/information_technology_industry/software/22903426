This is a compendium of continuous integration software which support a software engineering practice, continuous integration, in which developer's changes are immediately tested and reported when they are added to the mainline code base. The comparison of various continuous integration tools is done on the basis of platform, license, builders and Integration IDEs.
These software aid in enabling continuous delivery and increase a developer's productivity by giving in-time feedback. This ultimately leads to an improved code quality thus improving the overall software quality.
