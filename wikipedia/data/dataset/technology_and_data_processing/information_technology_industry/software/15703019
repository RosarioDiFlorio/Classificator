BB FlashBack is a Windows-based screen recording program, distributed by Blueberry Software. Recently, it was renamed as simply 'FlashBack'. It allows the user to add text effects, cut and paste movie footage and edit mouse movements. Recordings are initially saved in a proprietary format which can be opened and edited in the associated editor. Once editing is complete they can be exported to Flash, AVI, and a variety of other formats. A PowerPoint plug-in is also deployed with the programâ€™s installer. A freeware version of this program was released in April 2009.
The development company that makes the program began in 1997 as Blueberry Consultants, a bespoke software development company producing tailor-made software projects. In summer 2003, Blueberry Software was created and released the first version of BB FlashBack.
