SQRL or Secure, Quick, Reliable Login (pronounced "squirrel" /ˈskwɝl/  en ) (formerly Secure QR Login) is a draft open standard for secure website login and authentication. The software solution typically uses a link of the scheme sqrl:// or optionally a QR code, where a user identifies via a pseudonymous zero-knowledge proof rather than providing a user ID and password. This method is thought to be impervious to a brute force password attack or data breach. It shifts the burden of security away from the party requesting the authentication and closer to the operating system implementation of what is possible on the hardware, as well as to the user. SQRL was proposed by Steve Gibson of Gibson Research Corporation in October 2013 as a way to simplify the process of Authentication protocol, without requiring a third party, thus possibly revealing information about the transaction.
