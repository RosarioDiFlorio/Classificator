Linkinus was a shareware IRC client for Mac OS X and iOS. It has an Aqua-style user interface, and allows Cocoa plugins, AppleScript, and Growl notifications to be used. Linkinus also features embedded media, although some users have complained that this can cause the program to slow down, or even crash, especially on slow computers. Linkinus also has other features similar to those of other IRC clients, such as multitasking and the ability to change between different user interface styles.
Despite the developer tweeting in late 2012 that Linkinus was still under active development, it has not seen any updates since April 2012.
