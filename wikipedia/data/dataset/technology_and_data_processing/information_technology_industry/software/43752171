iPhone OS 1 is the first major release of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhone OS 1.1.5 is the latest and the last version of Apple's iPhone OS 1. This version of iOS was the first iteration of the touch-centric mobile operating system. No official name was given on its initial release; Apple marketing literature simply stated that the iPhone runs a version of Apple's desktop operating system, macOS, then known as OS X. On March 6, 2008, with the release of the iPhone software development kit (iPhone SDK), Apple named it iPhone OS (they later went on to rename it "iOS" on June 7, 2010).
The iPhone OS 1.1.3 update cost $19.95 for iPod Touch users.
