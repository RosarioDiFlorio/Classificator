CAI format is an ultra-high compression, scalable, hierarchical audio/video format initially developed by Jorg Nonnenmacher  in February 2000.
CAI format exists for live and file-based content. Files in CAI format have the ending .cai. All common formats used in audio/video production, distribution, and consumption can be transcoded to CAI format. To obtain CAI format, transcoding products can transform common audio/video formats used in content production, distribution, and consumption to CAI format.
The CAI format is today owned by PreciseStatistics GmbH, a German company, that obtained the rights to the format in 2004 when the initial creator of the CAI format assigned all rights to the company. PreciseStatistics developed the live and on-demand transcoding products for the CAI format and provides services and technology based on the CAI format under the Caipy brand.
