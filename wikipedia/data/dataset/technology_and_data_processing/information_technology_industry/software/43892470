Bvckup 2 is a undirectional file synchronization app for the Windows NT family, developed by Swiss-based Pipemetrics SA. It replicates files from one location to another in their original format and uses delta copying to speed up its operation. The program supports scheduling, removable device tracking, using Shadow Copy service to transfer open or locked files, move and renaming detection, security attribute cloning, and email alerts. However, it does not support compression or encryption.
