Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters (zh:開源人年會, or COSCUP)，is an annual conference held by Taiwanese Open source community participants since 2006. It's a major force of Free software movement advocacy in Taiwan. The event is often held in two days, with talks, sponsor and communities booths, and Birds of a feather (computing). In addition to international speakers, many Taiwanese local Open Source contributors often give their talks here. The chief organizer, other staffs, and speakers are all volunteers.
COSCUP's aim is to provide a platform to connect Open Source coders, users, and promoters, and promote FLOSS with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend because of the enthusiastic sponsors and donators. Since the conference venue is limited, tickets are often sold out immediately after the online registration starts.
The lightweight Desktop Environment LXDE was announced at COSCUP 2006.
