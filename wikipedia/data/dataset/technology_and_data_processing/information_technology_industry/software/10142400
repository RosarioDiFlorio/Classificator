LitwareHR is a fictitious HR application released in February 2007 as part of Microsoft's SaaS architecture guidance. Aimed at software architects and developers, the goal of LitwareHR is twofold:
To be the embodiment of the architectural guidance described in Microsoft's whitepapers
To demonstrate how the Microsoft platform is used in the creation of SaaS solutions
This reference implementation application provides recruitment management software delivered as a service. The important aspect is not what the application does but how it is implemented.
