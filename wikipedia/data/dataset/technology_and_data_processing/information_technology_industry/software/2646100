OpenBase SQL is a relational database server software, originally developed for the OpenStep platform. First released in 1991, OpenBase is available today for several platforms, although the bulk of its users are on Mac OS X. The system supports common access methods via JDBC and C, however it is optimized for use in conjunction with a variety of Macintosh-based development tools like WebObjects, RealBasic and Omnis Studio.
