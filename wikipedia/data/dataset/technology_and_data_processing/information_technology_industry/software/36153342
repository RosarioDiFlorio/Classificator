MultiEx Commander is a game resource archive manager for Windows published by the Xentax Foundation. Some features include a built-in MexScript (AKA BMS) interpreter, file extractor and importer, stand alone mod creator EasyMod.
This application is currently written by Mike Zuurman in Visual Basic. The first versions of the program were written in Borland Turbo C in 1998 and 1999 as user interface for a command line DOS archiving tool, called multiex, that was created in 1997. The program is extensible by programmers via a plugin-API. The first multiex release was built around MexScript, a custom script written specifically to enable programmers to process (game) archives by simply typing a few lines of script. All the low-level events would be carried out by the main program. MexScript (or BMS as it is also called, after Binary MultiEx Script) is still a prominent feature of the tool, as the user can write scripts via the built-in script window. It also enables the use of QuickBMS scripts, a later third party produced improvement (or "forking") of the original MexScript.
Additionally, MultiEx Commander can create stand-alone mods for games via the EasyMod creator. Custom changes made to certain game archives (such as sounds, or textures) are stored as a stand-alone program, enabling users to distribute their mods without others needing MultiEx Commander.
The Windows version is donateware: users can download it after they donate a certain amount to the Xentax Foundation (currently $10). After that, they can download it and use it indefinitely.
