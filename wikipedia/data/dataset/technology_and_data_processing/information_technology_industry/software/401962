Adabas is Software AGâ€™s enterprise database management system that was designed for reliability, high performance, scalability and low total cost of ownership.
Adabas is primarily known for its transaction processing speed under very high and unpredictable workloads. In a test at IBM Poughkeepsie in late 2012, Adabas benchmarked over 1 million commands per second.
Developed to handle shortcomings of RDBMs with the 3rd normal form, Adabas makes it possible to store multiple data relationships in the same table, thus there are no data redundancies, such as found in relational database systems. Adabas provides diverse functionality, including support for any type of data structure and data access and replication features to participate in data warehouse, business intelligence and big data environments. There is no standard SQL engine built into Adabas but, since 2004, the Adabas SQL Gateway was introduced (through a recently acquired company, CONNX) to handle the SQL shortcoming.
