The Client Access to Integrated Services and Information (CAISI) project aims to reduce the plight of chronic homelessness by enhancing the integration of care between agencies at the individual and population levels using an electronic information system. As such, the project goals can be summarized as:
development of an open source project that leverages OSCAR McMaster,
integrating shelter and health care information for homeless people,
and by using the system, building community and agency capacity.
The project builds on Seaton House - St. Michael's Hospital SHIFE experience, the Toronto District Health Council Discharge planning Toolkit, and the Homeless Health Reference Group.
