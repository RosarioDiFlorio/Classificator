pfs:Write was a simple word processor created by Software Publishing Corporation (SPC) in the early days of desktop computing. It was intended for DOS systems, but Apple II versions were also released.
It included all the basic features common to most word processors of the day, including automatic word wrapping, spell checking, copy and paste, underlining, and boldfacing; and it also boasted a few of the most-commonly-used advanced features, such as mail merge and few others. The product was considerably easier to both learn and use than its far more fully featured and expensive DOS word processing competitors, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and XyWrite.
pfs:Write was announced in 1983 and it was part of a family of products released by SPC under the "pfs:" brand (Personal Filing System) which, when installed onto the same computer, combined to form a sort of office suite which included companion products pfs:File in 1980 (a database), pfs:Plan (a spreadsheet), pfs:Report in 1981 (reporting software), and pfs:Graph in 1982 (business graphics software). Other, mostly utilitarian products bearing the "pfs:" brand subsequently emerged, including pfs:Access (for data communications), pfs:Easy Start (a menuing utility), and pfs:Proof (a proofreading utility). Eventually, SPC offered a low- to mid-level desktop publishing product called pfs:Publisher; and it packaged the core word processing, database and spreadsheet products into an suite named pfs:Office.
A Windows 3.0 version, called Professional Write Plus 1.0, was released in 1991.
The last version, Professional Write 3.0 for DOS, was released in 1994.
