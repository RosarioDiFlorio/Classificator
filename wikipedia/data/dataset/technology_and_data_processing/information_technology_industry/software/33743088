A comparison of network diagram software finds a number of tools exist to generate computer network diagrams. Broadly, there are three types of tools that help create network maps and diagrams:
Hybrid tools
Network Monitoring tools
Drawing tools
Network mapping and drawing software support IT systems managers to understand the hardware and software services on a network and how they are interconnected. Network maps and diagrams are a component of network documentation. They are required artifacts to better manage IT systems' uptime, performance, security risks, plan network changes and upgrades.
