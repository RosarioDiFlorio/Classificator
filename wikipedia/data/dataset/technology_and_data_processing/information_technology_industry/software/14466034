Planetarium software is application software which allows a user to simulate the daytime and nighttime sky on a computer. Such applications can be as rudimentary as displaying a star chart or map for a specific time and location, or as complex as rendering photorealistic views of the sky. While some planetarium software is meant to be used exclusively on a personal computer, some applications can be used to interface with and control telescopes or planetarium projectors. Optional features may include inserting the orbital elements of comets and other newly discovered bodies for display
