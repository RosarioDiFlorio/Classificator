Jaikoz is a Java program used for editing and mass tagging music file tags.
Jaikoz generates acoustic fingerprints from music files using the AcoustId service, it can then look up the metadata from MusicBrainz using the AcoustId, additionally it can match based on metadata to MusicBrainz or Discogs. Matching is first applied at album level, falling back to track level where a match at album level could not be made. This allows Jaikoz to automatically fix most of a users song collection.
Jaikoz uses a relatively unusual spreadsheet metaphor for both viewing and editing data, and allows editing of over fifty fields using this spreadsheet interface, the underlying jaudiotagger tag library is released under LGPL and is used by various Java applications.
Jaikoz is commercially licensed software, written in Java 1.5 by Paul Taylor. A shareware version, in which changes can only be saved to 20 files during one use, is also available as a 30-day free trial. 10% of every sale is paid to the MetaBrainz Foundation to support MusicBrainz development.
