The EPUB3 standard was released by the IDPF in 2011; however, even a year after the standard was released, most readers do not fully support this standard.
This version of the standard adds rich media capabilities such as:
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
JavaScript scripting capabilities for interaction and animation
Support for CSS3 (and HTML5)
MathML
Video support
Media overlay (read aloud) an option to add audio to text or images
