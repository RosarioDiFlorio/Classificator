Dubsmash is a video messaging application for iOS and Android created by Jonas Dr√ºppel, Roland Grenke and Daniel Taschik. Using the application, users can choose an audio recording or soundbite from movies, shows, music, and internet trends and record a video of themselves dubbing over that piece of audio.
