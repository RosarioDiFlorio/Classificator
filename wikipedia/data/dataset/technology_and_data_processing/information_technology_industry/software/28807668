NotScripts was a free and open-source extension for Google Chrome, Chromium, and Opera web browsers. NotScripts blocked execution of JavaScript, Java, Flash, Silverlight, and other plugins and scripted content. NotScripts used a whitelist to allow execution of scripts from certain sites.
NotScripts has been abandoned by the developer. It was removed from the Chrome Extension store in September 2014.
