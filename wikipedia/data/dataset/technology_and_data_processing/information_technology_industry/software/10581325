A permission-driven user interface (PDUI) is a user interface in which the appearance or non-appearance of menu items or functions is driven by the access permissions granted to a user.
Users can see very different user interfaces in the same system based on their permissions levels.
The system is intended to improve the user experience by removing items that are unavailable to the user. A user who sees functions that are unavailable for use may become frustrated. It also provides an enhancement to security by hiding functional items from unauthorized persons.
