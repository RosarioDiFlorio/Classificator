Physalis is a project to build software that allows users to run a service framework (OSGi-like) on top of Microsoft .NET capable devices and computers. The project itself is a collaborative work of two persons, Karen Tamrazyan and Romuald Tisserand. In fact, this is the first attempt ever to create something like OSGi framework for .NET platform. It is also supposed to work with the .NET Compact Framework and thus support diverse embedded devices like Pocket PCs, Smartphones and custom solutions based on the Windows CE embedded operating system.
