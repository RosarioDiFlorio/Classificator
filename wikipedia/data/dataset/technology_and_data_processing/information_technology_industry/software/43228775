Zinstall WinWin is a PC migration software, which allows to transfer applications, settings and files from one computer to another. It is used by consumers and businesses to keep user environment and data intact when moving to a new computer or doing a PC refresh.
A more advanced version of the product (Zinstall Rescue Kit), allows to rescue user's applications, setting and data directly off the old computer's hard drive, in situations when the old computer cannot be turned on or loaded successfully.
