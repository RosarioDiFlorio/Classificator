Apache OpenOffice (AOO) is an open-source office productivity software suite. It is one of the successor projects of OpenOffice.org and the designated successor of IBM Lotus Symphony. Apache OpenOffice is a close cousin of LibreOffice and NeoOffice. It contains a word processor (Writer), a spreadsheet (Calc), a presentation application (Impress), a drawing application (Draw), a formula editor (Math), and a database management application (Base).
Apache OpenOffice's default file format is the OpenDocument Format (ODF), an ISO/IEC standard. It can also read and write a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office (although unlike LibreOffice, it cannot save Microsoft's newer XML formats like DOCX, only import them).
Apache OpenOffice is developed for Linux, macOS and Windows, with ports to other operating systems. It is distributed under the Apache License. The first release was version 3.4.0, on 8 May 2012.
In January 2015 the project reported a lack of active developers and code contributions. After ongoing problems with unfixed security vulnerabilities through 2015 and 2016, in September 2016 the project started discussions on possibly retiring AOO. Security issues in Version 4.1.3 were known from January 2017, with 4.1.4 not being released until October 2017.
Despite the problems with development, the software continues to attract a large number of downloads, approximately 100,000 per day, a similar number to that of LibreOffice.
