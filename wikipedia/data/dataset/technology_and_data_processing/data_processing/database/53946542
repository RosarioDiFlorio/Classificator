æternity is a public, open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing and digital-asset platform that builds upon decentralized cryptographic P2P technology. Real-world data can interface with smart contracts through decentralized "oracles". Scalability and trustless Turing-complete state channels set æternity apart from other Blockchain 2.0 projects.
æternity provides a virtual machine which can execute scripts using an decentralized global network of public nodes maintaining the blockchain. State channels enable smart contracts to remain private and scalable as long as there is no disagreement between the counterparties. Inherently integrated in æternity is a value token called an "æon" or "AE token", which can be transferred between participants and is used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed. AE tokens are used to pay for space and computation time on the virtual machine and prevent spam on the network while allocating storage and computation time proportionally to the incentive offered by the request.
