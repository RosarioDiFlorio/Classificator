GlobalSpec is a technology services company which provides a search engine of engineering and industrial products, indexing over 180 million parts divided into 2,300,000 product families, from over 24,000 manufacturer and distributor catalogs. GlobalSpec is a domain-specific (or "vertical search") tool, in that its focused domain allows for optimized results. Within product families, searches can be narrowed by selecting values for parameters that are specific to that product type.
The website has over five million registered members, and as of 2009, membership was growing at a rate of 20,000 per week(membership required to view simple product specifications). In 2007, the company achieved 35% revenue growth, the sixth year in a row that the company achieved double-digit revenue growth. The website has approximately 3.8 million visitors a month. GlobalSpec has partnerships with several well-known companies, including:
