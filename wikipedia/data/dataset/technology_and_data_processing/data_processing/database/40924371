The National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP) is an online, searchable database of interventions designed to promote mental health or to prevent or treat substance abuse and mental disorders. The registry is funded and administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The goal of the Registry is to encourage wider adoption of evidence-based interventions and to help those interested in implementing an evidence-based intervention to select one that best meets their needs.
