NewsLibrary is an online news database developed by Knight Ridder that houses a conglomeration of news from over "4,000 outlets in the United States", most of which are "traditional" sources of news coverage, such as "newspapers and television stations". A total of 65 different newspapers are included in the article database. The database itself allows a user to input a search term and then narrow the listed search by date, region and newspaper, with the earliest possible articles to find being from the early 1980s. The site charges a fee for viewing the content, which is done on a pay-per-article scale, with each article costing $1.95. The cost of viewing articles is charged to the user accounts on a monthly basis, though there is the option to purchase 100 articles directly for $77.
It is described as a successor to the web archive VU/TEXT that was owned by Knight Ridder and shut down in 1996.
NewsLibrary differs from other news databases in that the site allows the user to input a date, region, and newspaper, but nothing in the search bar; this brings up all of the articles published within the narrowed selection string, rather than searching for the use of a term or phrase within an article.
