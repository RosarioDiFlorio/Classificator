Jasmine Directory is a human-edited web directory providing websites categorized topically and regionally. The directory offers a range of thirteen topic-based categories and one region-based category with hand-picked and reviewed users' suggested resources.
Jasmine Directory's editors manually add resources to the index (90% of the listings in Jasmine Directory were added manually, according to co-founder Robert Gombo»ô); site owners can also suggest their websites for review by paying a fee, however, inclusion is not guaranteed if the suggested resources don't comply with the editorial guidelines, in which case the review fee is fully refunded.
