Seeks is a free and open-source project licensed under the Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3). It exists to create an alternative to the current market-leading search engines, driven by user concerns rather than corporate interests. The original manifesto was created by Emmanuel Benazera and Sylvio Drouin and published in October 2006. Since then, the project has been under active development and stable releases of the engine are available for public use in addition to various distributions of the source code for adventurous users. In September 2011, Seeks won an innovation award at the Open World Forum Innovation Awards. Seem to be discontinued, as the source code haven't been updated since April 28, 2014 and all Seeks nodes are not usable since February 6, 2016.
