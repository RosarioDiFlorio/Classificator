Database System Concepts, by Abraham Silberschatz and Hank Korth, is a classic textbook on database systems. It is often called the sailboat book, because its first edition had on its cover a number of sailboats, labelled with the names of various database models. The boats are sailing from a desert island towards a tropical island, while the wind pushes them away and prevents their arrival.
The book is currently in its sixth edition. The third edition added S. Sudrashan as an author.
