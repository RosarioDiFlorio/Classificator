Gitorious was a shared web hosting service for collaborative free and open-source software development projects that use the Git revision control system. The name also refers to the free and open-source server software that the Web site is developed and hosted on. According to the Git User's Survey in 2011, Gitorious was the second most popular hosting service for Git, with 11.7% of respondents indicating they use it, behind 87.5% using GitHub. On 3 March 2015, Gitorious was acquired by GitLab B.V., who announced service through gitorious.org would be discontinued on 1 June 2015 and encouraged Gitorious users to make use of its import tools to migrate projects to GitLab.
