Not to be confused with ATG Dynamo, a J2EE application server
Dynamo is the name given to a set of techniques that when taken together can form a highly available key-value structured storage system or a distributed data store. It has properties of both databases and distributed hash tables (DHTs). Amazon DynamoDB is "built on the principles of Dynamo" and is a hosted service within the AWS infrastructure. It was created to help address some scalability issues that Amazon.com's website experienced during the holiday season of 2004. By 2007, it was used in Amazon Web Services, such as its Simple Storage Service (S3).
