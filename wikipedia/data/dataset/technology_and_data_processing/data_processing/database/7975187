The Blue Letter Bible Project is an initiative of Sowing Circle, a United States-based, non-denominational Christian ministry, who have created a Study Bible in both CD format and for the internet. Sowing Circle, a California 501(c)(3) Private Operating Foundation, was founded in November 1995. The Project supports 12 English Bible translations, Hebrew and the Septuagint for the Old Testament, and the Greek Textus Receptus and Westcott-Hort versions for the New Testament. Integrated study tools include Gesenius' Lexicon for the Old Testament, and Thayer's Lexicon for the New Testament, as well as English and Strong's Concordances for the entire Bible. Dozens of Bible Commentaries are also available.
A series of free instructional videos entitled "Introducing the Blue Letter Bible" is available on YouTube. There is also a Blue Letter Bible iPhone and Android app.
The Blue Letter Bible is so called because of the blue color of the hyperlinks. The name "Blue Letter Bible" also contrasts with the term red letter Bible which is a common form of printed Bible with key words, such as the words of Jesus, highlighted in red.
