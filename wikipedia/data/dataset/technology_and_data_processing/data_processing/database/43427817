Relcy was an American corporation specializing in mobile search. It was a stealth mode company funded by Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures. Relcy was founded by Rohit Satapathy and Nitin Gupta in mid-2013, notably with funding obtained by a cold tweet to Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures.
The company received both positive and negative criticism for re-attempting a search start-up with Google having dominated the industry for over a decade.
In February 2016 Relcy added a messaging system to its mobile search engine and announced the launch of an Android app.
In June 2016, Relcy announced they were shutting down.
