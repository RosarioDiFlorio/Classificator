Operation Angel Watch is an intelligence-driven program targeting registered sex offenders traveling abroad who ICE believes are likely to engage in child sex tourism. By evaluating patterns and trends, ICE identifies high risk countries to compare with the travel plans of persons included in sex offender registry. Since the inception Operation Angel Watch, nearly 300 suspected CST perpetrators have been identified. In 2007, Angel Watch sent 1,700 leads to 100 countries.
The 2014 bill to establish the Angel Watch Center was described as an "International Megan's Law". A 2010 Government Accountability Office report had found that at least 4,500 U.S. passports were issued to registered sex offenders in fiscal year 2008. Congressman Chris Smith noted, "The goal is reciprocal notice between countries."
