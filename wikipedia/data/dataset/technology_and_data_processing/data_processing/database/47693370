Steam Spy is a website created by Sergey Galyonkin launched in April 2015. The site uses an application programming interface (API) to the Steam software distribution service that is owned by Valve Corporation to estimate the number of sales of software titles offered on the service. Estimates are made based on the API polling user profiles from Steam to determine what software titles (primarily video games) they own and using statistics to estimate overall sales. Software developers have reported that Galyonkin's algorithms can provide sales numbers that are accurate to within 10%, though Galyonkin cautions against using his estimates in financial projections and other business-critical decisions.
