The National Heritage List for England (NHLE) is Historic England's official of buildings, monuments, parks and gardens, wrecks, battlefields and other heritage assets considered worthy of preservation. Properties on the list, or located within a conservation area, are protected from being altered or demolished without special permission from local government planning authorities.
The passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 established the first part of what the list is today, it established a list of 50 prehistoric monuments which were protected by the state. Further amendments to this act increased the levels of protection and added more monuments to the list. The Town and Country Planning Acts created the first listed buildings and the process for adding properties to it. Currently more than 600,000 properties are listed individually. Each year additional properties are added to the National Register as part of the different constituent registers that are part of the list.
The National Heritage List for England was launched in 2011 as the statutory list of all designated historic places including listed buildings and scheduled monuments.
The list is managed by Historic England (formerly known as English Heritage), and is available as an on-line database with 400,000 listed buildings, registered parks, gardens and battlefields, protected shipwrecks and scheduled monuments. A unique reference number, the NHLE Code, is frequently used to refer to the related database entry, such as 1285296 â€“ this example is for Douglas House; a Grade II* listed building in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.
