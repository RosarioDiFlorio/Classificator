The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. As of 2016, over ten million URLs of images have been hand-annotated by ImageNet to indicate what objects are pictured; in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. The database of annotations of third-party image URL's is freely available directly from ImageNet; however, the actual images are not owned by ImageNet. Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes.
