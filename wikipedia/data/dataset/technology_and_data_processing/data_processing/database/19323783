Jamendo is a music website and an open community of independent artists and music lovers. It bills itself as "the world's largest digital service for free music".
Jamendo was originally introduced as a service for releasing music under the Creative Commons licenses. As of October 2015, Jamendo no longer advertises its music as Creative Commons but rather "free streaming / free download" for personal use. The goal of Jamendo is to connect musicians and music lovers from all over the world, and to bring together a worldwide community of independent music, creating experiences and value around it.
At the center of Jamendo is an economic model that grants free music downloads for web users, while at the same time providing revenue opportunities for artists through commercial uses, via the music licensing platform Jamendo Licensing which sells licenses for music synchronization and background music.
Based in Luxembourg, the website has a community of 3 million members.
At the end of 2013, the catalog offered over 400,000 tracks by 30,000 artists from 150 countries. As of January 2015, the Jamendo homepage shows a count of 460,000 tracks available, and a total of +250 million downloads since the launch of the platform.
As of December 2016, 40,000 artists from 150 countries trust Jamendo, sharing more than half a million songs to be streamed and downloaded for free. The site is available in 8 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese
The name "Jamendo" is a portmanteau derived from a fusion of two musical terms: "jam session" and "crescendo".
