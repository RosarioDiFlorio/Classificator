BerliOS (short for "Berlin Open Source") was a project founded by Fraunhofer FOKUS, the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems located in Berlin, to coordinate the different interest groups in the field of open source software (OSS) and to assume a neutral coordinator function. The target groups of BerliOS were developers and users of open source software on the one side and OSS-related companies on the other.
BerliOS consisted of several subprojects:
Developer, a hosting platform for open source projects similar to SourceForge.net, GNU Savannah and JavaForge
DocsWell, a database for open source related documentation
SourceWell, a news service for open source projects
SourceLines, a "best practice" database for successful open source projects
SourceBiz, a list of open source companies
DevCounter, a database of open source developer profiles
OpenFacts, a wiki-based open source knowledge database (using the MediaWiki software)
SourceAgency (beta), a platform for coordinating open source funding
