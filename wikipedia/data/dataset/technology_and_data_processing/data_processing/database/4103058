Tigris.org is an open source software development community. It hosts software development services such as web hosting, mailing lists, issue tracking, wiki, download, and revision control with Subversion or Concurrent Versions System (CVS). It is hosted by CollabNet, the initiators and stewards of Subversion, and runs CollabNet Enterprise Edition. Portions of the Subversion project itself are hosted on Tigris. Tigris competes with the better-known SourceForge, although it is primarily focused on projects for collaborative software development.
Since July 2014, tigris.org does not accept new project proposals.
