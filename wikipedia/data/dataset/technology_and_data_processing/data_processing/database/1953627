IWon.com was a free casual game site and web portal that offered the chance to win cash for charities through activities such as playing online games. iWon started as a Web Portal, similar to Yahoo!, that entered its users into daily, weekly, monthly cash prize drawings. Users earned entries drawing based on a point system for using the website. Activities that earned points included clicking on links, using the search features and participating in its online games. The site was shut down on January 6, 2016.
Among major early backers of iWon was Viacom, parent of CBS, UPN and MTV. It is now owned by Barry Diller's IAC.
