Data Mining Extensions (DMX) is a query language for Data Mining Models supported by Microsoft's SQL Server Analysis Services product.
Like SQL, it supports a data definition language, data manipulation language and a data query language, all three with SQL-like syntax. Whereas SQL statements operate on relational tables, DMX statements operate on data mining models. Similarly, SQL Server supports the MDX language for OLAP databases. DMX is used to create and train data mining models, and to browse, manage, and predict against them. DMX is composed of data definition language (DDL) statements, data manipulation language (DML) statements, and functions and operators.
