The OneWeb satellite constellation—formerly known as WorldVu—is a proposed constellation of approximately 648 satellites expected to provide global Internet broadband service to individual consumers as early as 2019. The constellation is proposed by the company WorldVu Satellites Ltd., which has used the alternate name L5 in various regulatory filings. OneWeb is registered in St. Helier, Jersey and is expected to require up to US$3 billion in capital by the time the full constellation becomes operational in 2019–2020.
The 648 communication satellites will operate in circular low Earth orbit, at approximately 750 miles (1,200 km) altitude, transmitting and receiving in the Ku band of the radio frequency spectrum. Most of the capacity of the initial 648 satellites has been sold, and OneWeb is considering nearly quadrupling the size of the satellite constellation by adding 1,972 additional satellites that it has priority rights to.

The company's business plan is to attempt to "reach hundreds of millions of potential users residing in places without [existing] broadband access."
