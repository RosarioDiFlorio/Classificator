Preservation metadata is an essential component of most digital preservation strategies. As an increasing proportion of the worldâ€™s information output shifts from analog to digital form, it is necessary to develop new strategies to preserve this information for the long-term. Preservation metadata is information that supports and documents the digital preservation process. Preservation metadata is sometimes considered a subset of technical or administrative metadata.
