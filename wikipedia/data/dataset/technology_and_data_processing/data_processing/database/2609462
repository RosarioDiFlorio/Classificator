astalavista.box.sk was founded in 1994 as one of the first search engines for computer security information. In practice it turned out to be used as a search engine for security exploits, software for hacking, cracking and different keygenerators and software cracks. The site is also known for referencing things such as spyware and viruses and because of this the website is known to possibly contain data, links, downloadable files, and information some users would consider spyware, adware, or other unwanted programs.  Astalavista.box.sk is hosted in Slovakia. Astalavista is a pun on the Spanish phrase said by The Terminator: "Hasta la vista, baby" (meaning "see you later, baby").
Astalavista is also used to refer to other computer security related websites like the Astalavista Security Group.
