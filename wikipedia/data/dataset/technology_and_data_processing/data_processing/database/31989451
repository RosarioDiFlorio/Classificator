BTDigg was the first BitTorrent DHT search engine. It participated in the BitTorrent DHT network, supporting the network and making correspondence between magnet links and a few torrent attributes (name, size, list of files) which are indexed and inserted into a database. For end users, BTDigg provides a full text database search via Web interface. The web part of its search system retrieved proper information by a user's text query. The Web search supported queries in European and Asian languages. The project name was an acronym of BitTorrent Digger (in this context digger means a treasure-hunter). It went offline in June 2016, reportedly due to index spam. The site returned later in 2016 at a dot-com domain, but has since shut down again.
