The name Grokker is inspired by the 1961 Robert A. Heinlein science fiction classic Stranger in a Strange Land, in which Grok is a Martian word meaning literally ‘to drink’ and metaphorically ‘to be one with.’ To grok something is to understand something so well that it is fully absorbed into oneself. It is to look at every problem, opportunity, action, and point of view from any and all perspectives.
