Twing.com was a search engine specializing in internet forum content, located in Jersey City, New Jersey, with data centers around the world. Twing.com used vertical searching as a forum search service that seeks out communities based on common forum formats. The product disappeared from the Web in late November, 2008, when the product division's parent company Accoona ceased business operations.
In early 2013, a new startup named Twing.co launched. Beyond their common name, these companies are not related. Twing.co is a peer-to-peer professional networking platform supported by a knowledge based search engine that focuses on open innovation and collaboration. It was recently named among the Top 20 New Big Data Startups by DataWeek.
Twing.com did not use the typical web crawler method but recognizes the footprint and structure of forum content and indexes such content according to its context, and then allows for word sense disambiguation of concepts through use of topical category and other filters.
Additionally, prior to ceasing operations, Twing.com began collecting and indexing content from Twitter and other real-time user generated content sources.
