Douban.com (Chinese: 豆瓣; pinyin: Dòubàn), launched on March 6, 2005, is a Chinese social networking service website allowing registered users to record information and create content related to film, books, music, recent events and activities in Chinese cities. It can be seen as one of the most influential web 2.0 websites in China. Douban also owns an internet radio station, which ranks No.1 in iOS App Store in 2012. Unlike Facebook and Renren, Douban is open to both registered and unregistered users. For registered users, the site recommends potentially interesting books, movies, and music to them in addition to serving as a social network website and record keeper; for unregistered users, the site is a place to find ratings and reviews of said media.
Douban has about 200 million registered users in 2013.
The site serves pan-Chinese users, and its contents are in Chinese. It covers works and media in Chinese and in foreign languages. Some Chinese authors and critics register their official personal pages on the site.
