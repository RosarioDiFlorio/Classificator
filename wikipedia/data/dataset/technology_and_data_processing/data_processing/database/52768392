A supra-entity is a conceptual element derived from the Entity-Relationship (E-R) technique for information system modeling. It is similar to an entity, but it is defined at a higher level, encompassing individual entity occurrences, their parts, groups and groups of parts or parts of groups.
The concepts supra-entity, supra-relationship and supra-attribute were created and published by González & Muller in their work “Business Entity-Relationship Model: For Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Management ”, and applied for the first time in this work to conceptually model the key elements and interrelationships of “business” reality.
Supra-entities, supra-relationships and supra-attributes have the objective of covering the diversity of situations and perspectives existing in reality, through the integrated representation at a higher level of individual occurrences, its multiple parts and groups of entities and relationships according to different criteria, its structures, its properties or attributes and its association with other supra-entities at any level of partition or grouping.
