The California Code of Regulations (CCR, Cal. Code Regs.) is the codification of the general and permanent rules and regulations (sometimes called administrative law) announced in the California Regulatory Notice Register by California state agencies. Such rules and regulations are reviewed, approved, and made available to the public by the Office of Administrative Law (OAL), and are also filed with the Secretary of State.
The CCR consists of 28 titles and contains the regulations of approximately 200 regulatory agencies. Title 24, the California Building Standards Code, is not maintained by the OAL but by the California Building Standards Commission. The regulations have substantial portions under copyright (e.g., Title 24, the California Building Standards Code), but still have the force of California law. Some regulations, such as the California Department of Social Services Manual of Policies and Procedures concerning welfare in California, are separately published (i.e., "available for public use in the office of the welfare department of each county").
Its role is similar to the Code of Federal Regulations. Unlike the Federal Register, California regulations are not normally published in the Notice Register, meaning that until they are codified in the CCR they must be obtained from the individual agencies or elsewhere.
