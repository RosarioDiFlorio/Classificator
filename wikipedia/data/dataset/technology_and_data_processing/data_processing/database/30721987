Pongr is a mobile photo marketing and technology company that develops image recognition, artificial intelligence and direct response advertising tools for companies of all sizes to monetize their customer-shared photos on social networks. Brands use the Pongr platform to automate and manage direct-response programs, loyalty and social campaigns, multi-channel promotions and shopper marketing initiatives.
Pongr's image recognition technology is used by brands such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Arby's, Nestle and 7-Eleven to make logos and product packaging interactive with mobile phone cameras. The Pongr system processes customer-submitted photos as the entries in contests, sweepstakes and promotions, and also ties photo sharing on social networks to brand loyalty programs.[1] Pongr is an alternative technology to QR codes or bar codes.

In the crowded photo app and photo-sharing software market, Pongr is positioning itself as the only social sharing platform for brands that can monetize the millions of customer photos posted daily on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other sites. Consumer photos are monetized by integrating them with brands' existing CRM databases.
