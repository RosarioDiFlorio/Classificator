Project Baseline is a broad effort to map human health, led by Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), Alphabet, Inc.'s health sciences division, and was announced in the Wall Street Journal on July 24, 2014. It begins with the Project Baseline study, which will collect phenotypic health data from approximately 10,000 participants over the course of at least four years. The project employs experts from widely varying fields including science, medicine, user experience and design, engineering and patient advocacy. The project is not the first one to aim to collect data on many individuals for medical purposes, but it aims to collect a much larger amount of data covering a broader array of topics than its predecessors. De-identified Project Baseline study data will be available to qualified researchers for exploratory analysis in the future. Qualified external researchers may apply through applications reviewed by the Proposal Review and Publications Committee and Scientific Executive Committee.
