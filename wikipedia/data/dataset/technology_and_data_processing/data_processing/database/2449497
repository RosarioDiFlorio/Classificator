Rectifi was an online search engine which channels profited it earns to charity.
Rectifi was set up by Jonny Platt as a successor to GiveAsYouGet. As well as a general search engine with sponsored adds, rectifi earns revenue through eBay, and a comparison shopping feature. The site also provides information on how to reduce pollution and make a difference to poverty in the developing world at home.
The charities that benefit are picked on a quarterly basis, and have included Voluntary Service Overseas, World Development Movement and Greenpeace. Platt has appeared on the BBC's "Click Online" programme to help publicise the site.
