Perma.cc is a web archiving service for academic citations founded by the Harvard Library Innovation Lab in 2013. It was created in response to studies showing high incidences of link rot in publications, both academic publications and judicial opinions. By archiving copies of linked resources, and providing them a permalink, perma.cc is intended to provide longer-term verifiability and context for academic literature and caselaw. Perma.cc is administered by a network of academic and government libraries.
Perma.cc initiates page saves by user request only, it does not crawl the web and save pages like the Wayback Machine. A user account is required to save a page. Its target audience are organizations such as libraries, academic journals, law courts and school faculty. It provides support for organizational membership and administration of user accounts. Metadata such as notes can be added which are viewable to members within an organization. Pages can be made public or private within an organization. Individual accounts are also available but limited to 10 page saves per month.
Perma.cc saves both a Web ARChive (or "warc") file format version and a screen-shot version in .png
Perma.cc has an API for functions such as adding or deleting pages. Perma.cc is part of the Memento network thus all public pages can be searched for (by URL) using the Memento API.
