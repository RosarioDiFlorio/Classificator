The BFI Film & TV Database (ftvdb) is an online database of information related to movies, television shows, actors, production crew personnel, video games and fictional characters featured in visual entertainment media, from the UK. It is a part of the British Film Institute. On 26 June 2014, the database disappeared from the internet, with every page redirecting to listings on the BFI's main site.
