The website sophistication rate is measured by search engines and is based on page rank and internet presence.
A good sophistication rate is defined differently by search engines. To Bing, for example, a successful sophistication rate may be defined by the overall ranking of a website and based on its customer visits. To Google, a successful sophistication rate may refer to a better internet presence in social media based websites and a large amount of NoFollow links.
For websites that seek to generate offline responses, for example people talking about how sophisticated your website is or how large your website logo is, measuring sophistication rates can be difficult because it is not automatically traced to its source, as you cannot monitor peoples speech. Possible solutions include asking each person or shopper how they heard about the business.
