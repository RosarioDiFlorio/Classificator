Intute was a free Web service aimed at students, teachers, and researchers in UK further education and higher education. Intute provides access to online resources, via a large database of resources. Each resource is reviewed by an academic specialist in the subject, who writes a short review of between 100 and 200 words, and describes via various metadata fields (such as which subject discipline(s) it will be useful to) what type of resource it is, who created it, who its intended audience is, what time-period or geographical area the resource covers, and so on. As of July 2010, Intute provided 123,519 records. Funding was stopped in 2011, and the site closed.
A partial archive of the Intute library is maintained at XtLearn.net
