GoHook is a crawler-based search engine. It debuted in October 2003 and was officially launched in February 2004. Initially GoHook indexed completed auctions from eBay, after receiving permission from the listers (sellers) of those auctions. Even though eBay publicly asserts they're "just an auction venue," they claim this practice violates their policy and in April 2004 asked GoHook to stop downloading and hosting completed auctions.
In reaction, GoHook began crawling for and hosting PDF files and has cached over 700,000. The PDF files are also converted to HTML and ASCII text.
In February 2005, GoHook began offering an email capture and search tool which helps Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance.
