Internet-in-a-Box is a low-cost digital library, consisting of a wireless access point with storage, which users nearby can connect to.
Its realization in hardware and software has changed since 2012, as miniaturization of storage space and electronics progressed. As of 2017, its hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi with a replaceable storage card.
Columbia University's Masters in Public Administration in Development Practice (MPA-DP) has explored using these boxes in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, since 2016.
