A canonical cover 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   for F (a set of functional dependencies on a relation scheme) is a set of dependencies such that F logically implies all dependencies in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   logically implies all dependencies in F.
The set 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   has two important properties:
No functional dependency in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   contains an extraneous attribute.
Each left side of a functional dependency in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   is unique. That is, there are no two dependencies 
  
    
      
        a
        →
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\to b}
   and 
  
    
      
        c
        →
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\to d}
   in 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{c}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=c}
  .
