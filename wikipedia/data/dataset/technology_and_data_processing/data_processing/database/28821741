The Virtual Library of Musicology or VifaMusik (German: Virtuelle Fachbibliothek Musikwissenschaft) is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to provide sources and materials for music and musicology. The project has been active since July 2005 at the Bavarian State Library, in cooperation with the State Institute for Musicological Research in Berlin and the German Musicological Society.
