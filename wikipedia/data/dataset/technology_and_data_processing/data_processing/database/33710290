AUPEO! was a personalized internet radio service.
On October 28, 2016, Aupeo announced that The AUPEO! Service will cease general public operations on November 30, 2016. 
The service offered over 120 pre-developed stations, covering a range of genres; these included Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, R&B, Heavy Metal, Country, House, Techno, Classical, and Punk. Users were able to select stations that follow a theme, genre, or musical mood. In addition to these stations, users could also listen to ‘Artist Stations’, stations that play music related to an artist selected by the user. Aupeo’s ‘Mood Tuner’ allowed users to listen to stations specifically based on musical mood (happy, relaxing, aggressive, dramatic, stressful). AUPEO! was the first audio app to team up with Volkswagen cars using MirrorLink technology. It is also available in Audi vehicles.
Aupeo is a licensed webcaster in more than 40 countries worldwide. The company was formed in 2008 in Berlin as Aupeo GmbH and is financed by venture capital.
As of November 2011, the Aupeo archive encompassed around 900,000 tracks.
