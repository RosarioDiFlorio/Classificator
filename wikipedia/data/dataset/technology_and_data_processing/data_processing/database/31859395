Swissnex is a network of science and technology outposts aimed at connecting Switzerland with the world's innovative hubs. The network is managed by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) in cooperation with the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). There are currently six Swissnex branches: Boston (2000), San Francisco (2003), Singapore (2004-2015, ceased operations), Shanghai, China (2007), Bangalore, India (2011) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2013).
Since 2003, the network has relied on public and private funding (one third from the SERI and two thirds from other sources). Each Swissnex branch offers a variety of services to Swiss companies, academics, policy-makers, and others.
The SERI also maintains and develops a worldwide network of science and technology counsellors sharing the Swissnex mission. For the moment, twelve science and technology counsellors work at selected Swiss embassies.
Recognised among politicians and administrators, the network is very present on the front of innovation and technology cooperation. Its implication for the Swiss economy and research are however so far unclear compared to the costs of such a network. The choice for the locations of Swissnex outposts is questionable: Europe seems to be forgotten.
