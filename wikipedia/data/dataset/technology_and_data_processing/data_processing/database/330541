Yahoo! Groups is one of the worldâ€™s largest collections of online discussion boards. The term Groups refers to Internet communication which is a hybrid between an electronic mailing list and a threaded Internet forum, in other words, Group messages can be read and posted by e-mail or on the Group's webpage like a web forum. In addition, members can choose whether to receive individual, daily digest or Special Delivery e-mails, or simply read Group posts on the Group's Web site. Groups can be created with public or member-only access. Some Groups are simply announcement bulletin boards, to which only the Group moderators can post, while others are discussion forums.
It is not necessary to register with Yahoo! in order to participate in Yahoo! Groups. The basic mailing list functionality is available to any e-mail address, but a Yahoo! ID is required to access most other features.
Despite their popularity Yahoo! Groups have been called "a goldmine... Yahoo! has never cashed in on". As of 2013, Hari Vasudev oversees Yahoo Groups and Yahoo! Answers., however as of 2017 he's no longer there.
