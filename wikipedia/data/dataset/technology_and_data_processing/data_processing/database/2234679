The Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD) is an online database of information pertaining to, in America, the pornography industry: actors, actresses, directors, and pornographic films. It is similar to the Internet Movie Database, in that it is open to the public and is searchable. Films produced by the non-American pornographic industry are found on the database if a U.S. release is available and the film concerned is presented as bearing the information about the U.S. release, not the original one.
