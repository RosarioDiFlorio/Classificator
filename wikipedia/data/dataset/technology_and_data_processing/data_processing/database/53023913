TV White Space database, also commonly referred to as geolocation database, is an entity that controls the TV spectrum utilization by unlicensed white spaces devices within a determined geographical area. Its sole objective is to enable unlicensed access to white space spectrum while protecting incumbent broadcasting services. TV White Space database was first brought as a way to overcome the technical hurdles faced by spectrum sensing techniques to precisely detect very weak primary signals.
Spectrum is deemed available, or unavailable, to unlicensed usage depending on criteria that are regulator specific and thus the database operation can significantly vary between countries. Regulations on white space spectrum utilization are of extreme importance since they pose limits to the amount of white space spectrum that can be reclaimed by White Space technology for wireless broadband access. Having a certain degree of spectrum accessibility is crucial to the relevance and the successful adoption of TVWS as a technology.
The FCC and the Ofcom were the first two spectrum regulators to draft rules enabling unlicensed access to unused TV spectrum in US and UK, respectively,. Similar actions were taken by regulators from other countries including Industry Canada and iDA of Singapore. Currently, many companies have obtained authorization to operate geolocation databases upon successfully complying to regulatory requirements.
