Artsy is a free online platform designed to connect collectors to art. Artsy's search engine and database draw connections and map relationships among works of art.  Led by Carter Cleveland, computer science graduate from Princeton and Sebastian Cwilich, former executive of Christie's and Haunch of Venison director, Artsy aims “to make all the world’s art accessible to anyone with an internet connection."
Artsy is backed by a group of investors, including Eric Schmidt, Wendi Murdoch, Dasha Zhukova, Thrive Capital, Jack Dorsey, Bob Pittman, Rich Barton, Jim Breyer, Keith Rabois, David Tisch, Chris Dixon, Peter Thiel, Charlie Cheever, Dave Morin, and David Kidder. John Elderfield, former chief curator at New York’s Museum of Modern Art serves as Artsy’s senior advisor and Larry Gagosian and Marc Glimcher, president of Pace Gallery, are advisors.
