Lyrically (formerly known as LyricWikia or LyricWiki) is an online wiki-based lyrics database and encyclopedia. In March 2013, it was the seventh largest MediaWiki installation with over 1,800,000 content pages including 1.5 million songs. Users on the site can view, edit, and discuss the lyrics of songs, which are also available for purchase from links on the site. The site is searchable by song, artist, album, genre, hometown, label, and language. Users are told to be mindful of copyright while contributing, and copyright violations are removed upon request. All the lyrics on LyricWikia are licensed through LyricFind.
