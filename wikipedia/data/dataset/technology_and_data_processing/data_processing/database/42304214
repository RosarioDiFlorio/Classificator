Mapping the World of Women's Information Services  is an on line database of women's information centres, libraries and archives. It was developed in 1998 in the Netherlands by the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women’s Movement (IIAV) in collaboration with the Royal Tropical Institute, and Oxfam, GB, with a grant from UNESCO. Presently Atria, institute on gender equality and women’s history, the successor of the IIAV, maintains the database.
It contains almost 600 women's information centres from over 130 countries and can be accessed through the Atria website.
