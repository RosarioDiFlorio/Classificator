Info.com was a metasearch engine which provides results from leading search engines and pay-per-click directories, including Google, Yahoo!, Bing.com, Ask, LookSmart, About and Open Directory. It is based in London, United Kingdom.
Info.com is partnered with other search providers to include comparison shopping and product reviews, a selection of news, health, pictures, video, classifieds, jobs, White Pages and Yellow Pages, tickets, flights, hotels, weather, maps and directions.
Info.com formerly fetched results from several other popular search engines, but now, just like Yahoo!, it just a search engine powered by Bing (although the site never mention anything about that).
