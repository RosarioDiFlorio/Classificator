In mathematical analysis and computer science, functions which are Z-order, Lebesgue curve, Morton order or Morton code map multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality of the data points. It was introduced in 1966 by Guy Macdonald Morton. The z-value of a point in multidimensions is simply calculated by interleaving the binary representations of its coordinate values. Once the data are sorted into this ordering, any one-dimensional data structure can be used such as binary search trees, B-trees, skip lists or (with low significant bits truncated) hash tables. The resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would get from a depth-first traversal of a quadtree.
