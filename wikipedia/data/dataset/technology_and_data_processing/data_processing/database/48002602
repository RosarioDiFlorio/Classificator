Mayfield Mall was a shopping mall in Mountain View, California, that operated from the 1960s until 1984. It was the first air-conditioned, enclosed shopping mall in Northern California, though since the 1980s it has spent its life as an office complex. In 2013, Google rented the entire 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) property and ultimately purchased the property in 2016 for $225 million; it is now known as the company's Building RLS1.
