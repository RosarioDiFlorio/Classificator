Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s proprietary globally-distributed, multi-model database service "for managing data at planet-scale" launched in May 2017. It builds upon and extends the earlier Azure DocumentDB, which was released in 2014. It is schema-less and generally classified as a NoSQL database.
