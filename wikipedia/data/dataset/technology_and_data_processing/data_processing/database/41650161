Svensk mediedatabas (Swedish Media Database) is a search engine for the audiovisual works of the National Library of Sweden.
The database contains data about TV, radio, video, movies that have been shown in cinemas, gramophone records, CDs, cassette tapes, video games and multimedia. The SMDB contains most Swedish broadcasts and publications since 1979, but also older works. There is an almost complete list of Swedish gramophone records starting from the end of the 19th century. The SMDB also contains information about special collections such as older advertisement films and video recordings from Swedish theatres.
As of 2011, the database contains information about nearly eight million hours of audiovisual content.
