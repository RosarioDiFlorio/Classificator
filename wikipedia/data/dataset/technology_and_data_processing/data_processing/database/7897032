The Hong Kong Movie DataBase (HKMDB) is a bilingual (English and Chinese) website that was created in 1995 by Ryan Law to provide a repository for information about movies originating from Hong Kong and the people who created them.
The database was initially populated with data on over 6000 films, and reviews from the defunct database hosted at egret0.stanford.edu. In subsequent years it has expanded to contain information on more than 18,000 films and 71,000 people, and to include many films from Taiwan and Mainland China.
The database can be searched by movie title or by person's name.
