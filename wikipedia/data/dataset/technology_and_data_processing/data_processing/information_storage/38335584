It is Malaysiaâ€™s 1st and largest home grown video streaming service with over 6.9 million users and is experiencing a growth of over 18,000 members weekly.
Bringing things up a notch in April 2016, tonton was transformed into a hybrid video service alongside its brand new apps offering both FREE membership and the newly introduced premium service - coined tonton VIP.
Starting from just RM3, FREE members who upgrade to tonton VIP will unleash the true power of tonton - giving VIP members unrestricted access to a library containing almost 30,000 hours of local and syndicated content, exclusive LIVE events in HD, video ad-free experience, download and watch later functionality, enjoy VIP perks at events and much more. Viewers who upgrade to the tonton VIP membership will also get to binge watch all exclusive content, dramas and more months before it premieres on TV.
In addition, tonton offers advertising opportunities to advertisers with unlimited possibilities for their brands to reach both FREE and tonton VIP users.
