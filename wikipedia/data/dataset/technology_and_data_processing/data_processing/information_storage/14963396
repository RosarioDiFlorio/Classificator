Produced for a child and young adult audience, segments in each series depict everyday life and the challenges and concerns of those living in the locations and regions featured. Each film is 2–4 minutes in length, with each series containing approximately 40 films.
The ProjectExplorer series is distributed internationally without charge via the web by ProjectExplorer, LTD. an American not-for-profit organization.
