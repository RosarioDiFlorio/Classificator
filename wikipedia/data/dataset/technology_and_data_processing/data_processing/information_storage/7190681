PPS.tv (PPStream) is a Chinese peer-to-peer streaming video network software. Since the target users are on the Chinese mainland, there is no official English version, and the vast majority of channels are from East Asia, mostly Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Programmes vary from Chinese movies to Japanese anime, sports channels, as well as popular American TV and films.
It had an 8.9% market share in China in Q3 2010, placing it third - behind Youku and Tudou. In May 2013, the online video business of PPS.tv was purchased by Baidu for $370 million. After the acquisition, PPS.tv continued to operate as a sub-brand under iQIYI, Baiduâ€™s online video platform.
