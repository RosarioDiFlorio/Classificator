Prager University (often stylized as PragerU) is a 501(c)3 non-profit conservative digital media organization.
PragerU was founded in 2009 by radio talk show host Dennis Prager and radio producer and screenwriter Allen Estrin and is not an academic institution and does not offer certifications or diplomas.
Prager created Prager University with Estrin as his business partner in order to present his conservative views and to offset what he regards as the undermining of college education by the left. The videos usually feature a speaker who argues a particular side of a debate for about five minutes.
Since a lawsuit over use of a photograph in 2013, Prager University has used animation in its videos. As of November 2017, its YouTube channel included about 320 videos. The organization depends on donations. According to its CEO, Marissa Streit, a group of approximately 500 students, "PragerFORCE", promotes its videos.
On October 23, 2017, PragerU filed a lawsuit against Google claiming that 37 of its videos were unfairly demonetized or flagged so that they could only be viewed in restricted mode.
