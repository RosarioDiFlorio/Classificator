TVCatchup is an Internet television service for viewing free-to-air UK channels. It operates as a cable service and retransmits BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5, and ITV, amongst others, only in the UK. Users can access the service via desktop browsers as well as smartphone and tablet apps. The service is funded by advertising, with a pre-roll advertisement preceding the live channel stream.
The service was originally launched in 2007 as a personal video recorder in the cloud, before being redesigned as a live-streaming service. As of October 2013, it has nearly 10 million active users, according to the company, with 2 million viewers tuning in to the service to watch the England versus Poland FIFA World Cup qualifier on 15 October 2013.
On 4 June 2014 TVCatchup Ltd went into administration by order of London's High Court of Justice. The service remains online, despite winding up and liquidation orders made in May 2015. In August 2017, Bruce Pilley, a former director of the company, was banned from being a company director for nine years for failing to disclose that the company had a winding up order against it when drawing down a loan.
