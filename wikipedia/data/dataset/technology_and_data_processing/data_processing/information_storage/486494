CD+G (also known as CD-G, CD+Graphics and TV-Graphics) is an extension of the compact disc standard that can present low-resolution graphics alongside the audio data on the disc when played on a compatible device. CD+G discs are often used for karaoke machines, which use this functionality to present on-screen lyrics for the song contained on the disc. The CD+G specifications were published by Philips and Sony in an updated revision of the Red Book specifications.
The first CD to be released with CD+G graphics was Eat or Be Eaten by Firesign Theatre in 1985. The CD+EG is a similar format that allows for better graphics, but has been used very rarely.
