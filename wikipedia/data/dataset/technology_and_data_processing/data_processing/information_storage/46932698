The 2015 Texas pool party incident, also known as the "McKinney pool party", was an American civil disturbance that occurred on June 5, 2015, at a pool party in a gated McKinney, Texas, community. A McKinney police officer, corporal Eric Casebolt, was video-recorded restraining Dajerria Becton, a fifteen year old black girl wearing a swimsuit, on the ground. He later drew his handgun during the same incident. The incident was caught on video and was posted on YouTube by another teenage partygoer. Within hours, millions of people had seen the video. The officer shown in the video was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation and later resigned. The incident sparked protests in McKinney involving hundreds of people.
