VReel was a video sharing web site that allowed users to upload, share and view high quality videos by use of a proprietary video codec. The site was in open beta in an effort to replace the now defunct Stage6 site with a viable alternative. Using a similar style to the defunct site, VReel has received a licence from DivX, Inc. to use their codec, and has signed an agreement with Edgecast to host the Web site globally. VReel has since begun development of their own replacement for the DivX Webplayer.
VReel was taken offline on August 3, 2008 due to bandwidth theft, and to prepare for the Beta 2 launch. VReel then announced that the Web site would be back online on August 30, but financial problems forced the company to postpone. VReel launched a private beta on November 11, and entered Open Beta on November 28. They acquired the StageHD.com domain, and are currently forwarding all page requests to their video portal.
