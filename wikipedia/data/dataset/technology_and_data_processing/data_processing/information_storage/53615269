BookTube refers to the group of content creators on YouTube that film videos based on books. Similar to beauty gurus or gamers, BookTubers are a specific subset of the YouTube community. While the largest group of BookTubers focus on YA literature, BookTube channels address all possible kinds of literature, such as audiobooks, classics, science fiction, fantasy, literary fiction, children's literature, comics, romance, non-fiction, and books in translation.
