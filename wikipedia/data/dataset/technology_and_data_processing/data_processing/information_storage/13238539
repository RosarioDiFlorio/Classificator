The REAL Rudy is a series of four viral videos by documentary film director and activist Robert Greenwald.
The videos criticize former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani's preparedness for, and handling of, the September 11, 2001 attacks. They were released on September 4 and September 6, 2007. John Nichols, the Washington, D.C. correspondent for The Nation, described the videos as "a powerful series of video exposes that have gone after Giuliani's bitter disputes with 9-11 rescue workers—especially firefighters—over his exploitation of the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center for political purposes and a host of other scandals involving the GOP frontrunner.". The Democratic National Committee posted a summary of the series on its website.
