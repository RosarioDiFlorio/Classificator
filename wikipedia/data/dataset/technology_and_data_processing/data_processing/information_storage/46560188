YouNow is a live broadcasting service where users stream their own live video content or interact with the video streams of other users in real time. The service is available on its website, on Android and iOS apps.
As of August 2015 the service handles 150,000 broadcasts each day.
The majority of the users of YouNow are under 24 years old. Many users perform music or dance, others talk or make jokes. There was some media attention in 2015 on a number of users who film themselves sleeping. A tag-based topic system enables viewers to browse content of their choice, while trending streams enable users to locate more popular webcasters.
It runs a partner program through which popular broadcasters can earn money. Virtual goods bought by viewers are used to acclaim videos; the resulting revenue is split between YouNow and the video creator, with about 60% going to the latter.
It competes with apps like Meerkat and Periscope although others have compared it with sites like Chatroulette.
YouNow was founded by Adi Sideman in September 2011, but significantly grew in popularity during 2014 and 2015 following significant changes to the service. A round of funding in 2015 raised $15 million from venture capitalists, bringing the total invested to $30 million.
