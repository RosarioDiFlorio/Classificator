"Cat Daddy" is a 2011 song by American Hip hop group The Rej3ctz. It is based on a dance of the same name and is from the 2010 mixtape TheFUNKtion vs theKICKback. "Cat Daddy" was a MTV Jams "Jam Of The Week" in January 2011. It was released for digital download on February 16, 2011 on iTunes and subsequently charted on several Billboard charts, including the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it spent fourteen weeks and eventually peaked at number 77, after being re-released on June 27, 2011.
Chris Brown performed the Cat Daddy dance during the 106 & Park 10th Anniversary special in October 2010. Brown was the featured dance performer on the song's official video, which as of November 12, 2015 has over 99 million YouTube views. A Cat Daddy 2.0 video by Mario Van Peebles preceded the re-release of the song and was associated with the movie We the Party. Several notable celebrities have been filmed doing the dance, including Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. The dance is described as a combination of buckling a seatbelt and rolling a wheelchair.
The song and dance became a viral video in May 2012 when then-current Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover model Kate Upton posted a video of her bikini-clad rendition of the dance on YouTube, causing YouTube to temporarily ban the video. The propriety of the YouTube ban was hotly debated with articles in many top-tier publications including the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and the Daily News as well as leading news services such as ABC News and Fox News. Her video has about 25.7 million YouTube views, as of November 12, 2015.
