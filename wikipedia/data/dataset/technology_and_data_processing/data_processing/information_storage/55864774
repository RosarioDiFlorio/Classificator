Facebook Watch is a video on demand service operated by Facebook. Facebook Watch's original video content is produced for it by partners who earn 55% of ad break revenue while Facebook keeps 45%.
It features recommendations for shows to watch for viewers, in addition to categories like “Most Talked About,” “What’s Making People Laugh” and “Shows Your Friends Are Watching".
Budgets for the first batch of “spotlight” (short-form) shows for Watch were roughly $10,000 to $40,000 per episode. For “hero” shows (TV-length original series), Facebook was willing to spend anywhere from $250,000 to more than $1 million per episode.
In December 2017, it was reported that Facebook was lifting a longtime ban on pre-roll ads. It is anticipated that Facebook plans to test video ads at the start of Watch shows.
Facebook is reportedly planning on spending as much as one billion dollars on original programming through 2018.
