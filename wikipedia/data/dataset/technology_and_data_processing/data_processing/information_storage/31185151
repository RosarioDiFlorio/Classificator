It was released by ARK Music Factory as Black's debut single on March 14, 2011. The song features a rap verse from Wilson, which was uncredited on the single. Its music video caught a sudden surge of hits after Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Rifftrax comedian Michael J. Nelson called it "the worst video ever made" on Twitter and the song was featured on the Tosh.0 blog. The song's reception was highly negative.
The original video was removed from YouTube on June 16, 2011, due to legal disputes between ARK Music and Black herself. By then, it had already amassed more than 166 million views. and 3.2 million "dislikes" (88% of total ratings) from YouTube users. The video was uploaded to YouTube again on September 16, 2011 and currently has more than 2.7 million "dislikes" as of July 2017 (79% of total ratings), making it the fifth most disliked video on YouTube. Since the growth in popularity of the song and video, there have been numerous parody videos and remixes. Forbes stated that the notoriety of the song is another sign of the power of social media—specifically Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr, in this instance—in the ability to create "overnight sensations."
