Clesh (clip load edit share) is a cloud-based video editing platform designed for the consumers, prosumers, and online communities to integrate user generated content. The core technology is based on FORscene which is geared towards professionals working for example in broadcasting, news media, post production.
Video, audio, and graphical content is uploaded to Clesh via a standard web browser, a mobile device such as a phone / tablet, or desktop software for DV capture over Firewire. The hosted material can then be reviewed, searched, edited, and published online by anyone with a standard web browser or compatible mobile device.
Clesh supports storyboard shot selection, frame-accurate editing, transitions and various other functions such as; pan, zoom, colour and light correction, and audio levels. Content can be published in formats for example; Podcast, Mpeg2, HTML5 video or in a proprietary Java format.
Cloud-based software provides greater scope for sharing information and collaborating compared to LAN or desktop based systems. Users of cloud-based software rely on the cloud's owner for adequate security, performance and resilience.
Clesh does not assert any rights over uploaded content in contrast to other platforms (such as YouTube). All rights to any content uploaded to Clesh remain with the Author.
