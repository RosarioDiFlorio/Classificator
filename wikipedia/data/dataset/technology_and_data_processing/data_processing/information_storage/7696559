Edge-notched cards are an obsolete technology used to store a small amount of binary or logical data, encoded into the presence or absence of notches in the edges of paper index cards. The notches allowed efficient sorting and selecting of specific cards matching desired criteria, from a larger number of cards in a paper-based database of information.
