Kinomap is a complete end-to-end platform for creating, hosting, sharing and utilizing motion videos for user generated videos. Kinomap allows uploading motion videos shot with a GPS camera or a common camera coupledd with GPS track from another device (such as a smartwatch). Kinomap platform contains geolocated video shooting (2D, 3D, terrestrial and aero), applications for Smartphone and tablets, data acquisition and integration, dedicated web portals and features like round-tour management, audio and video navigation, video tourism, indoor fitness training etc.
The maps combine the video with navigation routes, and add physical data (like altitude, elevation, speed, pollution level, three-dimensional acceleration, bearing/direction, radioactivity, temperature and distance covered figures). During playback, a user may fast-forward the video to any desired point through video, map or graph. Navigation maps can be viewed in any one of several map formats including Google Map, Satellite, Terrain, Earth and OpenStreetMap (O.S.M.). A user may tag his Point of Interests on the map, identified during the journey, set Hot Spots, add notes or comments and specify a travel mode (pedestrian, car, bus, train, aircraft etc.).
