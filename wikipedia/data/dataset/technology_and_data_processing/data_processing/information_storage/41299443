The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media is a book by Jos√© van Dijck published by Oxford University Press in 2013 on social media platforms and their history. The author critically considers the histories of five social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and Wikipedia. Van Dijck's approach is based on the premise that to understand the full weight of social media, their technological dimensions should be connected to the social and the cultural.
The title of the work alludes to how the rise of social media has created a culture in which a (profitable) connectivity is dominant.
