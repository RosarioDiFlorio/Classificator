Video Single Disc (VSD) was a disc-based format that carried the same analog video information as a LaserDisc, but on a 12-centimetre (4.72 inch) diameter CD-DA-sized disc. It was a variation on the CD Video (CD-V) format, except that VSD disc carried only video. It did not have any additional audio tracks like CD-V. Like CD-V, VSD discs could be played back by LaserDisc players that had VSD playback capability.
VSD was popular only in Japan and other parts of Asia, and was never marketed or introduced elsewhere in the world, but the format did get used once in the United States for a promotional movie teaser and trailer disk to accompany early pressings of the Terminator 2: Judgment Day movie when it was released on LaserDisc in 1991.
