MyToons was a free online community for animation that supported content sharing and social networking. MyToons.com was headquartered in San Antonio, Texas.
The site was founded in 2006 by Paul Ford, Stacey Ford and Dan Kraus as a spinoff of Bauhaus Software. The Texas Emerging Technology Fund supported it with a $500,000 grant.
After four months of private beta, the site launched publicly in March 2007 during the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, and began distributing member-created animation videos to Internet audiences worldwide. Three weeks after its launch, MyToons had received more than 1.5 million unique visitors.
