The 24 Hour Fort challenge is a challenge in which participants must reach a location or venue before it closes for the evening and trespass on the property by hiding in a 'fort' - normally a hastily-constructed hiding place constructed by moving products on shelves in such a way that the participants can hide behind them, or simply by hiding in areas such as public toilets and staff-only areas. Once the location closes, the goal is to remain in the venue for as long as possible before either the location reopens in the morning, or until the building's staff or security apprehend the participants. Several store chains and companies have spoken out against the challenge, and participants risk being banned from stores or facing criminal charges for trespassing, criminal damage and unlawful entry.
The challenge can be traced back to August 2016, in which two Belgian teenagers remained inside an IKEA branch after closing time by hiding in wardrobes.
