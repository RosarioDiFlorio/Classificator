Louder Than War is a music and culture website focusing on mainly alternative arts news, reviews, and features. The site is an editorially independent publication that was started by journalist John Robb in 2010 and is now run by a team of other journalists with a worldwide team of freelancers.
The site is built around live reviews, album reviews and exclusive in-depth interviews with many key musicians including Mick Jones, Kurt Cobain, John Lydon, Peter Hook, The Stranglers, The Charlatans, The Damned and The Happy Mondays. In 2012, Louder Than War launched a record label to promote and champion lesser known bands and artists.
The website broke the story of The Stone Roses' reformation and was a supporter of the "Justice Tonight for the 96" Hillsborough tour.
John Robb is also a member of the English punk rock bands The Membranes and Goldblade.
