Connor Michalek (November 25, 2005 â€“ April 25, 2014) was a WWE fan who received considerable media attention after a social media campaign for him to meet his hero and favorite wrestler, Daniel Bryan. He later met Bryan and other WWE stars a number of times. Michalek, who had battled cancer of the spine and brain since he was three years old, died on April 25, 2014 at the age of eight. WWE executives Paul Levesque ("Triple H") and Stephanie McMahon subsequently named the Connor's Cure charity in his honor and he posthumously received the inaugural Warrior Award at the 2015 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony.
