Mostly used through the 1950s and into the 1960s, ribs were a black market method of smuggling in and distributing prohibited music by foreign and emigre musicians, like Pjotr Leschenko or Alexander Vertinsky, who were banned from broadcasting in the USSR. These included popular Western artists of the day such as Elvis, The Beatles, Bill Haley, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Ella Fitzgerald and Chubby Checker.
