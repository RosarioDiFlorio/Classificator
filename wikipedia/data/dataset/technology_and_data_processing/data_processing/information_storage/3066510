Don't Copy That Floppy was an antiâ€“copyright infringement campaign run by the Software Publishers Association (SPA) beginning in 1992. The video for the campaign, starring M. E. Hart as "MC Double Def DP," was filmed at Cardozo High School in Washington, D.C. and produced by cooperation between the SPA, the Educational Section Anti-Piracy Committee, and the Copyright Protection Fund, in association with Vilardi Films. The groups distributed the film for general viewing through VHS tapes that were mailed to schools. In later years, the film became a viral video sensation through websites such as YouTube, where the official page has had over 1,000,000 views as of December 2013.
In May 2009, the Software and Information Industry Association (formed in 1999 when the Software Publishers Association merged with the Information Industry Association) released the trailer for a follow-up to Don't Copy That Floppy, called Don't Copy That 2, released on September 9, 2009. The sequel features MC Double Def DP as he continues his crusade against "piracy" in the digital age.
