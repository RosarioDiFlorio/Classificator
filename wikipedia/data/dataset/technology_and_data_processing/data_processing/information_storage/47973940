Wireless Philosophy or Wi-Phi is an open-access philosophy website that aims to "introduce people to the practice of philosophy by making videos that are freely available in a form that is entertaining". Its founder and executive director is Gaurav Vazirani, a PhD student at Yale University. According to Mel Thompson, Wireless Philosophy is "a very good online resource for those coming new to philosophy, and for students from GCSE upwards."
