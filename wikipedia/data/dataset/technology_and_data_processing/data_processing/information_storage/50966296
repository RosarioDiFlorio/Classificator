Campus Insiders was a college sports website and internet television service. It was owned by a joint venture between IMG College and Silver Chalice.
The service was oriented towards live streaming of U.S. college sports, streaming live and replay broadcasts of events from selected conferences that are not picked up for television, as well as other original content. It was based out of studios in Chicago, Illinois in the former Harpo Studios building, alongside sister operation 120 Sports.
On April 13, 2017, it was announced that Silver Chalice had partnered with Sinclair Broadcast Group to merge Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, and Sinclair's syndication service and linear digital television channel American Sports Network into a new linear and digital sports network, which will be known as Stadium.
