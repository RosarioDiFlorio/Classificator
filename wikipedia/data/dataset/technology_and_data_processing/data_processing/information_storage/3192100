Revver (formerly ChangeTv) is a defunct video sharing website that hosted user-generated content. Until its shutdown in 2011, Revver attached advertising to user-submitted video clips and originally offered to share ad revenue with the video creators. Videos could be displayed, downloaded and shared across the web in either Apple QuickTime or FLV format. In addition, Revver was a video publishing platform that enabled third parties to build their own "Revverized" site. Revver allowed developers to create a complete white label of the Revver platform.
