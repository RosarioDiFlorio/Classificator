SuperDrive is a trademark used by Apple Inc. for two different storage drives: from 1988 to 1999 to refer to a high-density floppy disk drive capable of reading all major 3.5â€³ disk formats; and from 2001 onwards to refer to a CD/DVD reader/writer.
The terms DVD Multi, Super AllWrite and Super Multi are used to describe optical disc drives from non-Apple manufacturers.
