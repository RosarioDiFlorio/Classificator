The 2013 YouTube Music Awards, abbreviated as the YTMA, was the inaugural music award show presented by YouTube.
Unlike other award shows, the winners were entirely voted on by fans. The show was directed by Spike Jonze. "None of us have done anything live before or an awards show â€“ in a way we're all like amateurs on YouTube ourselves, making our first video. So even if it's messy, it'll be live," Jonze admitted to Billboard.com.
