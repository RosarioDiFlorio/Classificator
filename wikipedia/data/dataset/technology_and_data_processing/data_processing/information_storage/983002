Broadcast automation incorporates the use of broadcast programming technology to automate broadcasting operations. Used either at a broadcast network, radio station or a television station, it can run a facility in the absence of a human operator. They can also run in a "live assist" mode when there are on-air personnel present at the master control, television studio or control room.
The radio transmitter end of the airchain is handled by a separate automatic transmission system (ATS).
