Eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM) is a data encoding technique – formally, a channel code – used by compact discs (CD), laserdiscs (LD) and pre-Hi-MD MiniDiscs. EFMPlus is a related code, used in DVDs and SACDs. EFM and EFMPlus were both invented by Kees A. Schouhamer Immink. European Patent Office President Benoît Battistelli: "Immink's invention of EFM made a decisive contribution to the digital revolution."
