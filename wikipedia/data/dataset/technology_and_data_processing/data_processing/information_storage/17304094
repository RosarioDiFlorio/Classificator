A new media artist may use the following media to create works of art: the Internet, computer hardware, computer software-servers, routers, personal computers, database applications, scripts and computer files. These artists use the aforementioned technologies in conjunction with video and computer games, surveillance cameras, wireless phones, hand-held computers, Apache Web server, Hypertext Markup Language and Global Positioning System devices (GPS). The Dada and Pop art movements greatly influence new media artists and provide a foundation from which to borrow and reinvent conceptual and aesthetic ideas.
