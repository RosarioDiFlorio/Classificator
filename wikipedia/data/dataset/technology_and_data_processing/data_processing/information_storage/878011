DVD-Ds, also referred to as disposable DVDs, are a type of digital video disc that is designed to be used for a maximum 48 hours after the containing package is opened. After this time, the DVDs become unreadable to DVD players because they contain a chemical that, after the set period of time, will prevent the underlying data from being read by DVD drives. The medium in itself is copy protection neutral and does not require additional Digital Rights Management types of applications to be installed for the content to be accessible. The technology used for DVD-Ds is different from that for earlier disposable DVDs. DVD-D has a reservoir in the central area of the disc which contains the chemical agent. When the disc spins for the first time the chemical agent moves and gets in contact with the reflective layer of the disc. After approximately 48 hours, the reflective layer becomes unreadable as the laser cannot reflect on the layer.
