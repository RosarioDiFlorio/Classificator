Rostelecom (Russian: ОАО «Ростелеком») is Russia's leading long-distance telephony provider. Domestic long distance service provides about 50% of the company's revenue; and international long distance calls provide about 25%. From the company's website's "Rostelecom Today" page: "In every region of Russia, Rostelecom acts as a “carriers’ carrier” - interconnecting all local public operators’ networks into a single national network for long-distance service." In other words, if one makes a long distance call or originates Internet contact to or from Russia, it is likely that Rostelecom is providing part of the service. The company's stock trades primarily on the MICEX and RTS.
