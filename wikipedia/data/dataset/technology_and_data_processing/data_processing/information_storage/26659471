Goalbit is an open source P2PTV platform, capable of distributing high-bandwidth live video content. Its main component, the Goalbit media player, is free software based on the VLC media player and is, therefore, released under the GNU General Public License. It mainly provides the capability of streaming in the P2P Goalbit protocol, a protocol based on BitTorrent.
A Goalbit network is formed by broadcast-peers, super-peers, peers, and optionally a tracker (like in BitTorrent), although Kademlia is also available for communicating. Broadcast-peers are responsible for reading from the video source and generating the sharing unit in the Goalbit protocol, called chunk. These units are shared like in the P2P BitTorrent protocol but with certain hierarchy through the different peer types.
