Wildscreen.tv was a free video sharing website and social-media network that allowed users to upload self-generated video content. Wildscreen was designed as an alternative to YouTube in that independent film makers, musicians, and other artists can monetize the content they produce. Users own and customize their own channels for their video content, and they receive the ad revenue from advertising on their channel. Uploading of content was unlimited, and users had access to a media player that was embeddable on other web pages.
