XDCAM is a series of products for digital recording using random access solid-state memory media, introduced by Sony in 2003. Four different product lines –  the XDCAM SD, XDCAM HD, XDCAM EX and XDCAM HD422 –  differ in types of encoder used, frame size, container type and in recording media.
None of the later products have made earlier product lines obsolete. Sony maintains that different formats within XDCAM family have been designed to meet different applications and budget constraints.
The XDCAM range includes cameras and decks which act as drop-in replacements for traditional VTRs allowing XDCAM discs to be used within a traditional videotape-based workflow. These decks can also serve as random access computer hard drives for easy import of the video data files into non-linear editing systems (NLE) via FireWire (IEEE 1394) and Ethernet.
In September 2008, JVC announced its alliance with Sony to support the XDCAM EX format.
In August 2009, Convergent Design began shipping the nanoFlash Portable Recorder, which uses the Sony XDCAM HD422 codec.
In November 2012, VITEC began shipping the FS-T2001 Portable Recorder, which uses Sony XDCAM HD422 and XDCAM HD codec.
