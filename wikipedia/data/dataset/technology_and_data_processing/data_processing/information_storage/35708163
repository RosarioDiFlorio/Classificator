LV-ROM is an optical disc format developed by Philips Electronics to integrate analog video and computer software for interactive multimedia. The LV-ROM is a specialized variation of the CAV Laserdisc. LV-ROM is an initialism for "LaserVision Read-Only Memory".
Like Laserdisc, LV-ROM discs store analog audio and video by encoding it in pulse-width modulation. However, LV-ROM also stores computer files via the Advanced Disk Filing System, which is the file system used by Acorn Computers. An LV-ROM disc can store up to 324 megabytes of digital information, or up to 54,000 frames of analog video (36 minutes with a frame rate of 25 fps) per side.
The format had only one application: To publish documentary video, children's writings, and other historical records compiled from 1984 to 1986 for the BBC Domesday Project. The Domesday Project LV-ROM discs were played using a BBC Master computer connected via SCSI-1 to a Philips AIV VP415 Laserdisc player. A genlock enabled the software stored on the LV-ROM to display computer graphics over the analog video on the BBC Master's computer screen. The buttons and menus of the user interface were accessed with a trackball.
