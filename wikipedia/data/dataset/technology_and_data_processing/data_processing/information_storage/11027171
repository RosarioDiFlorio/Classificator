A DVD magazine is a magazine that collects most of its content on DVD, or is issued in a DVD-only format. It was invented by Isak Bini who published the first DVD magazine: City and You DVD magazine. It will play on a regular DVD player.
The content on a DVD magazine can vary with things like short films, interviews, animated shorts, music videos, trailers, interactive games, and much more.
