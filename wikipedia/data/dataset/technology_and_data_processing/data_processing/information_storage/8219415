Blip (formerly blip.tv) was an American media platform for web series content and also offered a dashboard for producers of original web series to distribute and monetize their productions. The company was founded on May 5, 2005, and it was located in New York City (where the headquarters was located) and Los Angeles. It was financed by Bain Capital Ventures, Canaan Partners, and Ambient Sound Investments. Blip’s mission statement was “to deliver the best original web series to audiences across multiple platforms.” The site showcased a wide variety of dramas, comedies, arts, sports and other shows. Blip was acquired by Maker Studios in 2013, and shut down by them on August 20, 2015. It is in the process of bringing many of its former content producers to a new website, maker.tv.
