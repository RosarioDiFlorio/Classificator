I Love the World, also known as I Love the Whole World, is an advertising campaign launched by Discovery Channel in 2008 in promotion of their new tagline: "The World is Just... Awesome". The song used in the ad is a re-writing of a traditional camping song known as "I Love the Mountains"  or "I Love the Flowers", likely adapted from the tune of "Heart and Soul", featuring a chorus of "boom-de-yah-da, boom-de-yah-da".
