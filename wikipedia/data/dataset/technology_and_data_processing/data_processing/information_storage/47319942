Chaturbate is an adult website providing live webcam performances by amateur camgirls, camboys and couples typically featuring nudity and sexual activity ranging from striptease and dirty talk to masturbation with sex toys. The site is divided into five categories: female cams, male cams, couple cams, transgender cams and spy shows.
"Chaturbate" is a portmanteau of "chat" and "masturbate". Viewers are allowed to watch for free (with the exception of Private Shows), but pay money in the form of "tips" in order to see certain sex acts performed. The site itself earns revenues by taking roughly 40% of what performers make. In addition Chaturbate generates revenue from the audience when they purchase tokens using their credit cards.
As of August 2017, the site is ranked 144th in the Alexa global rank and is the largest adult camming site competing with European BongaCams and LiveJasmin. It is estimated that the site has about 4.1 million unique visitors each month. Cam users can earn money by being tipped with tokens and 20 tokens are worth $1.
