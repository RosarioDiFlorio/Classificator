"Sí, Se Puede Cambiar" (English translation: Yes, we can change) is a song and music video created in support of Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. However, the video has no official ties to the Obama campaign. The song was written by Andres Useche. The video, which features Useche performing, was directed by Eric Byler, Warren Fu and Andres Useche, and was released on February 22, 2008 on YouTube under the username "United For Obama".
The video attracted national and international attention and through 2008 Andres Useche accepted invitations to do radio, newspaper and TV interviews in which he promoted Barack Obama's campaign.
The phrase "Sí se puede" originated with the United Farm Workers, which adopted it as the union's official slogan in 1972. It subsequently gained wider currency among other American labor unions and social justice activists.
