The history of optical recording can be divided into a few number of distinct major contributions. The pioneers of optical recording worked mostly independently, and their solutions to the many technical challenges have very distinctive features, such as
reflective disc (Compaan and Kramer)
transparent disc (Gregg)
floppy disc (Russell)
rigid disc (Compaan and Kramer)
focused laser beam for read-out through transparent substrate (Compaan and Kramer).
