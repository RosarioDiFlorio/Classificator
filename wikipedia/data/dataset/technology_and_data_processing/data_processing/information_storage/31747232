"President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden (SPOOF)" is Iman Crosson's spoof video posted to the YouTube video sharing website, including a spoof of U.S. President Barack Obama's May 1, 2011 speech announcing the death of Osama bin Laden. The video is the basis of the rap music single "Momentous Day."
The video was produced by actor-impressionist and dancer Iman Crosson and posted on YouTube three days after Obama's speech. Crosson's video includes a spoken explanatory introduction followed by a spoof of Obama's speech. The spoof includes comedic dancing, and presents the speech in rap music form, sometimes covering topics from Obama's speech with references to contemporary memes.
Popular and critical reaction focused on the video's humor and on Crosson's impersonation. Additionally, CBS News' Bailey Johnson said that Crosson's version of the speech "seems to perfectly capture the national mood," and Al Jazeera 's "Listening Post" stated that Crosson's satirical interpretation "cuts through the usual diplomatic platitudes and delivers - what seems to be - a more honest ... account of what happened." CQ Roll Call Daily Briefing Editor David Hawkings remarked that the video "skewered the presidentâ€™s 'no drama' affect and at the same time captured the mood of the country in the days after the Abbottobad raid."
