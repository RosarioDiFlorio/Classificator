VidAngel is an American video streaming service launched in 2014. The service offers members an option to edit commercially released DVDs by filtering content perceived as offensive, such as profanity, nudity and sexual content, or graphic violence.
The company was sued by several major movie studios in 2016, under allegations that their practices of bypassing DVD copyright protection features and streaming edited videos without permission constitute copyright infringement. Court rulings as of mid-2017 have all been against VidAngel, finding that the company violated copyright law and further ordering their service stopped. VidAngel has vowed to appeal, and was once fined for contempt of court for violating a court order.
VidAngel were ordered to shut down their website in late 2016 pending trial. On June 13, 2017, VidAngel announced the launch of a new $7.99 monthly subscription service based on a new model for filtering content from video streaming services Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO, and launched new apps for the new service on Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Chromecast, Android TV, and Apple TV.
