PULSE is a P2PTV application developed by the European FP7 NAPA-WINE (Network-Aware P2P-TV Application over Wise Networks) research consortium.
PULSE stands for Peer-to-Peer Unstructured Live Streaming Experiment and is a peer-to-peer live streaming system designed to operate in scenarios where the bandwidth resources of nodes can be highly heterogeneous and variable over time, as is the case for the Internet.
