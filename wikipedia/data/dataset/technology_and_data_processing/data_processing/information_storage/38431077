WhereverTV is an Over the Top (OTT) internet television platform provider located in Fort Myers, Florida focused on delivering linear television programming to SmartTVs and digital media receivers, and tablets via the public Internet.
The company has been providing access to free live streaming TV channels on the internet since 2007 through its Global Interactive Program Guide (officially trademarked as Global IPG) internet TV software, allowing registered users to watch TV online. In 2011, the company began selling subscription services for live television from Morocco and Greece. In 2013, it began selling Arabic TV subscriptions. WhereverTV announced plans to launch two additional services for 2013: a software application aimed at managing US and international channels to portable and stationary internet connected devices, and a traditional US based subscription service.
WhereverTV has since evolved into an alternative to fixed location subscription services such as those offered by cable companies and satellite television providers. Subscribers are able to personalize their viewing choices, subscription services and watch from any location that has Internet access. The company provides both wireless television and hard wired accessibility to TV on internet.
