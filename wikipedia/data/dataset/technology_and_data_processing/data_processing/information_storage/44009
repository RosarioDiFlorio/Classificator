MiniDisc (MD) is a magneto-optical disc-based data storage format offering a capacity of 74 minutes and, later, 80 minutes, of digitized audio or 1 gigabyte of Hi-MD data. Sony brand audio players were on the market from September 1992 until March 2013.
MiniDisc was announced by Sony in September 1992 and released in November of that year for sale in Japan and in December in Europe, Canada, the USA and other countries. The music format was originally based on ATRAC audio data compression, but the option of linear PCM digital recording was later introduced to attain audio quality comparable to that of a compact disc. MiniDiscs were very popular in Japan and found moderate success in Europe.
Sony has ceased development of MD devices, with the last of the players sold by March 2013.
