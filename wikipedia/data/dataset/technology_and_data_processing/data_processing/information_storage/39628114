The System Independent Data Format (SIDF) is a file system specification for removable media that was designed to achieve storage interoperability and to allow data interchange among software and hardware platforms. The data format was originally developed in 1993 by an industry consortium and adopted as an international standard by ECMA in December, 1994.
