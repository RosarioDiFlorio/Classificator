The Minisode Network (now Crackle Minisodes) is a Sony Pictures Television internet television network launched in June 2007. The term minisode is a portmanteau of "mini" and "episode". Unlike webisodes, which are initially broadcast on the internet, minisodes are condensed versions of previously broadcast, full length, television series.
