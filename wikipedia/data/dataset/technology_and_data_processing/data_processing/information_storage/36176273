Project for Awesome (often abbreviated P4A) is a community-driven charitable movement on YouTube, created by the Green brothers, Hank and John, most notable for their VlogBrothers YouTube channel. Formerly dubbed the Nerdfighter Power Project for Awesome, the project has taken place in December every year since 2007. The movement was started to have YouTubers create innovative videos promoting their favorite charity and upload it by a certain deadline, with the aim that their promoted charity gains more awareness, and donations from audiences.
The event takes place in December each year, and lasts for 48 hours. From 2007 to 2013, the P4A began on December 17, and lasted until the 18th or 19th. From 2014, the dates of the event have changed, and been fixed as the second Friday and Saturday in December (12â€“13 in 2014). In 2016, the P4A was December 9-11. 2017's dates will be December 15-17.
