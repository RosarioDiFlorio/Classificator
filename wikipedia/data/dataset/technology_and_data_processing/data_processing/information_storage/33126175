A Web extra usually refers to a segment recorded by a broadcaster as part of a television or radio series but posted onto the World Wide Web instead. The term and practice has become increasingly adopted by daily broadcasters (i.e. news broadcasters, chat show hosts) for both promotional purposes as well as bypassing limitations on the regular length of the broadcast.
Web extras often include interviews or panel discussions, and may often be billed as "pre-shows" or "post-shows" depending upon the time that the segment was broadcast; for this purpose, if a discussion between two or more persons on the set is likely to run through the end of the broadcast, the host or presenter may often pause the discussion to wrap up the regular broadcast and then resume the on-camera discussion after the broadcast ends.
