A web series is a series of scripted or non-scripted videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet and part of the web television medium, which first emerged in the late 1990s and become more prominent in the early 2000s (decade). A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or "webisode", however the latter term is not often used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of platforms, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They can also be watched on television.
In 2013, streaming video website Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online-only web television for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, House of Cards, Arrested Development and Hemlock Grove, earned nominations.
As of 2016, there are a number of awards that are given to the top web series productions, including the Streamys, Webbys and Indie Series Awards, and several web series festivals, including the Los Angeles and Vancouver Web Series Festivals. Most major award ceremonies have also created web series and digital media award categories, including the Emmy Awards and the Canadian Screen Awards.
