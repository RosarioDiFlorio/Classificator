The Internet Cat Video Festival is a national competition that celebrates cat videos on the internet. Many of these festivals include appearances by special guests and celebricats (such as Grumpy Cat and the creator of Nyan Cat), live music, costume contests, art projects, and booths hosting local animal resource nonprofits. The 2013 Minneapolis show will even feature a cat sculpture made out of butter.
