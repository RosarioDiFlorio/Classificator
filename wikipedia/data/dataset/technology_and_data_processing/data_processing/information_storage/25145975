"Charlie bit my finger - again", more simply known as Charlie Bit My Finger or Charlie Bit Me, is a 2007 internet viral video famous for formerly being the most viewed YouTube video. As of September 2017, the video has received over 854 million views and is the sixth most viewed non-music YouTube video.
The 56-second-long video, which was uploaded on YouTube in May 2007, features Harry Davies-Carr (who was aged three) and Charlie Davies-Carr (aged one), two brothers from the United Kingdom. The two are seen sitting in a chair when Harry puts his finger into Charlie's mouth and gets bitten. "Charlie bit me," he observes and puts his finger back into Charlie's mouth, which gets it bitten harder. Harry, who is hurt, says "Ouch" repeatedly and his brother begins to giggle. Afterwards, Harry smiles and repeats "Charlie bit me. And that really hurt."
