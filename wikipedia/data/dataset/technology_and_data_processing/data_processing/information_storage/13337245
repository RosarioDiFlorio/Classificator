LS-R, or the Layer-Selection-Type Recordable Optical Disk, is the term coined by Hitachi in 2003 for a next-generation optical disc technology which allows much larger data storage densities than DVD, HD DVD or Blu-ray Disc, by allowing the use of a large number of data layers in a single disc. In previous optical disc technologies, only a relatively small number of data layers can be incorporated in a single disc, since the reflections from the different layers interfere with each other. However, in LS-R, only the layer of interest generates a reflection, meaning that a very large number of layers can theoretically be stacked in the same disc. This feat is accomplished by an electronic "selection" mechanism, whereby each data layer is coated with electrodes and only the electrodes associated with the layer of interest are activated. This activation changes the "selected" data layer from being transparent to being reflective or opaque, thus it can be addressed.
