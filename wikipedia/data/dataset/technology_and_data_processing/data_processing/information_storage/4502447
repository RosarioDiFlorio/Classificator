A hybrid disc is a disc, such as CD-ROM or Blu-ray Disc, which contains multiple types of data which can be used differently on different devices. These include CD-ROM music albums containing video files viewable on a personal computer, or feature film Blu-ray Discs containing interactive content when used with a PlayStation 3 games console.
