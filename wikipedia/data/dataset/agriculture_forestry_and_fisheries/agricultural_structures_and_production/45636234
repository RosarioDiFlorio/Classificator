A grain hopper trailer is a trailer pulled by a semi tractor and used to haul bulk commodity products (such as grain). These trailers are used extensively throughout the United States to transport agricultural products as well as any other commodity that can be hauled in bulk and loaded and unloaded through the trailer.
