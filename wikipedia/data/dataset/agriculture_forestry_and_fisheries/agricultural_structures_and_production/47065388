A community orchard is a collection of fruit trees planted in a public space. Community orchards, which exist in North America and in parts of Europe, are planted in public parks, school and church yards, and on abandoned lots. These orchards are shared resources, not managed for profit. What they have in common is that they are cared for by a community of people.
Community orchards are planted for many reasons. They increase the public's access to healthy, organic fruit - especially in areas where the population cannot afford healthy, fresh food. They teach young people where their food comes from. They allow ordinary people to develop organic fruit tree growing skills. And they can make an ordinary park or green space into a community centre, where residents volunteer together to care for and harvest the trees. Community orchards also are a place of celebration. Many groups organize harvest and blossom festivals, cider pressing events, canning workshops and more.
