Kalahari Tea imported, distributed and sold via its web site a variety of specialty teas. Founded by Ned Fitch and David Abrahams, the company focused in particular on South African Rooibos or red tea, which it sold in Giant Eagle and GNC stores. Additional lines included its ChocoLatte green tea, citrus-flavored oolong teas, all of which were carried in Publix grocery stores.
