Sybilla Masters (c. 1676 â€“ 23 August 1720), born Sybilla Righton, was an American inventor. Masters was the first person residing in the American colonies to be given an English patent, and possibly the first known inventor of her sex in America. Masters was given a patent for a corn mill in 1715 in her husband's name, as women were not allowed to have their own patents in that time and place. She also patented a process for making hats.
Though not much is known of Masters' early life, it is thought she was born in Bermuda as her father had emigrated from there in 1687.
