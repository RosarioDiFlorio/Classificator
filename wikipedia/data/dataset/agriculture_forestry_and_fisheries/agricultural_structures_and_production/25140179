Doodh pati chai (from Hindi दूध पत्ति चाय and Urdu دودھ پتی چائے‎ , meaning "milk leaf tea") is a tea beverage consumed in Nepal, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, in which milk, together with sugar, is boiled with tea. Doodh pati is different from saada chai, in that it only uses milk and tea. This tea does not include water. It is made with milk, tea leaves and sugar only. This milk-based tea is quite common in South Asia. It is marginally costlier than regular, water-based saada chai.
