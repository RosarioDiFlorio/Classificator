Wool insulation is made from sheep wool fibres that are either mechanically held together or bonded using between 5% and 20% recycled polyester adhesive to form insulating batts, rolls and ropes. Natural wool insulation is effective for both thermal and acoustic insulation. The wool is often sourced from the less expensive black wools of the UK and Europe. Batts are commonly used in the walls and ceilings of timber-frame buildings, rolls can be cut to size for lofts, and ropes can be used between the logs in log homes. Natural wool insulation should be distinguished from mineral wool insulation, also called slag wool or rock wool, which only resembles natural wool fibers. It is actually made from rock, blast furnace slag, and other raw materials which are melted and spun into fibers.
Sheep wool is a natural, sustainable, recyclable material, which is biodegradable, and has low embodied energy. It does not endanger the health of people or the environment, and does not require protection to install, unlike fiberglass insulation. Wool is a highly effective insulating material which performs better than its rated R value because it can absorb and release moisture. Mongolian nomads used felted and woven sheep wool pads as an insulating layer on the walls and floors of their dwellings, called ger or yurts. The use of wool for insulation is starting to rise in popularity. It is already popular in Australia, which produces 55% of the world's raw and processed wool,. as well as in Europe and Canada, and gaining ground in the United States
