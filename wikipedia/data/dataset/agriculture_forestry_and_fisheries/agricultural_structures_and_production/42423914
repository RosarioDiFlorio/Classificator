The Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP) was established in 1988â€“89 under the patronage of the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, and the Planning Division of the Government of Pakistan. REAP played a significant role in defining rice standards in Pakistan. Consequently, Pakistan Rice Standards were established in 1992 for the first time, with support of the Pakistan Standards Institution.
