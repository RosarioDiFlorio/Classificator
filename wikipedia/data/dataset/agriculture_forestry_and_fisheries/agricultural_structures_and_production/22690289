The Faeth Farm near Fort Madison, Iowa was founded by German immigrants Jacob and Elizabeth Faeth in 1842. Mormons encamped near the farm after fleeing Nauvoo, Illinois. Adam Faeth built the existing house and barn. Herb Faeth expanded the orchard; he was close friends with the naturalist Aldo Leopold. Faeth Farm was self-supporting, sustainable farm for decades, and is believed to have the oldest orchard west of the Mississippi. In November, 2008, the farm was divided among four different parties, and much of it is likely to be developed. The core of the farmstead might remain orchard, but the property is still considered one of Iowa's most endangered historic sites.
