The sugar industry subsumes the production, processing and marketing of sugars (mostly saccharose and fructose). Globally, most sugar is extracted from sugar cane (~80 % predominantly in the tropics) and sugar beet (~ 20%, mostly in temperate climate like in the U.S. or Europe).
Sugar is an essential basis for soft drinks/sweetened beverages, convenience foods, fast food, candy / sweets, confectionery, baking products and the respective industries.
As per 2013 report from BCC Research estimates the global market for sugar and sweeteners at about $77.5 billion in 2012 with sugar comprising an almost 85% share. The market is thought to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%.
Around 460 million tonnes of sugar is produced every year. The largest producers are Brazil (72%), India (15%) and the European Union (10%). Altogether, there are more than 123 sugar-producing countries, but only 30% of the produce is traded on the international market. In 2011 global sugar export trade was worth $47bn with $33.5bn of sugar exports are from developing countries and $12.2bn from developed countries.
