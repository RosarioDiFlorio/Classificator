According to Greenpeace, GAR has six concessions on peatlands in Riau, with an estimated total are of 20,000 hectares. GAR was reported to have 1,880 hectares of peat in Central Kalimantan and 1,330 hectares in West Kalimantan, while claiming a zero-deforestation footprint. Greenpeace also discovered 322 hotspots on five to GAR's concessions in Central Kalimantan.  GAR denied these accusations and said to have a zero-burning policy since 1997.
