The Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) is a Ghanaian government-controlled institution that fixes the buying price for cocoa in Ghana, the world's second largest producer of the commodity. The price-fixing is intended to protect farmers from the volatile prices on the world market. While an overwhelming majority of cocoa is covered by the Cocobod, some special types of cocoa are not included, such as some fair trade, organic and high-quality beans. Besides the price-fixing, the organisation sells higher quality hybrid seeds, and does some research on cocoa plant-related diseases.
Between 1947 and 1979, the institution was known as the Cocoa Marketing Board.
