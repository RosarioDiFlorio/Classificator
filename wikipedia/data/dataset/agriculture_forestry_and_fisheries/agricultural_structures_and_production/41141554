Sugar Charcoal

It is formed by the destructive distillation of cane sugar. It is also prepared by the dehydration of sugar in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid. Since sulphuric acid is a dehydrating agent, it absorbs water from the sugar and leaves behind black residue of carbon.It is the purest form of amorphous carbon.
