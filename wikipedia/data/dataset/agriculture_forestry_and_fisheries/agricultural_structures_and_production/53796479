The Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) is a non-profit that promotes better standards in cotton farming and practices across 24 countries. The initiative now represents around 12% of global cotton production worldwide. Partner retailers include H&M, Gap, IKEA, and Levi Strauss, and include funding partners from USAID. BCI meets UN's goals to achieve better global water sustainability and sustainable agriculture. As of 2016, BCI has more than 50 retailers and over 700 suppliers.
BCI also promotes use of better irrigation practices with farmers, as well as reducing the use of fertilizers. Some examples point to a 40% reduction in water use by farmers in Pakistan and farmers in India cutting water use by half.

Some similar conservation efforts for cotton farming practices include Bayer's CropScienceâ€™s e3 sustainable cotton program.
