A brine pipeline is a pipeline to transport brine. It is a common way to transport salt from salt mines, salt wells and sink works to the places of salt evaporation (salterns, salt pans). Another usage is in oil and gas industries. Still another usage is to remove salts and contaminants from water supply sources.
