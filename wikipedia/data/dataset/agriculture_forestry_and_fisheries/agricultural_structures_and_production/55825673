Seven-colour tea or seven-layer tea (Bengali: সাত রং চা, Sylheti language: ꠡꠣꠔ ꠞꠋ ꠌꠣ) is a well-known hot beverage in Bangladesh. Romesh RamGour invented the seven-layer tea after discovering that different tea leaves have different densities.  Each layer contrasts in colour and distinct taste, from syrupy sweet to spicy cloves. The result is an alternating dark/light band pattern throughout the drink giving the tea its name. The Seven-colour tea is available in the Nilkantha Tea Cabin, a tea shop in Srimongol, Sylhet.
