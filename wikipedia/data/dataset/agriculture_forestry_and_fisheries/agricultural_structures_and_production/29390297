Pomegranate production in Afghanistan is a significant contributor to the Afghan agricultural economy. Pomegranates are a major fruit crop in many provinces such as Kandahar, Helmand, Wardak, Ghazni, Paktia, Farah, Kapisa and Balkh, and are the source of the livelihoods of thousands of people.
Afghanistan is known as "the country of the pomegranate fruit" in view of not only its conventional methods of cultivation but also for the quality of the landraces grown.
