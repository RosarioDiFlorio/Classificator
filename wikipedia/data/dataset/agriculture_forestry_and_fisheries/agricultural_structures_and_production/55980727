Pierre Huglin developed a bioclimatic heat index for vineyards, the Huglin heat sum index (or after Huglin respectively -warmth index or short Huglin index,) in which the temperature sum over the temperature threshold of 10°C is calculated and then summed for all days from beginning of April to end of September. The calculation uses both the daily average temperatures and the maximum temperatures and slightly modifies the calculated total according to latitude. Each grape variety needs a certain amount of heat in order to be cultivated successfully in the long term in a given area. The calculated heat sums, which are based on data from weather stations or from climate models, differ in that they are too low compared to the actual values in the vineyards. The index does not take into account e.g. thermally favoured hillsides where temperature values may be higher by about 1.5°C to 2°C.
