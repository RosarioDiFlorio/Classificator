Chocamine is a brand of cocoa extract found as an ingredient in many consumer health products, such as NightFood, ChocoMind, ChocoEnergy, LifeMap, Chocoslim, ChocoLift, and ErgoLean AMP. In these consumer products, Chocamine is included to provide the taste, smell and purported health benefits of chocolate, without the sugar, fat, and dairy found in many confectionery products. Cocoa solids contain alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine. Chocamine contains methylxanthine alkaloids (with a high concentration of theobromine), adrenergic amines, amino acids, and some dietary minerals.
