Rice production in Thailand represents a significant portion of the Thai economy and labor force. Forty percent of Thais work in agriculture, 16 million of them as rice farmers by one estimate.
Thailand has a strong tradition of rice production. It has the fifth-largest amount of land under rice cultivation in the world and is the world's second largest exporter of rice. Thailand has plans to further increase the land available for rice production, with a goal of adding 500,000 hectares to its already 9.2 million hectares of rice-growing areas.Fully half of Thailand's cultivated land is devoted to rice.
The Thai Ministry of Agriculture expects rice production to yield around 25 million tonnes of paddy rice in the 2016-2017 crop year, down from 27.06 million tonnes in 2015-2016. Jasmine rice (Thai: ข้าวหอมมะลิ; rtgs: khao hom mali, a higher quality type of rice, is the rice strain most produced in Thailand although in Thailand is thought that only Surin, Buriram, and Sisaket Provinces can produce high quality hom mali. Jasmine has a significantly lower yield rate than other types of rice, but it normally fetches more than double the price of other strains on the global market.
Due to an ongoing drought, the USDA has forecast output will drop by more than a fifth to 15.8 million tonnes in 2016. Thailand can harvest three rice crops a year, but due to the drought, the government is urging a move to less water-dependent crops or forgoing one crop. Rice is water intensive: one calculation says rice requires 1,500 m3 of water per cultivated rai.
