The Fruit Hunters is a 2012 feature documentary film about exotic fruit cultivators and preservationists. It is directed by Yung Chang and co-written by Chang and Mark Slutsky, and inspired by Adam Leith Gollnerâ€™s 2008 book of the same name.
In addition to documentary sequences, the film also uses CGI animation, models and performers to stage real and imagined moments in the history of fruit.
