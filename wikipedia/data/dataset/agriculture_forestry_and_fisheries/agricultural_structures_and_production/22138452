The company is located in Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico, the settlement of which began in 1957 when a U.S. American by the name of Daniel Ludwig—who also constructed the hotel Acapulco Princess in the port of Acapulco, Guerrero—installed a salt works there to supply the demand of salt in the western United States. The salt mine was established around the Ojo de Liebre coastal lagoon taking advantage of the heavy salinity of the place. The company, called Exportadora de Sal, S.A., of C.V. ("Salt Exporters, Inc."), produces around seven million tons of salt per annum, exporting to countries including Japan, Korea, the United States, Canada, Taiwan and New Zealand.
The production of salt at Guerrero comes from solar evaporation of seawater.
In 1973 Daniel Ludwig sold the company to the Mexican government and the corporation Mitsubishi, 51% and 49% respectively.
There was an effort by the company to construct another solar salt operation further down the Baja California coast however it was ended due to the objections of Mexican and American environmentalists. There is still the possibility of a chlor-alkali plant being built locally to process the salt into chemicals as is done by Mitsubishi elsewhere.
