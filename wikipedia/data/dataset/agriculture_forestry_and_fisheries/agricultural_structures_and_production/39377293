Cotton production in Uzbekistan is important to the national economy of the country. It is Uzbekistan's main cash crop, accounting for 17% of its exports in 2006. With annual cotton production of about 1 million ton of fiber (4%-5% of world production) and exports of 700,000-800,000 tons (10% of world exports), Uzbekistan is the 6th largest producer and the 11th largest exporter of cotton in the world. Cotton's nickname in Uzbekistan is "white gold" (oq oltin).
The industry is state-controlled on a national level. Over one million public servants, employees of private businesses and children are involved in the harvesting of cotton. Many of these individuals are forced to labor in the cotton fields, receiving little or no pay. In an economy which is the 82nd largest in the world, the role of cotton is crucial for Uzbekistan. But its production has declined over the years. Cotton production peaked in 1988 to 8,000 bales and as of 2012 is around 4500 bales (1 million tons). The reason for this downward trend is attributed to the precedence given to cultivate food crops, an essential requirement. Its cotton exports are mainly to China, Bangladesh, Korea and Russia. Uzbekistan has launched a development effort to many manufacture cotton textiles through enhancing cotton processing chains and mills. The Uzbekistan cotton industry has also been affected by the boycotting of its cotton by many global companies after human rights reports revealed the working conditions in the country, child labor, and forced labor.
