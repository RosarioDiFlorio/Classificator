The Thibodaux massacre was a racial attack mounted by white paramilitaries in Louisiana in November 1887. It followed a three-week strike by an estimated 10,000 workers against sugar cane plantations in four parishes in the critical harvest season.
The strike was the largest in the industry and the first conducted by a formal labor organization, the Knights of Labor. At planters' requests, the state sent in militia to protect strikebreakers, and work resumed on some plantations. Black workers and their families were evicted from plantations in Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes and retreated to Thibodaux.
Tensions broke out in violence on November 23, 1887, and white paramilitary attacked black workers and their families in Thibodaux. Although the total number of casualties is unknown, at least 35 black people were killed in the next three days and as many as 300 overall killed, wounded or missing, making it one of the most violent labor disputes in U.S. history. Victims reportedly included elders, women and children. All those killed were African American.
The massacre, and passage by white Democrats of discriminatory state legislation, including disenfranchisement of most blacks, ended organizing of sugar workers until the 1940s. "The defeated sugar workers returned to the plantations on their employers' terms."
