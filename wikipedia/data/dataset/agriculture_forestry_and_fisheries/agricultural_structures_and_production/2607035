Midori is a sweet, bright green-coloured, muskmelon-flavored liqueur made by Suntory. It is manufactured in Japan, the United States, Mexico, and France. It was made exclusively in Japan until 1987. Midori is typically 20â€“21% alcohol by volume. Its name is the Japanese word for "green". The Midori formulated in France is sweeter than the original Japanese version.
As it is extremely sweet, Midori is not usually taken "straight"; it is generally used in a cocktail, e.g., the Japanese slipper, which is a cocktail composed of lemonade, fresh lemon juice, lime juice, pineapple juice, or orange juice. Sour flavours are often combined with Midori in order to balance out its sweetness.
