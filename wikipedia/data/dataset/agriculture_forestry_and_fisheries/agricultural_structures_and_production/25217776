The grape arbor hieroglyph is used in Egyptian hieroglyphs as a determinative, or ideogram for words related to the "vineyard", i3rrt, or for 'wine', irp; it is also used for describing 'fruit' or 'orchards'.
The hieroglyph is used twice in the Rosetta Stone to refer to the vineyards, at the beginning of the decree listings, and at: remitting "of the grain bushels 5 which were taken on the arura in the field of the gods, and likewise the measure of their wine [which was taken on the arura] in the vineyard." (lines N14-(Nubayrah Stele) and Rosetta, R2)
