BOH Plantations Sdn Bhd (doing business as Boh) is the largest black tea manufacturer in Malaysia, with both domestic and international distribution owned by BOH Plantations Sdn Bhd. The BOH Tea Plantation, which is located at Cameron Highlands, Pahang, Malaysia is also the largest tea plantation in Malaysia.
BOH Plantations was founded in 1929 by J. A. Russell, a British-born British-educated businessman during the British colonial era in Malaya. Russell arrived in Kuala Lumpur at age seven, in 1890; the primary export was then tin. Prior to BOH, Russell had worked in the Straits Trading Company, learning to speak several Chinese dialects (along with Malay) and made contacts with wealthy Chinese tin miners. Besides investing in tin, Russell and his brothers (Philip, Donald, and Robert) invested in the nascent rubber industry in 1908. J. A. and Philip also invested in railway-related construction, including the new Kuala Lumpur railway station. In 1913, Russell purchased almost a third of the real estate in the town of Ipoh. He and Donald (a mining engineer from the Colorado School of Mines) founded a colliery at Batu Arang, in Selangor around 25 kilometres from the capital.
