Sifto Canada is a salt mining and marketing company based in Canada, with its primary products being table salt, fine evaporated salt, water conditioning salt, agricultural salt, and highway deicing salt. Sifto Canada is wholly owned by Compass Minerals.
Sifto was founded by Sam Platt who was prospecting for oil in 1866, and instead of oil encountered rock salt in Goderich Harbour on Lake Huron. Sifto Canada was formed in 1950 and the company was acquired by the United States chemical company Compass Minerals in the 1990s. The Goderich mine developed into the largest salt mine in Canada and remains a key source of salt for the company.
