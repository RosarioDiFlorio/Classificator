Phanerochaete salmonicolor is a fungal plant pathogen disease which has become a serious problem, especially in Brazil. P. salmonicolor is a member of the Corticiaceae family, which is a paraphyletic group classified based on their basidiocarps. This pathogen causes Pink Disease, most commonly in citrus, although P. salmonicolor has a wide host range including rubber and cacao trees. Pink Disease causes branch and stem die-back due to canker formation. The cankers are recognizable by gum exudation and longitudinal splitting of the bark.
