Sugar production is the primary business among farmers of the western Maharashtra region. The cooperative movement for the sugar industry started in the 1960s in Maharashtra with the announcement of 12 places in the state where sugar factories could be established. The Bombay state government announced a capital share of one million rupees to establish sugar factories at these potential 12 places. A central committee was formed by Bombay State Cooperative Bank under the chairmanship of Dhananjayrao Gadgil.
