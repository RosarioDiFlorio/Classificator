A chaiwala (Hindi: चायवाला, IAST: cāyavālā) is a person who prepares, sells or serves tea on streets or small roadside shops in the Indian subcontinent. They are an integral part of Indian tea culture. Chai is the Hindi word for "tea", as in masala chai, and wallah indicates the person performing the task, so chaiwalla is a street seller of tea.
Chaiwalas, as an entrepreneurial group, tend to move from different regions of India to run their small business in major cities. They boil a mixture of water and milk, add tea leaves and then strain the tea into containers or a tea kettle. They usually serve tea in a small glasses or unglazed clay teacups (kulhar) but, in recent years, they have started to serve tea in plastic cups. Traditionally, tea was made in brass vessels; however that appears to be changing in some places. The hygienic safety of tea prepared in this manner is disputed.
