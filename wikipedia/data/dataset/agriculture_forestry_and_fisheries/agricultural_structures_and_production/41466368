Kondowole is a Malawian cuisine delicacy (cuisine) that is eaten predominantly in the northern region of Malawi. It is made from cassava flour and water. It is a very sticky meal and resembles that of the Malawian nsima, Tanzanian ugali, or English posho. It is mostly cooked on the floor because of its texture as it is normally tough to run a cooking stick through hence a lot of strength is needed.
Kondowole is normally eaten with fish; fish in Malawi ranges from "utaka" (pronounced "u-ta-ka") and "chambo" (a famous fish from Lake Malawi). Kondowole is not a meal that can be made in bulk because of its consistency and texture, therefore is not as frequently eaten as nsima.
