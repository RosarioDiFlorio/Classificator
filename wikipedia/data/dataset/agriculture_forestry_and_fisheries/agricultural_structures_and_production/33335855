Christmas tree propagation is the series of procedures carried out to reproduce trees that are grown for sale as Christmas trees by tree farmers. The species and varieties that are propagated are limited by the type of tree farm that purchases the seedlings or rooted cuttings, the climate/environment where the trees will be grown, the climate/environment of the tree nursery, and what species and varieties that the end-consumer desires.
