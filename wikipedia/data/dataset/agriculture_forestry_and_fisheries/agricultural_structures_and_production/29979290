The Gardenerâ€™s Son is a screenplay by American writer Cormac McCarthy. It is the first published screenplay written by McCarthy, who primarily writes novels but has also written two plays and had four of his novels adapted into feature-length films. The story is based around a strange murder in Graniteville, South Carolina in 1876 that is without many details. At the request of director Richard Pearce, McCarthy wrote the screenplay for a two-hour episode of the television series Visions, which was broadcast by PBS on January 6, 1977. The story focuses on a young man embittered by the changes in his community due to the capitalist ways of the owner of the town's cotton mill. His anger grows until his rage consumes both himself and the families caught up in it. The episode was nominated for two Emmy awards and the screenplay has gone on to be published in book form.
