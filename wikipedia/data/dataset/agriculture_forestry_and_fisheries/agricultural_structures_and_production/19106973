Banana production in Belize accounted for 16 percent of total Belizean exports in 1999.
Banana production was aided in the 1990s by privatization and market and production. Banana production in Belize fluctuates, falling from 68,000 tons in 1994 to 45,000 tons in 1995 before rising back to 78,000 tons in 1999.
Banana production in Belize began in the late nineteenth century when it was a British colony, when American and British investors established the first plantations. Over the last 70 years, the pattern of banana production has gradually shifted away from large scale American and British owned company production to smaller-scale localised indigenous farming primarily targeted at the European market.
