Uganda is the largest producer of granular brown sugar in the East African Community, accounting for about 500,000 metric tonnes annually as of May 2017.
Following a drought that adversely affected the water levels of Lake Victoria, which ended around 2011 or 2012, two misconceptions arose in Kenya's political and industrial circles: (a) Uganda was incapable of growing enough raw cane for domestic consumption; and (b) any claim by Uganda that it had a sugar surplus was based on the fact that Brazilian sugar barons were dumping sugar on the Ugandan (and Kenyan) markets. A more reasoned approach, by both governments, allowed the development of a verifiable, inter-government, database showing production, consumption and export data for Uganda, since 2013.
