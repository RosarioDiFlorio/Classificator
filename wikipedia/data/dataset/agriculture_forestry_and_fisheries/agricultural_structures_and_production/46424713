Berinag Tea was a highly sought-after tea in London tea houses, as documented by William McKay Aitken and famed man of taste Laurie Baker. Berinag Tea estate was bought from agents of Corbett by Thakur Dan Singh Bist (also spelled "Bisht"). It was distributed by D.S. Bist & Sons,  a company owned by Thakur Dan Singh Bist who is a billionaire philanthropist in India. From the late 1900s till his death in 1964, Thakur Dan Singh Bist sought after the tea in China, India and London. However, after his death the tea estate was taken over by settlers and encroaches. The town of Berinag became the tea estate. Berinag was home to one of the best tea gardens in the country until the late Thakur brother, Dan Singh Bisht died.
Berinag tea was made from the leaves of a wild plant which grows in many localities in the Himalayas. It was grown in the most eastern Himalayan district in the state of Uttarakhand, India, but is now only grown in Chaukori which is famous for its tea gardens established by the Britishers. The trade name Berinag tea originates from a Chinese variety. Laurie Baker, the connoisseur, loved Berinag tea remembering it throughout his life.
