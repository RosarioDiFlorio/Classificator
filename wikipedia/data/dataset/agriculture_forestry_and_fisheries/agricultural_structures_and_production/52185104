Oleo saccharum ("oil sugar") is a mixology ingredient produced by placing citrus fruit rinds onto sugar, which hygroscopically pulls the citrus oil from the rinds, giving the resulting sugar-oil mix a rich flavor beyond that which simple syrup or fruit juice would give. Oleo saccharum is a key component in many punch recipes.
