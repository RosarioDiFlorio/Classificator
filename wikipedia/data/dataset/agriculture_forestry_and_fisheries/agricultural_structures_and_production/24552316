The L端neburg Saltworks (German: L端neburger Saline) was a saline in the German town of L端neburg that extracted salt.
According to legend, a hunter killed a wild boar whose coat was snow-white from crystallised salt. The sow must have wallowed in a salt spring and so the first source of salt was discovered in L端neburg about 800 years ago.
