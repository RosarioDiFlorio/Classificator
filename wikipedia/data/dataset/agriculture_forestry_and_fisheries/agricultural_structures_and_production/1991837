Blue Diamond Growers is a California agricultural cooperative and marketing organization that specializes in almonds. Founded in 1910 as the California Almond Grower's Exchange, the organization claims to be the world's largest tree nut processing and marketing company. It serves 3,500 almond growers, and helps make the almond crop (valued at over $1 billion) California's largest food export.
The company produces almonds in various forms, including roasted almonds (under the "Blue Diamond" brand) and almond milk (under the "Almond Breeze" brand).
The cooperative is privately held and does not disclose sales figures, although the Sacramento Bee has estimated it to have annual sales of about $709 million in 2009.
The organization is headquartered in Sacramento, California. From 2004 to 2008, it resisted attempts by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to organize workers at its processing plant. Blue Diamond was found by the National Labor Relations Board to have violated a federal labor law in its campaign against the union. In November 2008, however, the union lost an NLRB-supervised vote to establish a branch.
