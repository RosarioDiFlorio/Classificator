Ringtons is a tea manufacturing business based in Newcastle upon Tyne, North East England. It was founded in 1907 by Samuel Smith and delivered tea across the nation through a door to door service which still continues today. Although famous for tea, Ringtons soon sold other groceries and products including coffee, biscuits and sweets.
