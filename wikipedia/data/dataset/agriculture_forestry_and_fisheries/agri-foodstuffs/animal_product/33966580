Human placentophagy, or consumption of the placenta, is defined as, “The ingestion of a human placenta postpartum, at any time, by any person, either in raw or altered (e.g., cooked, dried, steeped in liquid) form.” Numerous historical occurrences of placentophagy have been recorded throughout the world, whereas modern occurrences of placentophagy are rare since most contemporary societies do not promote its practice. Since the 1970s, however, consumption of the placenta believing that it has health benefits has been a growing practice among clients of midwives and alternative-health advocates in the U.S. and Mexico. Human placentophagy is undergoing a small revival in Western cultures, fostered by celebrities like January Jones. Human placentophagy after childbirth is touted by some as a treatment for postpartum depression and fatigue, among other health benefits. However, scientific research provides no evidence that consuming the placenta prevents or treats postpartum depression, and there is inconclusive evidence that it has any health benefits whatsoever. The risks of human placentophagy are also still unclear.
Placentophagy can be divided into two categories, maternal placentophagy and non-maternal placentophagy.
