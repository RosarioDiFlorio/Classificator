The strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow. It consists of a muscle that does little work, the longissimus, making the meat particularly tender; although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin. Fat content of the strip is somewhere between the two cuts. Unlike the tenderloin, the longissimus is a sizable muscle, allowing it to be cut into larger portions.
