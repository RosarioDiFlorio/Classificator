Makchang (막창; "last viscus") or so-makchang (소막창; "beef last viscus") refers to either the abomasum (the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants) of cattle or the gui (grilled dish) made of beef abomasum. The latter is also called makchang-gui (막창구이; "grilled last viscus") or so-makchang-gui (소막창구이; "grilled beef last viscus"). Dwaeji-makchang (돼지막창; "pork last viscus") means either the rectum of pig or the gui made of pork rectum, and the grilled dish is also referred to as dwaeji-makchang-gui (돼지막창구이; "grilled pork last viscus").
They are often served with a light doenjang sauce and chopped scallions. High calcium content and high catabolism for alcohol makes it a favorite anju (side dish for drinking).
Makchang gui is said to be originated from Daegu and the surrounding Gyeongsang region. King Seonjo of Joseon is said to have enjoyed the dish at his inauguration.
