Fish balls are a common food in southern China, Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia and overseas Chinese communities made from "fish paste" (otherwise known as Chinese: 魚漿; pinyin: yújiāng; Jyutping: jyu4 zoeng1). They are also common in Nordic countries, where they are usually made from cod or haddock. Fish balls might be served boiled in soupy broth or deep fried in cooking oil.
