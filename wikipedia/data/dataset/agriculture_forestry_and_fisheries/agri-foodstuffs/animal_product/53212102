Ximbo is a traditional pit-barbecued pork dish from the Mexican states of Hidalgo and MÃ©xico. It originated in the Mezquital Valley, principally in San Salvador and Actopan municipalities. Ximbo is an Otomi word. It is generally made from pork, beef, pork cueritos, fish, and chicken fried in chili sauce with nopalitos, cumin, oregano, and onions. It is then wrapped in small packages made of century plant leaf.
