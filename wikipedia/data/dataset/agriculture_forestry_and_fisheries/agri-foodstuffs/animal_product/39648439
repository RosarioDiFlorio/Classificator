Beef alternative merchandising, sometimes shortened to BAM, is a method of fabricating sirloins, strip loins, and ribeyes into smaller cuts of meat created by the beef checkoff. The system was designed to appeal to consumers who are concerned about the portion sizes of these three cuts by dividing them into smaller steaks based on the individual muscles that compose the larger steaks. These cuts have an added bonus of reducing the cost of the meat for the consumer while simultaneously increading profits for the butcher.
