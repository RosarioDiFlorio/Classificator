Marie Rose sauce (known in some areas as cocktail sauce or seafood sauce) is a British condiment made from a blend of tomatoes, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and pepper. A simpler version can be made by merely mixing tomato ketchup with mayonnaise. The sauce, as well as prawn cocktail, which its alternative name of cocktail sauce comes from, was invented in the 1960s by British cook Fanny Cradock.
It is often used with seafood, and prawns in particular. Giles Coren said: "Prawn cocktail dripping with Marie Rose sauce is, probably, most symbolic of 70s cuisine."
