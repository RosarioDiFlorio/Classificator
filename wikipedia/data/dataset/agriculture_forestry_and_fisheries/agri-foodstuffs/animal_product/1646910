South Sentinel Island is one of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It is 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) long northeast to southwest and up to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) wide. At only 1.61 km2 (0.62 sq mi), it is much smaller than its counterpart North Sentinel Island and of significantly less interest. The island belongs to the Port Blair tehsil in the South Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
