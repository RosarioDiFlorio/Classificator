The Goan sausage is a typical reflection of Indo-Portuguese cuisine from Goa, Daman and Diu, which once were part of the Portuguese State of India. It is made with pork and various other ingredients, which make it extremely spicy. Their average diameter is about 1.5 cm.
It is usually served in a curry, boiled or fried, accompanied by white rice or baked potatoes and sometimes also with a boiled egg.
One of the simplest ways to cook the Goan sausage is to cut it into slices and put it in a pot with boiling water, chopped onion and a little vinegar. After a short time, it begins to release its seasoning into the water, yielding a spicy sauce and consistent in red color.
