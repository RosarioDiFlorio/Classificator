A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicularly to the spine of the pig and usually containing a rib or part of a vertebra. This loin meat is then cut down into pork chops and their variations. Pork chops are not processed and are leaner than other cuts of pork. It is commonly served as an individual portion. The average cooking time is approximately 9 minutes.
