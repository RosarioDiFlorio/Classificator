Ikizukuri (生き作り), also known as ikezukuri (活け造り), (roughly translated as "prepared alive") is the preparing of sashimi (raw fish) from live seafood. In this Japanese culinary technique, the most popular sea animal used is fish, but octopus, shrimp, and lobster may also be used.
The practice is controversial owing to concerns about the animal's suffering, as it is still alive when served.
