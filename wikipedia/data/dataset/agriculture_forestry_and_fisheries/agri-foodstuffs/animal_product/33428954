Wyngz is a chicken food product that is in the shape of a chicken wing or a bite-size appetizer-type product, but is not actually a chicken wing. The United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service permits the use of the term "wyngz" (but no other misspellings) on food packaging under the following conditions in which the Agency considers its use fanciful and not misleading:
The poultry used is white chicken (with or without skin)
"Wyngz" is placed contiguous to a prominent, conspicuous, and legible descriptive name (e.g., "white chicken fritters") in the same color font
The smallest letter in the descriptive name is no smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter used in "wyngz"
A statement that further clarifies that the product does not contain any wing meat or is not derived only from wing meat (e.g., "contains no wing meat," "with no wing meat," "contains breast meat and wing meat") is placed in close proximity to the descriptive name and linked to "wyngz" by use of an asterisk. "Wyngz" referenced elsewhere on the package (e.g., on the front riser panel) would also need to be displayed with an asterisk linking it to this statement on the principal display panel.
According to the website for Nestl√©'s DiGiorno brand frozen pizza and wyngz combo, the fanciful spelling is used "[b]ecause they're not wings. They're even better."
