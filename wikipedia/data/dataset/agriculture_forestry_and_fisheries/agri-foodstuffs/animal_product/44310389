Beef entrails (simplified Chinese: 牛什; traditional Chinese: 牛雜) is a Hong Kong dish largely influenced by Cantonese cuisine.
Good quality beef is chosen to stew with its entrails for a couple of hours. There are several ways to serve this food, for instance, as beef entrails hot pot, beef entrails on a skewer and beef entrails served with pieces etc. The seasonings called "13 herbs" are the main composition of the master stock sauce. None of the herbs can be omitted, or else it causes a huge change of flavour. The herbs are fennel, Sichuan peppercorn, star anise, dried citrus peel, cinnamon, sand ginger, and nutmeg. The tripe (four tripes of the cow are edible but the honeycomb tripe has the highest rating), pancreas, intestine, spleen and lungs are the major characters of the beef entrails. The dish is usually served with chili oil and black pepper.
