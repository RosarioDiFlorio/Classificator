Crubeens (from Irish crúibín, meaning "pig's trotter") are an Irish dish made of boiled pigs' feet which are then typically battered and fried. They are traditionally eaten by hand. The Irish singer Liam Clancy mentions them in a preamble to a version of the song "Galway Races". Crubeens are made from the pigs calves, and can be consumed fried, broiled, baked, etc.
