J&D's Down Home Enterprises, also known as J&D's Foods, is an American company based in Seattle, Washington, that produces bacon-related products such as Bacon Salt and Baconnaise. The company was founded in 2007 by Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow who used a $5,000 prize winning from America's Funniest Home Videos as start capital to launch the business. J&D's used an unconventional, yet successful advertising campaign consisting of on-line Social network services and personal telephone calls to the media to get stories written about them resulting in selling 20,000 jars of their initial product, Bacon Salt, in their first five months of operation. The business continues to be successful and has since added several new products to the Bacon Salt range.
