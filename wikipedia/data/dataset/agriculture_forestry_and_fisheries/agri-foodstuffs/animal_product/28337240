A hamdog is an Australian sandwich that consists of a shaped bread bun with a beef patty cut in two, and a frankfurter placed in between the two halves which is then topped off with cheese, pickles, sauces, tomato, lettuce and onion. The specially shaped bun was invented by Australian Mark Anthony Murray in February 2004 who was later granted a US patent.
