Black pepper crab is one of the two most popular ways that crab is served in Singaporean cuisine. It is made with hard-shell crabs, and fried with black pepper. Unlike the other popular chilli crab dish, it is not cooked in a sauce and therefore has a dry consistency. It is becoming very popular to mix the pepper crab with a fresh jackfruit sauce.
The creation of Singapore's black pepper crab is attributed to Long Beach Seafood Restaurant in 1959.
