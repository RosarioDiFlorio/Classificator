Tocino is bacon in Spanish, typically made from the pork belly and often formed into cubes in Spain. A variant of it is popular in the Philippines. In Caribbean countries, meanwhile, such as Puerto Rico and Cuba, tocino is made from pork fatback and is neither cured nor smoked but simply fried until very crunchy; it is then added to recipes, much like the way lardons are used in French cuisine.
