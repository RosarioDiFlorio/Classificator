Panchagavya or panchakavyam is a concoction prepared by mixing five products of cow and used in traditional Indian rituals. The three direct constituents are cow dung, urine, and milk; the two derived products are curd and ghee. These are mixed in proper ratio and then allowed to ferment. Panchamrita is a similar mixture that replaces dung and urine with honey and sugar. The mixture which is made using yeast as a fermenter, bananas, groundnut cake, and the water of tender coconut, is believed to be a potent organic pesticide and growth promoter - this is considered to be pseudoscience. The Sanskrit word Panchagavya means "mixture of five cow products". It is also called cowpathy treatment based on products obtained from cows used in Ayurvedic medicine and of religious significance for Hindus. Panchgavya is also used as fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural operations, but has no scientific evidence to back its claims.
The quality standards of Panchagavya are mentioned in Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. CSIR has obtained some patents regarding Panchagavya.
