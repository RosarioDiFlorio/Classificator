An escalope (also spelled as escallope) is a piece of boneless meat that has been thinned out using a mallet, rolling pin or beaten with the handle of a knife, or merely butterflied. The mallet breaks down the fibers in the meat, making it more tender, while the thinner meat cooks faster with less moisture loss. The meat is then coated and fried.
