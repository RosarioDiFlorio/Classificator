Lawar is a dish created from a mixture of vegetables, coconut and minced meat mixed with rich herbs and spices, originating from Bali, Indonesia. This dish is commonly found in restaurants and warungs in Bali. Despite its rich vegetables mixture, lawar is not a vegetarian dish, since most often it is mixed with minced meat or even blood.
