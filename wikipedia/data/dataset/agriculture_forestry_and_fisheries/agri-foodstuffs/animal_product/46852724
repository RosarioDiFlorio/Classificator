Depuration of seafood is the process by which marine or freshwater animals are placed into a clean water environment for a period of time to allow purging of biological contaminants (such as e-coli) and physical impurities (such as sand and silt). The most common subjects of depuration are such bivalves as oysters, clams, and mussels.
