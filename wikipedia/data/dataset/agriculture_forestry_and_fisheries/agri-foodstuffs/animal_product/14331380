Beshbarmak (Kyrgyz: бешбармак, Kazakh: беcбармақ, Bashkir: бишбармаҡ, Tatar: бишбармак — five finger), is the national dish among nomadic Turkic peoples in Central Asia.
The term Beshbarmak means "five fingers", because nomads used to eat this dish with their hands. The boiled meat is finely chopped with knives, mixed with boiled noodles, and spiced with onion sauce. It is usually served in a big round dish. Beshbarmak is usually served with shorpo – mutton broth in bowls called kese. Typically, shorpo is served as a first course that is followed by courses of beshbarmak and a drink called ak-serke (shorpo spiced with kymyz or ayran).
