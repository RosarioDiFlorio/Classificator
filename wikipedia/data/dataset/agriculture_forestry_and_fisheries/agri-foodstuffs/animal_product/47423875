Carne a la tampiqueña is one of the most popular meat dishes in Mexico. It was created in 1939 by the restaurateur Jose Ines Loredo and his brother chef Fidel, from San Luis Potosí, who moved to the port of Tampico, Tamaulipas. Each ingredient was given a meaning. The oval platter represents the Huasteca; the strip of the roasted meat, the Rio Panuco; the green enchiladas, the huasteco field; the white cheese, the purity of the people living in the Huasteca; the guacamole, the fruits of the region; the black beans, the fertility of the land and the oil boom in the area.
