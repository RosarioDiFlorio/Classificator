Mavželj (minced pork filling in net) is a national Slovene dish. It is known mostly in Slovene Carinthia and also in Upper Carniola. It is made of the soup in which the pork head was cooked, and of the remnants of the meat and the brains of the same pork head. The dish is ball-shaped and comes in various local variations. In the past, the preparation of this net wrapped ball called mavželjni was much more popular than today. Potters made special earthen baking moduls to fit their shape. The dish was mainly eaten on holidays.
