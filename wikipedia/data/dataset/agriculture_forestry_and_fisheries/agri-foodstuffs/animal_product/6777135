ang cabeza ay parte ng pilipino
Cabeza is a Spanish word meaning "head". In Mexican cuisine, it is used to describe the meat from a roasted head of a beef animal, served as taco or burrito fillings.
Typically, the whole head is placed on a steamer or grill, and customers may ask for particular parts of the body meats they favor, such as ojo (eye), oreja (ear), cachete (cheek), lengua (tongue), or labios (lips).
