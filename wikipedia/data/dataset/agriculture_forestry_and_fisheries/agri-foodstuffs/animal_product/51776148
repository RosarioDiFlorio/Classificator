Babi kecap is an Indonesian braised pork with sweet soy sauce (kecap manis). It is one of Chinese Indonesian classics, due to its simplicity which lend to its popularity among Chinese Indonesians households, and also popular among non-Muslim Indonesians, such as Balinese, Batak and Minahasan. It is also popular in the Netherlands as babi ketjap, owed to shared colonial ties with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the dish might also being served within an opulent rijsttafel banquet.
The dish believed was based on Southern Chinese braised pork in soy sauce. However it is more Indonesian in nature, because of the mild sweetness introduced by Indonesian kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). It is sometimes prepared with a sweet chili sauce.
In Bali, babi kecap is consumed at festivals such as Galungan and Nyepi.
