A bøfsandwich (literally translates to 'steak sandwich'), is the classic Danish take on a hamburger. It contains the hamburger elements of a cooked ground beef patty placed inside a sliced bread roll.
Bøfsandwiches are typically sold from hotdog stands and in traditional fastfood establishments, and have been described as an "archetypal Danish snackbar classic". Some traditional Danish restaurants have also started serving gourmet versions, with the addition of e.g. soft grilled onions.
Fans of the bøfsandwich maintain a Facebook page which announces "Denmark's best bøfsandwich" each year.
