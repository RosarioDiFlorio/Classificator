Bistec alemán or Crudo alemán (Crudo is Spanish for raw) is a typical German-Chilean dish similar to a steak tartare. It is made by putting finely chopped raw beef mince onto a piece of pre-sliced white bread and then adding lemon juice, chopped onions and a sauce made of yogurt and mayonnaise.
Most probably it is derived from the German Mett, a preparation of minced pork, also served with chopped onions. The predominance of cattle farming in southern Chile in contrast to pig farming in Central Europe eventually led to a local adaptation, using beef instead of pork to recreate this traditional dish.
