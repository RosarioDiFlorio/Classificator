The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation was one of the so-called alphabet agencies set up in the United States during the early 1930s as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
The corporation was merged into other government departments during World War II. As of 2012, the Federal purchase and distribution of surplus food still continues, now under the auspices of the Emergency Food Assistance Program.
