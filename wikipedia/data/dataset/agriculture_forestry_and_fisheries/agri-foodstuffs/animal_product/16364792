Pitina is an Italian cold cut (salume) with origin in the mountain valleys of Tramonti di Sopra and River Cellina of the province of Pordenone in Friuli, northeastern Italy. It is not a true sausage but instead it is a meatball made of smoked meats. The recipe was probably based on the impromptu need to preserve game. The preparation method did not require specialized equipment making it available to all homes, even the most isolated mountain huts.
Today the tradition is still alive and pitina is being produced commercially by several families in the province of Pordenone.
