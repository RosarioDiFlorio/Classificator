Presunto (European Portuguese: [pɾɨˈzũtu], Brazilian Portuguese: [pɾeˈzũtu]) is dry-cured ham from Portugal, similar to Spanish jamón or Italian prosciutto crudo.
Among the wide variety of presuntos in Portugal, the most famous are presunto from Chaves, produced in the north of Portugal, and that from the Alentejo, in the south, made from local Alentejano pigs.
In Brazil, the wet-cured ham called fiambre ([ˈfjɐ̃bɾɨ] or [fiˈɐ̃bɾi]) is often also called presunto.
Several varieties of presunto are protected by European law with geographical indications.
