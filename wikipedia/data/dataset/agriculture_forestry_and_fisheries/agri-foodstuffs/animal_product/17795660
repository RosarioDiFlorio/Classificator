BiFi is an originally German brand of sausage-based snacks now owned by Link Snacks. In the original version, it is a thin, jerky-like salami; variations include a poultry-based salami, a salami wrapped in a white or wheat roll (BiFi Roll and BiFi Roll Korn), a roll filled with beef, beans and bacon (Ranger), and a roll filled with salami, cheese, and pizza sauce (BiFi Carazza). Larger versions of several of these products, distinguished by the ending "XXL," are available; these include the original BiFi, BiFi Roll, and BiFi Carazza.
In the United Kingdom, a similar snack called Peperami is sold, also by Jack Link's. It is made of pork following their decision to stop making the snack out of beef. The Peperami name was first used for the spicy version of BiFi in Germany, later known as Peperoni.
The BiFi brand was originally registered in Germany in 1972 and later purchased by Unilever. On 21 February 2014, Unilever announced that it has signed a definitive agreement for the sale of its meat snacks business to Jack Linkâ€™s, for an undisclosed amount. The sale includes the brands Bifi, sold in Benelux, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and Peperami, which retails in the UK and Ireland.
