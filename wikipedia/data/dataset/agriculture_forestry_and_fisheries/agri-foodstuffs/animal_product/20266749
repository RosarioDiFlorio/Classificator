Tlačenka is the Czech and Slovak variety of head cheese similar to Polish salceson. Czech light-colored tlačenka is made in a number of types. It is generally bonded with brawn - thick pigskin and hock/trotters broth - with various combinations of meat cutoffs (i.e. knuckle, head), offal (tongue, heart, liver) and fat with seasoning (salt and various combinations of spices - marjoram, garlic, caraway, pepper, cloves, allspice, etc.). Another version - dark-colored tlačenka - is made with added blood.
