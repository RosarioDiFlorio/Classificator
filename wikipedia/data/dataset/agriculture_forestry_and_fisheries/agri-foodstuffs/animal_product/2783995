Meedhupparu is a coral island on the east of the Northern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll in the Maldives.
Native wildlife consists mostly of crows, fruitbats, crabs and geckos.
Following the El Ni√±o current that decimated the Maldives' surface coral in the late 1990s, the lagoon surrounding the island is full of dead coral, but is now interspersed with lots of new growth and the sea life is returning. At depths of 10 metres species include rays, sharks, wrasse, octopus, squid and groupers.
Meedhupparu is a resort island favoured largely by Italian and British visitors. The island was for the most part unaffected by the tsunami of December 2004.
