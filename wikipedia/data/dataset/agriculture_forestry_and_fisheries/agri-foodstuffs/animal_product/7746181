Bife a cavalo is a traditional dish in Portugal and Brazil. It consists of a grilled, sometimes deep fried steak, with fried eggs on top. It is usually served with rice and beans and a salad. Its name literally means "horseback-riding steak", as an allusion to the appearance that the fried eggs are "riding" the steak.
It may be prepared from several beef cuts, such as Alcatra, Cox√£o-Mole, Maminha or Fraldinha.
