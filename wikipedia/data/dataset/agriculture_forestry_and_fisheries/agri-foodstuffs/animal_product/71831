Corned beef is a salt-cured beef product. The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large grained rock salt, also called "corns" of salt. It features as an ingredient in many cuisines. Most recipes include nitrates or nitrites, which convert the natural myoglobin in beef to nitrosomyoglobin, giving a pink color. Nitrates and nitrites reduce the risk of dangerous botulism during curing by inhibiting the growth of Clostridium botulinum spores. Beef cured with salt only has a gray color and is sometimes called "New England corned beef". Often, sugar and spices are also added to recipes for corned beef.
It was popular during World War I and World War II, when fresh meat was rationed. It also remains especially popular in Canada in a variety of dishes, perhaps most prominently Montreal-style smoked meat.
