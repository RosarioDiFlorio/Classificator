Kakuni (角煮) is a Japanese braised pork dish which literally means "square simmered".
Kakuni is a popular regional product (meibutsu) of Kyushu, particularly Nagasaki. The origin of this dish is most likely Chinese, making it a form of Japanese Chinese cuisine, and it is similar to Dongpo pork, though not as heavy in sauce. During the Ming Dynasty and Song Dynasty, the main Sino-Japanese trading route existed between Hangzhou and Kyūshū. Many Chinese lived in major port cities in Kyushu, such as Nagasaki; likewise many Japanese lived in Hangzhou. Therefore, pork was popularized in major Kyushu cities.
