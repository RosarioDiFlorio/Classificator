Rafute is a pork rib dish in the Okinawan cuisine of the island of Okinawa, Japan. Rafute is skin-on pork rib stewed in soy sauce and brown sugar. It is traditionally considered to help with longevity. Rafute was originally a form of Okinawan Royal Cuisine.
In Hawaii, rafute is known as "shoyu pork," which is served in plate lunches. In the early 1900s, Okinawan immigrants in Hawaii introduced rafute into the local cuisine. They likely did so through food services, as ethnic Okinawans owned and ran many restaurants in Honolulu, Hawaii.
