A beefsteak  is a flat cut of beef, with parallel faces spaced to a thickness of 0.5–2" (1–5 cm), usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers, with a raw mass in common restaurant service ranging from 4–20 ounces (120–600 g). Beefsteaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (cf. cube steak).
