A domesticated quail is a domestic form of the quail, a collective name which refers to a group of several small species of fowl. Thousands of years of breeding and domestication have guided the bird's evolution. Humans domesticated quail for its meat and egg production; additionally, quail can be kept as pets. Domesticated quail are commonly kept in long wire cages and are fed game bird feed. The most common domesticated breed is the Coturnix quail (also known as the Japanese quail). Quail live on the ground, and rarely fly unless forced to do so.
