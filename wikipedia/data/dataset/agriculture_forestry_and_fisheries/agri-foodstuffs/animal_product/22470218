Millionbøf (from Latin mīlle, 'a vast number' and French bœuf, 'beef') is a Danish beef dish that is commonly served with potatoes (perhaps mashed), pasta or rice. The name (translating literally to “million steak”) comes from the fact that the meat is broken up into many small pieces when stir fried.
The dish may be seasoned as needed, and more ingredients can be added, such as onions, pearl onions, strips of pepper or paprika. It can also be made in a pot with onions, sweet pepper, corn and mashed tomatoes. As a sidedish you can eat it with pasta.
