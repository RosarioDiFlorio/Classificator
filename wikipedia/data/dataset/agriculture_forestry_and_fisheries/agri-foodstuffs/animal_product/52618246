The Pompeii Lakshmi is an Indian ivory statuette dated to 20-50 CE, that was discovered in the ruins of Pompeii (79 CE) in the 1930s. Originally, it was thought that the statuette represented the goddess Lakshmi, a goddess of fertility, beauty and wealth, revered by Hindus and Jains. However, the iconography reveals that the figure is more likely to depict a yakshi, a female tree spirit that represents fertility, or possibly a syncretic version of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi from an ancient exchange between Classical Greco-Roman and Indian cultures.
The figure is now in the Secret Museum in the Naples National Archaeological Museum.
