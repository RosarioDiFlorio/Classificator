Drisheen (Irish: dris√≠n) is a type of blood pudding made in Ireland. It is distinguished from other forms of Irish black pudding by having a gelatinous consistency. It is made from a mixture of cow's, pig's and/or sheep's blood, milk, salt and fat which is boiled and sieved and finally cooked using the main intestine of an animal (typically a pig or sheep) as the sausage skin. The sausage may be flavoured with herbs, such as tansy. The recipe for drisheen varies widely from place to place and it also differs depending on the time of year. Drisheen is a cooked product but it usually requires further preparation before eating. How this is done varies widely from place to place.
In Cork and Limerick, the dish is often paired with tripe, where it is known as "packet and tripe". In Cork the combination of tripe and drisheen is considered a meal particular to and strongly associated with Cork.
