Barleycup is an instant cereal drink, available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Malta and Hong Kong. Barleycup was manufactured by the British company Ridpath Pek Ltd., until it was acquired in 2004 by the American firm Smithfield Foods Inc. and merged with Norwich Food Company Ltd. to form Smithfield Foods Ltd. UK. In 2013 the Barleycup brand was purchased by “Grana” Sp. z o.o., the company that had earlier been the manufacturer of beverages produced under this brand. The packaging and labels were modified in the same year.
A new product was marketed in 2014 – Barleycup with Dandelion. At present, the following brand products are available on the British market: Barleycup powder 100g, Barleycup powder 200g, Barleycup granules 200g, Barleycup Organic 100g, Barleycup with Dandelion 100g.
Barleycup's ingredients comprise roasted barley, rye and chicory, plus, in the case of Barleycup with Dandelion, dandelion root and sugar beet. These beverages do not contain any artificial additives, lactose or dextrose. Thanks to its taste and appearance, Barleycup is considered to be a caffeine-free alternative to coffee.
Barleycup drinks are gluten free and are certified by the Polish Coeliac Society, a member of the Association of European Coeliac Societies (AOECS).
