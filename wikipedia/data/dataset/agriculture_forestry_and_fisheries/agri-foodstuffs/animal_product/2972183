Gelbwurst, meaning “yellow sausage”, is a traditional sausage from Bavaria, Germany. It was invented in 1905 and is made from pork, veal and mixed spices (such as ginger and nutmeg). Traditionally, the sausage contained brains, though this is usually no longer the case. Despite this, it is still sometimes referred to as Hirnwurst (“brain sausage”) in certain parts of Germany. Gelbwurst is coloured yellowish white and usually has a yellow or orange skin around its edge. It is often served cold on a slice of bread and eaten immediately, as it becomes rancid very quickly.
