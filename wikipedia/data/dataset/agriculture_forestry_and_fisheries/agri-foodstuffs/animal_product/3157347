Morningstar Farms is a division of the Kellogg Company that produces vegetarian food. Many of their offerings are meatless variations of traditionally meat-based products, including some that are vegan.
Morningstar Farms was introduced by Worthington Foods (originally a division of Miles Laboratories) in the 1970s. Kellogg purchased Worthington Foods in October 1999 at which point it acquired the Morningstar Farms brand.
