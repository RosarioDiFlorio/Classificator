Tokwa’t baboy (Tagalog for "tofu and pork") is a typical Philippine appetizer. It consists of pork ears, pork belly and deep-fried tofu, and is served in a mixture of soy sauce, pork broth, vinegar, chopped white onions, scallions and red chili peppers. It is usually served as pulutan ("snack", lit. tran: "finger food"), as a meal served with rice or as a side dish to rice porridge. Tokwa is the Lan-nang word for firm beancurd, while baboy is the Tagalog word for pork; ’t is the contracted form of at, which means "and".
The original dish (without the tofu) is known as kulao or kilawin na tainga ng baboy among the Caviteño Tagalogs. It is a type of kinilaw. For this reason, tokwa’t baboy is sometimes referred to as kilawing tokwa't baboy.
