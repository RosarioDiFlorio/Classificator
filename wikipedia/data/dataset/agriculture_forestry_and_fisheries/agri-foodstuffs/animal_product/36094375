Dopo and Adesso are a pair of restaurants in Oakland, California founded and run by chef Jon Smulewitz. Dopo was founded in 2003 and Adesso was spun off in February 2009 when the owners acquired additional nearby space. Both restaurants focus on charcuterie, with menus changing on a daily basis to take advantage of timely ingredients. They have been described by the New York Times as part of a new wave of innovative restaurants that have begun to improve Oakland's reputation for food, and have won extensive local acclaim, with both Dopo and Adesso being listed by the San Francisco Chronicle as one of the top hundred restaurants in the Bay Area in 2012.
