Gored gored (Amharic pronunciation: [ɡorəd ɡorəd]) is a raw beef dish eaten in Ethiopia. Whereas kitfo is minced beef marinated in spices and clarified butter, gored gored is cubed and left unmarinated. Like kitfo, it is widely popular and considered a national dish. It is often served with mitmita (a powdered seasoning mix) and awazi (a type of mustard and chilli sauce).
