This is a list of pork dishes. Pork is the culinary name for meat from the domestic pig (Sus domesticus). It is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide, with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved.
The consumption of pork is prohibited in Judaism, Islam, and some Christian denominations such as Seventh-day Adventism.
Fresh pork may contain trichinosis, a parasitic disease caused by eating raw or undercooked pork or wild game infected with the larvae of a species of roundworm Trichinella spiralis, commonly called the trichina worm. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends cooking ground pork to an internal temperature of 160 °F, followed by a 3-minute rest, and cooking whole cuts to a minimum internal temperature of 145 °F, also followed by a 3-minute rest.
