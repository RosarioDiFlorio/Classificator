Asocena is a Filipino dish primarily consisting of dog meat. The term asocena was first used in the 1980s and became popular when a film entitled Azucena, written by Enrique Ramos and directed by Carlitos Siguion-Reyna, was screened in 2000. The dish's name is a compound word, from aso, the Filipino word for "dog" and Spanish word cena, which means "dinner" or "an evening meal", the literal translation being "dog-meal" or "a meal of dog meat". It may also be a play on the Spanish name Azucena, which is also used to describe a variety of fragrant, white rice.
