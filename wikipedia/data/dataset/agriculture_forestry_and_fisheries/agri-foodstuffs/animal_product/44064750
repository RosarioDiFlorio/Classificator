A steak burger is a type of sandwich prepared using steak as a primary ingredient. In the United States, the first steak burger offered to consumers appears to have been invented in 1934. Beefsteak is typically used, although other meats can also be made into steak burgers. They may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings, and several restaurant versions have existed in the past and continue to be prepared in contemporary times.
