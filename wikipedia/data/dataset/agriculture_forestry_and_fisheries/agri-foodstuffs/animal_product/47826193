Ground meat (called mince or minced meat outside North America) is meat finely chopped by a meat grinder or a chopping knife.
A common type of ground meat is ground beef, but many other meats are prepared ground in a similar fashion, including pork, lamb, and poultry. In South Asia, both lamb (mutton) and goat meat are also minced to produce keema, though the process of mincing is manual.
