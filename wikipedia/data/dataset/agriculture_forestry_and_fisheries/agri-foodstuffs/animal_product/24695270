Chicken bog is a pilaf dish made of rice and chicken. It can include onion, spices, and sometimes sausage. A whole chicken is boiled until tender (with the sausage, onion, and spices, if included), then the rice is added and cooked until it absorbs all the liquid. Cooks often pick the bones and other inedible parts out of the pot and discard them before adding the rice to the meat and other ingredients. However, some cooks leave it all in for the diners to pick out as they eat, similar to many Caribbean meat and rice dishes. It is called Chicken "bog" because the chicken gets bogged down in the rice.
Loris, South Carolina celebrates an annual festival called the "Loris Bog-Off". Chicken bog is made different ways in different places, but it is perhaps found most often in the Pee Dee and Lowcountry regions of South Carolina.
