Som moo (Lao: ສົ້ມໝູ; literally "sour pork"), Naem (Thai: แหนม), Mu som (Thai: หมูส้ม), or Chinsom (Lanna: จิ๊นส้ม), is a type of preserved pork sausage that is a traditional celebratory food from Vietnam. It is made from raw ground pork and shredded pork skin. A thin layer of star gooseberry leaves, guava leaves, or fig leaves are used to wrap a small lump of raw ground pork and skin. These leaves contains a natural souring agent, causing the raw pork to ferment, making it edible after a few days. As a celebratory dish, nem is widely used in traditional rituals in Vietnam such as weddings and as an offering on the ancestor's altar. In modern time, synthetic chemicals are also used as a souring/fermenting agent, especially in southern Vietnam. This usage caused nem to have a bright reddish color and a sulphuric smell. Natural ingredients give the nem a grayish color.
