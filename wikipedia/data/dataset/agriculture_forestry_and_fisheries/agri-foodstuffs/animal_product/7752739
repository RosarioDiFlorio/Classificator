Goldbeater's skin is a sheet of tissue traditionally used in the process of making gold leaf by goldbeating. The skin consists of the processed outer membrane of an animal's intestine, typically an ox, and is interleaved with gold stock to facilitate batch production of many leaves at the same time.
