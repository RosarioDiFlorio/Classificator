Fritada is a typical dish in Ecuadorian cuisine. Its main ingredient is fried pork. It is a traditional dish, and its origins date back to the colonial era, to the beginning of the 19th century. The pork is cooked in boiling water with various spices and then is fried with pork fat in a brass pan over flames. It is generally served with Llapingacho or whole boiled potatoes, mote or cooked corn, pickled onions and tomato, and fried ripe plantains. It may also be accompanied by cooked fava beans or mellocos, though mellocos are rather uncommon.
