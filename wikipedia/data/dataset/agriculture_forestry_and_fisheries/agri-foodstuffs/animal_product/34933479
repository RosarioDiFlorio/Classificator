The Sydney Royal National Poultry Show (previously the Royal Canberra National Poultry Show) is the largest poultry show in the Southern Hemisphere, held every four years on the year of the Olympics and attracting exhibitors from across Australia. It was hosted in Canberra until 2014, when hosting was transferred from the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society to the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, that hosted the 2016 show as the Sydney Royal National Poultry Show.
The National Poultry Show is held every 4 years and has in the past hosted 5000 birds and 1500 exhibitors, requiring up to 58 judges, some of whom have been international. In the past it took place in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory and was hosted by the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society. The show transferred to Sydney in 2016 following a dispute between the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society and the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales (RAS NSW) over the issue of borrowing cages from RAS NSW to use for the show in Canberra.
