The German Ivory Museum Erbach (Deutsches Elfenbeinmuseum Erbach) is a museum in Erbach im Odenwald, Germany. It was founded in 1966, but the collection was started by Count Francis I in late 18th century. The city of Erbach then developed to become one of the centres for ivory carving.
The museum exhibition consists of more than 2000 items that represent European, African, Asian, and Greenlandic ivory carving art from the Middle Ages to the present day. One of the focuses is the work of ivory carvers in the Odenwald area in the 19th and 20th centuries, for example Jan Holschuh.
In early 2006, the museum was modernised and extended. Other ivory museums in this region are the privately owned Ivory Museum Michelstadt and the church-owned Ivory Museum Walld√ºrn.
