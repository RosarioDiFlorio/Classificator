Moronga, rellena, or morcilla is a kind of blood sausage. It is found in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Central America and Mexican cuisine. Spices, herbs (such as ruta, oregano, and mint), onions and chili peppers are added and then boiled in the pig's large intestines for casing for several hours. It is served in a sauce, either "chile rojo" or "chile verde". It is also served in central Mexico as a filling in gorditas and tacos after it has been pan-fried with fresh onions and jalape√±o peppers. This sausage is called "morcilla" in the Yucatan Peninsula, and it is almost always served along with other sausages (buche)  and a mix of pickled onion, cilantro, and spices.
