Carne asada (literally "flesh/meat/beef" "roast/broiled/grilled") is a Latin American dish of grilled and sliced beef, usually skirt, flank or flap steak. It is usually cooked with a certain amount of searing to impart a charred flavor. Carne asada can be served as a main dish or as an ingredient in other dishes. The term carne asada translates to "grilled meat"; the English "roast beef" is so named in Spanish.
