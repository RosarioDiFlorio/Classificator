A spice bag (or spicy bag, spice box or spicy box; Irish: mála spíosrach) is a fast food dish popular in Dublin, and other parts of Ireland inspired by Asian cuisine. The spice bag consists of deep-fried chips, crispy shredded chicken and/or chicken balls, red and green peppers, sliced chili peppers, fried onions, and a variety of spices. It is sometimes accompanied by a tub of curry sauce. Available in Chinese takeaways and chippers since the 2010s, the dish has developed something of a cult following.
