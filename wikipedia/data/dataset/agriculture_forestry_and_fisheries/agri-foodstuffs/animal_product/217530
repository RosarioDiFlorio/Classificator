Quorn is a meat substitute product originating in the UK and available in 19 countries. It was launched in 1985 by Marlow Foods, a joint venture between Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now owned by Monde Nissin Corporation. All Quorn foods contain mycoprotein as an ingredient, which is derived from the Fusarium venenatum fungus and is grown by fermentation using a process that its manufacturer has described as similar to the production of beer or yogurt. It is sold primarily in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. Quorn is sold as both a cooking ingredient and as the meat substitute used in a range of prepackaged meals.
In most Quorn products, the fungus culture is dried and mixed with egg albumen, which acts as a binder, and then is adjusted in texture and pressed into various forms. A vegan formulation also exists that uses potato protein as a binder instead of egg albumen.
