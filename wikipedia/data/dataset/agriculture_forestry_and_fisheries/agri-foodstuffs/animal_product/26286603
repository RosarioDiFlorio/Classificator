The Jeju Black Pig (Hangul: 제주흑돼지; RR: jeju heuk-doe-ji) is a breed of domestic pig found on the Korean island of Jeju-do. This is Korea's largest island and lies to the south of the country in the Korea Strait. It is a smallish pig with a black skin and smooth coat of hair. It has erect, unfolded, ears and a narrow snout.
As part of ongoing co-operation between North and South Korea, there is a project underway to build a pig farm in Pyongyang to breed Jeju Black Pigs. The equipment required (about US$160,000 worth) has already been shipped to North Korea from Jeju-do. A breeding stock of pigs is to follow when the farm is ready.
