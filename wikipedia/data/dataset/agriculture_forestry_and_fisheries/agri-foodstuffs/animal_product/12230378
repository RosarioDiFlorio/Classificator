Pinchitos or Pinchos Morunos is a Moorish-derived cuisine typical of the Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. It consists of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer (Spanish: pincho) which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers.
Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain.
Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years. Pinchitos is one of the main dishes in Venezuelan barbecues, and are eaten almost during all year long. Besides lemon, bread, and wine (or beer, depending on the region), it is served usually with boiled yuca, or, in recent years, with cherry tomatoes. Pinchitos are sold in street food carts all around the country, especially during weekends. In some regions, Pinchitos are called "Pincho Americano" (American Brochette); but the recipe is just the same.
