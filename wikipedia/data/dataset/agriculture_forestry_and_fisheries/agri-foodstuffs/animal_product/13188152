An egg spoon is a specialized spoon for use in eating boiled eggs. In comparison to a teaspoon it typically has a shorter handle and bowl, a more pointed tip and often a more rounded bowl. These characteristics are intended to facilitate the removal of an egg's contents from the shell, through a small hole in one end. For this purpose the egg spoon is easier to use than a normal teaspoon.
Because the sulfur in eggs cause silver to tarnish, good silver egg spoons will have a gold wash over the bowl of the spoon. Egg spoons can also be made of horn, porcelain and stainless steel as well as any other material that does not react to the sulfur in eggs.
