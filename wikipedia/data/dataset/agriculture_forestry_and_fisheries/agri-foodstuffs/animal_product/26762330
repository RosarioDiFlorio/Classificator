Discada is a mixed meat dish popular in the northern Mexican states of Baja California, Sinaloa, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. The dish includes a mixture of grilled meats cooked on an agricultural plow disk harrow, hence its name. The basic meats for a traditional discada include beef (usually a flank cut), bacon, ham, sausage, and Mexican chorizo. The disk is placed over an open flame, and the ingredients are introduced one at a time. The meats are seasoned and marinated according to the cook's preference and usually include salt, pepper, lime juice, and garlic. Aromatics including white or purple onions, bell peppers, Jalapeno or Serrano peppers, and tomatoes are also used to add flavor and color to the dish. It is usually served with tortillas in tacos or separately on a plate.
