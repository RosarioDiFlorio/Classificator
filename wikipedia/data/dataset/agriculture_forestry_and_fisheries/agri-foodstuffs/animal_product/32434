Veal is the meat of calves, in contrast to the beef from older cattle. Veal can be produced from a calf of either sex and any breed; however, most veal comes from young males of dairy breeds who are not used for breeding. Generally, veal is more expensive than beef from older cattle.
Some methods or aspects of veal production are controversial due to animal welfare concerns.
