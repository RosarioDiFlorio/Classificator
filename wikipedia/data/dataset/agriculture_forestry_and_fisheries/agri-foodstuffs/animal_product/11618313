The Hungarian Mixed Grill or Fatányéros is a famous traditional Hungarian mixed meat barbecue dish, (or pecsenye in Hungarian) originating from Transylvania.
The dish Fatányéros was on the menu since 1900 at the famous Wampetich Restaurant (later Gundel) in the City Park (Városliget) in Budapest, as "fatányéros - Hungarian mixed grill on wooden platter". The dish was served on wooden platter, and contained grilled slices of veal, beef, pork cutlets, and a slice of goose liver and a slice of bacon - grilled or roasted on a spit. As a side dish french fries or thick slices of fried potatoes are served, together with fresh mixed green salad, with a big knife with Hungarian motifs stuck in the middle of the steak.
Steaks called pecsenye are part of the traditional Hungarian cuisine and may refer to any kind of pan fried meat; pork, beef, poultry or game. Other Hungarian pecsenye or steaks are for example Cigánypecsenye (Gypsy roast).
These steaks are often served on a wooden platter, like Bakonyi pecsenye, Tordai pecsenye or Erdélyi fatányéros, arranged in a very decorative way with garnishing, fried vegetables and salad.
