The Pyxis of Zamora (made in 964 CE /353 aH) is an ivory carving casket (17.7–11 centimetres (7.0–4.3 in)) (pyx) that dates from the Caliphate of Córdoba, and it is housed in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid.
Commissioned by Al-Hakam II for his concubine, Subh, mother of Prince Abd al-Raman, who died young, it is linked to the palatine ivory workshops of Madinat al-Zahra.
