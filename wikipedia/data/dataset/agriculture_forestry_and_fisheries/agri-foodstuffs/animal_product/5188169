Farmland Industries was the largest agricultural cooperative in North America when it eventually sold all of its assets in 2002â€“04. During its 74-year history, Farmland served its farmer membership as a diversified, integrated organization, playing a significant role in agricultural markets both domestically and worldwide.
The Farmland brand and its slogan "Good Food From the Heartland" are now owned by Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer and processor in the world, but Farmland Foods, Inc. operates independently and continues to market meat products under the "Farmland" brand. Farmland Foods serves both domestic and international markets and has revenues in excess of $3.5 billion annually.
