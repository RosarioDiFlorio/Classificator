Rollie Eggmaster is a kitchen appliance manufactured by Florida-based company Kalorik. It is described as a "vertical grill" that cooks eggs into a sausage-shaped omelette.  The appliance creates tube-shaped cooked eggs.  The user of the appliance adds a mixture of two eggs into its cylindrical cooking tube and a cylinder of omelette is extruded in about five to eight minutes. 
The Rollie Eggmaster has been the subject of humor. It was listed as one of "The 11 most useless kitchen gadgets in the entire world" by the Los Angeles Times. It was also described as the answer to the question "How can I make my breakfast fit more snugly into my colon?" on satirical American TV program The Colbert Report.
