Giouvetsi or Youvetsi (pronounced [ʝuˈvet͜si], from Turkish language güveç) is a baked Greek dish made with chicken, lamb or beef and pasta, either kritharaki (orzo) or hilopites (small square noodles), and tomato sauce (usually spiced with allspice and sometimes cinnamon, cloves or bay leaves). Other common ingredients include onions/shallots, garlic, beef stock, and red wine, as well as some cheese to serve.
