Boca Burger is a veggie burger made chiefly from soy protein and wheat gluten; it is a registered trademark of the Boca Foods Company, a subsidiary of Kraft Foods. Like all of Boca Foods' products, Boca Burgers serve as a meat analogue. Although most of Boca products are vegetarian and may include animal-derived ingredients such as dairy products, some of them are vegan. As of summer 2008, Boca Burgers are not available outside North America, and there are no current plans to offer them internationally.
