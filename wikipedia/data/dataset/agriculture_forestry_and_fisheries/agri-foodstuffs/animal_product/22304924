Meat emulsion is a two-phase system, with the dispersed phase consisting of either solid or liquid fat particles and the continuous phase being the water containing salts and dissolved, gelled and suspended proteins. Thus they can be classified as oil-in-water emulsion. Meat emulsion is not a true emulsion since the two phases involved are not liquids and the fat droplets in a commercial emulsion are larger than 50 Âµm in diameter and thus do not conform to one of the requirement of a classical emulsion. The continuous phase mainly consists of water, water-soluble proteins and salt-soluble proteins. The dispersed phase or discontinuous phase consists of fat droplets.
The water-soluble proteins are sarcoplasmic proteins such as myoglobin and other pigments; salt-soluble proteins are myofibrillar proteins such as myosin, actin, and actinins.
