RÃ©union is an island located near the eastern coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Its coral reef covers a concentrated part of the western littoral. The coral reef is located between St Leu and St Gilles. It is more than 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) long and ranges in width from 50 metres (160 ft) in its northern part at St. Gilles to 600 metres (2,000 ft) in the south. Since the island is close to the continental shelf, the sea becomes deep not far from the coast. The presence of nearby deeper ocean currents supports a rich biodiversity fauna and flora in the reef environment.
