Cadbury Mini Eggs are a milk chocolate product created and produced by Cadbury UK, also produced in Cadbury Adams (in Canada). Introduced by the Cadbury company in 1967. The egg is solid milk chocolate encased in a thin coating of hard candy "shell", molded to resemble a miniature egg.
Mini Eggs were previously produced in the Keynsham plant in Somerset, UK; however as of February 2010, production has moved to Cadbury's new plant in (Bielany Wroclawskie) Poland. These products no longer state a country of origin on the label, instead stating "Made in the EU under licence from Cadbury UK Ltd".
