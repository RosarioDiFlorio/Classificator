Trepanging is the act of collection or harvesting of sea cucumbers, known in Indonesian, as "trepang". The collector, or fisher, of trepang is a trepanger.
Trepanging is comparable to clamming, crabbing, lobstering, musseling, shrimping and other forms of "fishing" whose goal is acquisition of edible invertebrates rather than finfish.
