Carne de Porco Ã  Alentejana is one of the most traditional and popular pork dishes of Portuguese cuisine. It is typical from the Algarve region, in Portugal, even though the name is Alentejana (from Alentejo). It was added because Alentejo is very known for their pork. Algarve pork did, however, not have the same good image. It is a combination of pork and clams, with potatoes and coriander.
Usually about 800 grams of pork is marinated for four hours in white wine, paprika, chopped garlic, coriander, bay leaf, and salt and pepper. It is then fried until golden brown at which point clams are added and cooked for an additional two minutes. Traditionally this dish is served with cubed French fries or baked potatoes.
