The TenderCrisp is a chicken sandwich sold by international fast-food restaurant chain, Burger King and its Australian franchisee, Hungry Jack's. It is one of their "indulgent" products.
The TenderCrisp sandwich is part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appeals to adults in the 24â€“36 years age bracket. Along with the TenderGrill and Angus sandwiches, these products are intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products.
