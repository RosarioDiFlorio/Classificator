Garnatálg is a traditional sausage of the Faroe Islands, specifically the town of Trøllanes in the north of the island of Kalsoy.
Made with offal such as intestine, covered in a layer of caul and usually served in slices, garnatálg has similarities (but is not identical by any means) to other northern European organ meat dishes such as haggis (Scotland), kepeninė (Lithuania) and slátur (Iceland).
