Matsusaka beef (松阪牛, Matsusaka-gyū, also "Matsuzaka beef") is black-haired Wagyū (Japanese beef), also known as Kuroge Washu or "Japanese Black", the cattle come from the Matsusaka region of Mie, Japan. It is one of the most famous beef types within Japan and internationally, with a high fat-to-meat ratio. Within Japan, Matsusaka beef is generally considered one of the three top brands (known as Sandai Wagyuu, "the three big beefs"), along with Kobe beef and Ōmi beef or Yonezawa beef. Only 2,500 cows that meet the strict standards are slaughtered each year, making it difficult to find.
