Carne-de-sol ([ˈkaʁnʲi dʒi ˈsɔw], locally [ˈkaɦni di ˈsɔw], Portuguese for "sun meat"), or jabá ([ʒaˈba]) is a dish from Northeastern Brazil. It consists of heavily salted beef, which is exposed to the sun for one or two days to cure.
Carne-de-sol is sometimes fried and served as a hamburger, or baked in the oven with cream or, more traditionally, prepared as paçoca.
Its origin is attributed to the sertanejos (people who live in the semi-arid countryside), who developed this local recipe to preserve meat. Nowadays, the dish is traditional and typical of the entire Northeast Region, and in restaurants all across the country.
