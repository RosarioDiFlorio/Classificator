Wallenbergare is a Swedish dish generally consisting of ground veal, cream, egg yolks and coated in breadcrumbs. It is traditionally served with mashed potatoes and peas.
It was created and named for häradshövding (Circuit Judge) Marcus Wallenberg.
There are many theories about the origin of this recipe, but the two main ones postulate either that it comes from Wallenberg's father-in-law Charles Emil Hagdahl or that it was created for him by Julius Carlsson, chef de cuisine at the restaurant Cecil in Stockholm.
