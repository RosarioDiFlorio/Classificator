Note: the term "Liquivore" is not necessarily a scientific word. It was coined by the author Wayne Barlowe in his book 'Expedition', describing speculative predators that liquefy their prey in a similar way to that of flies and spiders. However, given that the term describes the habits of real-life "liquivores", it has been used for the name of this page, although we do advise that you do not use the term in an official or factual statement/document.
Liquivores are animals that liquefy their food using digestive enzymes. Examples of liquivores are spiders and flies.
