Dried lime (also known as: black lime; noomi basra (Iraq); limoo amani (Iran); loomi (Oman)) is a lime that has lost its water content, usually after having spent a majority of their drying time in the sun. They are used whole, sliced or ground, as a spice in Middle Eastern dishes. Originating in the Persian Gulf -- hence the Persian name limoo amani (Omani limes) and Iraqi name noomi basra (lemon from Basra) -- dried limes are popular in cookery across the Middle East.
