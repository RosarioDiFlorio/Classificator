Apple seed oil is a fixed oil found in apple seeds. It is used in the cosmetic and medical industries.
A study on apple seed oil was conducted in 2007 which found that apple seeds contain a high amount of both oil and protein (27.5 to 28% and 33.8 to 34.5%, respectively). Analysis of amino acids in apple seeds concluded that they also contain a significant amount of sulfur. Other elements significantly found in apple seeds include phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and iron. This study also concluded that apple seed oil could be used as an edible oil, with the oil cake being used to supplement animal feed.
Apple seeds are known to contain low concentrations (lower than apricot or almond seeds) of amygdalin, a compound that degrades into Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) when metabolized.
