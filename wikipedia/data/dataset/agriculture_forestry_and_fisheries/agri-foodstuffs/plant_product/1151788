Idli podi (இட்லிப் பொடி in Tamil) is a coarse powder mixture of ground dry spices that typically contains dried chilis, urad (bean), chickpea, and sesame seeds. Tamilians traditionally use idli podi as a condiment on idlis, dosas and other South Indian dishes.
Idli podi also called as dosa podi in Kerala is eaten as a dipping condiment: The diner takes a teaspoon of powder on his plate, makes a well in the centre, adds sesame or other oil to this crater, and mixes in the powder to form a moist paste. Pieces of idli or dosa are then broken off and dipped into this tasty oil-powder mix, and eaten. It may also be simply added dry to food.
It is a convenient substitute for chutneys and is usually available in most households in Tamil Nadu.
Recipe for idli podi
100 g of urad dal
100 g of channa dal
5-10 dry red chilis
1/2 tsp til (sesame seed)
a pinch of asafoetida
salt to taste
Mix the dal and the chilis in a wok and dry roast until the white dal turns golden brown. Remove to a plate and sprinkle the asafoetida on the mix before it cools. Dry roast the sesame seeds until they become dry. Mix with the dal and chili mix and let cool.
Salt to taste and put it all in a grinder and make a slightly coarse powder.
Mix with either sesame oil or ghee when using.
Some recipes add powdered, roasted garlic.
Add 25g of rice and two teaspoons of pepper to get the authentic pallakkaad-style idli molagai podi.
Instead of sesame seeds, try adding jaggery to get a different taste.
