Rhus coriaria, commonly called Sicilian sumac, tanner's sumach, or elm-leaved sumach, is a deciduous shrub to small tree in the Anacardiaceae or Cashew family, native to southern Europe. The dried fruits are used as a spice, particularly in combination with other spices in the mixture called Za'atar.
