Elenolic acid is a component of olive oil and olive leaf extract. It can be considered as a marker for maturation of olives.
Oleuropein, a chemical compound found in olive leaf from the olive tree, together with other closely related compounds such as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid.
