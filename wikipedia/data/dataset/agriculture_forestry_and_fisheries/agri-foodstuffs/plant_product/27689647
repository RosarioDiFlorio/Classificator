Hertford Museum is a local museum in Hertford, the county town of Hertfordshire, England.
The museum first opened in 1903 and is located in a 17th-century town house with a Jacobean-style knot garden. The galleries on the ground floor present the early history of the museum. Objects include exotic animals, fossils, and Japanese armour. The first floor presents the town and people of Hertford. The collections cover local, military, natural, and social history, as well as archaeology, fine art, and geology.
The museum undertakes educational activities with schools. For example, Little Munden Primary School took part in a pilot project, working with the museum, to create an exhibition about their locality covering the period 1830â€“1930.
The museum closed in Winter 2008 for major refurbishment, largely funded by a Heritage Grant from the UK Heritage Lottery Fund. It reopened on 27 February 2010.
