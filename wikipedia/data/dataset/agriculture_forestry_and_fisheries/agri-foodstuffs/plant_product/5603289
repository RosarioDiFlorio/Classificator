Microseris lanceolata is a perennial herb also known as murnong and yam daisy.
It is found in many forms in southern and eastern Australia (Victoria, NSW, ACT, SA, WA and on the island of Tasmania), the Tasmanian form being markedly smaller than the mainland Australian form. A related species occurs in New Zealand, Microseris scapigera, recognised now as the correct name for plants there. In Australia that name was used earlier.
