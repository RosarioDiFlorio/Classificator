A plantibody is an antibody that is produced by plants that have been genetically engineered with animal DNA. An antibody (also known as an immunoglobulin) is a complex protein within the body that recognizes antigens on viruses and other dangerous compounds in order to alert the immune system that there are pathogens within the body. The transgenic plants become transformed with the DNA and produce antibodies that are similar to those inserted. The term plantibody and the concept are trademarked by the company Biolex.
