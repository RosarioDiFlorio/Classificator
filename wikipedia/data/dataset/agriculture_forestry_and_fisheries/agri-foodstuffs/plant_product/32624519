Pits are thin portions of the cell wall that adjacent cells can communicate or exchange fluid through, utilizing plasmodesmata. Generally each pit has a complementary pit opposite of it in the neighboring cell. These complementary pits are called "pit pairs".
Pits are composed of three parts: the pit chamber, the pit aperture, and the pit membrane. The pit chamber is the hollow area where the cell wall is absent. The pit aperture is the opening at either end of the pit chamber. The pit membrane is the middle lamella, or the membrane between adjacent cell walls, at the middle of the pit chamber.
Pit pairs are a characteristic feature of the xylem, as sap flows through the pits of xylem cells.
