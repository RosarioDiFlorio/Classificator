Osmundea pinnatifida is a species of red alga known by the common name pepper dulse.
It is a small seaweed widely found with the tidal zone of moderately sheltered rocky shores around Britain and Europe. Although technically a red seaweed, it can show a wide range of colouring from yellow-buff to a red so dark as to be almost black.
It is harvested and dried in Scotland and in the Channel Islands for use as a curry-flavoured spice.
