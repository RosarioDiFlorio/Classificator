Shichi-mi tōgarashi (七味唐辛子, seven-flavor chili pepper), also known as nana-iro tōgarashi (七色唐辛子, seven-color chili pepper) or simply shichimi, is a common Japanese spice mixture containing seven ingredients.
A typical blend may contain:
coarsely ground red chili pepper (the main ingredient)
ground sanshō ("Japanese pepper")
roasted orange peel (Chenpi)
black sesame seed
white sesame seed
hemp seed
ground ginger
nori or aonori (seaweed)
poppy seed
Some recipes may substitute or supplement these with poppy seed, yuzu peel, rapeseed or shiso.
Shichimi should be distinguished from ichi-mi tōgarashi (一味唐辛子, one-flavor chili pepper), which is simply ground red chili pepper.
