Allasch is a type of caraway liqueur of around 40% ABV, usually flavoured with bitter almonds, anise, angelica root and orange peel.
Invented in 1823 in Allasch, Russian Empire (now Allažmuiža in Latvia), a von Blanckenhagen family property, it was widely popular and produced there until 1944 when the Soviet Union annexed Latvia and expelled ethnic Germans from the region.
In 1830 allasch was exhibited on the Leipzig Trade Fair and quickly gained popularity, being soon produced by local distilleries. With the drink's post-WW2 demise in its homeland, it is nowadays a Leipzig specialty, usually drank as a digestif, although manufacturers outside Leipzig do exist.
