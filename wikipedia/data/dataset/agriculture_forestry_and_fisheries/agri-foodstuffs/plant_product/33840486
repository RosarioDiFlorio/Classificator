Ginseng is prized in Korea, and is thought to improve vitality and physical strength. Some studies have suggested that the saponin in ginseng may have anti-cancer properties.
A tea made from ginseng, which can be a fresh ginseng (수삼; 水蔘; susam), a dried ginseng (건삼; 乾茶; geonsam). The sliced or whole ginseng is boiled for a few hours, and then refined sugar (or unrefined sugar such as honey) may be added. A common ratio is 500 mℓ of water to 50 g of ginseng. Sometimes, jujube can be added when boiled. Some believe that insamcha is good for increasing energy, especially for someone who catches colds frequently in winter. It also has a remedial effect on stomachaches due to low body temperature. However, neither belief has been shown in independent scientific evaluations.
