Allium lojaconoi, common name Maltese dwarf garlic, is a species of wild garlic endemic to the Republic of Malta in the Mediterranean. It is closely related to A. parciflorum, from Sardinia and Corsica.
Allium lojaconoi usually grows on rocky ground near the coast, on all three of the major islands of the country (Malta, Gozo and Comino).
