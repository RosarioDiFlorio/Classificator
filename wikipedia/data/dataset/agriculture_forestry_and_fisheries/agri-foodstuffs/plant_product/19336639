Lunumiris (Sinhala:ලුණු මිරිස් [lunu-miris] some also refer it as "Katta Sambal" [Sinhala:කට්ට සම්බෝල [kaṭṭa sambōla]]) is a spicy Sri Lankan sambal paste served as a condiment. It consists of chili pepper, red onions, Maldive fish, sea salt, black pepper and lime juice, usually ground with mortar and pestle or grind stone. However red onions aren't used when making katta sambal, and red onions is used in lunu miris so lunu miris has a more wet texture than katta sambal.
This is a paste which is a little bit hot because of the chili powder added.
