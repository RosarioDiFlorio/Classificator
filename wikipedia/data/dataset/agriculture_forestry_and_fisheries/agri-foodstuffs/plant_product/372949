Cocobolo is a tropical hardwood of Central American trees belonging to the genus Dalbergia. Only the heartwood is used; it is typically orange or reddish-brown, often with darker irregular traces weaving through the wood. The sapwood (not often used) is a creamy yellow, with a sharp boundary with the heartwood. The heartwood changes color after being cut.
The heartwood is dense; some cocobolo has a specific gravity of over 1.0, and will sink in water.
