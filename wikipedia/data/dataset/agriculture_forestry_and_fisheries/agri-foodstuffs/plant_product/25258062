Mogwa-cha (모과차) or quince tea is a traditional Korean tea made with Chinese quince. Most commonly, mogwa-cha is prepared by mixing hot water with mogwa-cheong (quince preserved in honey or sugar). Alternatively, it can also be made by boiling dried quince in water or mixing powdered dried quince with hot water.
