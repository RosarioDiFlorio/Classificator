Zaytoun is a non-profit organisation established to support Palestinian farming communities by helping to increase the market for their olive oil products internationally, and also by helping the farmers themselves improve the quality of their oil through training and equipment provision. Also
As a result of the current conflict, Palestinian olive farmers have faced the uprooting of many of their crops and also suffer from a lack of access to their farms due to the security fence. Zaytoun operates within the Palestinian Occupied Territories to establish cooperatives that enable farmers to improve the quality of their oil and to highlight the impact of the conflict on poverty.
Up to 100,000 families depend upon the olive harvest for their livelihoods to some extent.
Zaytoun is supported by UK charity War on Want amongst others. They were awarded Fairtrade certification for their olive oil in March 2009
