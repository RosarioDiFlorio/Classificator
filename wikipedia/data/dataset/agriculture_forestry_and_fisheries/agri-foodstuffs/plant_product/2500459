Cannabis tea (also known as herbal tea, weed tea, pot tea, ganja tea, or green tea) is an infusion of cannabis in hot or cold water. Cannabis tea is becoming more popular as an alternative method of cannabinoid ingestion versus smokes or solid edibles in the cannabis industry. Properly produced decarboxylated cannabis teas are very effective when ingested.
