Spruce-pine-fir (SPF), which refers to the spruce, pine and fir tree species, refers to Canadian softwoods of similar characteristics that have been grouped due to their similar physical and mechanical properties. SPF is used to make dimensional lumber for home building and panel as well as in engineered wood products such as plywood, oriented strand board, laminated veneer lumber, glued laminated timber and cross laminated timber. SPF wood has moderate strength, is worked easily, takes paint readily, and holds nails well. They are white to pale yellow in color. There are two types of SPF woods:
Eastern Canada (Saskatchewan and east), comprising timber from the red spruce, black spruce, jack pine, and balsam fir species.
Western Canada (British Columbia and Alberta), comprising timber from the white spruce, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and alpine fir species.
The lodgepole pine forests of British Columbia, particularly in the Interior are currently suffering from a massive infestation of the mountain pine beetle.
Western SPF is the primary deliverable species of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lumber contract.
In many cases SPF is used in contrast to other species of wood used for different purposes, such as southern yellow pine (SYP) or poplar.
