Santalum spicatum, the Australian sandalwood, is a tree native to semiarid areas at the edge of Southwest Australia. The Noongar peoples know the plant as uilarac, waang, wolgol or wollgat. It is traded as sandalwood, and its valuable oil has been used as an aromatic, a medicine, and a food source. S. spicatum is one of four high-value Santalum species occurring in Australia.
