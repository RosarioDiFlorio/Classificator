Hemp juice made from industrial hemp is a drug-free, non-psychoactive juice pressed with pressure from the Cannabis sativa plant. The juice is obtained through a large-scale industrial cold-pressing procedure using the upper parts of the hemp plant as well as the leaves. This procedure clearly distinguishes hemp juice from other hemp products such as hemp oil, hemp sprouts or hemp milk, which are solely obtained through the seeds of the hemp plant as opposed to the green hemp leaves used for the juice. The hemp juice production therefore makes use of a valuable part of the industrial hemp plant which has previously been neglected and not been used but instead been left on the fields to decompose. In particular, hemp juice offers a base for a variety of drug-free products in the areas of nutrition, medicine, cosmetics, and relaxing beverages. Moreover, its full-bodied umami flavor offers the ability to enhance dishes and drinks in their specific flavor, especially sweet or savory and harmonizes tastes overall.
Current studies point out the particularly high medical potential of the cannabinoid CBD, which is found in industrial hemp. Drug-free industrial hemp and the hemp juice produced from it offer the advantages of legal cultivation and utilization, as well as consumption by humans in many countries around the world. As opposed to the Cannabis Indica and Sativa plants with higher Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content which are not legal in most countries.
Hemp juice is a highly suitable food product due to the high amounts of proteins it contains.
Hemp juice and its press remnants can be used to supplement food by substituting for instance some portion of flour in bread. It can be used as a taste enhancer in any kind of dish. It can be used as food supplement in the form of freeze-dried hemp juice powder for nutritional reasons. Considering the vast advantages of cultivating hemp in comparison to other crops, hemp is a sustainable food source for the future.
