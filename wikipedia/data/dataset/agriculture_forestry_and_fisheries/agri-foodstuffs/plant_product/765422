Persicaria odorata, known as Vietnamese coriander, is an herb whose leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking. Other English names for this herb include Vietnamese mint, Vietnamese cilantro, Cambodian mint, hot mint, laksa leaf, and praew leaf.
Vietnamese coriander isn't related to the mints nor is it in the mint family Lamiaceae, but its general appearance and fragrance are reminiscent of them. Persicaria is in the family Polygonaceae, collectively known as smartweeds or pinkweeds.
