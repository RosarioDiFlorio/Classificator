Blutwurz is the root of the plant "Blutwurz" (Potentilla erecta), which derives its name (blood root) from the color of the juice that emerges when one cuts the root. The root provided a traditional anti-inflammatory medicine. Today it is still consumed in the form of tea, syrup, cream, or powder. Most importantly, the Penninger company uses Blutwurz as the key ingredient of an herbal liqueur or Bitters that the company produces in Bavaria.
The liqueur is 50% alcohol by volume. To give the liqueur its distinctive taste, Penninger first macerates the root, steeping it in alcohol for some four to five weeks. The resulting liquid is then filtered. The non-use of distillation extracts the root's essential oils, while preserving its flavor and color. One may consume the liqueur as an apéritif, digestif, or ingredient in a cocktail.
