Hemp protein is the protein content of hemp seeds. The protein in hemp seeds is made up of the two globulin types of proteins, edestin (60â€“80%) and albumin, with edestin also being rich in the essential amino acids. Hemp protein has a PDCAAS score of 0.61 (the limiting amino acid being lysine, with a digestibility of 94.9%) and a biological value of 87. The total proportion of essential amino acids in hemp protein isolate, is also significantly higher than that of soy protein isolate.
Hemp protein has also been shown to reduce oxidative stress in hypertensive rats.
