A tylosis (plural: tyloses) is a bladder-like distension of a parenchyma cell into the lumen of adjacent vessels in wood. Less certainly, the term tylosis is in use to summarise the physiological process and the resulting occlusion in the xylem of woody plants as response to injury or as protection from decay in heartwood. It is a key process in wall one of the Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees (CODIT) and other woody plants.
