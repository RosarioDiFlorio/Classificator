Quercus velutina, the eastern black oak or more commonly known as simply black oak, is a species in the red oak (Quercus sect. Lobatae) group of oaks. It is widespread in eastern and central North America, found in all the coastal states from Maine to Texas, inland as far as Ontario, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and eastern Texas.
Quercus velutina was previously known as yellow oak due to the yellow pigment in its inner bark, however nowadays this name is usually reserved for Chinkapin oak. It is a close relative of the western black oak (Quercus kelloggii) found in western North America.
