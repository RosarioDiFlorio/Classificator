Bafat (or Baffat) is a type of masala, a mixture of spices. It is commonly made with a mixture of dried and ground chilli peppers, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, black peppercorn, turmeric, cinnamon and cloves[1]. Baffat is commonly used in Mangalorean cuisine[2] and, due to the Portuguese influence in the area, is a combination of Indian and Portuguese flavors. Bafat is regarded as a pork seasoning [3], but is also used to season other meats, and sometimes vegetables.
