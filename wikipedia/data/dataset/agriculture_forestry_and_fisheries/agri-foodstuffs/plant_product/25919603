Peace Oil is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust, a UK-based registered charity, led by Hilary Blume which supports fund-raising by other charitable organisations. The charity describes the olive oil as "produced in Israel by Jews, Arabs, Druze and Bedouin working together ...(it) encourages co-operation between communities". The olives are grown in the foothills of the Carmel Mountains and pressed within hours of picking to produce extra virgin olive oil. The project has been running since 2006 when the oil was launched at an Israel Expo Day organised by the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, which promoted it as a way "to support Israelâ€™s vibrant trade...to make a difference to the actual future of Israel."
