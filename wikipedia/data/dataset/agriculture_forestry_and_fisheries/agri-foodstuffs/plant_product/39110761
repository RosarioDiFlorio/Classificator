Lawry's Seasoned Salt is a seasoned salt widely used in the United States. Before its retail introduction in 1938, it was used exclusively by Lawry's The Prime Rib Restaurant in Beverly Hills, where the seasoning was created. The brand is now owned by McCormick & Company. Lawry's was the first seasoned salt to hit the market; seasoned salts are now said to outsell regular table salt in the United States.
