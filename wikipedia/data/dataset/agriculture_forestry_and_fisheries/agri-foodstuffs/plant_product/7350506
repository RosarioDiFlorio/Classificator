Diospyros discolor (commonly known as velvet apple, velvet persimmon or mabola tree) is a tree of the genus Diospyros of ebony trees and persimmons. Its edible fruit has a skin covered in a fine, velvety fur which is usually reddish-brown, and soft, creamy, pink flesh, with a taste and aroma comparable to fruit cream cheese. It is native to the Philippines, where kamagong usually refers to the entire tree, and mabolo or t√°lang is applied to the fruit. Velvet apple trees are found, but rare, in Sri Lanka too.
