Becherovka (Czech pronunciation: [ˈbɛxɛˌrofka] ( listen)), formerly Karlsbader Becherbitter, is a herbal bitters, often drunk as a digestive aid, that is produced in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic by the Jan Becher company. The brand is owned by Pernod Ricard.
Becherovka is often described as having a gingery or cinnamony flavor. It is made from a secret recipe based on a wide variety of herbs and spices. Its alcohol content is 38% ABV (76 proof). It is usually served chilled.
Some serve it with tonic water, making a drink called a beton (becherovka and tonic) which means "concrete" in Czech, and lot of other languages. This Cocktail was very popular in the Czech Republic during the 90s.
The Jan Becher Museum in Karlovy Vary is devoted to Becherovka.
