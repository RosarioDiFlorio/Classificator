Génépi or génépy (in French) or genepì (in Italian ) is a traditional herbal liqueur or aperitif popularized in the Alpine regions of Europe. Genepi also refers to alpine plants of the genus Artemisia (commonly called wormwood) that provide the liqueur's flavor and color, and the French Savoy region adjacent to the Aosta Valley, where the plants grow and where the beverage originated.
Genepi liqueur is related to absinthe in that its namesake botanicals are of the Artemisia genus, but like Chartreuse, it is a liqueur (contains sugar) and traditionally taken neat. Like many European herbal liqueurs, especially those used as digestifs, the flavor of génépi can be an acquired taste. It is less sweet than many digestifs, and the flavor imparted by the herbs is reminiscent of chamomile or feverfew. It is naturally light olive to pale gold in color. Cheaper versions may be made bright green through the addition of food coloring.
Because génépi is produced by steeping the aromatic flowering tops of select Artemisia sp. in a strong, clear alcohol such as vodka or pure grain alcohol, it cannot be considered equivalent to spirits traditionally produced by re-distilling botanicals in alcohol, such as absinthe and gin. Further separating it is its added sugar content.
