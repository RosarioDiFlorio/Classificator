Gorgie City Farm is a city farm in Gorgie. south-west Edinburgh. It was established in the late 1970s and officially opened in 1982. Animals include cows, sheep and goats. There is a small play park encouraging imagination led play. Entry is free but the organisation relies on donations to maintain this as well as the council grant and other funding for specific projects. Certain activities are put on for a minimum donation. The social enterprises (birthday parties and small pet boarding) charge the relevant fees. Parking is limited to blue badge holders (or obvious equivalents).
