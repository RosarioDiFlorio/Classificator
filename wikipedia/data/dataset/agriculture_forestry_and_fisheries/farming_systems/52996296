Windfields Farm in Chesapeake City was Maryland's leading stud farm for Thoroughbred horses before it closed in 1988.
Windfield Farms, Maryland, was owned by E. P. Taylor, who bought the farm in 1964 at the recommendation of Allaire du Pont. He originally used the farm to board horses to be closer to American racing. This changed when his champion Northern Dancer retired to stud. Northern Dancer had been raised on the original Windfields Farm in Ontario, and originally stood there as well. However, his first crops were so successful that Northern Dancer was moved to Maryland in 1969 where he had more access to high quality mares. Northern Dancer became one of the most successful sires of all times.
A series of notable horses retired to stud at Windfields, including El Gran Senor, and Assert. Shareef Dancer, Devil's Bag and Secreto were bred on the farm. The farm's most profitable horse, Northern Dancer, retired from stud in the spring of 1987, and the owners decided that it was no longer profitable to run a stud farm in Maryland, where costs very high. The remaining horses were sold to farms in other states.
