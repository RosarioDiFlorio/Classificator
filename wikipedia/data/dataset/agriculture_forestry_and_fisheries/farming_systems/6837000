A bo√¥ (also spelled boo or boe)  pronunciation  is an old Saxon building where a farmer could spend the night with his cattle if he let them graze far outside the village. The buildings, which had separate areas for cattle and farmer to live, were made with cheap materials. Walls were made of straw or braided twigs covered in cow manure or loam; the roofs were also made of straw.
