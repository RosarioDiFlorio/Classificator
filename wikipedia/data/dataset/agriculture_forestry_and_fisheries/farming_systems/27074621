The Molteno Brothers, Edward (1877-1950) and Harry (1880-1969) Molteno, were sons of Cape Prime Minister John Molteno by his third wife Sobella Maria. Pioneering and successful exporters, they had a huge influence on South Africa's fruit industry.
They divided up and donated most of their farming enterprise, to be distributed to, and used for the benefit of, Elgin farm workers. After his death, the younger brother Harry left the remainder as a trust fund that continues their charitable work to this day.
