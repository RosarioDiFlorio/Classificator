The Morningside Nature Center is a living history site and nature education program located in Gainesville, Alachua County in the U.S. state of Florida and overseen by the city of Gainesville. The center maintains a small farm meant to simulate a North Florida family homestead from the mid-1800s. The farm includes a cabin and schoolhouse which were built in the 1840s and later moved to the site, along with newer farm buildings constructed as authentically as possible. On most weekends, volunteers dress in period attire and teach visitors about rural life in historical Alachua County.
Apart from the farm, Morningside Nature Center also has an covered open air pavilion which is used for environmental education sessions for students on field trips and summer camps and for various other events. Much of the rest of the park's 278 acres (1.13 km2) consist of pine and palmetto flatwoods and Florida sandhills traversed by trails and paths. Controlled burns are conducted in the wooded areas to maintain the natural ecosystems.
