Harlinsdale Farm is a 198-acre (80 ha) historic district in Franklin, Tennessee that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It dates from c.1900 and had other significant dates in 1935 and 1945.
Its main horse stable, the centerpiece of the property, was completed in 1935. Instead of traditional placement to the rear of the main house on the property, this stable is prominent in the property, set at the end of the drive in from the road, with its long axis parallel to the road. Several buildings on the property were modified in 1945.
It includes Colonial Revival styling for four laborers' houses on the property. When listed, the district included 14 contributing buildings, four contributing structures, and one contributing site, as well as four non-contributing buildings and one non-contributing site.
The NRHP eligibility of the property (and 342 other farm properties in Tennessee) was covered in a 1974 study of "Historic Family Farms in Middle Tennessee".
It was opened as a park of the City of Franklin, Tennessee in 2007. It was formerly used as a breeding farm for Tennessee Walking Horses.
