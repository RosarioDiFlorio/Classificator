The T&T Ranch (also written as TT Ranch and T and T Ranch) was a demonstration farm and dairy, that was situated in the Amargosa Valley, 5.5 miles (9 kilometres) southeast of Leeland in Nye County, Nevada. It was owned by the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad between its foundation in 1915 and the 1940s. During that time five pieces of land were added to the property, that were obtained under the Pittman Underground Water Act. The T&T Ranch was thereafter occupied by Gordon and Billie Bettles.
