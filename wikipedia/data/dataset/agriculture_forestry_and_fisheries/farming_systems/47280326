Oksenøen, also spelled Oxenøen and Oksenøyen, and sometimes referred to as Oksenøen Bruk, is an office complex on the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. Traditionally the site consisted of two farms, Store Oksenøen and Lille Oksenøen, which date back to the late Iron Age. The site became a market garden from 1919. This was rebuilt to create a 14,000-square-meter (150,000 sq ft) office complex which opened in 1999. The complex was until 2013 the head office of Norske Skog.
