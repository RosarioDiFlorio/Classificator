Loblolly Stable was a Thoroughbred horse breeding and racing stable in Lake Hamilton, Arkansas owned by businessman John Ed Anthony and his former wife Mary Lynn. The stable's first top runner was Cox's Ridge who won important races in 1977 and 1978 and went on to become an excellent sire. Loblolly Stable had back-to-back wins in the Preakness Stakes in 1992 and 1993 with Pine Bluff and Prairie Bayou respectively and also won the 1980 Belmont Stakes with Temperence Hill.
Having dissolved their marriage, in 1994 the owners agreed to wind up the stable operation and began selling off some of its mares and yearlings at the Keeneland Sales.
Loblolly Stable's successor was John Ed Anthony's Shortleaf Stable. A native of Bearden, Arkansas, in 2001 John Ed Anthony was inducted in the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame.
