Fair Hill Training Center is a racehorse training center based in Fair Hill, Maryland. It was owned by William du Pont, Jr. of the well-known Du Pont family, who bought the land in 1926. Dupont invested a substantial amount of money to make the property a leading breeding and training farm for his Thoroughbred racehorses. The State of Maryland purchased Fair Hill in 1974, converting the then 5,700 acres (23 km2) property into an equine training complex and a natural resource center. There are 17 privately owned barns, with more than 450 stalls. Each barn has its own set of turn out paddocks and porta pens. Barns here at Fair Hill were individually named after some of the du Pont thoroughbred champions such as Parlo, Chevation and Fairy Chant.
There are two race tracks: a mile dirt track and a 7/8ths mile track with an artificial surface (Tapeta). The campus also includes 3,000 acres (12 kmÂ²) of grasslands and woods which can be used by trainers who wish to take their horses out on trails.
