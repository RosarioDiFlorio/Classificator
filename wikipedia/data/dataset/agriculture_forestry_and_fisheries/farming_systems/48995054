Sion Hill is a ruined sugar plantation and rum distillery on the island of Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Established in the 18th century, the estate passed through several owners while it was in operation. The great house, the main residence on the plantation, is a one-story Classical Revival limestone building completed in 1765. The factory and grinding mill, the two primary buildings used for sugar production, were also made of limestone; the distillery is located within the factory building. The property also includes a cookhouse and a stable.
The plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 19, 1976.
