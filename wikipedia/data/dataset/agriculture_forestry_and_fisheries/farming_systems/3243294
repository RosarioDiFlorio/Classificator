Coolmore Stud, in Fethard, County Tipperary in Ireland, is headquarters of the world's largest breeding operation of thoroughbred racehorses. Through its racing arm, Ballydoyle, Coolmore also has raced many classic winners and champions. The operation is currently owned and run by the Magnier family, which has been associated with a long sequence of top-class stallions since the 1850s, originally in Co Cork, Ireland where stallions still stand as part of Coolmore today.
Coolmore was home to champion sires Sadler's Wells and Danehill, and currently features leading sire Galileo.
