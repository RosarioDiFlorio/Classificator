Spendthrift Farm is a thoroughbred race horse breeding farm and burial site in Lexington, Kentucky currently owned by B. Wayne Hughes. It was founded by Leslie Combs II and named for the great stallion Spendthrift, who was owned by Combs' ancestor, Daniel Swigert of Elmendorf Farm. Spendthrift was the great-grandfather of Man o' War.
Although Spendthrift Farm is known mostly as a commercial breeding operation, they maintain a small racing stable as well. Their most notable runners are Beholder, a 4-time Eclipse Award winning mare, Lord Nelson, a three-time Gr.I winning sprinter, and Court Vision, who won the Breeders' Cup Mile and now stands at Spendthrift.
