Swan Land and Cattle Company Headquarters, in Chugwater, Wyoming, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.
The surviving buildings include the ranchhouse, barn, and commissary, for the company organized in Scotland in 1883. This company was a foreign concern that flourished in the American West, during the 1880s, when the range cattle industry was profitable. The company operated for over 70 years.
It is located on Wyoming Highway 313.
