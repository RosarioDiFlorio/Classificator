Kinghaven Farms is a thoroughbred horse racing stable founded in 1967 by Donald G. "Bud" Willmot. Located in King City, Ontario, north of Toronto, the success of the stable would see it expand to the United States with the acquisition of a 660-acre (2.7 km2) farm and training center near Ocala, Florida. Kinghaven became a father/son operation in 1974 when Bud's son David S. Willmot began managing the farm's racing/breeding programs. In 2004, Willmot announced that Kinghaven was shutting down its Thoroughbred operation, although he would continue to race a handful of horses in following years.
