Cardonald Place Farm is a farmhouse on the banks of the White Cart Water river in Cardonald, Glasgow, Scotland. It was built in 1848 on (or close to) the site occupied by the former Cardonald Palace.
Cardonald Castle was the seat of the Cardonald Stewart family in the 16th Century. Nothing remains of Cardonald Palace, although a stone from the palace has been set into the farmhouse above the door.
The farmhouse is featured on the cover of the 1993 book "Old Cardonald Had A Farm" by John A. Innes.
