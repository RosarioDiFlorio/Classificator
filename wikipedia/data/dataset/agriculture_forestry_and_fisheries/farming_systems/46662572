Håkås (pronounced [ˈhɔːkɔs]; from Old Norse Haukáss, "hawk hill"), formerly spelled Haagaas and Haakaas, is a hill and an area near the lake Øyeren in Båstad in Trøgstad, Østfold, Norway, 25 kilometres southeast of Oslo. It is also the name of three neighbouring farms in the immediate vicinity of the hill. In 2016 the Håkås nature reserve was established by the King-in-Council; consisting of the Håkås forests near Øyeren, it was fully protected due to its importance to biodiversity.
