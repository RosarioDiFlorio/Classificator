The Country Heritage Park (Formerly the Ontario Agricultural Museum) is located next to Highway 401 and the Niagara Escarpment in Milton, Ontario, Canada, and recreates rural life in the 19th century in Ontario. During the day it also acts as a private school and office, and hosts parties at night.
