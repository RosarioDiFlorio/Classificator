The Archibald Smith Plantation Home is a historic house in Roswell, Georgia built in 1845. The home was built by one of Roswell's founders, Archibald Smith, and housed three generations of his family. The home was restored by the third generation, Arthur and Mary Smith, in 1940. The home was sold to the City of Roswell in 1986 and opened to the public as a house museum in 1992.
In addition to the home, the grounds include a guest house, slave quarters, cookhouse, carriage house, barn, spring house and water well. The plantation was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
