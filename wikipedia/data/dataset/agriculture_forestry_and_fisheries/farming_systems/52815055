Sjønstå is a settlement in Norway and was officially a village during a brief time when Sulitjelma Mines carried out activity in the area, c. 1890 to 1956. Before this time, Sjønstå comprised the Sjønstå farm, which is located on Øvervatnet (Upper Lake) in the municipality of Fauske in Nordland county.
The Sjønstå River empties into the lake at Sjønstå. Where it enters the lake, there is a sandy beach on the west side of the river's mouth. There are also natural terraces from moraine deposits. The old farm is located on the sandy beach and the terraces were used for tilled fields and meadows.
The Sjønstå farm was given protected status in 2006 by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. It represents a special kind of farm known as a cluster farm (Norwegian: klyngetun); these were typical in Nordland county before 1900 and few of them have been preserved. The Sjønstå farm is the only remaining cluster farm in Northern Norway and has national significance.
