A gentleman's farm is a property that is owned by a gentleman farmer who has a farm as part of his estate and who farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit or sustenance. His acreage may produce any number of types of grains, poultry or other livestock. The estate can vary from under ten to hundreds or even thousands of acres. The gentleman farmer can employ labourers and farm managers. The chief source of income for the gentleman farmer was derived not from any income that the landed property may generate. He invariably had his own private income, worked as a professional, owned a large business elsewhere, or some combination of the three.
Some, notable gentleman farmers include Dwight D. Eisenhower who retired to a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania after leaving the White House, George Washington, who farmed at Mount Vernon, Winthrop Rockefeller son of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. who moved to Arkansas in 1953 and established Winrock Farms atop Petit Jean Mountain, Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, Frank C. Rathje, and William Locke Allison, known for Allison Woods, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
