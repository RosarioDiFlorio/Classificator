Luther Burbank's Gold Ridge Experiment Farm is the official name of the 3 acres (12,000 m2) that remain of the farm originally purchased in 1885 by famed plant breeder Luther Burbank (1849-1926) in an area of Sebastopol, California, formerly known as the "Gold Ridge District". To these 10 acres (40,000 m2), Burbank added 5 acres (20,000 m2) in 1904 and 3.046 acres (12,330 m2) in 1906 until, in 1923, failing health compelled him to sell-off 3.046 acres (12,330 m2) of his holdings. Burbank died in 1926.
In 1974, Burbank's widow, Elizabeth Waters Burbank (1888-1977), donated the remaining 15 acres (61,000 m2) to the Sebastopol Area Housing Corporation for the purpose of erecting low-income, senior, and disabled housing units with the stipulation that the 3-acre (12,000 m2) parcel containing the "Caretaker's Cottage" (that had been constructed a year or two after an older cottage on the property was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake), the barn, the potting shed (destroyed by fire in the late 1960s) and over 250 living specimens of Burbank's work be set aside and left undisturbed as a historical and horticultural area, dedicated to Burbank, to be studied and enjoyed by future generations. Presently owned by the City of Sebastopol, it is administrated by the Western Sonoma County Historical Society and maintained entirely by volunteers.
