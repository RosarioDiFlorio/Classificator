The Ryan Round Barn is a historic round barn located about six miles north of the city of Kewanee, Illinois in Johnson-Sauk Trail State Park. The barn is 61 feet (19 m) tall and 74 feet (23 m) in diameter, making it the largest round barn in Illinois. The interior of the barn has three and a half levels and a central silo. The roof features four gambrel dormers spaced evenly around the edge and a cupola at the top. The barn was completed in 1910.
The barn was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974; it was the first round barn in the state to be added to the Register.
The barn features a display of antique farm machinery and implements, and is open to visitors seasonally.
