Middleburg Plantation is a historic colonial-era plantation on the Cooper River near Huger, South Carolina. The plantation house, built in 1699 by the French Huguenot Benjamin Simons in 1699, is probably the oldest standing wood-frame building in South Carolina, and is consequently an architecturally important example of period construction. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.
