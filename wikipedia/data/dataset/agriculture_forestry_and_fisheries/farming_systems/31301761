The Boydâ€“Wilson Farm is a 157-acre (64 ha) historic district in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The circa 1840 farm includes an I-house.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. When listed, it included six contributing buildings, two contributing structures, one contributing site and two non-contributing buildings.
The farm's west edge is the West Harpeth River. The property includes the historic Boyd Mill Ruins (separately listed on the National Register).
The farmhouse's north, two-story facade was built c.1884 and is of heavy braced frame construction. It has a central hallway and chimneys at its gable ends in what is called an I-house. The chimneys, originally limestone, were modified c.1920 to include brick. It has a two-story portico with four square columns built in 1976 which replaced a one-story portico from c.1884.
It was deemed notable as "one of the few historic farms in Williamson County to retain its agricultural integrity from a period in the county's history when agriculture was the basis of prosperity."
It is a designated Century Farm. Historic notability of properties of this type was covered in a 1994 study of historic family farms in Middle Tennessee.
