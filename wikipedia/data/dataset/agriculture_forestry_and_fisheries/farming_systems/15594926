Lawson Park is a remote English Lake District hillfarm, leased by Grizedale Arts (a contemporary art commissioner) from the Forestry Commission. It is situated opposite the village of Coniston overlooking Coniston Water. A major refurbishment by architects Sutherland Hussey in 2007/8/9 has seen the farm transformed into a residency and office base for Grizedale Arts. It now offers live/work residencies to contemporary artists and hosts events and conferences periodically. Grizedale Arts director Adam Sutherland has furnished the building with a notable collection of works by British designers and manufacturers from 1820 to the present day. Circa 15 acres (61,000 m2) of land around Lawson Park is being returned to productive use as a smallholding, and the gardens, designed by artist & film-maker Karen Guthrie, are open to the public in summer under the National Garden Scheme.
