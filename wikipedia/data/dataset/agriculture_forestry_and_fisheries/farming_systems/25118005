Maden Hall Farm, also called the Fermanagh-Ross Farm, is a historic farm near the U.S. city of Greeneville, Tennessee. Established in the 1820s, the farmstead consists of a farmhouse and six outbuildings situated on the remaining 17 acres (6.9 ha) of what was once a 300-acre (120 ha) antebellum farm. Maden Hall has been designated a century farm and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
William Ross II (1790–1865), the son of a Scotch-Irish immigrant, built the Maden Hall farmhouse in 1825, and in subsequent years acquired the surrounding land, much of it given to him by his father-in-law, John Gass. In spite of raids from bushwhackers, the farm survived the U.S. Civil War intact, and after the war the farm was maintained by Ross's children and grandchildren, most of whom made relatively few changes to the farm over several decades. In 1968, former University of Tennessee football standout Len Coffman (1915–2007) and wife Jennie King (a Ross descendant) purchased the farm from King's relatives. The Coffmans' daughter, Carol, is the farm's current owner.
