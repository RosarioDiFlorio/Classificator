Lindley Hall Farm is a farm located near Fenny Drayton and Higham on the Hill in Leicestershire, England.
The farm is a fourth generation mixed family farm owned by the Farmer and Fisher families.
In 2002, the Ordnance Survey defined Lindley Hall Farm (located on the outskirts of the Village) as the geographical centre of England. A plaque denoting this point, and disputing the "traditional" centre of England as being at Meriden in the West Midlands, was erected by Ordnance Survey on 14 June 2013.
The farm is part of the former RAF Lindley airfield, named after the farm which itself was named after the former Lindley Hall.
Fenny Drayton (formerly Drayton-in-the-Clay) is a village in Leicestershire, England, in the district of Hinckley and Bosworth. It is near to the county border of Warwickshire and has a Coventry (Warwickshire) postcode.
