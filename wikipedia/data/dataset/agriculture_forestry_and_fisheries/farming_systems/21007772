Friar Garth Farmhouse is a grade-II-listed farmhouse located on Finkle Street in the village of Malham, Craven, North Yorkshire, England. It was listed as an historic site by the English Heritage on 13 September 1988. It commands wide views of the dale and sits astride the feet of Cawden hill, a reef knoll. The hill houses a spring which, when torrential rains do not cease in days, bursts through the ground and sends Finkle Street awash, waters running down into the village. These floods rarely reach Friar Garth, though they often threaten to.
In recent years the farmhouse has acquired an annexe and an extension. The field is oft home to sheep and chickens with a dales pony visiting on occasion. A greenhouse inhabits a run-down yard with a pond and overgrown shrubbery.
