Darby Dan Farm is a produce, livestock, and thoroughbred horse breeding and training farm founded in 1935 near the Darby Creek in Galloway, Ohio by businessman John W. Galbreath. Named for the creek and for Galbreath's son, Daniel M. Galbreath (1928-1995), it was expanded from an original 85-acre (340,000 m2) farm into a 4,000 acre (16 km²) estate. Established in 1954 on the original area, Darby House today serves as a banquet and retreat facility. Still in the hands of the Galbreath family, it has 250 acres (1 km²) of woodlands, a 110-acre (0.4 km2) animal preserve, and approximately 3000 acres (12 km²) used for the commercial growing of food crops. The horse farm has 750 acres (3 km²) of blue grass pasture plus a large number of barns and breeding facilities. As well, 39 houses were built on the property.
