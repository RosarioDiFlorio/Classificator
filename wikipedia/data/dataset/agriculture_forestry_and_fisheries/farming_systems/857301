Molesworth Station is located behind the Inland Kaikoura Mountain range in the South Island's Marlborough district. It is New Zealand's largest farm, at over 1,800 kmÂ², and supports the country's biggest herd of cattle. It also hosts government science programs, such as research into bovine tuberculosis and related research into possums.
The land is owned by the Crown and is leased for farming. On 1 July 2005, administration of the land was handed to the New Zealand Department of Conservation.
The HVDC Inter-Island transmission line travels through the station.
