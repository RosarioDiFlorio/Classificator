Green Meadows Petting Farm is a farm animal learning center company. It was founded by Bob and Coni Keyes in Waterford, Wisconsin in 1964 as a petting farm. In 1988, they moved to Kissimmee, Florida and opened a second operation, notable for featuring a 2 ft (610 mm) narrow gauge railroad for its guests. The locomotive on this railroad is the same model as the locomotive used on the Gatorland Express in nearby Gatorland.
Members of the Keyes Family have opened eight additional Green Meadows Farms with total attendance of 500,000 people per year.
