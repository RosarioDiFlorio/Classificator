The Frogmore Plantation Complex, located on Saint Helena Island, in Beaufort County, South Carolina, is significant for several reasons. First, the plantation home, along with its contributing properties (i.e. pump house, barn, windmill/water tower), offers an excellent example of the area’s architectural development from 1790-1920. Second, the plantation’s long association with prominent families contributes to its significance. The plantation was first owned by Lieutenant Governor William Bull, who then willed it to his son in 1750.
After the Civil War, the house was purchased by two northern missionaries—Miss Towne and Miss Murrary—who founded the historic Penn School, located within the Penn Center. The Frogmore Plantation Complex was listed in the National Historic Register on May 26, 1989.
