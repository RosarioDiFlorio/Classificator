Rock-a-Doodle is a 1991 live action/animated musical comedy film loosely based on Edmond Rostand's comedy Chantecler. Directed by Don Bluth and written by David N. Weiss, Rock-a-Doodle is an Irish, British and American venture produced by Sullivan Bluth Studios and Goldcrest Films. The film features the voices of Glen Campbell, Christopher Plummer, Phil Harris (in his final role before his retirement and death), Charles Nelson Reilly, Sorrell Booke, Sandy Duncan, Eddie Deezen, Ellen Greene and Toby Scott Ganger in his film debut. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 2 August 1991 and in the United States on 3 April 1992.
The film takes place in the 1950s, where an anthropomorphic rooster named Chanticleer (whose special crow literally causes the sun to rise every morning) left the farm to become a rock star in the city. Without him, rain continues to pour non-stop, causing a massive flood all over the country. The evil Grand Duke of Owls and his birds-of-prey henchmen take over in the darkness. Chanticleer's barnyard friends, along with Edmond, a young human boy who had been transformed into a kitten by the Duke, take off on a mission to get Chanticleer to bring back the sun and save the country.
