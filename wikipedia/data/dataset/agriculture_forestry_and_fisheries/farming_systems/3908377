The Queens County Farm Museum is located on 47 acres (190,000 m2) of the New York City neighborhoods of Floral Park and Glen Oaks in Queens. This historic farm occupies the city's largest remaining tract of undisturbed farmland (in operation since 1697), and is still a working farm today. The site features restored farm buildings from three different centuries, a greenhouse, planting fields, livestock, and various examples of vintage farm equipment. Queens Farm practices sustainable agriculture and has a four-season growing program.
The museum includes the Adriance Farmhouse which is a New York City Landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places. Free guided tours of the farmhouse are offered to the public Saturdays and Sundays year-round. Hayrides are offered on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) from April through October. An on-site seasonal farmstand featuring Queens Farm vegetables, herbs, and flowers takes place every Wednesday through Sunday (11am-3pm, Wed -Fri; 11am-5pm, Sat & Sun) from May through October.
