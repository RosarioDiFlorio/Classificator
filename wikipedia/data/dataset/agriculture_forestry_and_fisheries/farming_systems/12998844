Ghamrah (الغمرة) is a small village located next to the village of Masafi in Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. Masafi housed one of the military strategic bases in the mid-1900s. The people of Ghamrah were mostly farmers as the rich land permits the growth of various types of fruits not possible to grow in other parts of the UAE, such as mango. Nowadays, people have abandoned their farms and turned toward the business sector.
