Claude Moore Colonial Farm, originally Turkey Run Farm, is a U.S. park in Virginia recreating and reenacting life on a tenant farm c. 1771. Turkey Run is the only privately run park in the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The Friends of Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run Inc., a privately funded foundation, pays for all activities on the farm, while the land is owned by the NPS. They receive only certain maintenance tasks from the Park Service. The Farm is located in Langley, Virginia, a suburb of McLean, Virginia, next to the George Bush Center for Intelligence and the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center. Market Fair events are held at the park.
The mission of Turkey Run is to recreate the life of 1771 tenant farmers. The vast majority of Virginians in 1771 were tenant farmers who grew tobacco to pay their rent and grew food to eat. By contrast, Colonial Williamsburg demonstrates the life of the small upper crust â€” merchants and landowners.
