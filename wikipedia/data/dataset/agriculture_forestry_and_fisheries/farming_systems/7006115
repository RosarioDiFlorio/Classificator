The Jarrell Plantation State Historic Site is a cotton plantation and state park in Juliette, Georgia, United States. Located in the red clay hills of the Georgia piedmont, the site stands as one of the best-preserved examples of a "middle class" Southern plantation. The Jarrell Plantation's buildings and artifacts all came from one source, the Jarrell family, who farmed the land for over 140 years. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is a Georgia state park in Jones County.
