Lewisfield Plantation is a historic plantation house located near Moncks Corner, Berkeley County, South Carolina. It was built about 1774, and is a 2 1/2-half story clapboard dwelling. It is supported by a high brick foundation that encloses a raised basement. It has a five bay wide verandah supported by six slender Doric order columns. Records show over 100 slaves were held in bondage on the plantation as of 1835. A Revolutionary War skirmish occurred directly in front of the house when Colonel Wade Hampton (1752â€“1835) surprised a British force that had stopped at Lewisfield Plantation to await a paroled prisoner of war, Keating Simons, who was the owner of the plantation at the time. South Carolinian politician Rembert Dennis lived on the plantation. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
