Annandale Farm was situated six kilometres from Sydney in the present day suburbs of Stanmore and Annandale. Built by George Johnston, it became one of the most successful farms in the early colonial days of New South Wales. Johnston was a Royal Marines officer, and briefly Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. He was a key figure in the Rum Rebellion of 1808. He rode from the farm to arrest Captain Bligh on January 26, 1808. Also it was from the farm where Johnston marched with his troops to Castle Hill on March 5th, 1804 to quell a convict revolt.
