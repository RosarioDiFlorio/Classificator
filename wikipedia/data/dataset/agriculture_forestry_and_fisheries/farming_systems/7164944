Xalapa Farm is an American Thoroughbred horse breeding farm founded in 1897 in Paris, Kentucky by Edward Francis Simms.
Horses such as Prince Palatine have stood at stud at Xalapa Farm. They have bred notable Graded stakes race winners such as Suave Dancer who in 1991 won the Irish Champion Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and blue hen broodmare Hildene.
