London Heritage Farm is a 4.06 acres (1.64 ha) historical site that contains the 1880s London family farm house and a park overlooking the south arm of the Fraser River. The farmhouse runs a tea room, gift shop and six display rooms. The grounds include heritage and herb gardens, the restored Spragg family barn, antique farming equipment, a small hand tool museum, chickens, Honey and Blue Orchard bees, community gardens/allotments and large lawns as well as picnic tables and public washrooms.
The London farmhouse has been fully restored and furnished to illustrate rural life in Richmond during the 1880 to 1930 era. Six rooms display the furniture, pictures, clothing, quilts and everyday articles of the era.
London Heritage Farm is owned by the City of Richmond and operated by the London Heritage Farm Society. Operations and improvements to the house are financed through donations, the operation of the tea room, gift shop and special events held by the Society.
