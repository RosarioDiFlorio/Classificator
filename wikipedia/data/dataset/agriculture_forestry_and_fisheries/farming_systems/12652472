The Garfield Farm and Inn Museum is a Registered Historic Place in Kane County, Illinois, United States. The property is a 375-acre (1.52 km2) farmstead, centered on an inn that served teamsters and the nearby community during the 1840s. It is currently a museum offering a variety of educational and entertainment events. The buildings that remain are three original 1840s structures, including the 1842 hay and grain barn, the 1849 horse barn, and the 1846 inn. Various other barns and outbuildings also stand, the last dated to 1906.
Garfield Farm & Tavern Museum is the only historically intact Illinois prairie farmstead and former teamsters' inn being restored by donors and volunteers from over 3000 households in 37 states as an 1840s living history farm and inn museum.
