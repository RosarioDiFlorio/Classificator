Montauk County Park, formerly known as Theodore Roosevelt County Park, is located approximately three miles (4.8 km) east of Montauk, New York. The park is 1,157 acres (4.68 km2) in size, running from Montauk Highway north to Block Island Sound and is bordered on the east by Montauk Point State Park.
Montauk County Park was created from 1971 to 1986 through a series of land acquisitions by Suffolk County with the help of Hilda Lindley and the Concerned Citizens of Montauk. It was named for Theodore Roosevelt in 1998 to commemorate the centennial anniversary of his return to Long Island following the Spanish–American War, however it was re-named "Montauk County Park" in 2014 after concerns were raised about the insignificance of Roosevelt's actual involvement with the area.
The park includes:
Big Reed Pond – a National Natural Landmark.
Montaukett Village – a home and burial ground of the Montaukett tribe of Native Americans, which includes the grave of member Stephen Talkhouse
Deep Hollow Ranch – the first cattle ranch in the United States, established in 1658
Third House – the third residence constructed in the 18th century for cattle keepers, who brought cattle to graze in Montauk each summer. The house is open seasonally.
Camp Wikoff – where Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were temporarily quarantined after returning from the Spanish–American War in 1898
