Fairview Plantation was built around the year 1800 by Baruch Duckett in Collington, Maryland (now the census-designated place of Fairwood). The house is a transitional federal/Greek revival design considered to be a significant part of the Prince George's County heritage. Fairview is a two-story stuccoed brick plantation house with flush end chimneys and a unique stepped gable at one gable end. Its Georgian plan interior features fine Federal style trim.
