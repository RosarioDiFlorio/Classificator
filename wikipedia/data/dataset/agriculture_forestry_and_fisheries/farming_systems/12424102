The Forest Home Farms is a 16-acre (6.5 ha) municipal historic park located in San Ramon, California. In 1997, Ruth Quayle Boone bequeathed the land and all buildings on it to the City of San Ramon for use as a park and historical site in memory of her husband, Travis Moore Boone. After Ruth Booneâ€™s death in 1998 at the age of 94, the City expanded the memorial to include Ruth, in honor of her generosity to the people of San Ramon and in recognition of the contribution women made to agriculture in the San Ramon Valley.
