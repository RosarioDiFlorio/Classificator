The Brandegee Estate is an historic estate at 280 Newton Street in Brookline and Boston, Massachusetts. Developed at the turn of the 20th century, it is one of the largest essentially intact estate properties in either community. It was developed by Mary (Pratt) Sprague, a direct descendant of Joseph Weld, one of Boston's first settlers, and is noted for its large Renaissance Revival mansion (designed by Little, Brown & Moore), and landscaping by Charles A. Platt. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Its name derives from Mary Sprague's second husband, Edward Brandegee.
