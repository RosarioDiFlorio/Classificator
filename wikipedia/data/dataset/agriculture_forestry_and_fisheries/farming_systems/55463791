Glenalvon House is an historic homestead located in Campbelltown, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
Glenalvon House and farm was the family home of Michael Byrne, a publican. The homestead in the Australian Colonial Georgian style was built in 1840. The homestead is managed by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society Inc. as a museum that is open to the public for a modest fee.
On 2 April 1999 the estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following statement of significance:

Glenalvon is historically, aesthetically and socially significant as one of the oldest urban townhouses in the township of Campbelltown. The house and stables of Glenalvon are a significant landmark element. Glenalvon has been used continuously as a residence for almost 160 years and although some changes have been made to the house, much of the original fabric, dating from 1840, has survived intact. The landscape setting of the house is also important as it represents part of the original curtilage of the property and makes a major contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown.
