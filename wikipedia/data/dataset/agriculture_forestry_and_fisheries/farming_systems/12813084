Lane's End Farm is a Thoroughbred horse breeding farm in Versailles, Kentucky established in 1979. The original land was part of Bosque Bonita Farm and was originally owned by Abraham Buford, a Confederate Army General. The land was later bought by horseman John H. Morris. Now owned and operated by the Farish family, Lane's End Farm has become one of the major breeding farms in North America.
