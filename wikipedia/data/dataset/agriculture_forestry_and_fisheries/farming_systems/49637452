Hove Farm (Norwegian: Hove gård) is an original undivided farm (matrikkelgård) on the southwest part of the island of Tromøy in the municipality of Arendal in Aust-Agder county, Norway. The farm is located on a headland, with the sea behind it to the southeast and facing Hove Bay (Hovekilen) to the northwest. Hove Bay is a protected marine area, accessible only to small vessels. The islands of Merdø and Gjesøya lies closest to Hove. Until 1942, Hove Farm had a single registration number and a single owner. The farm was purchased by the state in 1942, and was then used by the German occupation forces during the Second World War. Today the farm belongs to the municipality of Arendal.
The farmhouse dates from 1725 and was built after the original structure at the site burned. Below the farm there were one or two cotter's farms in the past, when a tannery operated at the farm in the early 1800s.
