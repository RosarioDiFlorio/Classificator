Return to Green Acres is a 1990 American made-for-television comedy film based on the 1965â€“1971 sitcom Green Acres which premiered on CBS on May 18, 1990. It stars all the then-surviving original cast (Hank Patterson and Barbara Pepper (Fred and Doris Ziffel) died in 1975 and 1969 respectively, and Eleanor Audley (Eunice Douglas) retired from acting in 1970).
This movie was the final acting performance of character actor Frank Cady, who reprised his role as Sam Drucker, the Hooterville general store proprietor, who was featured concurrently on both Green Acres and the sister CBS sitcom from which it was spun off, Petticoat Junction; Cady died in 2012 at the age of 96.
