Wertheimer et Frère is a Thoroughbred horse racing and breeding business partnership between brothers Alain and Gerard Wertheimer of France.
The Wertheimer brothers are the owners of the House of Chanel in Paris. They inherited that company and the horse racing business from their father Jacques who had inherited a racing stable from his parents Pierre and Germaine Wertheimer.
The brothers operate as La Presle Farm and/or Wertheimer Farm in the United States and in France as Wertheimer et Frère where they have won numerous important Conditions races.
Alec Head trained for the family in Europe until his retirement in 1984 but for a number of years continued to act as their bloodstock advisor. Head's daughter Christiane "Criquette" Head took over as trainer in 1983 and continued to have great success until they ended their working relationship in 2006.
In the United States, the Wertheimer brothers won the 1993 Breeders' Cup Turf and earned American Horse of the Year honors with Kotashaan. In 2003, they won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies with Halfbridled. Both horses were trained by Richard Mandella.
In 2008, 2009, and 2010, their filly Goldikova won the TVG Breeders' Cup Mile, becoming the only horse to ever win a Breeders' Cup event three times. In 2011, Goldikova competed in the event for a fourth consecutive year, finishing 3rd. Goldikova was trained by Freddy Head who is the brother of Criquette Head.
