Ramme Gaard is an organic farm and country estate, located just north of Hvitsten in Akershus municipality, on the coast of Norway, owned by billionaire philanthropist Petter Olsen.
Developed as a working farm on organic principles from its inception, the Baroque garden which is open to the public features sculptures, ponds, fountains and cascades.
Olsen also facilitates and sponsors cultural projects around the estate grounds. The open air amphitheatre is used as a public performance area. This includes the annual Rock Festival which has featured performances by CC Cowboys, Deadaheads and Neil Young.
