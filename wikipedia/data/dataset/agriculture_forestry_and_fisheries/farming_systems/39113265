The Page Farm & Home Museum is a museum on the campus of the University of Maine in Orono, Maine. Its mission is "to collect, document, preserve, interpret and disseminate knowledge of Maine history relating to farms and farming communities between 1865 and 1940, providing an educational and cultural experience for the public and a resource for researchers of this period." The University of Maine was founded in 1865 as the "Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts". The centerpiece of the museum is the Maine Experiment Station Barn, a 19th-century barn, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, that is the last standing agricultural building on the campus.
