The Nesset Parsonage (Norwegian: Nesset prestegård) lies 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) southwest of Eidsvåg on the south side of Langfjorden in the municipality of Nesset, Norway.
The parsonage is especially known for being the boyhood home of the writer Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. His father, Peder Bjørnson, served as the parish priest here from 1837 to 1853. Bjørnstjerne lived in Nesset until 1844, when he moved to Molde and started high school. The rural community and nature at the parsonage in Romsdal had a strong impact on Bjørnson's poetry.
The parsonage has been developed in a partnership between the Romsdal Museum as a museum-based consultant and the Norwegian Church Endowment (Ovf), which owns the property. The parsonage is the municipality's millennium site.
