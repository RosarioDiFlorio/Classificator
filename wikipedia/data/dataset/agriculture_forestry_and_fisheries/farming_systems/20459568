Leighton Hall is an estate located to the east of Welshpool in the historic county of Montgomeryshire, now Powys, in Wales. Leighton Hall is a listed grade I property. It is located on the opposite side of the valley of the river Severn to Powis Castle. The Leighton Hall Estate is particularly notable for the Hall which was decorated and furnished by the Craces to designs by Pugin in his Houses of Parliament style, and for the Home Farm, a model farm , which was to be in the forefront of the Victorian industrialised High Farming. Leighton Hall was also the birthplace of the much disparaged hybrid Cupressocyparis leylandii hedge tree. The Hall is now in private ownership and is not accessible to the public, although it can still be viewed from the road. The Home Farm is currently under restoration.
