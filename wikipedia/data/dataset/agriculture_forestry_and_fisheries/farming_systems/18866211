Rose Hill Plantation House is an historic Carpenter Gothic house located on US 278 in Bluffton, South Carolina. It was begun in 1858 for Dr. John Kirk and Caroline Kerk, his wife, but construction was interrupted by the Civil War and not resumed until after World War II when it was renovated and finished by architect Willis Irvin for John Sturgeon and Florence Sturgeon, his wife. On May 19, 1983, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
According to tradition, the house was spared ordered destruction during the Civil War after a Union soldier declared "this house is too beautiful to be burned".
