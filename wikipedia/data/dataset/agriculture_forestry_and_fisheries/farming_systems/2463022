Prescott Farm is a historic preservation of a colonial farm in Middletown (Newport County), Rhode Island. It spans 40 acres, and was in danger of demolition before Doris Duke, through the Newport Restoration Foundation [1] bought it in 1973 and began restoration of the historical site. Notable features of it include an operational windmill (c. 1811), British General Prescott's Guard House, a county store (c. 1715), and a University of Rhode Island Master Gardener [2] project with the purpose of simulating a historical vegetable garden through careful research on what crops where grown during that time period. The farm itself is typical of the farms on Aquidneck Island.
