Barnyard Commandos is an action figure line created by toy designer James Groman for American Greetings Corporation and produced by Playmates in 1989. A thirteen-episode French-American animated series was based on the figures the following year. Produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and the French company IDDH. It features the vocal talents of S. Scott Bullock, Thom Bray, Pat Fraley, Paul Hreppel, John Mariano, Bob Ridgeley, Lennie Weinrib, and Danny Wells. However, the series was not successful enough to merit further production of episodes.
The property is based around the concept of farm animals who consumed radioactive materials left over from an abandoned military experiment, mutating them into hyper-intelligent, anthropomorphic paramilitary troops. This consists of two "hilariously harmless" opposing teams: the R.A.M.S. (Rebel Army of Military Sheep) and the P.O.R.K.S. (Platoon of Rebel Killer Swine).
