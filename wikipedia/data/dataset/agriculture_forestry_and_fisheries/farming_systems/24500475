Sheepdrove Organic Farm gained a high public profile when Juliet and Peter Kindersley took the UK government to court over its handling of the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. They also campaigned for a better approach to the 2007 FMD outbreak.
The Kindersleys established Sheepdrove Organic Farm during the late 1990s after the acquisition of land neighbouring their home at Sheepdrove Farmhouse. The holding was put through organic conversion under Soil Association UK certification and developed an organic rotation system with a broad range of livestock and crops. They soon began a home delivery service taking orders through a website at a time when online meat sales were highly unusual. The farm is renowned as a place where organic principles and environmental sustainability are promoted.
