The Black Forest Open Air Museum (German: Schwarzw√§lder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof) is an open-air museum in the Black Forest, Germany, located between Hausach and Gutach.
The museum is centred on the Vogtsbauernhof farmhouse dating from 1612, which was built on this site. Other buildings from the Black Forest have been dismantled, transported to the museum and reassembled.
