Runnymede Farm is an American horse breeding farm located outside Paris, Kentucky on U.S. Route 27, the Paris-Cynthiana Road. It is said to be the longest continuously running Thoroughbred horse farm in Kentucky, 365-acre (1.48 km2) established in 1867 by American Civil War Colonels Ezekiel Field Clay and Catesby Woodford.
Colonel Ezekiel Clay (1840â€“1920), whose father, Brutus J. Clay, was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives and the United States House of Representatives and a breeder of Thoroughbreds and champion cattle. He was a nephew of abolitionist Cassius Clay and a cousin to Henry Clay.
Catesby Woodford (d. age 74 in 1923) was a wealthy Paris, Kentucky distiller who became President of the Race Horse Owners' and Trainers' Association and whose New York Times obituary said "was regarded as the dean of Kentucky sportsmen."
