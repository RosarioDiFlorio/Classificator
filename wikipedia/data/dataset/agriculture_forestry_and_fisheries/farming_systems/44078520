Upper Pengelli is a farm in the township of Pengelli in Kerry in the historic county of Montgomeryshire, which is now part of Powys. The farmhouse is a timber framed house of Lobby entry type probably dating from the earlier part of 17th Century. A gabled wing was added at a right angles to the main house in the mid-19th century, when it was partly brick faced. The tile hanging on the house which imitates slate is mid-20th century. The farm buildings are an example of a small model or Industrial farm by the architects Poundley and Walker. It was part of the Brynllywarch Estates owned by the Naylor Family. It was sold in 1931 to Montgomeryshire County Council and after 1974 became a Powys County Council Smallholding. In the 1980s it was designated for conversion into a Rural Life Museum. It subsequently became derelict and in 2014 offered for sale by Powys County Council.
