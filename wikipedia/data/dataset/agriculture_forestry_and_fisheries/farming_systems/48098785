Mas√≠a el Altet is a family-owned estate that dates back to the 18th century. The building is catalogued by the Valencian Community as "Cultural Patrimony-Building".
The owner of the rustic farm, The Economist and Auditor Jorge Petit, developed this business from his passion for the agriculture, the grove respects the tradition of farming from the existing centenary olive trees at the farm.
Originally, the olive oil was sold to Italy and given the exceptional quality obtained, he decided to bottle the so far acclaimed extra virgin olive oil. The acceptance was so great that Jorge Petit started to present his new product in many extra virgin olive oil competitions, becoming the most awarded EVOO in the world.
