Adena Springs is a Thoroughbred horse breeding operation owned by Frank Stronach and his family. The main farm is located in Paris, Kentucky, with satellite locations in Florida and Ontario, Canada. Adena Springs has won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder eight times, one of which was Stronach winning the award in his own name. Adena Springs has won the Canadian Sovereign Award for Outstanding Breeder six times, plus four earlier wins under Stronach's own name.
Adena Springs has stood multiple stallions at its various farms since 1996. Their first important stallion was El Prado, who was the leading sire in North America for 2002, and an influential sire of sires, including Medaglia d'Oro and Kitten's Joy, himself the leading sire in 2012. They next expanded their program by adding half-brothers Awesome Again and Macho Uno. As of 2016, the operation stands 18 stallions. In 2013, Adena Springs stood three of the top 15 stallions in the Thoroughbred industry, with stud fees ranging from $3,500 to $75,000 for various stallions.
Adena Springs began as a nursery to produce horses for Stronach Stables. Famous homebreds include Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again and his best son, Horse of the Year Ghostzapper, both of whom stand at Adena. With the expansion of the farm, Adena is now a major seller of young thoroughbreds. Horses bred and sold by Adena include Game On Dude and Judy the Beauty.
