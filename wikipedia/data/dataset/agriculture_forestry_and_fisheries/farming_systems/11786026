When on a farm along-with crop production, some other agriculture based practices like poultry or dairy farming etc. is adopted, then this system of farming is known as mixed farming. It is the dominant system in Europe and now in parts of India, where most farms have a mixture of fields and pastures. It was first mainly used for self-consumption, but now in Advanced countries like USA, Japan, etc., this is done for a commercial purpose.
Cultivation of crops along with rearing of animals for meat or milk is called Mixed Farming. For example, the same farm may grow cereal crops, and keep cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry.
In mixed farming, along with farming some other agriculture based practices are also carried out.
Often the dung from the cattle is used to fertilize the cereal crops. Before horses were used for haulage, many young male cattle were often not butchered as surplus for meat but castrated and used as bullocks to haul the cart and the plough.
