An Aussiedlerhof (plural: Aussiedlerhöfe), also called an Aussiedlung (plural: Aussiedlungen) is an agricultural concern in Germany, typically a farm, located outside a village and which has moved away from that village, usually due to a lack of space.
Many aussiedlerhöfe were established in Germany, during the post-war period. Many of these farms are located in the area surrounding a village at some distance from the other buildings. They were usually established by farmers who had originally had their farmyard within the village itself, but had decided as a result of the post-war situation to move away from the heart of the village.
In addition, there were aussiedlungen or partial aussiedlungen, usually due to a lack of space at the existing farmyard, the merging of farming facilities or to resolve problems due to the federal emission control act.
