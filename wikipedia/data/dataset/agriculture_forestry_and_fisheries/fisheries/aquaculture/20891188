Carpenter's Brook Fish Hatchery is a county-maintained fish hatchery in the town of Elbridge, New York. The fish hatchery is located along New York State Route 321, at the intersection with former New York State Route 368 (now County Route 107). The location is maintained by Onondaga County's Parks commission, running full-time around the year with certain hours. Opened in 1938, it is only one of four county-maintained fish hatcheries in the state of New York at the current time. The fish hatchery produces over 70,000 trout annually. The staff of the hatchery, along with other volunteers, help fund retail sales and local fish stores with $4 million annually.
