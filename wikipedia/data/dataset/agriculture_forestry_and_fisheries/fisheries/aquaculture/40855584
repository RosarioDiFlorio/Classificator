Foam lines are accumulations of foam, with trapped insects, exuvia, etc. found on the surface of freshwater water courses or bodies. Lines appear as individual islands of foam that accumulate against obstructions, shorelines, etc. Foam lines have some characteristics in common with sea foam from the marine environment which may form lines of spume as the tides rise and fall.
