Human behavior has a large impact on Jamaica's 479 square miles of coral reefs, which hosts 60 different species of coral. These reefs are a major tourist attraction for the country, accounting for 27 percent of its GDP. Due to Jamaica's economic reliance on its coastal reserves, the degradation of the coral reefs is much higher because of continuous habitat destruction.
