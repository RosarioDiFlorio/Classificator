Reflectin is a family of intrinsically disordered proteins evolved by a certain number of cephalopods including Euprymna Scolopes and Doryteuthis Opalescens to produce iridescent camouflage and signaling. The recently identified protein family is enriched in aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids, and is utilized by certain cephalopods to refract incident light in their environment. It is possible that reflectins are beta barrel type proteins.
