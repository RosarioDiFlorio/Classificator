Finnish-Swedish ice class is an ice class assigned to a vessel operating in first-year ice in the Baltic Sea and calling Finnish or Swedish ports. Ships are divided into six ice classes based on requirements for hull structural design, engine output and performance in ice according to the regulations issued by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi), which overtook the responsibilities of the Finnish Maritime Administration in 2010, and the Swedish Maritime Administration.
