The Wieringerrandmeer or bordering lake of Wieringen is a project of the Dutch province of North Holland and the (former) municipalities of Wieringen and Wieringermeer. (Since 2012 both are part of the new municipality of Hollands Kroon.) It is intended to create islands and a bordering lake. The project was cancelled in 2010 by the provincial and national governments.
