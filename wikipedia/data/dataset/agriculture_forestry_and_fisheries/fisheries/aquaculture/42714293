The Young Grab, or the Young Modified Van Veen Grab Sampler is an instrument to sample sediment in the ocean. It is a modified version of the Van Veen grab sampler, with a clamshell bucket made out of stainless steel mounted to a supporting frame. The sampling area extracted with this instrument can vary depending on its size. With the modifications this version of the Van Veen grab sampler is heavier than the traditional version. The frame allows for better stability and level sampling. Weights can be attached to the frame to ensure the bucket grabs sufficient sediment, or skids to ensure the gear does not sink too deep in soft sediments.

A draw-back of the use of this sampler is that it tends to disturb the sediments more than a box corer does. This does also not allow for sampling of the water column, but only the benthic surface.
