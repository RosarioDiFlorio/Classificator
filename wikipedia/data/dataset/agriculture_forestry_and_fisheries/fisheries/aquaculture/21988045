Acantopsis dialuzona is a loach native to the swift, clear streams and rivers of mainland and archipelagic Southeast Asia, from India to Indonesia through the Chao Phraya and Mekong river basins. It can also be found in flooded fields.
The horseface loach or horsehead loach, formerly known as Acantopsis choirorhynchos, is now recognized as belonging to this species.
