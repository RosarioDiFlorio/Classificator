Karang Mas or Karang Mas Shoal (Gosong Karang Mas) is a reef located off the northeastern tip of the island of Java, about 15 km offshore at the southern entrance to Madura Strait. The reef was known as Meinderts Reef (Dutch Meyndertsdroogte).
It carried a lighthouse (07° 39' S 114° 27' E) which had existed in the 1930s and was used as a significant navigation aid and landmark, but was evidently destroyed during World War II. The former lighthouse has been replaced with a newer lighthouse which apparently constructed above the base of the original lighthouse.
