Mexico Rocks is a shallow patch reef complex located off the far northern tip of Ambergris Caye, in the Belizean Barrier Reef. The site consists of approximately 100 Holocene patch reefs clustered on a Pleistocene ridge of limestone and is composed predominantly of boulder corals (Montastraea annularis). The reef has accumulated in shallow water, about 2.5 to 5 metres (8 to 16 ft) deep, over the last 420 years, under static sea level conditions.
The Montastraea annularis patch corals that dominate here are unique to Ambergris Caye's northern lagoon and a rare occurrence in Belize; the only other such patch reefs in the country are located at Glover's Reef. In addition, staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis occurs on the ridge's windward and leeward flanks.
The site was recommended for designation as a marine preserve in 1978, and is still under consideration. A popular snorkelling destination, it is seen as an important addition to the caye's ecotourism attractions. The area is known for conch, banded shrimps, arrow crabs, flounders, stingrays, yellow tail snappers, and an assortment of butterflyfishes and angelfishes.
