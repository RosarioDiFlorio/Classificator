Jo達o Valente is a reef located nearly between the islands of Boa Vista (20 nmi, 35 km) and Maio (25 mmi, 45 km). The reef's lowest point is about 100 meters above sea level. The seamount is about 1,000 meters tall. The highest point is 14 meters below sea level and dominates the area of about 1,000 to 2,000 km2, probably and erosion affected the volcano (Guyot). The reef is partly visible during low tide.
During the Ice Age, it was a larger island that once included Boa Vista and that island separated Maio by about 2 to 5 km, it was in the middle part and had two isthmus connecting the former Boa Vista and the Southern peninsulas. Around 7,000 to 6,000 BC, the isthmus were flooded and separated the islet from Boa Vista. Jo達o Valente was a flat island until around 2,000 to 1,000 BC when a rise in sea level flooded the whole island and became a reef.The reef was mentioned as "Baixa" (Portuguese for lower as being underwater and a submerged rocky area) in a 1598 map titled Insulae Capitis Viridis which is now at the National Library of France. In a map from 1747 by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin, the reef was mentioned as a submerged rock named Jean Letton (Roche de Jean Letton, Middle Dutch: Rotz van Jean Letton, Portuguese: Rochas de Jo達o Leit達o). On April 20, 1806, the English ship The Lady Burgess sank into the reef.
The high biodiversity of fishes in the reef along with other seamounts discovered in 1981, ichthyofauna has been studied. Also it is the area where other sealife including coral are founded and may be Cape Verde's most abundant including the waters surrounding Boa Vista.
