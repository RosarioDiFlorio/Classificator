The Van Veen Grab Sampler is an instrument to sample sediment in water environments. Usually it is a clamshell bucket made out of stainless steel. Up to 20 cm deep samples of roughly 0.1 m2 can be extracted with this instrument. It can be light-weight (roughly 5 kg) and low-tech. The smallest version even fits into hand luggage.
A draw-back of the use of this sampler is that it tends to disturb the sediments more than a box corer does.
