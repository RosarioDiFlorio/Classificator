Silicic acid  is a chemical compound. Silicic acid is the general name for a family of chemical compounds containing the element silicon attached to oxide and hydroxyl groups. This family of compounds have the general formula [SiOx(OH)4-2x]n. Some simple silicic acids have been identified, but only in very dilute aqueous solution, such as metasilicic acid (H2SiO3), orthosilicic acid (H4SiO4, pKa1=9.84, pKa2=13.2 at 25 Â°C), disilicic acid (H2Si2O5), and pyrosilicic acid (H6Si2O7); however in the solid state these probably condense to form polymeric silicic acids of complex structure.
