In 2015, the UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries (IOF) was formed incorporating the former UBC Fisheries Centre as well as researchers from other units across campus including the Departments of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, Zoology and Botany. The UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries brings together a community of Canadian and international experts in ocean and freshwater species, systems, economics, and issues to provide new insights into how global marine systems function, and the impacts of human activity on those systems. It is working towards a world in which the oceans are healthy and their resources are used sustainably and equitably. IOF is located at The University of British Columbia, and promotes multidisciplinary study of aquatic ecosystems and broad-based collaboration with researchers, educators, maritime communities, government, NGOs, and other partners.
