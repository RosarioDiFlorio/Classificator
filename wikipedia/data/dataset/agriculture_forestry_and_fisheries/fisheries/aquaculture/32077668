Blue Revolution refers to the time of intense growth in the worldwide aquaculture industry from the mid-1960's to present. The aquaculture industry has been growing at an average rate of nine-percent a year. Worldwide aquaculture production has now reached 50 million tons, up from two million in 1950. A similar growth in land-based agriculture observed in the 1960's and 1970's is commonly referred to as the green revolution.
