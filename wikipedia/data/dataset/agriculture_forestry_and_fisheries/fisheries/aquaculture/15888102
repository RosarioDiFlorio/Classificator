Administratively the Indispensable Reef belongs to the Rennell and Bellona Province of the Solomon Islands.

North Reef is 18 km (11 mi) long, and up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide. The rim of the atoll has two narrow openings in the north and northwest. The reef has a total area of 100 km2 (39 sq mi), including lagoon and reef flat. There are no islets.
Middle Reef is 51 km (32 mi) long. Little Nottingham Islet is a small islet located near the center of the reef. Besides its main lagoon, Middle Reef has a separate smaller northern lagoon. The total area is about 300 km2 (120 sq mi).
South Reef is 21 km (13 mi) long and up to 8 km (5.0 mi) wide. It encloses a lagoon 18 to 35 metres (59 to 115 ft) deep. The total area exceeds 100 km2 (39 sq mi).
