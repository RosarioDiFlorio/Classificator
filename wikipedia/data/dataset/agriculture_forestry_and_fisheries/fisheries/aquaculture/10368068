Hawkins Bank is a large, submerged bank off the Mascarene Plateau. It is considered a dependency of Mauritius (in terms of fishing banks, much like Saya de Malha Bank, Nazareth Bank and the Soudan Banks). The bank is abundant with fish and Mauritian vessels often fish in the waters in and around the bank.
