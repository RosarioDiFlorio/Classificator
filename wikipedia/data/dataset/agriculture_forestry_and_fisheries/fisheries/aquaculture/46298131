Lentisphera araneosa is a marine bacteria strain in the bacterial phylum Lentisphaerae. They are able to produce viscous transparent expolymers and grow attached to each other by the polymer in a three-dimensional configuration. They are part of the natural surface bacterial population in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They are less than 1% of the total bacterial community. This species is gram negative, non-motile, non-pigmented, aerobic, chemoheterotropic, and facultatively oligotrophic sphere-shaped. Its genome has been sequenced.
