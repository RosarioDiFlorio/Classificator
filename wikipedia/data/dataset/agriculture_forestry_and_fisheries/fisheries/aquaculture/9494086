Marine larval ecology is the study of the factors influencing the dispersing larval stage which is exhibited by many marine invertebrates and fishes. Marine organisms with a larval stage usually release large numbers of larvae into the water column, where the larvae develop and grow for a certain period of time before metamorphosing into adults.
Many marine larvae are capable of dispersing long distances from their release site, although determining their actual dispersal distance is a significant challenge due to their microscopic size and the lack of an appropriate larval tracking method. Understanding dispersal distance, however, is important for a variety of reasons, including fisheries management, effective marine reserve design, and control of invasive species.
