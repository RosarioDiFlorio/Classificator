Iron-oxidizing bacteria are chemotrophic bacteria that derive the energy they need to live and multiply by oxidizing dissolved ferrous iron. They are known to grow and proliferate in waters containing iron concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L. However, at least 0.3 ppm of dissolved oxygen is needed to carry out oxidation.
Known species of bacteria with microbial metabolisms based on iron oxidation include Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans.
