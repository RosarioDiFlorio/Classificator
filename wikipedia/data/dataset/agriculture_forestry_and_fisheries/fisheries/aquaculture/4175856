The Department of Energy's Aquatic Species Program experimented with raceway ponds for the cultivation of algae. Many commercial producers of spirulina still use raceway ponds as their primary method of cultivation. Race way ponds were used for removal of lead from waste water using live Spirulina (Arthospira) sp.
