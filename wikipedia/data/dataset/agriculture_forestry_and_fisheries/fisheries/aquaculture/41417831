Disposing trash on Earth mainly comes in three ways: littering, incinerating, and storing in it the many landfills we have around the world. With todayâ€™s landfills, there are very constructed contaminate structures. These systems are designed to help keep solid waste from becoming too uncontained and uncontrolled from the environment and the impact it could have on the health of humans. The purpose of having a liner system within a landfill is mainly to isolate everything within the landfill from the environment and protect it from contaminating the contents of the soil and especially the water within the ground. These liners are engineered to create a physical barrier between the garbage within the landfill, the ground, and the environment, in order to separate the liquid contaminate (leachate) so that it can go to a treatment facility. There are different types of these landfill sites for the different types of solid wastes which society creates and leaves behind. There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is double-liner systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.
