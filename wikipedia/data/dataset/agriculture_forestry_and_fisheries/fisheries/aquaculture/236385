WorldFish is an international, nonprofit research organization with headquarters in Penang, Malaysia, and offices in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. WorldFish’s mission is to harness the potential of fisheries and aquaculture to reduce poverty and hunger in developing countries.
WorldFish is a member of the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR), a global agriculture research partnership for a food secure future.
Working in partnership with private and public sectors and civil society, WorldFish uses its scientific expertise in fisheries and aquaculture to promote sustainable, evidence-based development solutions and policy recommendations that support the Millennium Development Goals. All services and solutions developed by the Center are international public goods that are made freely available to all.
WorldFish has introduced innovative technologies and practices that are brought to scale through a network of partners. The Center works on a breeding program to develop the Abbassa strain of Nile Tilapia that helped increase aquaculture productivity and improve food security for millions of Egyptians.
In Bangladesh, WorldFish trained and supported thousands of rural farmers by helping them improve the productivity of their homestead ponds and gardens.
WorldFish has been recognized with a Tech Museum Award, several World Bank Development Marketplace Awards.
Dr Modadugu Vijay Gupta, retired Assistant Director General of WorldFish Center, won the 2005 World Food Prize for his life's achievements in enriching the diets and lives of the world’s most impoverished families, and in 2015 was a co-recipient of the first Sunhak Peace Prize for his work in  developing aquaculture as an alternative solution to the future food crisis.
