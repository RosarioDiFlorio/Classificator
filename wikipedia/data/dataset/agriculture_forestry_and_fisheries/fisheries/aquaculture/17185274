The stream order or waterbody order is a positive whole number used in geomorphology and hydrology to indicate the level of branching in a river system.
There are various approaches to the topological ordering of rivers or sections of rivers based on their distance from the source ("top down") or from the confluence (the point where two rivers merge) or river mouth ("bottom up"), and their hierarchical position within the river system. In terms of terminology, the words "stream" or "branch" tend to be used rather than "river".
