The Master of Fisheries Science (M.F.Sc) is a master's degree for studies in fisheries science in India. Fisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is typically taught in a university setting, and can be the focus of an undergraduate, postgraduate or Ph.D. program.
