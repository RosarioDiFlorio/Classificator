The Vasyugan Swamp (Russian: Васюганские болота) is the largest swamp in the northern hemisphere. It is located in Russia, in southwestern Siberia.
The swamp is a major reservoir of fresh water for the region, and the Vasyugan river has its source there. It is home to a number of endangered species which is a concern among local environmentalists as the production of oil and gas has become a major industry in the region.
