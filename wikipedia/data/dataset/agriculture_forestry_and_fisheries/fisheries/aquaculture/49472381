ICAR - Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Rohtak centre also called as ICAR-CIFE Rohtak centre is one of the regional research centres operated under Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE),Mumbai. CIFE Rohtak centre has a fable history and a unique distinction of being the only central research centre in India dedicated to research on use of inland saline soils and ground water for fish and shrimp culture (Inland saline aquaculture). Traditionally a non fish growing state, CIFE pioneered scientific fish farming in Haryana after successful pilot studies and demonstrations at Dumduma and Sultanpur farm in Gurgaon District, Haryana beginning as early as 1980. In order to further strengthen research in Inland saline aquaculture, CIFE shifted its research centre from Sultanpur to what was then the National seed farm facility under state fisheries department near Rohtak (Lahli-Baiyani Villages) in April 1996.
