Lacking an immune system, protective shell, or mobility, sponges have developed an ability to synthesize a variety of unusual compounds for survival. C-nucleosides isolated from Caribbean Cryptotethya crypta, were the basis for the synthesis of zidovudine (AZT), aciclovir (Cyclovir), cytarabine (Depocyt), and cytarabine derivative gemcitabine (Gemzar).
Semisynthetic analogs of the sponge isolate jasplakinolide, were submitted to National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Biological Evaluation Committee in 2011.
