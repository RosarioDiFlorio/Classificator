Saltwater aquaponics (or sometimes marine aquaponics) is a combination plant and fish rearing system similar to standard aquaponics, except that it uses saltwater instead of the more commonly used freshwater. The concept is meant to be a natural and sustainable way to eliminate the stresses that are put on local fisheries and environments by conventional fish farming practices.
