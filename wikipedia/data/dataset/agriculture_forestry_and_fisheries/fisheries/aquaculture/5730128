Netrani (also known as Pigeon Island) is a small island of India located in the Arabian Sea. It is off the coast of Karnataka situated approximately 10 nautical miles (19 km) from the temple town of Murudeshwara in Bhatkal Taluk. The island can be seen from the main coast over 15 km away, including from various beaches in Bhatkal city as well as from the Murudeshwar Beach. Views above give this island the appearance of being heart-shaped. Besides pigeons, the other inhabitants of the island are wild goats. This island has scuba diving facilities and the place is easily accessible from Bhatkal, Mangalore, Goa, Mumbai or Bangalore. There are dive shops at Murdeshwara and Goa, that regularly organize diving tripes to the island. Those that do not want to dive can just visit the island and hike in by hiring the full fishing motor boat at the Bhatkal Fishing Harbour/Bunder. It would be beneficial if in big groups.
