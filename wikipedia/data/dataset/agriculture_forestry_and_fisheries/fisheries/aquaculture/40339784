MarBEF Data System (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning) was a project of the European Union's Network of Excellence which served as a platform to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine biodiversity, with informative links to researchers, industry, stakeholders and the general public. The program was funded by the EU and formally ended in 2009. The data system's online Register of Resources (RoR) includes the details of over 1,000 European marine biology experts and their affiliated institutions and publications.
MarBEF consisted of 94 European marine institutes and the work done was published in 415 scientific articles. While the initial MarBEF project has ended, work continues through numerous projects within the MarBEF "umbrella" including, the European Ocean Biogeographic Information System, the European Register of Marine Species, the European Marine Gazetteer, and includes a related Marine Biodiversity Wiki and MarBEF Open Archive.
