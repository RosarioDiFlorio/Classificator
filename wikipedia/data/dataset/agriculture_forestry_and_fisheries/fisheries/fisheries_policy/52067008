Cumbria Coast is one of EnglandÂ´s Marine Conservation Zones. It was designated in 2013, and is currently one of three such zones off the coast of Cumbria.

The MCZ covers the stretch of sea from Whitehaven down to the mouth of the Ravenglass Estuary. It includes the sea off Sellafield (the nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site), and off St Bees Head.
