The Gulf of Maine has been fished since the 1700s, and has been a historic fishing area since. Climate change is having significant impacts on this ecosystem; between 2004 and 2013, the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99.9% of the global oceans, increasing average temperature by 2 Â°C. Having seen the depletion of groundfish stocks starting in the early 1990s, managers took care to create five closure areas in the Gulf of Maine.
These closed areas do not prohibit all fishing, rather they prevent the further degradation of benthic habitat and groundfish species. Closed areas are different than Marine Protected Areas (MPA) because they allow some forms of fishing and other activities to occur that would normally not be allowed in MPA.
