The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) is a regional fisheries management organization that maintains controls over fishing and fishing-related acts in the North East Atlantic Ocean. NEAFC states that its objective is "to ensure the long-term conservation and optimum utilization of the fishery resources in its Convention Area, providing sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits." The area covered by the NEAFC Convention stretches from the southern tip of Greenland, east to the Barents Sea, and south to Portugal.

NEAFC was founded in 1980 and established by the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in Northeast Atlantic Fisheries.
It replaced an earlier commission by the same name established by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention of 24 January 1959.
