The Fishery Limits Act 1976 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (1977 c. 86) in order to implement the extension of fishing waters under the European Community's Common Fisheries Policy into British law.
The Act extended the fishing limits from 12 nautical miles (22 km; 14 mi) to 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) and was in force with the members of the EEC and nine other countries. Iceland, with whom the United Kingdom had clashed over fishing rights in the so-called "Cod War", was not included due to separate negotiations with the EEC.
