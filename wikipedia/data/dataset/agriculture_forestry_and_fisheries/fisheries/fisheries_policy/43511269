The UBC Fisheries Centre becomes the "UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries", with an expanded mandate for collaboration and impact across disciplines and sectors in 2015.
The UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries (IOF) contributes to a transformative global shift toward sustainable coastal ecosystems, oceans and fisheries. It brings together a community of Canadian and international experts in ocean and freshwater species, systems, economics, and issuesâ€”and provides new insights into how our marine systems function, and the impacts of human activity on those systems. Located at the University of British Columbia, promotes multidisciplinary study of aquatic ecosystems and broad-based collaboration with maritime communities, government, NGOs and other partners.
The UBC Fisheries Centre was the focal point for development of the widely used Ecopath with Ecosim approach and software. It is also a member of the FishBase Consortium.
