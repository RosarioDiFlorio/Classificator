The European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases is located in Frederiksberg in Denmark at the National Veterinary Institute (a part of Technical University of Denmark). It is funded by the European Commission.
A main purpose of the CRL is to ensure the quality of diagnostics of fish diseases in EU Member States and to harmonise the procedures and methodologies applied. The work is mainly concerned with the exotic (epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus and epizootic ulcerative syndrome) and non-exotic (viral hemorrhagic septicemia, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, koi herpes virus, and infectious salmon anemia virus) diseases mentioned in Council Directive 2006/88/EC. The CRL co-ordinates those activities of the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for Fish diseases in EU that aim to harmonise diagnostic techniques and disseminate information of mutual interest. The work of the CRL also includes development of a database (Fishpathogens.eu) that aims to collect information on fish disease isolates and their sequences. Details of the work programme is decided at the Annual Meeting of the NRLs for Fish Diseases.
