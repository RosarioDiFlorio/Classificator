Sex for Fish sometimes referred to as "Fish for Sex" is a phenomenon in which female traders engage in sexual relationships with fishermen to secure their supply of fish. The women fish traders are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply them with daily fresh fish. Along the beaches where the sex for fish practices have been observed, the fishermen do maintain several transactional sexual relationships with women at different beaches where they land with their fish.
Sex for Fish as a phenomenon is common in many low and middle income developing countries; however, the bulk cases have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s inland fisheries. The most vulnerable victims are economically disadvantaged women, e.g. single or divorced women as well as widows residing in along the shores of inland fisheries centers.
Several social-economic factors including poverty, cultural practices, and competition among women who are involved in fish trade are often listed as variables fueling the sex for fish practice. There is no conclusive research that shows what promotes sex for fish practice, however, fishermen seem to be taking advantage of stiff competition between the women who trade in fish to demand sexual favors in exchange for the fish. The men or the trader who receives sexual favors would grant preferential sale and sale at reduced prices to these women
In the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya, women have been observed giving out empty polythene bags to the fishermen before they go out fishing at night or early morning, and when the fishermen return, some of the best catch would be set aside for them, stashed in these bags. The fishermen take advantage of these economically and social disadvantaged women by offering preferential treatment in fish business in exchange for sex.
