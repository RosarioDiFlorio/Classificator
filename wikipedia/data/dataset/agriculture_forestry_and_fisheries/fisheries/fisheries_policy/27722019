The Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA: pronounced pin-SEE-ma) is one of five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs), areas of high ecological, social and economic importance, that have been identified by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) as priority regions for marine planning as part of Canada’s Oceans Action Plan.
After years of work by conservation groups, the fishing sector, tourism outfitters, First Nations, scientists and coastal residents, the Government of Canada finally embarked on the PNCIMA marine planning process in 2010. The goal was to develop a plan to conserve this relatively undeveloped region, while fostering sustainable economies on the coast, which promised to make Canada a world leader in marine conservation.

The purpose of the PNCIMA planning process is to ensure a healthy, safe, and prosperous ocean area by engaging all interested parties in the collaborative development and implementation of an integrated management plan. The goals of the PNCIMA initiative include: healthy and resilient ecosystems, reduced inter-user conflicts, sustainable economies, and thriving coastal communities with strong cultural and economic ties to coastal and marine areas.

In September 2011 however, the federal government withdrew from an agreement that provided funding to support the PNCIMA process. They stated that the process was being “realigned” to better fit with timelines and to be consistent with ocean planning on the other coasts of Canada. Under this streamlined plan, funding for public consultation and independent science was no longer required.
