The Kalamos Island biological field station is a research station located in the island Kalamos, in the Ionian Sea, in Western Greece. It is situated in the core of the inner Ionian marine protected area, site GR22220003 of the Natura 2000 network. The marine area is additionally protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS).
The station is a base for year-round research activities in ecology, ecosystem management and sustainability issues such as permaculture. It was created as part of the Kalamos and Kastos sustainable development program of Terra Sylvestris, a non-governmental non profit organization that established the program in order to bring about sustainable development through rewilding in the area of the Island of Kalamos, Kastos and adjacent smaller islands and their marine environment.
