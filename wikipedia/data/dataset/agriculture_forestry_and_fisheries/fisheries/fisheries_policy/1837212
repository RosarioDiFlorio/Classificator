This is a list of the bird and mammal species described as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It contains species not only in the U.S. and its territories, but also species only found in other parts of the world. It does not include endangered fish, amphibians, reptiles, plants, or invertebrates. The complete list can be found in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 50 Part 17.
The listings for status are E for endangered or T for threatened. Species may also be endangered or threatened because they are sufficiently similar in appearance to endangered or threatened species and are marked for "similarity of appearance" as E(S/A) or T(S/A).
Endangered species are animals and plants that are in danger of becoming extinct.
Threatened species are animals and plants that are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.
Identifying, protecting, and restoring endangered and threatened species are the primary objectives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program.
