The National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (Survey) has been sponsored since 1955 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is one of the oldest and most comprehensive continuing recreation surveys. The most recent Survey (2006) found that 87.5 million U.S. residents 16 years old and older participated in wildlife-related recreation and spent $122.3 billion on their activities. During that year, 30.0 million people fished, 12.5 million hunted, and 71.1 million participated in at least one type of wildlife-watching activity such as observing, feeding, or photographing birds and other wildlife in the United States.
