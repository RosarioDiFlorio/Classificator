The pond was designed and built under guidance of Jakub Krčín, working for Bohemian aristocratic family House of Rožmberk and it is named after that family. The work was finished in 1590. At this time many fish ponds were established throughout South Bohemia.
Water from river Lužnice flows into the pond.
