The Consumer Council for Water (CCWater) is a non-departmental public body that represents water and sewerage consumers in England and Wales. The organisation provides impartial advice and/or advocacy for aggrieved consumers.
CCWater is independent of both the regulator, Ofwat, and the water companies.
There are four regional committees in England (Northern, Central & Eastern, London & South East and Western) and one in Wales. Each committee has at least one office to represent customers of different water companies. The head office is in Victoria Square House, Victoria Square, Birmingham.
In March 2010, CCWater added an online Consumer Support site where users can have their own questions/enquiries answered which can be accessed via their website at http://www.ccwater.org.uk/
