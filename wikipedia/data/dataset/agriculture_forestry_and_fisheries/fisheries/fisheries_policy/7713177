The River Gannel (Cornish: Dowr Gwyles, meaning lovage river) rises in the village of Indian Queens in mid Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It flows north under Trevemper Bridge and becomes a tidal estuary, the Gannel (Cornish: An Ganel, meaning the Channel), that divides the town of Newquay from the village of Crantock and joins the Celtic Sea.
The estuary contains a historic boatyard and is an important location for migratory birds.
The river is known for a legend called the Gannel Crake, an unusual noise which might be heard "crying out". During the 19th century it was described as being like "a thousand voices pent up in misery, with one long wail dying away in the distance". It is traditionally referred to by the superstitious natives as the cry of a troubled spirit that ever haunts the scene.
