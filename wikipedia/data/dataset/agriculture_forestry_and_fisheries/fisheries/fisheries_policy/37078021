The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHF&G) is a department within the government of New Hampshire in the United States. The Fish and Game Department manages New Hampshire's fish, game, and aquatic plant resources.
The Department was created in 1865 to both propagate and conserve the state's fish and game. Fish and Game Commission members from each of the 10 counties are appointed by the Governor, plus one for the coastal area. In 2006 the non-profit corporation Wildlife Heritage Foundation of New Hampshire (the Foundation) was formed due to falling revenues from the Fish & Game Department's licenses for hunting and fishing. They work with and support the Fish and Game Department on projects and events which otherwise could not be funded.
