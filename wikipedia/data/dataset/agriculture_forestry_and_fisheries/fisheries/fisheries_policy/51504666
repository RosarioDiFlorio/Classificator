West of Walney is a Marine Conservation Zone in the Irish Sea west of Walney Island, England. It was designated in 2016 to protect subtidal mud and sand habitats. The area is 388km2, a similar size to the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. The depth range of the site is 15â€“33 metres.
An unusual feature of the MCZ is that it is co-located with offshore wind turbines. This makes it simpler to restrict fishing by bottom trawling because this type of fishing is generally discouraged within windfarm developments.
The MCZ is one of three off the coast of Cumbria, the others being Allonby Bay and Cumbria Coast.
