In oyster hatcheries fewer machines are needed but the most important one is the nursery tank system that keeps the oyster larvae alive.
The nursery tank system was developed in Florida.
Boats and small rafts were also used to gather the oysters in the deep if they cannot reach by bare foot. The rafts and boats were made in Italy. Also while they remove the oysters they use a small knife or a stone to weaken the oyster from the rocks. The knives are from China.
A filter is also a main one to keep the hatchery water clean and the same water level. Such filters are made in Japan.
When the oysters need to be carried by hand the workers used Hessian bags made in the United Kingdom. Racks are used often to dry out the bacteria on the oysters. This are also from the United States of America.
