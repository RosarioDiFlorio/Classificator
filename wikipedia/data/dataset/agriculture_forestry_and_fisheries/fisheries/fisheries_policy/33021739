Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), also known as mycotic granulomatosis (MG) or red spot disease (RSD), is a disease caused by the water mould Aphanomyces invadans. It infects many freshwater and brackish fish species in the Asia-Pacific region and Australia. The disease is most commonly seen when there are low temperature and heavy rainfall in tropical and sub-tropical waters.
