Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) are an ongoing network of large scale initiatives in the landscape of England to improve ecological connectivity and improve biodiversity. At 2015 the NIAs cover 47,000 acres of England in total, achieved at a total cost of Â£7.5 million. At spring 2015 the NIAs have also added a further 13,500 acres beyond the initial 2012 areas, as well as a total of 335 miles of new footpaths for public access.
