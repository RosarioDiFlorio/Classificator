Catla (Gibelion catla), also known as the major (Indian) carp, is an economically important South Asian freshwater fish in the carp family Cyprinidae. It is native to rivers and lakes in northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, but has also been introduced elsewhere in South Asia and is commonly farmed.
Catla is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. It reaches up to 182 cm (6.0 ft) in length and 38.6 kg (85 lb) in weight.
Catla is a surface and midwater feeder. Adults feed on zooplankton using large gill rakers, but young ones on both zooplankton and phytoplankton. Catla attains sexual maturity at an average age of two years and an average weight of 2 kg.
