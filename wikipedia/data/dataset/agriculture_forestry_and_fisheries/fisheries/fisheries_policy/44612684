Salmon escapement is the amount of a salmon population that does not get caught by commercial or recreational fisheries and return to their freshwater spawning habitat. Estimates of these amount are calculated with statistical analysis using data collected during that particular run season. These estimations help produce fishing quotas for the return year of the juveniles born for that years run, or can be used to determine the health of a salmon stock.
Estimating escapement for salmon can be done several ways: The most commonly used method is the area-under-the-curve model, and other methods include the change-in-ratio method, carcass-counting surveys, and weir-count surveys.
