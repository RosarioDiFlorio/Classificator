The C.D. "Buzz" Besadny Anadromous Fish Facility is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources egg collection station near the city of Kewaunee. Trout and salmon migrating from Lake Michigan are led by flowing water in a fish ladder to collection ponds. Fish are moved from the ponds into the processing building to be spawned and then sent to hatcheries where they are raised before being released into Lake Michigan's tributaries in order to negate the proliferation of the alewife and support sports fishing.
The facility began operations in 1990, and a processing building and public viewing area was opened in 1996.
