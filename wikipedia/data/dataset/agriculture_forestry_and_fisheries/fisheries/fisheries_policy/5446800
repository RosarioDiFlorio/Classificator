The State Veterinary Service(SVS) was an executive agency of the UK government department the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It was the government's delivery agent responsible for animal health and welfare in England, Scotland and Wales.
It was set up in 1865 in response to an outbreak of rinderpest in London.
On 2 April 2007 State Veterinary Service joined with Egg Marketing Inspectorate, Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate and Wildlife Licensing and Registration Service to create a new enlarged agency called Animal Health[1].
