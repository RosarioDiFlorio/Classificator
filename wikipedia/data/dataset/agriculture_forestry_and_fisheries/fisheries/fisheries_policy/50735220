Corumbau Marine Extractive Reserve (Portuguese: Reserva Extrativista Marinha do Corumbau) is a coastal marine extractive reserve in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The reserve was created in 2000 to help protect the traditional local fishing economy, which was suffering from predatory commercial fisheries. It includes an area of corals and rich marine biodiversity, and a breeding ground for humpback whales. Growth in tourism has caused a surge in real estate prices and introduced new social problems among the traditional residents.
