Aquaculture started to take off in Madagascar in the 1980s. The majority of Aquaculture in Madagascar includes the cultivation of sea cucumbers, seaweed, fish and shrimp. Aquaculture in Madagascar is being used to stimulate the countries economy, increase the wages of fishermen and women in the area and improve the regions ocean water quality. Coastal regions of Madagascar are reliant on the Indian Oceans marine resources as a source of food, income, and cultural identity. Madagascar is the fourth-largest island in the world and consists of the main island, as well as smaller surrounding islands. Madagascar is considered to be a biodiversity hotspot. Over 90 percent of its wildlife is not found anywhere else on Earth. In the Velondriake, a locally managed marine area (LMMA) in southwest Madagascar, laws have been created by an official governing body, consisting of elected representatives from 25 villages, called ‘dina’, to combat environmental degradation. This LMMA includes coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds, baobab forests and other threatened habitats. The Vezo, literally meaning ‘people who fish’ in the Malagasy language of the region, are amongst Madagascar's poorest. Making environmentally conscious efforts to boost the economy and raise incomes are top priorities for the LMMA.
