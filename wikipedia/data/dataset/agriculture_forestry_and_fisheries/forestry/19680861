Ludwig Beissner (6 July 1843 â€“ 21 December 1927) was a German horticulturalist and dendrologist born in Ludwigslust, Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
From 1887 to 1913, Beissner was inspector of the botanical gardens of Bonn. He was an author of a popular textbook on hardwoods ("Handbuch der Laubholz-Benenung") and on a study of softwoods ("Handbuch der Nadelholzkunde"), the latter work being published over three editions (1891, 1909 and 1930).
