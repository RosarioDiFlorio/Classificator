Overlogging is a kind of overexploitation caused by legal or illegal logging activities that lead to unsustainable or irrecoverable deforestation and permanent habitat destruction for forest wildlife. Overlogging is often associated with attempts at reducing the "third world debt" but is not restricted to developing countries. With the developed world's growing demand for pulp and paper, especially - but not restricted to - for disposable tissues, overlogging is an imminent threat to Earth's forests everywhere.
