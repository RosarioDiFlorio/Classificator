The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, commonly referred to as Andrews Forest, is located near Blue River, Oregon, United States, and is managed cooperatively by the United States Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and the Willamette National Forest. It was one of only 610 UNESCO International Biosphere Reserves, until being withdrawn from the program as of June 14, 2017, and a Long Term Ecological Research site. It is situated in the middle of the Western Cascades.
There is a roughly 1300 m elevation difference between the lowest point of the forest near the headquarters and living facilities and the its highest point at the summit of Carpenter Mountain. North- and west- facing slopes of the forest are exemplary of temperate rainforest, and old-growth forest covers 40% of the forest's surface area.
