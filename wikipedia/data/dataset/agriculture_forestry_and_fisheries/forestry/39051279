The Forest of Avon Trust is the local charity for trees in the former county of Avon, which now comprises Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset.
The Trust's objectives are to plant trees in gardens, streets, green spaces and schools to benefit people and wildlife. It also provides support to communities and individuals to plant and manage trees, including woodland and orchard creation.
The Forest of Avon Trust also provides accredited OCN level 3 training for Forest School leaders and runs woodland activity and outdoor learning sessions for schools, nurseries and families. Since 2011 the trust has also run projects with adults with learning difficulties to increase skills, independence and wellbeing.
The Forest of Avon Trust currently manages a community woodland near Upton Cheney, South Gloucestershire.
