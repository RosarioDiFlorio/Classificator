The Master Arborist or Board Certified Master Arborist credential identifies professional arborists who have attained the highest level of aboriculture offered by the International Society of Arboriculture(ISA) and one of the two top levels in the field. There are several paths to the Board Certified Master Arborist, but typically on average each has been an ISA Certified Arborist a minimum of three to five years before qualifying for the exam (this can vary depending upon other education and experience). The certification began as a result of the need to distinguish the top few arborists and allow others to identify those with superior credentials. The ISA added specialty certifications of Utility Specialist, for those maintaining vegetation around electric utility wires, Municipal Specialist, for those with additional experience managing public urban trees.
The Master Arborist examination is a far more extensive exam than the International Society of Arboriculture Certified Arborist Exam, and covers a broad scope of both aboriculture management, science and work practices.
Another credential that is on a par with the Master Arborist is that of the American Society of Consulting Arborists, the Registered Consulting Arborist. There are perhaps six hundred individuals with that qualification, and only 70 arborists who hold both credentials.
The ISA Board Certified Master Arborist exam covers virtually every area of aboriculture (other than consulting), with the following areas covered on exam.
