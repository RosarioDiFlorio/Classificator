The Benson raft was a huge seagoing log raft designed to reliably transport millions of board feet of timber at one time through the open ocean.
Held together with giant logging chains, their cargo of logs and often finished lumber goods went from the outlet of the Columbia River in the United States into the Pacific Ocean and south 1100 miles to San Diego, California. Once there the logs were sawn into lumber by the Benson Logging and Lumber Company for sale in Southern California.
