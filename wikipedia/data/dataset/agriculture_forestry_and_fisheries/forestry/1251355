In agriculture, gardening, and forestry, broadcast seeding is a method of seeding that involves scattering seed, by hand or mechanically, over a relatively large area. This is in contrast to:
precision seeding, where seed is placed at a precise spacing and depth;
hydroseeding, where a slurry of seed, mulch and water is sprayed over prepared ground in a uniform layer.
Broadcast seeding is of particular use in establishing dense plant spacing, as for cover crops and lawns. After broadcasting, seed is often lightly buried with some type of raking action.
Seeds sown in this manner are distributed unevenly, which may result in overcrowding. This method may not ensure that all seeds are sown at the correct depth.If they are not sown evenly then there would be a lack of various nutrients from sunlight,oxygen etc in many crops or plants.
