The term National Forest Program (NFP) does not refer to one specific programme. It actually incorporates a wide range of approaches that can contribute to the formulation, planning and implementation of forest policy at national and subnational levels. As one of the most important outcomes of international forest policy dialogue, this means that NFP is applicable to all countries and to all types of forests.
