The Agroforestry Research Trust (ART) is a British non-profit-making charity that researches into temperate agroforestry and all aspects of plant cropping and uses, with a focus on tree, shrub and perennial crops. It produces several publications and a quarterly journal, and sells plants and seeds from its forest gardens.
The trust is managed by Martin Crawford, and has a 2-acre (8,100 m2) forest garden, next to the Schumacher College in Dartington, Devon, in the United Kingdom. It makes heavy use of ground cover plants to restrict the growth of weeds.
