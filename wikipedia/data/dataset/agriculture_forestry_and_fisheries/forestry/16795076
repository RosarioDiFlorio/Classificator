The Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) is a public agricultural university with central offices in Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal. Organized in a manner similar to agricultural universities in India, it is the only such university in Nepal.
It was created by the Parliament of Nepal, which passed a bill in June 2010 merging two constituent campuses of Tribhuvan University: the Rampur Agriculture Campus of the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science and the Forestry Campus, Hetauda of the Institute of Forestry in Hetauda, Makawanpur. The university exists to offer agricultural workforce development and promote research in agriculture, forestry, and allied disciplines. Through teaching, research, and extension programs in agriculture, livestock, and forestry, it aims to raise the socio-economic conditions of rural people.
