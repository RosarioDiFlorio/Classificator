The National Axe Throwing Federation (NATF) is an organization established in 2016 with global membership that seeks to establish competitive rules and safety standards for the sport of axe throwing.
The NATF supports over 3000 throwers, who compete in sanctioned leagues located in four countries for a chance to win the annual National Axe Throwing Championship (NATC). The Ontario craft brewery Beau's was the Title Sponsor at the 2017 NATC.
