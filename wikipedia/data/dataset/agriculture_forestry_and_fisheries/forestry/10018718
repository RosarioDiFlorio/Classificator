University of Juba (Arabic: جامعة جوبا‎) is a public university located in Juba, South Sudan, founded in 1975 in response to the need for higher education in southern areas of Sudan. Due to the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983 - 2005), the university relocated to Khartoum, for safety of staff, students and infrastructure. In 2006, the government at that time agreed to change the name of the university to Juba National University. Following the attainment of independence by South Sudan in July 2011, the university has relocated back to Juba, where it was founded. The university gives instruction in the English language.
