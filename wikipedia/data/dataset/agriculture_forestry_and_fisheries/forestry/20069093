Founded in 1913, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association changed its name to the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC) in February 2001.
The Forest Products Association of Canada is a trade association which represents Canada's wood, pulp and paper producers both nationally and internationally in government, trade, and environmental affairs. Canada’s forest products industry is an $80 billion a year industry that represents 2% of Canada’s GDP. The industry is one of Canada's largest employers, operating in hundreds of Canadian communities and providing nearly 900,000 direct and indirect jobs across the country. FPAC represents the largest Canadian producers of forest products. Member companies are responsible for 75% of the working forests in Canada. Third-party certification of member companies' forest practices is a condition of membership in the Association.
FPAC member companies are: AbitibiBowater, Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. (Al-Pac), Canfor, Canfor Pulp Limited Partnership, Cariboo Pulp and Paper Company, Cascades Inc., Catalyst Paper Corporation, FF Soucy, Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Mill, NewPage Corporation, Kruger Inc., Louisiana-Pacific Canada Ltd., Mercer, Mill & Timber Products Ltd., Papier Masson, SFK Pulp, Tembec Enterprises Inc., Tolko Industries Ltd., UPM-Kymmene Miramichi Inc., West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Weyerhaeuser Company Limited.
In May 2010, under the leadership of then President Avrim Lazar, FPAC successfully helped to negotiate The Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, with several large ENGOs. The first independent audit of the CBFA in 2011 revealed a lack of progress in achieving formal milestones and in 2017 the long-term survival of the agreement was put into question.
