A shade tree is any tree grown specifically for its shade. This term usually applies to large trees with spreading canopies.
Some of the most popular shade trees in temperate countries are oaks, maples, ashes, lindens, and elms.
In tropical countries, trees such as the African tulip tree, Hopea odorata, and some Erythrina species are often planted as shade trees.
