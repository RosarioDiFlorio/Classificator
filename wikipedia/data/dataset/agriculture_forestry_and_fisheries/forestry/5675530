In the United States, an interagency hotshot crew (IHC), or simply hotshot crew, is one of various elite teams of 20 wildland firefighters, the most highly trained in the country, that are prepared to battle the most serious fires nationwide. They meet and exceed the requirements of Type 1 firefighters in terms of their extensive training, high physical fitness standards, and ability to undertake difficult, dangerous, and stressful assignments. They often respond to large, high-priority fires and are trained and equipped to work in remote areas for extended periods of time with little logistical support.
As an interagency resource, hotshot crews can be requested to respond to wildland fire incidents in any jurisdiction. As of 2017, there were 114 IHCs in operation in the United States, organized by diverse agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, as well as state, county, and city governments. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho coordinates Hotshot crews on the national level.
Hotshot crews trace their history to Southern California in the late 1940s on the Cleveland and Angeles National Forest. The term "hotshot" comes from their having been assigned to the hottest parts of the fire. In American English, the term also connotes "a person who is conspicuously talented or successful".
While not fighting fires, hotshot crews typically work in their home units to meet resource goals such as thinning, prescribed fire operations, habitat improvement, and trail construction projects. Hotshot crews can also respond to other emergency incidents, including search and rescue and disaster response. For example, in 2009 the Cherokee IHC was assigned to clear trees downed by rare tornadoes in Prospect Park and Kissena Park in New York City, their first employment in an urban setting.
