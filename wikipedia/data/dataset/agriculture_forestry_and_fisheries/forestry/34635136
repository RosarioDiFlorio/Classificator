A firewood processor is a machine designed to cut and split firewood with minimal manual handling of the logs. There are typically four main parts of the machine, each dedicated to a separate function. Processing begins with a log pile – a pile of logs that have been de-limbed and cut to an appropriate length, generally 10–12 feet (3.0–3.7 m). Popular brands include Hakki Pilke, Wood Beaver, DYNA, Multitek and Blockbuster. Many individuals use processors commercially and also privately as a hobby. Others choose to rent them as an alternative to purchasing.
