Professor John Hope  (10 May 1725 â€“ 10 November 1786) was a Scottish physician and botanist. Although he did enormous work on plant classification and plant physiology, due to an absence of publications, he is now best known as an early supporter of Carl Linnaeus's system of classification.
In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
In 1784 Hope was elected as president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1784-6).
