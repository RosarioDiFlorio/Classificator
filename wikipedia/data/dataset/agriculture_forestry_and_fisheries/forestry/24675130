The International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) is an international non-governmental organization that enhances international cooperation between the worldwide organizations with interests in the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences. Established in 1910, ISPRS is the oldest international umbrella organization in its field, which may be summarized as addressing “information from imagery”. ISPRS achieves its aims by:
Advancing knowledge in the areas of interest of ISPRS by encouraging and facilitating research and development, scientific networking and inter-disciplinary activities
Facilitating education and training with particular emphasis in less developed countries
Enhancing public recognition of the contributions of the photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial information sciences for the benefit of humankind and the sustainability of the environment
The ISPRS scientific and technical programs are organized by five Technical Commissions. Each Commission is sponsored by an ISPRS member organization for the four-year period between Congresses. The five Technical Commissions have established around 60 Working Groups which are responsible for particular topics within the Commissions’ areas of interest. All Technical Commissions hold a Symposium within their country in 2018. Smaller workshops will be organized by the Working Groups before the 2020 Congress is organised from June 28 - July 4, 2020 in Nice, France, by the French Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (http://www.isprs2020-nice.com).
