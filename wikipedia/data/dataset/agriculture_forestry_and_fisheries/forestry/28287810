In forestry, quadratic mean diameter or QMD is a measure of central tendency which is considered more appropriate than arithmetic mean for characterizing the group of trees which have been measured. For n trees, QMD is calculated using the quadratic mean formula:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                ∑
                
                  
                    
                      D
                      
                        i
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    2
                  
                
              
              n
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {\sum {D_{i}}^{2}}{n}}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          
            D
            
              i
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {D_{i}}}
   is the diameter at breast height of the ith tree. Compared to the arithmetic mean, QMD assigns greater weight to larger trees – QMD is always greater than or equal to arithmetic mean for a given set of trees. QMD can be used in timber cruises to estimate the standing volume of timber in a forest, because it has the practical advantage of being directly related to basal area, which in turn is directly related to volume. QMD can also be calculated as:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                B
                A
              
              
                k
                ∗
                n
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {BA}{k*n}}}}
  
where BA is stand basal area, n is the number of trees, and k is a constant based on measurement units - for BA in ft2 and DBH in inches, k=0.005454; for BA in m2 and DBH in cm, k=0.0000785.
