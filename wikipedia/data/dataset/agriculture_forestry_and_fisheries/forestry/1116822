The Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) is a non-profit scientific research organization that conducts research on the use and management of forests with a focus on tropical forests in developing countries. CIFOR is the forestry research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.
CIFORâ€™s research contributes to the three CGIAR System-Level Outcomes: reduced poverty, improved food and nutrition security, and improved natural resource systems and ecosystem services. It also contributes to the new United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and commitments made by countries in the Paris agreement and other accords related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
