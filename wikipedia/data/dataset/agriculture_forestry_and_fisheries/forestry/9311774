In forestry, slash, or slashings are coarse and fine woody debris generated during logging operations or through wind, snow or other natural forest disturbances. Slash generated during logging operations may increase fire hazard and some North American states have passed laws requiring that logging slash be treated. Logging slash can be chipped and used for the production of electricity or heat in cogeneration power plants.
Where logging takes place on soft ground the branches and tops of trees can be used as part of the timber harvesting process to provide a track for forest machines. Using slash in this manner reduces ground damage.
