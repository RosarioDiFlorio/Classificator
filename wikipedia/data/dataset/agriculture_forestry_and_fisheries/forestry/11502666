Forest Live (formerly Forest Tour) is an annual British music festival featuring predominantly pop and rock bands and artist. The series of concerts are organised by the Forestry Commission, a British non-ministerial government department. The events are hosted in seven forest venues throughout the United Kingdom. The tour began in 2000, as part of an initiative to bring new audiences into forests, and encourage people to see their woodlands.
