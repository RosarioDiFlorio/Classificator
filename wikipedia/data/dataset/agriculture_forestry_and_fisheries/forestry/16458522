Tree taper is the degree to which a tree's stem or bole decreases in diameter as a function of height above ground. Trees with a high degree of taper are said to have poor form, while those with low taper have good form. The form of a tree is sometimes quantified by the Girard form class, which is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the butt-log scaling diameter to diameter at breast height.
Taper is often represented by mathematical functions fitted to empirical data, called taper equations. One such function, attributed to Ormerod, is

    {\displaystyle d(h)^{2}={D^{2}}\left({H-h \over H-h_{b}}\right)^{1.6}}
  
where:

  
    
      
        d
        (
        h
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(h)}
   = stem diameter at height h,

  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
   = tree diameter at breast height,

  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   = tree total height,

  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   height of interest (h ≤ H), and

  
    
      
        
          h
          
            b
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle h_{b}}
   = breast height.
Once developed, taper equations can be used to predict the diameter at a given height, or the height for a given diameter.
