International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994 (ITTA, 1994 or ITTA2) was drafted to ensure that by the year 2000 exports of tropical timber originated from sustainably managed sources and to establish a fund to assist tropical timber producers in obtaining the resources necessary to reach this objective. It defined the mandate of the International Tropical Timber Organization.
The agreement was opened for signature on January 26, 1994, and entered into force on January 1, 1997.
It replaced the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983, and was superseded by the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006.
