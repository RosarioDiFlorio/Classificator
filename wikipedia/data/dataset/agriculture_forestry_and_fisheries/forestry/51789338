The Institute of Forestry (IoF, Nepali: वन विज्ञान अध्ययन संस्थान) is one of the five technical institutes under Tribhuvan University, Nepal's largest academic institution. Under the Department of Forests, the IoF was founded as Nepal Forestry Institute in 1947 in Singha Durbar. However, it was relocated to Bhimphedi in 1957, then to Hetauda in 1965, before being incorporated into TU from 1972. The current head office of the institute, usually referred to as the dean's office, is housed at Pokhara Campus.
The IoF implements forestry-related academic programs through its two constituent campuses, located in Pokhara and Hetauda. The current dean of the institute is Krishna Raj Tiwari, and he is backed by two assistant deans, presently Yajna P. Timilsina and Jeev Nath Pandey.
