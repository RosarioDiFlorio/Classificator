Resin workers were people whose work involved the extraction or working of resin. Resin work was an occupation that largely died out in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it was sometimes a primary occupation as well as a secondary source of income. Resin was needed as a raw material in the manufacture of pitch, tar and terpentine.
