Stand level modelling is a type of modelling in the forest sciences in which the main unit is a forested stand.
A forest stand is a contiguous community of trees sufficiently uniform in composition, structure, age and size class distribution, spatial arrangement, site quality, condition, or location to distinguish it from adjacent communities.
A forest is a "collection of stands".
