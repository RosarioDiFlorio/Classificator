A High-Biodiversity Wilderness Area (HBWA) is an elaboration on the IUCN Protected Area classification of a Wilderness Area (Category Ib), which outlines five vast wilderness areas of particularly dense and important levels of biodiversity. The sub-classification was the initiative of Conservation International (CI) in 2003 to identify regions in which at least 70 percent of their original vegetation has remained intact in order to ensure that this is safeguarded and these regions do not become biodiversity hotspots. Currently the areas listed as HBWAs are
Amazon basin, Brazil
Congo Basin, The Democratic Republic of Congo
New Guinea, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea
North American Deserts, Southwest United States and Mexico
Miombo-Mopane Woodlands and Savannas, South Central Africa
