WikiWoods is a group of volunteers who plant trees with the joint aims of preventing climate change and inspiring people to be environmentally aware. Founded in 2007, around 3400 volunteers have planted 163,100 trees to October 2016. The group is based around a wiki, which enables people to register their own tree planting events, to find like-minded friends in their region, and to network with foresters and other tree experts. As of 2016, events have taken place in Berlin, Brandenburg, Göttingen, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany as well as in Hîrbovăț in Moldova. It is hoped that the idea will spread, with further volunteers getting involved in organising tree planting events using the WikiWoods software as a coordinating platform.
WikiWoods plants according to a set of sustainability guidelines that were specially developed for the group. The events that have been carried out so far include afforestation, the conversion of monoculture coniferous forests into mixed woodland, the planting of hedges and forest edges, as well as the planting, harvesting, and pruning of fruit trees.
In order to ensure the future protection of the trees that are planted, WikiWoods works with environmental partners who provide the land and take responsibility for their ongoing care. Partner organizations include WWF, BUND, NABU National Heritage Foundation (NABU-Stiftung Nationales Naturerbe), and the Lower Oder Valley National Park.
WikiWoods is supported by sponsor organization Active Commons e.V., which provides funds for planting projects and the operation of the Internet platform. WikiWoods is a member of the Climate-Alliance Germany.
