Ortho3D
True 3D city reconstruction created automatically from multi-angle stereoscopic vertical and oblique aerial and/or street photographs, thanks to very robust photogrammetric dense matching software based on strong GPU computing.
Workflow :
image matching, keypoints extraction
bundle adjustment
dense matching, point cloud extraction
point cloud cleaning
