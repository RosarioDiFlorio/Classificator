The Three-North Shelter Forest Program (simplified Chinese: 三北防护林; traditional Chinese: 三北防護林; pinyin: Sānběi Fánghùlín), also known as the Three-North Shelterbelt Program or the Green Great Wall, is a series of human-planted windbreaking forest strips (shelterbelts) in China, designed to hold back the expansion of the Gobi Desert. It is planned to be completed around 2050, at which point it will be 2,800 miles (4,500 km) long.
The project's name indicates that it is to be carried out in all three of the northern regions: the North, the Northeast and the Northwest.
