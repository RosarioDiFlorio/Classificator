Hermann Zabel (22 September 1832, Neu-Katzow – 26 April 1912, Gotha) was a German botanist who specialized in the field of dendrology.
From 1854 to 1860 he was employed as an assistant at the botanical garden and museum in Greifswald. From 1869 to 1895 he was director of the forestry botanical garden in Hannoversch Münden. In retirement he took up residence in the city of Gotha.
The genus Zabelia (Rehder) Makino is named in his honor, as are taxa with the specific epithets of zabeliana and zabelii.
