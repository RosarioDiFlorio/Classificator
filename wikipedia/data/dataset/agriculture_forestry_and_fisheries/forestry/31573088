Silvology (Latin, silva or sylva, "forests and woods"; and Ancient Greek: -λογία, -logia, "science of or study of") is the study of forests and woods, incorporating both the understanding of natural forest ecosystems and the design of silvicultural systems.
Silvology is seen as a single science for forestry and was first used by Roeloff Oldeman. It integrates the study of forests and forest ecology, dealing with single tree autecology and natural forest ecology.
