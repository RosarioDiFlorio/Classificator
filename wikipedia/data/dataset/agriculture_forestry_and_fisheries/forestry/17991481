The American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) is the national trade association of the forest products industry, representing manufacturers of approximately 80 percent of the U.S. pulp and paper industry and 50 percent of the wood building material capacity.
AF&PA was formed on January 1, 1993 by the merger of the National Forest Product Association and the American Paper Institute.
Membership includes scores of companies and industry associations; among them, AbitibiBowater Inc., Boise Cascade LLC, Duro Bag Mfg, Georgia-Pacific LLC, International Paper Company, NewPage Corporation, Norbord Inc., Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., Sonoco Products Company, Verso Paper, and Weyerhaeuser Company.
AF&PA's primary work is public policy advocacy at the international, national, state and local levels and, according to the Center for Public Integrity, it spent about $20 million from 1998-2004 on these efforts. The Association also serves as the forest products industry's primary statistical clearinghouse for manufacturing, production and capacity data. An AF&PA affiliate organization, the American Wood Council, promotes the use of wood building materials in residential and commercial construction and is an ANSI-accredited publisher of wood building codes.
