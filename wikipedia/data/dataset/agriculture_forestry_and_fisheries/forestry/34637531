Pottiputki is a planting tool that was created by Tapio Saarenketo in the early 1970s. It is an efficient tool for manual planting of containerized seedlings. The planters can work in an ergonomically correct position while maintaining high productivity, making the task both fast and comfortable. It is more effective, but more expensive than the traditional mattock.
The tool is available in multiple sizes and tube diameters.
