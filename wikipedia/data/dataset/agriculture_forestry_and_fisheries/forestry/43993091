Dennis Robert Hoagland (April 2, 1884 â€“ September 5, 1949) was a plant scientist working in the field of plant nutrition. He was Professor of Plant Nutrition at the University of California at Berkeley from 1927 until his death in 1949., and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was known especially for his work on hydroponics and the Hoagland solution.
Hoagland graduated from Stanford University (1907) with a major in chemistry. In 1908 he became an instructor and assistant in the Laboratory of Animal Nutrition at the University of California at Berkeley, an institution with which he would be associated for the remainder of his life. He worked in the field of animal nutrition and biochemistry until 1912, when he entered the graduate school in the department of agricultural chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, receiving his master's degree in 1913. The following year he became assistant professor of agricultural chemistry at Berkeley.
A Hoagland hydroponic solution provides every nutrient necessary for plant growth being appropriate for the growth of a large variety of plant species. The solution described by Hoagland and Arnon in 1938 has been modified several times, notably with the addition of iron chelates.
