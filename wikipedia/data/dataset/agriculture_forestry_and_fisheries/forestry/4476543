Energy forestry is a form of forestry in which a fast-growing species of tree or woody shrub is grown specifically to provide biomass or biofuel for heating or power generation.
The two forms of energy forestry are short rotation coppice and short rotation forestry:
Short rotation coppice may include tree crops of Poplar, Willow or Eucalyptus, grown for 2 to 5 years before harvest.
Short rotation forestry are crops of Alder, Ash, Birch, Eucalyptus, Poplar, and Sycamore, grown for 8 to 20 years before harvest.
