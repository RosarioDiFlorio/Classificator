The United Nations Forest Hero Award was established in 2011, the International Year of Forests, to recognise individuals who have devoted their lives to protecting forests. Awards are given annually to one person in each of five regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America.
