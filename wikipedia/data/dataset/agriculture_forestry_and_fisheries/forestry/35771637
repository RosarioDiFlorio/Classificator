The Zambia Forestry College (ZFC) was established in 1949 to provide technical training in forestry. In the same year it produced the first forest guards.
In the following year, Forest Rangers were trained. The College has since been growing to cope with the changing demand for natural resource trained staff. By 1963, over 300 Forest Rangers (Certificate holders) and Forest Guards had been trained.
Training for Foresters (Diploma holders) commenced in 1963 with nine (9) students. By the end of 1977, 131 Foresters and one (1) female Forester completed her training successfully signifying that this field was gender friendly. The college has now been upgraded with equipment, facilities and staff.
