Free immigration (free movement of people) is often regarded as one of the core concepts of libertarian theory and philosophy. Some libertarians assert that: "Efforts by the government to manage the labor market are as apt to fail as similar efforts to protect domestic industries or orchestrate industrial policy. ... If an immigrant seeks to engage in peaceful, voluntary transactions that do not threaten the freedom or security of the native-born, the government should not interfere."
