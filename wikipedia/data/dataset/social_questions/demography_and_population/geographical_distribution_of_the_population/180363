The Gurkhas or Gorkhas or Gorkhali (Nepali: गोर्खा) or (Nepali: गोर्खाली) ( ) are the soldiers of Nepali nationality recruited in the British Army, Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Gurkha Contingent Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN Peace Keeping force and war zones around the world. Historically, the terms "Gurkha" and "Gorkhali" were synonymous with "Nepali", and derived from the hill principality Gorkha Kingdom from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under Māhārājādhirāj Prithivi Narayan Shah. The name may be traced to the medieval Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath who has a historic shrine in Gorkha. The word itself derived from Go-Raksha (Nepali:गोरक्षा), raksha becoming rakha (रखा). Rakhawala means protector and is derived from raksha as well.
Ethnically, Gurung, Kshetri or Khas, Thakuri, and Magar mainly were the Gorkha tribes who united erstwhile Gorkha Kingdom and fought against the British invasions. But today, Gorkha soldiers mostly belong to the Magar, Gurung, Tamang, Kirant Rai, Limbu, Kshetri, Sunuwar, Thakuri and Tharus. There is no ethnicity based restriction to join. There are Gurkha military units in the Nepalese, British and the Indian army enlisted in Nepal, United Kingdom and India. Although they meet many of the requirements of Article 47 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions regarding mercenaries, they are exempt under clauses 47(e)&(f) similar to the French Foreign Legion.
Gurkhas are closely associated with the Khukuri, a forward-curving Nepalese knife, and have a well known reputation for fearless military prowess. The former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, once stated that "If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a Gurkha."
