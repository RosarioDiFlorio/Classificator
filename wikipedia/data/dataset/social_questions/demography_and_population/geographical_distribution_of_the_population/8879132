This list of traditional territories of the original peoples of North America gives an overview of the names of the indigenous "countries" of North America. In this sense, "country" refers to the name of the land...the ground...the territory of a nation, rather than the name of the nation ("tribe") itself. This article is only about the name for the land of a nation.
For example, the traditional territory (country/land) of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Nation is called Waaziija, meaning "the Grand Pinery". In English, the land of an indigenous nation was historically, and sometimes still is, referred to as a "country", such as "(the) Winnebago country". Some Latinate forms exist in English such as "Iroquoia", "Huronia", and "Apacheria".
The distinction between nation and land is like the French people versus the land of France, the Māori people versus Aotearoa, or the Saami people versus Sápmi (Saamiland).
