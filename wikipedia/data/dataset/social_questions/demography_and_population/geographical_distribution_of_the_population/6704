Christendom has several meanings. In a contemporary sense, it may refer to the worldwide community of Christians, the adherents of Christianity, the Christian-majority countries, the countries in which Christianity dominates, or the nations in which Christianity is the established religion. It is also used as synonymous with the Western world.
In its historical sense, the term usually refers to the Middle Ages and to the Early Modern period during which the Christian world represented a geopolitical power that was juxtaposed with both the pagan and especially the Muslim world. In the traditional Roman Catholic sense of the word, it refers to the sum total of nations in which the Catholic Church is the established religion of the state or to those with ecclesiastical concordats with the Holy See.
