Project for Public Spaces (PPS) is a nonprofit organization based in New York dedicated to creating and sustaining public places that build communities.
Planning and design rooted in the community form the cornerstone of PPSâ€™s work. Building on the techniques of William H. Whyte's "Street Life Project," this approach involves looking at, listening to, and asking questions of the people in a community to discover their needs and aspirations. It was founded in 1975 by Fred Kent.
