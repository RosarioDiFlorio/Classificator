The Kingdom of Kush or Kush () was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, located at the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and River Atbara in what are now Sudan and South Sudan.
The Kushite era of rule in Nubia was established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Kush was centered at Napata during its early phase. After King Kashta ("the Kushite") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the Kushite emperors ruled for a century as pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt, until they were expelled by the Assyrians under the rule of Esarhaddon.
During classical antiquity, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Meroe. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as Aethiopia. The Kushite kingdom with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the Kingdom of Aksum.
