Caelius Vibenna, (Etruscan Caile Vipina, was a noble Etruscan who lived c.750  BCE (but see below) and brother of Aulus Vibenna (Etruscan Avile Vipina).
Upon arriving at Rome, Vibenna aided Romulus in his wars against Titus Tatius. He and his brother Aulus are also recorded as having aided King Tarquinius Superbus, although Tarquinius Superbus lived some five generations after Romulus. Tacitus relates that a certain hill in Rome, previously named Querquetulanus (after the trees covering the hill) was renamed the Caelian Hill after Caelius Vibenna.
A burial urn inscribed Arnth Caule Vipina can be found at Deposito de' Dei at Chiusi, Italy. It is likely that the ashes within belong to a different Etruscan of the same name.
