The Hacienda del Pozo de Verona was a mansion designed by architect A. C. Schweinfurth for philanthropist Phoebe Hearst in the Amador Valley near Pleasanton, California. The Hacienda was originally built between 1894 and 1898, with substantial later additions designed by architect Julia Morgan. The design of the Hacienda combined Mission, Pueblo, and Moorish architectural styles. It was destroyed by fire in 1969.
