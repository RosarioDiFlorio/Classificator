A flower seller, normally a woman, traditionally sells flowers on the street. Often the flowers are carried, in a basket for example. The subject matter has been a favorite of artists. The profession has mostly died out in countries like the United Kingdom, but still exists in others such as India.
The 1920s series of British Squibs films were constructed around the adventures of a London flower girl played by Betty Balfour.
