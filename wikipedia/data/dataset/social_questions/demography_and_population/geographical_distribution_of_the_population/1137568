Artificial gravity (sometimes falsely referred to as pseudogravity) is the creation of an inertial force that mimics the effects of a gravitational force, usually by rotation. Not to be confused with the intermittently experienced linear acceleration felt by astronauts from the force created by a rocket engine, artificial gravity is commonly used to refer to a sustained normal force. That normal force can be created through a number of methods such as rotation, linear acceleration, and magnetism. Artificial gravity has been used in simulations to help astronauts train for extreme conditions. Additionally, simulated gravity in manned spaceflight has been proposed as a solution to the adverse health effects caused by prolonged weightlessness. However, there are no current practical outer space applications of artificial gravity for humans due to concerns about the size and cost of a spacecraft necessary to produce a useful centripetal acceleration comparable to the gravitational field strength on Earth (g).
