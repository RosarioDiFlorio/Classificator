Nikon (alternatively spelled Nicon; Νίκων in Ancient Greek) was an ancient coastal emporium in the Horn of Africa. It was described in the 1st century CE Greco-Roman travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as being situated in the vicinity of Port Dunford (Bur Gao) in the southern Jubaland region of present-day Somalia.
