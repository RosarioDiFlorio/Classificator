The Berlin Demography Forum (BDF) is a global, non-partisan platform providing a new impetus to raise awareness of the significance of demographic change both at a national and international level. The forum brings together high-ranking politicians, scientists, business leaders, and representatives of international organisations and civil society to debate potential solutions and to contribute to sustainable development.
