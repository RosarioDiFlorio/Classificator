Annexation (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the administrative action and concept in international law relating to the forcible transition of one state's territory by another state. It is generally held to be an illegal act. It is distinct from conquest, which refers to the acquisition of control over a territory involving a change of sovereignty. It usually follows military occupation of a territory.
Annexation differs from cession, because unlike cession where territory is given or sold through treaty, annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state. Annexation can be legitimized via general recognition by international bodies (i.e. other countries and intergovernmental organisations).
