The Temple of King Dongmyeong (Hangul: 동명왕 신사, Hanja: 東明王 神祠), also known as the Temple of Jumong (Hangul: 주몽사, Hanja: 朱蒙祠), was a shamanistic temple dedicated to King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo, the founder of the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. It existed in at least two places; one in the Liaodong Peninsula and another in the Korean Peninsula.
The temple was standing even in the medieval Goryeo Dynasty; however, it has currently been lost to history.
