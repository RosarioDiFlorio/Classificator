Greater Israel (Hebrew: ארץ ישראל השלמה; Eretz Yisrael Hashlema) is an expression, with several different Biblical and political meanings over time. It is often used, in an irredentist fashion, to refer to the historic or desired borders of Israel.
Currently, the most common definition of the land encompassed by the term is the recognised territory of the State of Israel combined with the Israeli-occupied territories. Historically, Revisionist Zionists used a definition of the term meaning the whole territory covered by the British Mandate for Palestine, which included Mandatory Palestine itself and Transjordan, which developed independently after 1923. Religious uses of "Greater Israel" refer to one of the Biblical definitions of the Land of Israel found in Genesis 15:18–21, Deuteronomy 11:24, Deuteronomy 1:7, Numbers 34:1–15 or Ezekiel 47:13–20.
