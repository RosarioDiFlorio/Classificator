The Killke culture occupied the South American region around Cusco, Peru from 900 to 1200 AD, prior to the arrival of the Incas in the 13th century.
Killke culture flourished in highland Peru in the Late Intermediate Period around what is now Cusco. They built the massive fortress, Saksaywaman, during the 12th century. Later, the fortress was used by the Inca, following their occupation of the region.
In 2007, excavations uncovered a temple on the edge of the fortress, indicating religious as well as military use of the facility.
New excavations began in June 2007 that will continue to 2012. On March 13, 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of another ancient temple, roadway, and irrigation systems at Saksaywaman, overlooking the Inca capital of Cusco. Part of the temple was destroyed by dynamite blasts in the early 20th century, when the site was used as a stone quarry.
Killke ceramics first were described by John H. Rowe, although he incorrectly identified them as "early Inca". These vessels often are globular with vertical strap-handles and having simple linear geometric decorations of black or black-on-red over a white or buff slip.
