Óc Eo (French, from Khmer: អូរកែវ, O Keo, "Glass Canal") is an archaeological site in Thoại Sơn District in southern An Giang Province, Vietnam, in the Mekong River Delta. Óc Eo may have been a busy port of the kingdom of Funan between the 1st and 7th centuries.

Scholars use the term "Óc Eo Culture" to refer to the archaeological culture of the Mekong Delta region that is typified by the artifacts recovered at Óc Eo through archeological investigation.
Óc Eo is also one of the modern day communes of Vietnam.
