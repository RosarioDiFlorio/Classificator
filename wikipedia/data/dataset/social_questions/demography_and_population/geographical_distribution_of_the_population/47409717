The Somayajña is a yajña (ritual) performed for appeasing the celestial entities in Hinduism. It is primarily performed to promote the wellbeing of all humanity. The ritual is based on methods prescribed in the Vedas. Soma is used as the main oblation in this yajna, hence the name Somayajña. The Soma plant, the king of medicinal herbs, is said to be relished by the celestials.
