A community museum exhibits a social history, often of a local area or an ethnic group.
Most such museums are local museums but could cover a dispersed community such as an ethnic diaspora, gays, a profession or industry, or another group with a common interest such as an ideological movement.
Community museums generally have some relation to the identified community other than to exhibit artifacts under glass. Some are community centers. Others are participatory, inviting local commentary or input, folk items, hosting performances, or lending items from their collection out.
