Pan-Asianism (also known as Asianism or Greater Asianism) is an ideology that promotes the unity of Asian peoples. Several theories and movements of Pan-Asianism have been proposed, specifically from East, South and Southeast Asia. Motivating the movement has been resistance to Western imperialism and colonialism and a belief that Asian values should take precedence over European values. During the Cold War, the movement became less vigorous, as nations in the region aligned with one or the other of the superpowers.
