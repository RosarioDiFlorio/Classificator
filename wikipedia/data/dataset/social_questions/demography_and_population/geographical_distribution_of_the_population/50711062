The term territorial state (German: Territorialstaat) has been used since the High Middle Ages to refer to a state, typically in the Holy Roman Empire, in which the sovereignty or 'claim to power' (Herrschaftsanspruch) of the territorial prince, extended over a specific territory and its people. The constitution of such a state is referred to as the territorial constitution (Territorialverfassung).
Unlike the old stem duchies or lordships organised as a personal union, the sovereignty of a territorial state was based on its land or territory and not on membership of a dynastic family or other personally-related rights. Until the 16th century and, in some cases, beyond that, territorial states were characterised by a certain dualism, in that the territorial lords (the princes) held power jointly with the estates or Landst√§nde and both sides often had rights with respect to the other as well as separate institutions and administrations. This was especially true of the Holy Roman Empire, whose 300 individual territories gradually acquired territorial sovereignty.
The princely territorial state shares many characteristics with the institutional, geographically-defined state typical of the modern era.
