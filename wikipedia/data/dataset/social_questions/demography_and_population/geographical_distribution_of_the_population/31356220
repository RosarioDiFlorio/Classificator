The geographical chronicle Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan (Icelandic pronunciation: ​[ˈleːiðarvisɪr ɔːɣ ˈpɔrkar̥scɪpan]) was published in c. 1157 AD by Níkulás Bergsson (a.k.a. Nikolaos), the abbot of the monastery of Þverá in Eyjafjörður, Northern Iceland.
The publication is basically a guidebook for pilgrims about the routes from Northern Europe to Rome and Jerusalem. It contains two descriptions of lands around Norway that the Abbot seems to have acquired for his book from independent sources.
