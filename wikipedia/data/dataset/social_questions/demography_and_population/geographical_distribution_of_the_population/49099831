Las Haldas or Las Aldas is a large archaeological complex from before and during the initial ceramic period (1800-1000 BCE) of Peru. Las Haldas is located on the Pacific coast approximately 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of Lima and about 20 kilometres (12 mi) south of the Casma river valley, noted for the extensive ruins of the Casma/Sechin culture. Las Haldas, a coastal community, coexisted with the inland agricultural communities in the Casma River Valley for most of its history.
Distinguishing characteristics of Las Haldas are both its size and age as one of the earliest ruins of the ceramic period, its dependence upon maritime resources for subsistence, the lack of agriculture, and its distance from any source of fresh water.
Las Haldas is in a coastal area in which are found the oldest known civilizations of the Americas. The Casma valley archaeological sites are a few miles north and the Norte Chico civilization is about 60 miles (97 km) to the south.
