Vitki (from Old Norse: Wise one, pl. vitkar) was a sorcerer and magician in Norse Heathen societies. Vitkar could be men and women, experts in the tradition of Magic Runes, knowledge of the runes and healing ability as healers. A Vitki was a shamanic figure during the pre-Christian medieval Scandinavia, sometimes compared to prophets and oracles. The vitkar could carry tattooed on their chests hugr√∫nar (runes to memory and loquacity). Currently there's a Vitki figure in Germanic neopaganism.
