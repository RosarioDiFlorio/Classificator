The Lille Braderie (French: Braderie de Lille) is a braderie, or annual street market/flea market, that takes place on the weekend of the first Sunday of September in Lille, France. The event dates back to the 12th century and claims to be the largest such event in Europe with over 10,000 sellers and several million attendees.
The 2016 market was cancelled due to security fears because of recent terrorism in France. The mayor stated that they "could not guarantee the safety of the more than 2 million visitors who show up for the street fair"
