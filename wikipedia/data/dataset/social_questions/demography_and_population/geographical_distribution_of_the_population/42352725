The Civil War Trails Program founded by Civil War Trails, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia is a multi-state heritage tourism initiative designed to draw connections between and encourage visitation to Civil War sites. Efforts to increase visitation and signage have stepped up in recent years in preparation of the sesquicentennial of the Civil War. This includes and increased focus on lesser known sites with the addition of directional "trailblazer signs" for more than 1000 previously uninterpreted Civil War sites in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and West Virginia. Tennessee joined the program in 2008.
