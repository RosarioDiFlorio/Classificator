In terms of a political entity, a state is any politically organized community living under a single system of government. States may or may not be sovereign. For instance, federated states are members of a federal union, and may have only partial sovereignty, but are, nonetheless, states. Some states are subject to external sovereignty or hegemony, in which ultimate sovereignty lies in another state. States that are sovereign are known as sovereign states.
The term "state" can also refer to the secular branches of government within a state, often as a manner of contrasting them with churches and civilian institutions.
Speakers of American English often use the terms state and government as synonyms, with both words referring to an organized political group that exercises authority over a particular territory.
Many human societies have been governed by states for millennia, but others have been stateless societies. Over time a variety of different forms developed, employing a variety of justifications for their existence (such as the divine right of kings, the theory of social contract, etc.). In the 21st century, the modern nation-state is the predominant form of state to which people are subject.
