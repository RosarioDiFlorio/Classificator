Gu-Edin (also transcribed Gu'edena) was a flat field in Sumer, in modern-day Iraq. It lay between Umma and Lagash.
Enakalli, Ensi of Umma, purposely destroyed the irrigation works in the field to create a "margin of desolation" on behalf of his god.
The destruction of Gu-Edin is paralleled in the Gor novel series by John Norman.
