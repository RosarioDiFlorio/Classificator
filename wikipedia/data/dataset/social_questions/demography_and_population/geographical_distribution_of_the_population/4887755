The European Liberation Front (ELF) was a small neo-fascist group that split from Oswald Mosley's British Union Movement in 1948. Its founder and ideological inspiration was Francis Parker Yockey. In 1949 they issued a manifesto titled The Proclamation of London, written by Yockey.[1] The pan-nationalist (Pan-Europeanist) and anti-American movement had little impact, and lasted until 1954.
In the 1990s, the ELF, Yockey, and his ideology, were rediscovered by the Nouvelle Résistance, Alternativa Europea, National-Bolshevik Party, National Revolutionary Faction, and others. In 1999, a manifesto of a second 'European Liberation Front' was published in Paris, but there is apparently no more active organisation of that name now. The manifesto takes its ideological inspiration from Yockey, and from Otto Strasser, who was expelled from the Nazi party by Adolf Hitler in 1930.
Despite the pan-European style of its title, the ideology of the manifesto is ethnic and racial nationalism: the manifesto speaks of the "historical and cultural ties which exist between our respective nations" and calls for "mono-ethnic racial homelands" to preserve the "race, culture and traditions of all European peoples". European liberation, according to the manifesto, consists of "National Revolution".
Continental Europeans, like Jean-François Thiriart and Alain de Benoist were already influenced by the work of Yockey in the 1960s.
