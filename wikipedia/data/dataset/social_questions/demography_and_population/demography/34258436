Irreligion in the United Kingdom refers to the secularity or atheism, or, more generally, the lack of a religion in the country. Historically, the growth of irreligion in the UK has followed a European-wide pattern of secularisation.
The first British census to gather data on religion, in 2001, showed that there were 7.7 million irreligious people in the country. The wording of the question was criticised by humanist groups, and a revised question in the next census in 2011 counted 14.1 million irreligious people. This made irreligion the second-largest viewpoint on religion after Christianity, larger than the combined populations of non-Christian religions in the UK, and also the largest growth between the two censuses.
Freedom to be irreligious had been limited by the country's blasphemy law, which punished criticism and mockery of Christianity, particularly the state Church of England. The last conviction was in 1977, with the law being abolished in 2008.
