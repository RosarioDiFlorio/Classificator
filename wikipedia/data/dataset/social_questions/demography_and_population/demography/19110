The demographics of Malaysia are represented by the multiple ethnic groups that exist in this country. Malaysia's population, according to the 2010 census, is 28,334,000 including non-citizens, which makes it the 41st most populated country in the world. Of these, 5.72 million live in East Malaysia and 22.5 million live in Peninsular Malaysia. The population distribution is uneven, with some 79% of its citizens concentrated in Peninsular Malaysia, which has an area of 131,598 square kilometres (50,810.27 sq mi) constituting under 40% of the total area of Malaysia.
The Malaysian population is growing at a rate of 1.94% per annum as of 2017. According to latest projection of the 2010 census, among the three largest Malaysian groups Malays and Bumiputera fertility rates are at 2.4 children per woman, Chinese 1.4 children per woman, and Indians 1.8 children per woman. Malay fertility rates are 40% higher than Malaysian Indians and 56% higher than Malaysian Chinese. Population projections in 2017 show that the Malays and Bumiputeras comprised a total of 68.8%, Chinese 23.2%, and the Indians 7.0% of the total population. The Chinese population has shrunk from the figures of 1957 when it was about 40% of Malaya, although in absolute numbers they have multiplied around threefold by 2017 in Malaysia (2.4 million in 1957 to 6.6 million in 2017, the later figure include East Malaysia), but dwarfed by the fivefold increase of Malays (from around 3.1 million in 1957 to 15.5 million in 2017).
