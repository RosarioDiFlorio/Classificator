Gendercide is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender. The term is related to the general concepts of assault and murder against victims due to their gender, with violence against women and men being problems dealt with by human rights efforts.
Gendercide shares similarities with the term ‘genocide’ in inflicting mass murders, however, gendercide targets solely one gender, being men or women. Politico-Military frameworks have historically inflicted militant-governed divisions between femicide, and androcide; gender-selective policies increase violence on gendered populations due to their socioeconomic significance.
Gendercide is reported to be a rising problem in several countries. Census statistics report that in countries such as China and India, the male to female ratio is as high as 120 men for every 100 women. Gendercide also takes the forms of abortion and infanticide, and lethal violence against a particular gender at any stage of life.
The Holocaust falls within the category of genocide but can also be categorized as gendercide; in such instances, women were chosen for execution more than their male counterparts, and females were sent to ‘work camps’ where many were killed. Moreover, the categorization of war zones included the gendercide of males. Men who were able to participate in the military were deemed ‘militarized’ while other men were labeled ‘non-combatant’ and were not able to fit in the civilian subgroup because that admitted only women and children. Due to not being placed into the two dominant groups, being the militarized category and civilian group, the male non-combatant group was targeted for gendercide and received "particularly lethal treatment. Patriarchal structures that conceive females as responsible for breeding future combatants, are, along with the elderly and the young, "targeted as part root-and-branch extermination”; the culling of the women is perceived as severing reproduction.
