This is a list of counties and county-equivalents of the United States situated entirely or predominantly on islands. The United States of America is composed of 50 states, which are in turn divided into counties or county-equivalents (parishes, boroughs, independent cities, or census divisions). However, only a small fraction of those are situated entirely on islands. This list does not include county-equivalents in U.S. territories or commonwealths, such as Puerto Rico.
