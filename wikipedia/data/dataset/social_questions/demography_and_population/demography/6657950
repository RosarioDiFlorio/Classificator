Megestrol acetate (abbreviated as MGA), sold under the brand name Megace, is a progestin with antiandrogen activity that is mainly used as an appetite stimulant and less commonly in the treatment of breast and endometrial cancers. It is the C17Î± acetate ester of megestrol, which, in contrast to MGA, was never marketed for medical use. The term megestrol is often inappropriately used as a synonym for MGA, and when it is used, it almost always refers to MGA rather actually than megestrol. MGA is taken by mouth.
