Asian Caribbeans are people who live in the Caribbean, but were born in Asia, or are descended from people who were born in Asia.
The Asian Caribbean populations were the result of Coolie slaves and indentured labourers that were brought here by the Coolie Trade to work in mines, sugar plantations etc .
