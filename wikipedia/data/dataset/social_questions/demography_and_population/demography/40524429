Early modern demography is the demography of the world after the end of the medieval period, encompassing the whole of the Early modern period until the availability of accurate census records and other data which form the basis for contemporary demography.
Depending on the context, the end of the medieval world and the beginning of the modern may be dated to the Black Death in the middle of the 14th Century, the Fall of Constantinople in the middle of the 15th Century, or the Age of Exploration and the resulting epidemic deaths.
