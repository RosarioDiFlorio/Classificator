Minority (non-Japanese) students can be found throughout the entire Japanese education system. An incomplete list of possible cultural and or language minorities represented in Japanese schools include:
other Asian, particularly Korean, Chinese, Filipino, Thai, Mongolian and Vietnamese
Europeans
North Americans
Latin American, particularly Brazilian and Peruvian
Returnee children
bicultural children whose parents are from separate cultures and/or who speak separate languages
Ryukyuan people
Ainu people
Okinawans and Ainu are considered to be speakers of Japanese, and as a result are not considered language minorities. Descendants of Koreans and Chinese who have lived in Japan for many generations also speak Japanese as their first language. However, other non-Japanese-speaking children, such as the children of Japanese World War II orphans raised in China, who have been returning to Japan in the past decades, have introduced an element of language minorities to schools in Japan since the late 1970s.
