Multiracial is defined as made up of or relating to people of many races. Many terms exist for people of various multiracial backgrounds. While some of the terms used in the past are considered insulting and offensive, there are many socially acceptable modern terms that multiracial people identify with. These include mixed-race (or simply "mixed"), biracial, multiracial, multiethnic, polyethnic, half, half-and-half, métis, creole, mestizo, mulatto, melungeon, criollo, chindian, dougla, quadroon, zambo, eurasian, hāfu, and pardo.
Individuals of multiracial backgrounds make up a significant portion of the population in many parts of the world. In North America, studies have found that the multiracial population is continuing to grow. Because of a decline in racism, multiracial people no longer feel the need to hide their heritage. In many countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, mixed-race people make up the majority of the population. Other countries where multiracial people make up a sizable portion of the population are the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Brazil, the Netherlands, Spain, parts of Africa and Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, and Fiji.
