A metroplex is a contiguous metropolitan area that has more than one principal anchor city of near equal size or importance, commonly associated with the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex. According to the North Texas Commission (NTC), the term originated from an ad agency's portmanteau of the terms "metropolitan" and "complex". The NTC trademarked the term "Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex" in 1972 as a replacement for the previously-ubiquitous "North Texas". Urban areas with smaller secondary anchor cities are not considered metroplexes, such as Mexico City, New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, and Phoenix.
