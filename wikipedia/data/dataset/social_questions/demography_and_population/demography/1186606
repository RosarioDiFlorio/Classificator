Breakthrough bleeding (BTB) is any of various forms of vaginal bleeding, usually referring to mid-cycle bleeding in users of combined oral contraceptives, as attributed to insufficient estrogens. It may also occur with other hormonal contraceptives. Sometimes, breakthrough bleeding is classified as abnormal and thereby as a form of metrorrhagia, and sometimes it is classified as not abnormal.
