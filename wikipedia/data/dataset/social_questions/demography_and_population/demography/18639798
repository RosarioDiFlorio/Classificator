Black women is both a multi-faceted cultural identity and a powerful social construct with different meanings in different places. For some, it is those women born on the African continent; for others it includes the descendants of slaves brought from Africa to the United States. For others, it includes aboriginal women in Australia or Pakistanis in the United Kingdom. In all places, black women have been seen over the past three hundred years in stereotypical ways, resulting in increased risk for them. But, they have also been important leaders early in human history.
