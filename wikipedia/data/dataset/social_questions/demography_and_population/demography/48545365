Kuri-mar (or Kudi-mar) is a Punjabi phrase which literally means "girl killer". It may refer to the practice of female infanticide which existed prior to 19th century in parts of India. The practice was banned by Guru Govind Singh around 1699 and he prohibited his followers from associating with its practitioners. Later, various rehat-namas including the Sikh Rehat Maryada prohibited the practice. Today, the term also encompasses female foeticide and may refer to North-western regions of India which have skewed gender ratios.
