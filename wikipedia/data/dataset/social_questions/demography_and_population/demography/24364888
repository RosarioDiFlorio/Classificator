Protestant views on contraception are markedly more pluralistic than the views expressed by the Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church, due to historical divergences of theological thought that began during the Protestant Reformation, including the rejection of an infallible doctrinal authority other than Scripture. The doctrine of Protestantism from the Reformation until 1930 strongly condemned contraception. Since the 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference of the Anglican communion, major Protestant denominations shifted their doctrine to accepting contraception. In general, most liberal Protestants and Anglicans hold relatively settled views that accept use of contraception, while debate is ongoing among conservative Evangelicals, especially as to which types are and are not acceptable.
