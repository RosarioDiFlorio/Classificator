The Garifuna (Pardo) ( gə-RIF-uu-nə; pl. Garinagu in Garifuna) are mixed-race descendants of West African, Central African, Island Carib, European, and Arawak people.
Although their background is the Lesser Antilles, since 1797, the Garifuna people have lived in Central America, along the Caribbean Coast of Honduras, with smaller populations in Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua and in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. They arrived there after being exiled from the islands of the Lesser Antilles by British colonial administration as Black Caribs after a series of slave revolts. Those Caribs deemed to have had less African admixture were not exiled, and are still living in the islands.
They speak the Garifuna language.
