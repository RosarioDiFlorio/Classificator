carafem is an American nonprofit organization that provides women’s reproductive health services with centers in Chevy Chase, Maryland and Atlanta, Georgia. The organization seeks to normalize, "de-medicalize" and remove the social stigma from the provision of birth control and early abortion care in the midst of an ongoing polarized and politicized debate on abortion in the United States. The organization intentionally uses certain language such as “health center” instead of “clinic”, and openly uses the word “abortion” in its advertising.

carafem centers aim to provide information and low-cost options for most methods of birth control including the birth control pill, contraceptive implants, injectable, intrauterine device (IUD), patch, ring and emergency contraception. They also provide early abortion care with medication. carafem operates under the corporate name FemHealth USA, a registered 501(c)(3) organization.
