Progestogen-only contraception (or progestin-only contraception) relies on progestogens alone to achieve contraception. It is one of the two major types of hormonal contraception, with the other major type being combined hormonal contraceptive methods (including both estrogen and a progestogen). There are several progestogen only contraceptive methods:
Progestogen-only pill ("minipill")
Contraceptive implants such as Nexplanon
Progestogen-only injectable contraceptives like Depo-Provera and norethisterone enanthate
Mirena intrauterine system
