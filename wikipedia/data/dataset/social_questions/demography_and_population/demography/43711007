Reports of forced sterilization of Native American women began to surface in the 1970s. Of the 100,000 to 150,000 Native American women of childbearing age, 3,400 to 70,000 of these women were involuntarily sterilized through tubal ligation or hysterectomy. They were not given a choice to refuse or accept to undergo the sterilization procedure. Many were manipulated into thinking that they would risk losing their welfare aid or even their lives should they refuse to undergo a sterilization procedure. However, the procedure was most often done under the pretense of a check up or abortion, and most of the victims didn't know they were sterilized until years afterwards.
The sterilizations had an appreciable effect on the fertility rates of Native American women. In the 1970s, the average birth rate of Native American women was 3.79 children, but by 1980 the birth rate had fallen to 1.8 children.
