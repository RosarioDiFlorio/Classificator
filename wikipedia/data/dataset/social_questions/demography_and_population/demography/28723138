A reproductive life plan is a plan for whether, when and how to have children. It includes personal goals, and states how to achieve them. The plan is based on a person's priorities and goals with regard to life and children. The plan may take into account their resources, commitments, and values. Reproductive life plan serves as a basis for action to help realize the plan. For instance: it can be helpful in selecting an appropriate birth control if one is sexually active but is not ready to have children; or seeking Pre-conception counseling and care, to improve health of mother and child. Family planning professionals can help in formulating and implementing a reproductive life plan. Unintended pregnancies are associated with an array of negative outcomes for the mother, child and family, formulating a plan can help to make sure that pregnancies are prepared for and intended.
People often delay having children to gather necessary resources, to gather social support, until career or other goals are met, or to improve health outcomes for mother and child.
Although many people who desire children do so through childbirth, some adopt children, become foster parents, or use other arrangements to achieve their desires (co-parenting, surrogacy).
Many people decide not to have children (childfree).
In 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a recommendation, encouraging men and women to formulate a reproductive life plan, to help them in avoiding unintended pregnancies and to improve the health of women and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.
