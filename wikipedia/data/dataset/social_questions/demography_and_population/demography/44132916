The working environment has gone through a major transformation over the last decade, particularly in terms of population in the workforce. The three generations dominating the workforce in 2013 are Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y. The coming decades will see further changes with emergence of newer generations, and slower removal of older generations from organisations as pension age is pushed out. Many reports, including a publication by Therese Kinal and Olga Hypponen of Unleash, warn that understanding differences between the generations, and learning to adapt their management practices is critical to building a successful multigenerational workplace.
