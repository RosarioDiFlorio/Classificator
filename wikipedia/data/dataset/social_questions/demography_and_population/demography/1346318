Brazil has a high level of urbanization: 82 out of every 100 Brazilians live in cities. The criteria used by the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) in determining whether households are urban or rural, however, are based on political divisions, not on the built environment.
Nowadays, the country has more than 5,570 municipalities. About 87.86% of Brazilians live in urban areas.
The state capitals are also the largest cities in their respective states, exceptions being Florianópolis (which is the capital and the second largest city of Santa Catarina state after Joinville) and Vitória (which is the capital but only the fourth largest city of Espírito Santo state).
