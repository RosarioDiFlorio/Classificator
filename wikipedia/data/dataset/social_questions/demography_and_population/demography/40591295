World Vasectomy Day was an event to raise global awareness of vasectomy as a solution to prevent unintended pregnancies. The goal was for doctors all over the world to perform approximately 1000 vasectomies, connected to the event via Skype and social media platforms. Prolific vasectomist Dr Doug Stein was scheduled to perform vasectomies in front of an audience at the Royal Institution of Australia (RiAus) to launch the inaugural World Vasectomy Day with the worldâ€™s first live-streamed vasectomy. Dr Stein planned to answer questions from a live audience in Australia and an international online audience.
