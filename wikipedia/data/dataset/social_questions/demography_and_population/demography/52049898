Minoritized language is a term of sociolinguistics that refers to a language that has suffered marginalization, persecution or even ban at some point in its history. It is a concept which highlights the presence of an enforcement action that leads to a cut in its use. It differs from the more widely used "minority language",which refers to the language used by a small number of speakers. In any case they aren't synonymous and not always a minoritized language is a minority language, although it tends to it. An example of this language is Galician, which has been sidelined by youth in Spain. Other examples of this language are Ã–s and Tofa, whose speakers were, respectively, ridiculed for or banned from speaking the language. Language marginalization stems from the need large nations' have of establishing a common tongue for all its societal dealings.
