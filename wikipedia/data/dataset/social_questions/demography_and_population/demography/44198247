Abortion in Bangladesh is illegal under most situations, but menstrual regulation is often used as a substitute. Bangladesh is still governed by the penal code from 1860, where induced abortion is illegal unless the woman in danger.
Historically, abortion has been prevalent, especially during the years following the Bangladesh Liberation War. For example, in 1972, the law allowed for abortion for those women who has been raped during the war. In 1976, the Bangladesh National Population Policy unsuccessfully attempted to legalize abortion in the first trimester.
Since 1979, menstrual regulation has been the favored alternative to induced abortion, and it is legally permitted because pregnancy cannot be established. In 2012, the Drug Administration for Bangladesh legalised the combination of mifepristone and misoprotol for medical abortion.
