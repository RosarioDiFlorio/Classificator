Post-demographics is a way to study the personal data in social networking platforms, and, in particular, how profiling is, or may be, performed, with which findings as well as consequences. The prefix 'post' shows that it is different from the demographic data that tries to organize groups, markets and voters in society. Where of interests are not the traditional demographics of race, ethnicity, age, income, educational level or derivations thereof such as class, but rather tastes and other information supplied to make and maintain an online profile. From a post-demographics perspective, the profile lies at the core of research into social networking sites, as it provides information that moves beyond the demographic, organized according to ‘interested’ and ‘favorites’, with more specific sub-categories as brands, music, movies, animals, etc.
