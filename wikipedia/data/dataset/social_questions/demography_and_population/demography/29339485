Family Planning Queensland (FPQ) t/a True Relationships & Reproductive Health (True) is an expert provider of clinic services and education relating to reproductive and sexual health. Founded in 1972, True is a non-profit organisation that serves nine regional centres across Queensland. During 2015, the organisation changed its trading name from FPQ to True.
True is a secondary health provider, which plays an important role in the referral pathways between general practice and hospitals. The organisation is well known for its strong subject-matter focus and non-judgmental approach and its clinic service portfolio includes services that GPs do not necessarily provide such as colposcopy and procedural contraception.
In addition to its clinics, True is a leading provider of education and training for clinicians. It is a member of Family Planning Alliance Australia (FPAA) and conducts the FPAA National Certificate in Sexual & Reproductive Health for Doctors, in addition to a wide variety of other courses.
In the community, True supports schools, parents and community groups with education tailored to their specific needs. The historical focus on reproductive and sexual health is increasingly supplemented by respectful relationships education, responding to community concerns about domestic violence and sexual abuse.
