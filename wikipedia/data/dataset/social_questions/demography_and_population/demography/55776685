Irving Operation is a gynaecological operative technique for permanent sterilization in women. It was proposed to reduce the failure rate of Pomeroy procedure for female sterilization. In Irving operation, the proximal part of fallopian tube is buried back into the myometrium, thereby obstructing its lumen.
