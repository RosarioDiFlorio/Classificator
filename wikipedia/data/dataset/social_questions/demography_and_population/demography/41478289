La Operación is a 1982 forty-minute documentary film by Ana María García about US-imposed sterilization policies in Puerto Rico, exploring the mass sterilization of Puerto Rican women during the 1950s and 1960s. Garcia blends interviews with women of different ethnic and class backgrounds who have gone through the sterilization process. She intercuts these interviews with vertite and historical footage to create a powerful look at this decades-long practice.
