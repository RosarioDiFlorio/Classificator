No-scalpel vasectomy (also called keyhole vasectomy or NSV) is a vasectomy procedure variant in which a sharp hemostat is used to puncture the scrotum to access the vas instead of giving an incision as in conventional vasectomy. This offers several benefits, key being no need for surgical sutures to close the skin. Because of the inherent simplicity of the procedure it affords itself to be used in public health programs worldwide.This method is used in over 40 countries for male sterilisation.
