Testosterone undecanoate, sold under the brand names Nebido, Aveed, and Andriol among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid. It is used in androgen replacement therapy primarily for the treatment of male hypogonadism, and has also been investigated for use as a male contraceptive or as hormone replacement therapy in transgender men. It is a synthetic androgen ester which acts as a prodrug of testosterone, and hence is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of testosterone. Unlike other testosterone esters, testosterone undecanoate is available in both oral and intramuscular formulations. As an intramuscular injection, it is much longer-acting than most other testosterone esters. Along with testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, testosterone undecanoate is one of the most widely used testosterone esters.
