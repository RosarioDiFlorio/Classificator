Combined oral contraceptives that contain natural estradiol or an estradiol ester (e.g., estradiol valerate) include:
Cyproterone acetate and estradiol valerate (brand name Femilar) – introduced in Finland (only) in 1993
Dienogest and estradiol valerate (brand names Qlaira, Natazia) – introduced in Europe in 2009 and the United States in 2010
Nomegestrol acetate and estradiol (brand name Zoely) – introduced in Europe in 2011
It is hypothesized that these contraceptives may pose less of a risk of blood clots than contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol, which is the conventional estrogen that is used in oral contraceptives, but this has yet to be proven. However, incidence of irregular vaginal bleeding may be higher with estradiol-containing contraceptives in relation to the fact that estradiol is a weaker estrogen than ethinylestradiol in the endometrium.
Estradiol, mainly as esters including estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, and estradiol enanthate, is the exclusive estrogen used in combined injectable contraceptives.
