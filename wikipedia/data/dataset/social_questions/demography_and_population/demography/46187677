Migration can be voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary migration includes the slave trade, trafficking in human beings and ethnic cleansing. Migration is vital in the story of the human race. People move to survive. They move in search of food. They move away from danger and death. They move towards opportunities for life such job opportunities and technological advancement. Migration is tied to the human spirit, which seeks adventure, pursues dreams, and finds reasons to hope even in the most adverse circumstances.
