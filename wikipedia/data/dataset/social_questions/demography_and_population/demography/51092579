Nandrolone hexyloxyphenylpropionate (brand names Anador, Anadur, Anadurine), also known as 19-nortestosterone 17Î²-(3-(4-hexyloxy)phenyl)propionate, is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and a nandrolone ester that is marketed in France, Denmark, Austria, Luxembourg, and Turkey. It has been studied as a potential long-acting injectable male contraceptive, though it has not been marketed for this indication. Approximately 70% of men became azoospermic, while the remaining men all became oligospermic.
