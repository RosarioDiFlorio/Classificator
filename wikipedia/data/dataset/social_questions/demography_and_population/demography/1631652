The Nordic race was one of the putative sub-races into which some late 19th to mid 20th century anthropologists divided the Caucasian race. People of the Nordic type were to be mostly found in the Nordic countries. The psychological traits of Nordics were described as truthful, equitable, competitive, na√Øve, reserved, and individualistic. Other supposed sub-races were the Alpine race, Dinaric race, East Baltic race, and the Mediterranean race.
Nordicism was an ideology of racial separatism which viewed Nordics as an endangered racial group, most notably in Madison Grant's book The Passing of the Great Race. This ideology was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in some Northwestern, Central, and Northern European countries as well as in North America and Australia. The Nazis claimed that the Nordic race was the most superior of the "Aryan race" and constituted a master race (Herrenvolk).
