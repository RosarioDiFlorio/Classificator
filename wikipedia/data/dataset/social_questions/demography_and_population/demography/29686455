As of 2010, 17% of Singaporeans have no religious affiliation. Non-religious Singaporeans are found in various ethnic groups and all walks of life in Singapore. Singapore's non-religious tend to be atheists, agnostics, humanists, theists, deists and skeptics. Some locals affiliate with no religion, but still choose to practice traditional rituals like ancestor worship. The number of non-religious people in Singapore has risen slightly. Census reports show that those who said they have no religion rose from 13% in 1980 to 17% in 2010. In recent years, social gatherings of non-religious people have become more popular in Singapore.
Since 2005, informal atheist groups had organised social gatherings to discuss religion and secularism, and popular books on the topic from authors such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. One of the earliest groups was called the Atheist Haven, and was formed by three Singaporeans in 2004.
