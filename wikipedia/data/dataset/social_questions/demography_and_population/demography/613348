Philipp Mainländer (October 5, 1841 – April 1, 1876) was a German poet and philosopher. Born Philipp Batz, he later changed his name to Mainländer in homage to his hometown, Offenbach am Main.
In his central work Die Philosophie der Erlösung (The Philosophy of Redemption) – according to Theodor Lessing, "perhaps the most radical system of pessimism known to philosophical literature" – Mainländer proclaims that life is absolutely worthless, and that "the will, ignited by the knowledge that non-being is better than being, is the supreme principle of morality."
