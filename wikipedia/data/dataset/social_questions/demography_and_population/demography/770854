It is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.05%. The device is placed under the skin and lasts for up to five years. It may be used by women who have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and therefore cannot use an intrauterine device. Following removal fertility quickly returns.
It is generally well tolerated with few significant side effects. Side effects may include irregular menstrual periods, no periods, headaches, and breast pain. Use is not recommended in people with significant liver disease. The levonorgestrel implant is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It primarily works by stopping ovulation and by thickening the mucus around the cervix.
A levonorgestrel-releasing implant was approved for medical use in 1983 in Finland and in the United States in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 8.93 to 13.29 USD per set. Levonorgestrel implants are approved in more than 60 countries and used by more than seven million women. As of 2015 it is approved but not available in the United States.
