A Caribbean person or West Indian is a native or inhabitant of the Caribbean region or a person of Caribbean descent living outside the Caribbean. The Caribbean region was initially populated by Amerindians from several different Carib and Arawak groups. These groups were decimated by a combination of slavery and disease brought by European colonizers. Descendants of the Arawak and Carib tribes exist today in the Caribbean and elsewhere but are usually of partial Native American ancestry.
Modern Caribbeans usually further identify by their own specific ethnic ancestry, therefore constituting various subgroups, largest of which are: Afro-Caribbean (largely descendants of emancipated African slaves) White Caribbean (largely descendants of European colonizers) and Indo-Caribbean (largely descendants of jahaji indentured workers).
