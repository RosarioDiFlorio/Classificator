Localities, also called urban sub-divisions, are component areas of the urban areas (conurbations) of England and Wales defined by the Office for National Statistics to enable detailed study of smaller areas within conurbations, and to enable comparisons to be made with historical data. The boundaries of localities within conurbations often follow those of local authorities existing before local government re-organisation in 1974, the boundaries of current authorities within agglomerations, or the points where previously separate urban areas joined.
Localities are not the same as local government areas such as cities or borough council areas, as localities are based upon the actual built-up area and cannot extend beyond a single physically contiguous urban area, but can extend beyond local government boundaries. For the population of these local government areas see List of English districts by population.
This is a list of the localities within England that had a population greater than 100,000 at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001.
This article is provided for historical interest only, because this sense of 'locality' disappears in the 2011 census and the population data have been recalculated.
