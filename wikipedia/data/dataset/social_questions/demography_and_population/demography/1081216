Indo-Caribbeans are Caribbean people with roots in South Asia. They are mostly descendants of the original jahaji indentured workers brought by the British, the Dutch, Spain, and the French during colonial times.
The term East Indian is used in the English-speaking Caribbean and by the Canadian mainstream media. They are sometimes simply called Indian, Hindustani, Jahaji, Girmitya, Coolie, Kantraki, Bharatiya, Desi, or India Wale, in the English-speaking Caribbean. However, Coolie is considered a derogatory racial slur, as it means "poor worker."
Most Indo-Caribbean people live in the English-speaking Caribbean nations, Suriname, and the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique, with smaller numbers in other Caribbean countries and, following further migration, in Europe and North America.
