Irreligion in Sri Lanka may refer to atheism, agnosticism, deism, religious skepticism, secular humanism or general secularist attitudes in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan national census does not provide an option for no religion.
This is supported by a 2008 Gallup poll which found 99% of Sri Lankans considered religion an important aspect of their daily lives. Only Niger, Bangladesh and Indonesia scored higher than this.
