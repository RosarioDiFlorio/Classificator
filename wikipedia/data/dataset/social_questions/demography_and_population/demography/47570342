This is a list of urban areas in Europe, with their population according to two different sources. The list includes urban areas that have a population of over 1 million.
Figures in the first and second column come from the UN's World Urbanization Prospects and list only urban agglomerations. Figures in the third column come from the City Population website and list all continuous urban areas, including conurbations. Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact.
