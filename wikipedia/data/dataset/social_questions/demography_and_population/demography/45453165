The Arab Barometer is a research project that produces scientifically reliable data on the politically-relevant attitudes of citizens in the Middle East and North Africa. Since 2006, the project has conducted 29 surveys over three waves covering 14 countries in the region.
The project is organized through a partnership between Princeton University, the University of Michigan, and the Arab Reform Initiative. Results are based on face-to-face interviews using multi-stage probability sampling to select respondents eighteen years of age or older.
