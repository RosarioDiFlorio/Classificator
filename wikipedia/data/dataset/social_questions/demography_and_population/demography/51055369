Oxogestone phenpropionate (USAN), also known as xinogestone, as well as 20β-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 20β-(3-phenylpropionate), is a steroidal progestin related to the 19-norprogesterone derivatives that was developed as an injectable hormonal contraceptive in the 1960s and early 1970s but was never marketed. It is the 20β-(3-phenylpropionate) ester of oxogestone, which, similarly, was never marketed.
