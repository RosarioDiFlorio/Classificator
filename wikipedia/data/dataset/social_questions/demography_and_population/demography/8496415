This is a list of gay villages, urban areas with generally recognized boundaries that unofficially form a social center for LGBT people. They tend to contain a number of gay lodgings, B&Bs, bars, clubs and pubs, restaurants, caf√©s and other similar businesses. Some may be gay getaways, such as Provincetown or Guerneville.
