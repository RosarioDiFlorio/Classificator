The Zosimades (Greek: Ζωσιμάδες) or Zosimas brothers were 18th-19th century Greek benefactors and merchants.
The Zosimades were six brothers:
Ioannis Zosimas (1752–1771)
Anastasios Zosimas (1754–1828)
Nikolaos Zosimas (1758–1842)
Theodosios Zosimas (1760–1793)
Zois Zosimas (1764–1828)
Michael Zosimas (1766–1809)
They were born in Ioannina, a city that was under Ottoman rule and a major center of the Greek Enlightenment that time. Their father was a local merchant, Panagis Zosimas. At 1875, Nikolaos, Theodosios and Michael started their trading activities in Livorno, Italy, while Ioannis, Anastasios and Zois ran their trade business in Nizhyn (Ukraine) and then in Moscow. Their trade network soon became profitable and they managed to make a fortune.
