"Hong Kong Kids" or "Kong Kids" (Kong Hai; Chinese: 港孩) is an expression, often derogatory, that refers to children or teenagers in Hong Kong who, among other undesirable traits, are overly dependent, have low emotional intelligence and have weak self-management skills. The term "Kong Kids" was coined in 2009 in a book titled "Kong Kids: The Nightmares for Parents and Teachers" published by MingPao (a local Chinese newspaper publisher). The book summarizes ten negative characteristics common in children born in Hong Kong after the 1990's. The book cited parents who spoil their children from an early age as the party responsible for the upbringing of "Kong Kids". Treating their children like "princes and princesses", parents tend to spoil their children with material gifts and money (not dissimilar to the "Little emperor syndrome" prevalent in neighbouring China). In addition, parents often have a hand in tackling everyday, trivial problems that their children might face, limiting opportunities for the children to problem solve on their own. Growing up under a spotlight, children often develop a self-centred personality, believing that the Earth revolves around them. It's also likely for Kong Kids to have a short temper when faced with problems, since they are not used to solving problems on their own. These harmful habits and characters may influence future generations, forming a vicious cycle.
