Resource acquisition ability (RAA) is a term in social psychology and the sexual opposite of the reproductive value (RV), introducing an unintentional mechanism used by women when selecting a male partner. The RAA is focused on some factors:
Genetic information
Salary
Social status
Child care
Personal history (i.e. crime affairs are not good for the RAA)
Numerous other things
Unlike the reproduction value, the RAA is not a scale. Mainly because of the unindexable factors, this term is a bit more complex than the RV.
