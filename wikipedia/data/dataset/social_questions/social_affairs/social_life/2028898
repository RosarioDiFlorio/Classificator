An only child is a person with no siblings, either biological or adopted. The term only child is generally applied only to those individuals who have never had siblings.
Some chidren may have half-siblings or step-siblings, either living at the same house or a different house - especially those who were born considerably later - may have a similar family environment to only children, as may children who have younger siblings from both of the same parents (generally ten or more years).
