Transitional age youth (TAY) are young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four who are in transition from state custody or foster care and are at-risk. Once they turn 18 they can no longer receive assistance from the systems of care that previously provided for many of their needs. Like most young people, they are struggling to start out with limited resources and experience. Unlike many, though, they do not have the family resources others take for granted. There is no family to provide them with furniture and dishes for their apartment, to co-sign a loan or guarantee their credit for the landlord, to help pay the security deposit, to guide them through the college admissions process, or put in a good word for a new job.
