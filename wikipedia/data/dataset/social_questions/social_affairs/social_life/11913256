App-O-Rama refers to a strategy of completing multiple credit account applications in a relatively short period of time. The term, as set out in the Wall Street Journal, refers to a frenzy of applications, and most frequently refers to applications for financial products, such as loans, credit cards, and bank deposit accounts. However, it can also include insurance applications, brokerage applications, etc.
App-o-Rama is also commonly known as AppORama, Application-O-Rama, App-a-Rama, "AOR" for short, and other nicknames in the United States.
Since many of these financial products require a credit inquiry and evaluate one's credit worthiness at that point in time, the object is to perform all applications at the same time, preferably when one's credit profile is in top condition.
