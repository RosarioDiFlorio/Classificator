Gay sexual practices are sexual activities involving men who have sex with men (MSM), regardless of their sexual orientation or sexual identity. The authors of the Kinsey Reports state that 37% of their male subjects had had at least one homosexual experience. Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to social desirability bias.
