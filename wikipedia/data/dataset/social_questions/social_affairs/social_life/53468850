A relationship register is an alternative to marriage that provides legal proof of a relationship. This may be useful in issues relating to tax, retirement accounts, government payments, immigration or medical emergencies. Most states and territories in Australia provide a relationship register, and similar registers exist in other jurisdictions, such as the Canadian province of Manitoba.
