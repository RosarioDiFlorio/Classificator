Carl "Charlie" Brandt (February 23, 1957 – September 13, 2004) was an American serial killer. Brandt, a native of Indiana and longtime resident of the Florida Keys, committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa "Teri" Brandt, seven times and decapitated and severely mutilated his niece, Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.
It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents – his pregnant mother fatally – in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident – of which Teri Brandt's family was unaware – and because of Charlie Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with human anatomy, investigators looked into the prospect that he had been a serial killer who had operated without detection since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.
