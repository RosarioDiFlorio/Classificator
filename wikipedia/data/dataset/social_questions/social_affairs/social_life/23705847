Ring enhancers, often called Ring Guards, Ring Wraps, or Curved Rings  are uniquely designed rings, created to be worn with solitaire diamond rings. The sole purpose of a ring enhancer is to complement a diamond solitaire ring with additional diamonds or gemstones, in order to enhance the size and appearance of a solitaire engagement ring. When worn together, the two rings appear to be a single, multi-stone ring.
