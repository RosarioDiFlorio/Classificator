Love & Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs was written in 2004 by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs. The book suggests a direct connection between the emotional needs of men and women and a verse of scripture found in the Bible, that when adhered to, can strengthen and transform relationships.
Ephesians 5:33 "Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
Dr. Eggerichs founded the nonprofit organization Love and Respect Ministries  in 1999 and held Love and Respect Marriage Conferences throughout the U.S. along with his wife Sarah. By 2003 Dr. Eggerichs had become a requested speaker on the Christian radio broadcast Focus on the Family that at that time was hosted by psychologist James Dobson. The book was then produced with the assistance of Focus on the Family and went on to make several top 10 book lists and won several book awards including the 2007 Book of the Year for the Family Christian Stores. Other awards include the Gold Medallion Award in 2005 and the Retailers Choice Awards. Dr. Eggerichs wrote a second follow-up to Love & Respect in 2009 titled The Language of Love & Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate  In 2010, Love and Respect for a Lifetime, a gift book for husbands and wives, was released.
