(ULPA is also an acronym for ultra-low penetration air (ULPA) filters.)

The Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which includes its 1976 revision called the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), is a uniform act (similar to a model statute), proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws ("NCCUSL") for the governance of business partnerships by U.S. States. The NCCUSL promulgated the original ULPA in 1916 and the most recent revision in 2001.
