Homeovestism is a concept identified by George Zavitzianos and further developed by Louise Kaplan, to refer to the arousal of a person by wearing clothing appropriate to their gender, in comparison with the more widely recognized practices of transvestic fetishism, in which one is aroused by wearing clothing of a different gender.
According to Kaplan's book Female Perversions (Doubleday, 1991), homeovestism is "an impersonation of the idealized phallic parent of the same sex" in order "to overcome shameful and frightening cross-gender identifications" (p. 546, footnote to p. 250).
