A simmelian tie (can be capitalized as a Simmelian tie) is a type of an interpersonal tie, a concept used in the social network analysis. For a simmelian tie to exist, there must be three (a triad) or more of reciprocal strong ties in a group. A simmelian tie is seen as an even stronger tie than a regular strong tie.
A simmelian tie can be seen as a basic element of a clique.
