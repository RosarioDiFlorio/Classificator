Love Matters is a global program providing information on relationships, sex and love. The idea was first developed in the Netherlands by the independent media producer RNW Media. It has been referred to as a freedom of speech program. Its current target countries are Kenya, Uganda, China, Egypt, Mexico, Venezuela and India.
The platform was originally launched in India, before expanding rapidly to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and China. Love Matters works mainly online via its own websites and social media channels. In each region, it provides the same delivery method, but the content and language are tailored to each target market. It seeks to bridge the gap in sexual reproductive health information between young people, sexual health experts, educators and services.
The concept has been honored by the World Association for Sexual Health and is also mentioned in the United Nations manifesto on reproductive health.
