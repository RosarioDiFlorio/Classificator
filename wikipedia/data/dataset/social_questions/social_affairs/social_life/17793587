Family resource programs are Canadian community-based organizations that support families in a variety of ways through systems such as family resource centres, family places, family centres, and neighbourhood houses. They can also be linked to schools, community centres, child care programs, women's centres, and native friendship centres. This includes programs such as Ontario Early Years and military-funded family centres. They are generally grassroots organizations that aim to be responsive to local issues.
Similar organizations or programs may exist in other countries under similar or different names.
