National Coalition Against Domestic Violence focuses on domestic violence in the home, society-wide violence, and factors that perpetuate violence against women and children. Founded in 1978, its goal is to “organize for collective power by advancing transformative work, thinking, and leadership in communities and individuals who seek to end violence in our lives.”
