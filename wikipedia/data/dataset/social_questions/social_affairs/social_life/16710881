Domestic violence in Argentina is a serious problem. Since the 1990s onwards, the Government of Argentina has taken steps to address this problem. Yet, the policies of Argentina have been criticized for being weak, primarily due to focusing on civil, rather than criminal dealing with this form of violence, and for stressing conciliation between the victim and perpetrator. The policy dealing with domestic violence has also been made more difficult due to the decentralized nature of the country: Argentina, being a decentralized federal state with 23 provinces, has led to significant variation between provincial policies on domestic violence, with women across the country, having differing levels of protection.
