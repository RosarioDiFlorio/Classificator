COLAGE (originally abbreviated from Children of Lesbians and Gays Everywhere) is an organization created in 1990 by the children of several lesbian and gay male couples who felt a need for support.
COLAGE is run and operated by people of all ages who have a LGBTQ parent or parents. Older Colagers mentor younger members, preparing them for challenges that a child may face having same-sex parents. Every summer COLAGE comes to Family Pride annual Family Week in Provincetown on Cape Cod. There, hundreds of gay families attend COLAGE meetings and workshops.
COLAGE is currently a virtual organization and has a small paid staff. Its executive director is Annie Van Avery who has a gay father and a lesbian mother. The national program coordinator is Robin Marquis who was raised by her lesbian mom and bisexual mom with the help of her two gay dads.
