Peggy Vaughan (1936 â€“ November 8, 2012), became well known in 1980, when she and her husband, James Vaughan, publicly shared their story of overcoming infidelity on the American Phil Donahue Show and in the book, "Beyond Affairs." Over the next 30 years, Vaughan became known "as an internationally recognized expert in the area of extramarital affairs." Public reaction led Vaughan to create the Beyond Affairs Network "to help others whose marriages were impacted by infidelity."
In 1989, Vaughan published "The Monogamy Myth," which challenged many of the prevailing attitudes and assumptions about the issue of extramarital affairs with the goal of "helping people be better prepared to either prevent affairs or to recover if it happens." A follow-up edition was published in 2003 with the subtitle "A Personal Handbook for Recovering from Affairs."
In addition to multiple appearances on The Phil Donahue Show, Vaughan frequently appeared in the national media as an expert on infidelity, including on Oprah, Montel Williams, CNN, CBS's 48 Hours, and Fox News.
Beginning in 1991, Vaughan and her husband began conducting public seminars for individuals and couples on "recovering from affairs," later organizing the handouts from those seminars into a handbook for couples. In 1992, the Vaughans wrote "Making Love Stay," which shared their insights about long-term relationships.
In a 1999 keynote at the Smart Marriages conference, Vaughan shared her perspective on rebuilding marriage after an affair:

Answer all questions and hang in through the inevitable emotional turmoil.
Sever contact with the third party and build trust through actions, not promises.
Make a commitment to honesty and ongoing honest communication.
Accept the fact that monogamy is an issue that's never settled "once and for all."

After a four-year battle with cancer, Vaughan died at her home in La Jolla, California on November 8, 2012. Upon her death, many of her writings were donated to the public.
