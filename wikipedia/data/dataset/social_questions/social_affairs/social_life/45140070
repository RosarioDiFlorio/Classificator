“We Are Limitless” is a registered 501c3 charity dedicated to moving Rwandan orphans into boarding schools, finding and funding suitable homes, and offering unique opportunities to help bring joy and hope to in-need children. Recently the group has begun working with orphans and victims of sexual violence in The Democratic Republic of Congo.
The organization was founded by filmmaker Matthew Leutwyler after he returned from a trip to Rwanda where he volunteered teaching math and English at the Noel Orphanage in Gisenyi, Rwanda.
