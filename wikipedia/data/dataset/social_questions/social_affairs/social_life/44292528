Same-sex intimacy refers to a relationship between two friends of the same sex that has many components of a sexually intimate relationship (e.g. self-disclosures, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical contact and trust), but not necessarily sexual intimacy or sexual contact. The term can apply to the exploration of sexuality outside the home, as well as to the physical activities shared between two friends. Contemporary applications include the "bromance" culture, referring intimate bonds formed between male friends in films such as I Love You, Man, as well as the familial bonds exhibited by close female friends, propagated in the mainstream media by television shows such as Sex and the City.
