The Family Court (Ireland) is a division of the District, Circuit and High Courts that deals with family law matters in Ireland. In principle all hearings are in camera and reporting is anonymous, restricted and issued quarterly by a single journalist. The following matters are covered by the Family Court:
Judicial Separation including maintenance and custody
Divorce
Nullity
Relief following a foreign divorce or separation outside the jurisdiction
Declaration of Marital Status
Determination of property disputes
Remedies against the estate of a deceased spouse
Declarations of parentage
Barring Orders and Injunctions
The court has been the subject of criticisms which have led to its procedures being included in the Third Programme for Law Reform, as well as the attempted implementation of new procedures.
