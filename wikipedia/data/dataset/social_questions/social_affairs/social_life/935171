A runaway is a minor or (depending upon the local jurisdiction) a person under an arbitrary age, who has left their parent or legal guardian without permission, or has been dismissed by their parent and is considered by the local authorities to lack the capacity to live under his or her own accord (the latter is sometimes referred to as a throwaway). Statistics show that 75% of runaways are female.
