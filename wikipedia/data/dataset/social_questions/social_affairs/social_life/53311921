Family disruption is a term referring to events which disrupt the structure of individual families. These events include divorce, legal separation, and parental death. Some studies suggest that juveniles who have experienced more family disruptions are at a higher risk of delinquency, drug use, negative personality traits, and depression in adulthood. In contrast, a 2009 Norwegian study reported very little association between family disruption and educational achievement.
