International Purple Hijab Day (sometimes known as Global Hijab Day or International Purple Hijab and Kufi Day) is an international day of remembrance for those who have experienced domestic violence. It is observed on the second Saturday each February. It is most often celebrated by Muslims, with women donning a purple hijab, but anyone may participate by wearing a purple item of clothing on the day such as a scarf, tie or Kufi.
