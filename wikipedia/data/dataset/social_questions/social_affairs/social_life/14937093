Osama bin Laden, a militant Islamist and founder of al Qaeda in 1988, believed Muslims should kill civilians and military personnel from the United States and allied countries until they withdrew support for Israel and withdrew military forces from Islamic countries. He was indicted in United States federal court for his involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, and was on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.
In 1974, at the age of 18, bin Laden married his first wife Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria. Osama bin Laden married at least four other women; he fathered between 20 and 24 children.
