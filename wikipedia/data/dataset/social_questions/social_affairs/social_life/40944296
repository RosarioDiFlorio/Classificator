Social Mirror Theory (SMT) states that people are not capable of self-reflection without taking into consideration a peer’s interpretation of the experience. In other words, people define and resolve their internal musings through other’s viewpoint. SMT's background is derived from the 1800s from concepts related to the study of public opinion and social interaction by Wilhelm Dilthey, the German philosopher and sociologist.
SMT suggests that people, in general, are not capable of self-reflection without taking into consideration a peer’s interpretation of the experience. Burgoon and Hale (1984) conceptualized relational communication as the verbal and nonverbal themes present in people's communication that define an interpersonal relationship.
