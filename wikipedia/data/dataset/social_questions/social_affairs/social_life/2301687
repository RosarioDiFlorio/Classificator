Repossession is a term used to describe when
an actual owner takes back from the borrower an object that was rented or leased, or was borrowed, either with or without compensation, or
when a lienholder takes possession of an item from its registered owner that was used as collateral for a loan.
Repossession, colloquially known as "repo" for short, is a "self-help" type of action in which the party having right of ownership of the property in question takes the property back from the party having right of possession without invoking court proceedings. The property may then be sold by either the financial institution or third party sellers. The extent to which repossession is authorized, and how it may be executed, greatly varies in different jurisdictions (see below).
When a lender cannot find the collateral, cannot peacefully obtain it through self-help repossession, or the jurisdiction does not allow self-help repossession, the alternative legal remedy to order the borrower to return the goods (prior to judgment) is replevin.
The security interest over the collateral is often known as a lien. The lender/creditor is known as the lienholder.
