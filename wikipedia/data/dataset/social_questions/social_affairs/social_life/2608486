Childproofing (also called Baby Proofing) is the act of making an environment or object safer for children. The act of childproofing reduces risks to a level considered acceptable by a society, an institution, or, for example, to specific parents. Childproofing may include restriction of children to safe areas or preventing children from reaching unsafe areas. This can be accomplished by the parent, or by hiring a professional for assistance. Childproofing is gaining more prominence now that parents have greater access to information on child injury and a greater variety of products to help prevent it. In fact it has become so top of mind for parents, even hotels and kid-friendly resorts are offering "child-proof" rooms.
