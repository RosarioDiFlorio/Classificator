In psychology, the external image (also alien image, foreign image, public image, third-party image; German: Fremdbild) is the image other people have of a person, i.e., a person's external image is the way they are viewed by other people. It contrasts with a person's self image (German: Selbstbild); how the external image is communicated to a person may affect their self esteem positively or negatively.
