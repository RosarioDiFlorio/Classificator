Empathy-altruism is a form of altruism based on feelings for others.
The social exchange theory states that altruism does not exist unless benefits to the helper outweigh the costs. C. Daniel Batson holds that people help others in need out of genuine concern for the well-being of the other person. The key ingredient to helping is "empathic concern". According to his 'empathy-altruism hypothesis', if someone feels empathy towards another person, they will help them, regardless of what they can gain from it (1991). An alternative hypothesis that exists is 'empathy-joy', which states a person helps because they find pleasure at seeing another person experience relief (2008). When they do not feel empathy, the social exchange theory takes control.
