Encore fellowships are temporary work placement programs designed to help former private sector mid-life careerists transition into encore career work in the social sector. Similar to how a person might apply for an internship with a business prior to applying for a full-time position, this temporary fellowship allows a person to experience non-profit work first-hand without the long-term commitment of a full-time encore career.
