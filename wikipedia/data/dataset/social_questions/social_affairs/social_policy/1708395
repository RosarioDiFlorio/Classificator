Norbert Blüm (born 21 July 1935) is a German politician who was a federal legislator from North Rhine-Westphalia, Chairman of the CDU there (1987–1999), and a minister for labor and social affairs -- the only minister who was all the 16 years of Kohl as Chancellor (Bundeskanzler) in his government.
Born in Rüsselsheim, he trained as a toolmaker at Adam Opel AG in the town. During this time he was a founding member of the local Scout Group within the Deutsche Pfadfinderschaft Sankt Georg. Later he studied German language and literature, history and philosophy.
Especially during his political career, Blüm has been an outspoken critic of the agenda and conduct of Scientology. As a consequence, he has been a target of Scientology advocates who claimed that the organization was a victim of religious discrimination in Germany.
He received the Leipzig Human Rights Award in 2001.
His most known quotation "Die Rente ist sicher" (loosely translated into: "Pensions are secure") is a misquotation. It was a slogan he wielded in 1986 ("Eins ist sicher: Die Rente", "one thing is certain: The pension"). The misquotation became an infamous saying in Germany and has been target of Kabarett and hostile remarks for years. After almost 3 decades, Blüm even took part in it by talking about his infamous quotation in the German TV show Neues aus der Anstalt.
