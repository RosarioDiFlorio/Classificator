Emergency management is the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies—preparedness, response, and recovery—in order to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including disasters. Often interchanged with disaster management, it is not be confused with it. The World Health Organization defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted, and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster. Thus, emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster, which is harder to recover from.
