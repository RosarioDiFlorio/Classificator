Elterngeld (translated literally from German as parents' money), is a tax-financed payment for couples which pays an amount of money to support the costs of bringing up a child. Elterngeld schemes exists in Germany, France, and Scandinavia.
It generally does not provide full support of the costs of bringing up a child. It is only provided for a limited period, ranging from until one year after birth until 18 years of age in Norway. The amount of Elterngeld granted depends in some places on the income of the parents.
