Solidarity action (also known as secondary action, a secondary boycott, or a sympathy strike) is industrial action by a trade union in support of a strike initiated by workers in another, separate enterprise. The term "secondary action" is often used with the intention of distinguishing different types of trade dispute with a worker's direct employer. Thus, it may be used to refer to a dispute with the employer's parent company, its suppliers, financiers, contracting parties, or any other employer in another industry.
In most countries, there are limits on the purposes for which people may go on strike, and in many English-speaking nations, restrictions have been placed against which organizations trade unions may strike.
British and American workers can strike usually only against their direct employer. In Continental Europe, solidarity action is generally lawful, and the right to strike is seen as a part of broader political freedom.
