The Confederation of German Employers' Associations or BDA (German: Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverb√§nde) is the umbrella organization for German employers' associations. It represents interest groups in the areas of industry, the tertiary sector, banking, commerce, transport, trade and agriculture. In 1977, the head of the BDA, Hanns Martin Schleyer, was murdered by the Red Army Faction, a far-left German militant group.
The seat of the BDA is in Berlin (until 1999: Cologne).
