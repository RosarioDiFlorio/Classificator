Manual handling of loads (MHL), manual material handling (MMH) involves the use of the human body to lift, lower, fill, empty, or carry loads. The load can be animate (a person or animal) or inanimate (an object). Most manufacturing or distribution systems require some manual handling tasks. Though decreasing lately, the rate of workers in the EU-25 that report carrying or moving heavy loads, is still high (34.5%), reaching 38.0% in the EU-10. When performed incorrectly or excessively, these tasks may expose workers to physical risk factors, fatigue, and injury. A variety of MMH techniques and tools exist to alleviate these potential problems. In the UK all organisations have a duty to protect employees from injury from manual handling activities and this is outlined in The Manual Handling Operations (MHO) Regulations 1992.
