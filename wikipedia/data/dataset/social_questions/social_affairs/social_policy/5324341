The Barrier Industrial Council is the trades and labour council for the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. It was formed in 1923 by eighteen unions and grew to be one of the most influential forces in the politics of the city of Broken Hill in the late twentieth century. It also owns Broken Hill's only newspaper, the "Barrier Daily Truth".
