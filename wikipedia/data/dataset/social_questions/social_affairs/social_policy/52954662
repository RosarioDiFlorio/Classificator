A company code of conduct is a document written up voluntarily by a company in which sets out a set of principles that it commits itself to follow. In some cases, codes of conduct reach suppliers, subcontractors and third parties.
The company code of conduct appeared in the 1970s but in the course of the 1990s process that multinational corporations (MNE) generally began to create and disseminate to the public many codes of conduct to those who undertake to adjust their activities.
It is about a phenomenon with regards to MNEs and their relationship with workers, society and the environment. They have also generated extensive debates about the conditions of their validity and their control, which in turn has led to the creation of "multinational enterprise observatories"
A company code of conduct is related to the International Framework Agreements (sometimes also called bilateral codes of conduct) that a coupe of MNEs have signed with World Trade Unions, as well as with the multilateral codes of conduct that have been signed by companies with trade unions, NGOs, environmental organizations, consumer organizations, etc.
