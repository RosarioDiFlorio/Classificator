Éamon Ó Cuív (Irish pronunciation: [ˈeːmˠənˠ oː ˈkiːvʲ]; born 23 June 1950) is an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway West constituency since the 1992 general election. He previously served as Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil from 2011 to 2012, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Minister for Defence January 2011 to March 2011, Minister for Social Protection from 2010 to 2011, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs from 2002 to 2010, Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands from 2001 to 2002 and Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development from 1997 to 2002. He served as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1989 to 1992.
He unsuccessfully contested the leadership of Fianna Fáil after the resignation of Brian Cowen, but lost to Micheál Martin. Martin appointed Ó Cuív Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil after Brian Lenihan, Jnr's death. However, Ó Cuív ceased to be Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil on 29 February 2012 because of his opposition to his party's stance on the European Fiscal Compact.
