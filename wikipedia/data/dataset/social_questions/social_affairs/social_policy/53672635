2017 social unrest in French Guiana is a series of protests and strikes led by the "Collective of 500 Brothers" to highlight the issues of insecurity and infrastructure in French Guiana, France. It began on March 20, 2017 in Kourou, and spread all over French Guiana within a few days. Several international rocket and satellite launches were postponed, and March 28 saw the largest demonstration ever held in French Guiana. The protesters asked for more resources, but turned down a government pledge of â‚¬1 billion in infrastructure. Labor union leaders and three local politicians occupied the Guiana Space Centre on April 4-5, 2017. Supermarkets no longer sold fresh products due to road blocks in April 2017. The strikes became an issue in the 2017 French presidential election.
