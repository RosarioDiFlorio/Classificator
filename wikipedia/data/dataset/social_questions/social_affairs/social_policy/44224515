The Muslim Community Reference Group (MCRG) was an advisory body to the Australian federal government, set up by the Howard Government, from mid-2005 to mid-2006. The board served to provide the federal government with proposals on strategies and practices to help integrate the Muslim community and to foster greater understanding towards Muslims among the general society, public institutions and governmental bodies.
