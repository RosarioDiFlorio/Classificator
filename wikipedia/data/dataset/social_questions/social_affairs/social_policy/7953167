Hot work is a process that can be a source of ignition when flammable material is present or can be a fire hazard regardless of the presence of flammable material in the workplace. Common hot work processes involve welding, soldering, cutting, brazing burning and the use of powder-actuated tools or similar fire producing operations outside of designated hot work areas. When flammable materials are present, industrial processes such as grinding and drilling become cold work processes.
In some countries, such as the UK and Canada, a hot work permit is required for hot work.
