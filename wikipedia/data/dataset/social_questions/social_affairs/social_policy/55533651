France’s 35 hour workweek is apart of a labor reform that was adopted in two phases with the ‘Aubry 1’ law in June 1998, and the ‘Aubry 2’ law in January 2000. This reforms were made under the Socialist Party led by Prime MInister Lionel Jospin's whose priority was to lower the unemployment rate that was at a record high of 12.5%. The goal was to induce job creation by work sharing. The previous legal duration of the working week was 39 hours, which had been established by François Mitterrand. The 35-hour working week was in the Socialist Party's 1981 electoral program, titled 110 Propositions for France, but was not pursued because of a poor economic state.
