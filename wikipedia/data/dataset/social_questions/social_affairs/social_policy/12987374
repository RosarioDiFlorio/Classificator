Incapacity Benefit is a British social security benefit that was introduced in 1995 and phased out after parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act of 2007.
Incapacity Benefit and its forerunner were paid to more than two million people having difficulty finding work because of an illness or a disability. Between 2011 and 2016 a compulsory reassessment programme moved the bulk of these long-term recipients onto Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). As a result, fewer than 3000 working-age adults were being paid full Incapacity Benefit by May 2017 (another 70,000 were receiving National Insurance credits only).
By rooting out weak claims and encouraging people with moderate disabilities to find suitable jobs, the reassessment of sickness benefit claimants and their movement onto the more conditional ESA was supposed to have saved seven billion pounds a year from the welfare budget by 2016. In practice, this major Whitehall project failed to generate any savings for the Exchequer.
