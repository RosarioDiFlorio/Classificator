Sexual harassment in the workplace has been considered a form of discrimination on the basis of sex in the United States since the mid 1970s.
United states law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment:
Quid pro quo sexual harassment: an employee is required to tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for employment, a raise or job benefit, or promotion.
Hostile work environment: sexual harassment in the workplace results in an offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes an employee's work performance.
