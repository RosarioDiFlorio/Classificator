The Victorian Trades Hall Council is a representative body of trade union organisations, known as a Labour council, in the State of Victoria, Australia. It comprises 60 affiliated trade unions and professional associations, and eight regional Trades and Labour Councils of Victoria.
The eight regional Trades and Labour Councils are Ballarat Regional Trades & Labour Council, Bendigo Trades Hall Council, Geelong Trades Hall Council, Gippsland Trades & Labour Council Inc., Goulburn Valley Trades & Labour Council, Sunraysia Trades & Labour Council Inc., North-East Border Trades & Labour Council and South-West Trades & Labour Council. The Victorian Trades Hall Council is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
Affiliation to the Victorian Trades Hall Council is open to any industrial organisation of employees (most commonly called a trade union) with at least 20 financial members. Delegates from affiliated organisations are elected to meet as the Victorian Trades Hall Council. There is an annual conference which sets policy, with monthly Council meetings, and an Executive which meets more often to administer the affairs between council meetings, particularly matters of an urgent nature.
