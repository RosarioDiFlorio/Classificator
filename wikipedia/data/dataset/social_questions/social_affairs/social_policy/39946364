Jai Andhra movement is a 1972 political movement in support for the creation of Andhra state in the light of injustices felt by the people of the Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema Regions. This was after the HC and SC upheld the Mulki rules in existence at the time. This disenfranchised a vast majority of the population of the state from obtaining jobs in their own state capital. In ensuing protests and police firing eight people were killed. Prominent leaders from Coastal Andhra: Tenneti Viswanadham , RajaSagi Suryanarayana Raju, Gouthu Latchanna, Jupudi Yegnanarayana, N. Srinivasulu Reddy, B. V. Subba Reddy, Kakani Venkataratnam, Vasantha Nageswara Rao, M. Venkaiah Naidu, prominent student leader from Andhra University, and many others participated in the agitation. It was a sequel to the 1969 Telangana movement. Over 400 people sacrificed their lives for the movement. One of the main opinions expressed was "Development is seen only in and around Hyderabad and it is time the coastal districts also develop rapidly".
