Mr. Ouch is a hazard symbol developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) to represent electrical hazards. Unlike other high-voltage warning symbols, Mr. Ouch was specifically designed with young children in mind.
Mr. Ouch is similar in name, purpose, and appearance to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC's "Mr. Yuk" design used to label poisonous substances, although the two symbols were developed independently.
