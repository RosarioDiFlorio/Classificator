Labor unrest is strike action or industrial action undertaken by labor unions, especially where labor disputes become violent. Such a conception of labor action was common in the United States in the 19th century, most prominently among mining interests in the American West, and remained common in the 20th century among totalitarian states, such as the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China.
