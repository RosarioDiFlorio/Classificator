The City Protocol is a new open, global, and progressive working framework for cities worldwide to assess and improve performance in environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, quality of life, and city services, by innovating and demonstrating new leadership models, new ways of engaging society, and by leveraging new information and communication technologies (ICT).
Many initiatives exist today on various indicators (quality, performance and life) and on normalization of trade. The City Protocol addresses the city under a systemic approach. Cities can usefully be described as complex systems since their components interact and co-determine their future. Thus, urban planning is limited by the very nature of their complexity. The city has a metabolism and a rich ecosystem, itâ€™s very heterogeneous. Like any complex system, it changes over time, it evolves, it is fragile and must adapt to changes. Resilience is the key to also ensure continuity of services in the city at any time of crisis. Two major vectors through the development of the city, the need, its uses and functions, and chance, hazard and risk. The city should be adaptive, learning, evolving, robust, autonomous, self-repairing, and self-reproducing.
