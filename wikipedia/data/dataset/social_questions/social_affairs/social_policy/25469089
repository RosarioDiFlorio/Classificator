The Saltsjöbaden Agreement (Swedish: Saltsjöbadsavtalet) is a Swedish labour market treaty signed between the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Swedish: Landsorganisationen) and the Swedish Employers Association (Swedish: Svenska arbetsgivareföreningen) on 20 December 1938, that became a model for other agreements. The rules on industrial action has come to be regarded almost as general legal principles of conflicts between the labor market forces. The agreement cemented the Swedish social norm that the two sides shall conclude agreements without interference by government. The agreement is still in effect, with the latest changes being made in 1976.
In 2007, the LO, the Council for Negotiation and Co-operation (sv. Privattjänstemannakartellen, PTK) and the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (a successor organisation to the Swedish Employers Association) began negotiations towards a new agreement at the initiative of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise. The negotiations, however, were suspended in March 2009.
