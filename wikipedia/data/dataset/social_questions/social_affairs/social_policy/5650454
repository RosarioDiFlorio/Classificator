The Montevideo Resolution, officially Resolution IV.4.422-4224, is a resolution passed in Montevideo, Uruguay on December 10, 1954 by the General Conference of UNESCO. The resolution officially supports Esperanto, an international auxiliary language, and recommended that the Director-General of UNESCO follow current developments in the use of the language. In 1977, the Director-General visited the World Esperanto Congress in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and, in 1985, UNESCO passed a further resolution recommending that member countries encourage the teaching of Esperanto. The Montevideo Resolution was the result of a long campaign by Ivo Lapenna.
