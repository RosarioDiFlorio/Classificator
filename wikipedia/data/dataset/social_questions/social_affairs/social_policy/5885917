Shop stewards are representatives of labour unions. Unlike other union representatives, stewards work on the shop floor, connecting workers with union officials at regional or national levels.
The role of shop stewards may vary from being a mere representative of a larger national union towards independent structures with the power of collective bargaining on the workplace.
Both in Germany and Britain shop stewards were crucial in antiwar protests during World War I. In Germany a network of shop stewards called Revolutionary Stewards took an important role in the revolutionary events of November 9 in Berlin.
