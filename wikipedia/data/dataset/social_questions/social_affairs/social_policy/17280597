Reassignment centers are holding facilities for the New York City Department of Education, where more than 600 teachers accused of misconduct have been paid to work full-time doing nothing for months or years at a time while awaiting resolution of their cases. Among teachers they are referred to as rubber rooms. The city has 13 reassignment centers.
In The Rubber Room, it is also claimed that the city's teacher union, the United Federation of Teachers, neglects to provide proper representation to teachers assigned to reassignment centers. Exonerated teachers often become absent teacher reserve teachers.
