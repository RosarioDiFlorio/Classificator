A stadium subsidy is a type of government subsidy given to professional sports franchises to help finance the construction or renovation of sports venues. Stadium subsidies can come in the form of tax-free municipal bonds, cash payments, infrastructure improvements and operating cost subsidies. Funding for stadium subsidies can come from all levels of government and remains controversial among legislators and citizens.
