The Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Production (Spanish: Federación de Cámaras y Asociaciones de Comercio y Producción de Venezuela) or Fedecámaras is Venezuela’s main business union. It is formed by businesses that represent all economic sectors of the country.
Fedecámaras is composed of chambers of commerce (cámara in Spanish) in fourteen basic trade groups: banking, agriculture, commerce, construction, energy, manufacturing, media, mining, ranching, insurance, transportation, tourism, real estate and telecommunications. Additionally, 18 regional Fedecámaras chapters complete the organisation. Fedecámaras represents small, medium and large size companies.
Fedecámaras’ mission is to strengthen Venezuela’s business system on the base of the principles of democracy and economic liberty. In practice this means acting as a concerting organism of Venezuela’s main policies (investment, development, employment, inflation, wages, interest rates, among other policy sectors) together with the government and other unions operating in the country. It’s principal values are liberty, democracy, private property, professionalism and leadership.
This organization was at political odds with former Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez. During a failed coup d'état against him in April 2002, former Fedecámaras president Pedro Carmona assumed the role of interim de facto president of Venezuela for two days.
