In English peon (), from the Spanish peón [peˈon]) usually refers to a person subject to peonage: any form of unfree labour or wage labor in which a laborer (peon) has little control over employment conditions. In this sense, peon and peonage are, strictly speaking, used accurately only of the colonial period in Latin America and other countries colonized by Spain. However, the word peon has a variety of related, less formal uses.
