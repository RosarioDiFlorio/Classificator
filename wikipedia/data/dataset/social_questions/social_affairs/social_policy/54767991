The General State Administration is one of the Public Administrations of Spain. It is the only administration with powers throughout the national territory and it is controlled by the central government.
It is integrated by:
Central Organization (Government, Council of Ministers, Government Delegated Commissions, Ministries, General Commission of Secretaries of State and Undersecretaries and Interministerial Commissions).
Peripheral Organization (Delegations of the Government in the Autonomous Communities, the Subdelegates of the Government in the Provinces and the Insular Directors of the General State Administration).
State Administration Abroad (Embassies and consulates)
Its legal regime is set out in article 103 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and Law 6/1997 of April 14, about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration, which establishes that the General State Administration, under the direction of the Government and with full submission to the Law, objectively serves the general interests, developing executive functions of an administrative nature. On October 1, 2016, the Law 6/1997 was repealed upon the entry into force of Law 40/2015.
