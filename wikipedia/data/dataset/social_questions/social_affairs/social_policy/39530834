The Battle of the Viaduct was an event that took place in Chicago due to a much larger and more prolific event, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The strike began on July 14, 1877 in Virginia, during a time of great economic woe throughout the country, thus it quickly gained momentum, eventually becoming the first national strike in United States' History. The city of Chicago was quickly affected by the strike. Being one of the most heavily populated cities in America at the time, crowds gathered in extreme numbers to partake in the upheaval. One specific area, the Halsted Street viaduct, saw a huge number of people gather and protest. They began to get violent, and in return they were met by fierce retaliation from the authorities. The conflict that ensued between the two sides quickly turned bloody, and the event that took place became known as the Battle of the Viaduct.
