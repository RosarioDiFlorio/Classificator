Articles 4 and 114 of the Constitution of Latvia form the foundation for language policy in Latvia, declaring Latvian to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. Latgalian and the Livonian language, in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including Russian (the first language for more than one third of the population). Other significant minority foreign languages include Belarusian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Romani.
The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."
