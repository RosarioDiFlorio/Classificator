An unfair labor practice (不当労働行為, futouroudoukoui) is discrimination by an employer in Japan against a worker who is associated with a union, or refusal by an employer to negotiate with a trade union, or interference in the activities of a union. Unfair labor practices are defined under Article 7 of the 1949 Trade Union Law (労働組合法, roudou-kumiaihou). They are ruled on by Labor Relations Commissions.
