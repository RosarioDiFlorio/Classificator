The Federation of International Employers / La Federaci√≥n de Empresarios Internacionales (formerly The Federation of European Employers) was established in 1988 with the support of the European Commission. Today it operates independently and is the leading organisation for multinational employers and is also known as FedEE Global.
The Federation's principal aims are to assist companies to achieve legal compliance, operate more effectively at an international level, improve transnational HR capabilities, network with other international executives, develop practical/equitable pay structures, evaluate new employment methods and trends, monitor employee participation and trade union activities and embrace workforce diversity.
