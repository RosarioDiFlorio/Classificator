Dry cleaning is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent other than water. It is used to clean fabrics that degrade in water, and delicate fabrics that cannot withstand the rough and tumble of a washing machine and clothes dryer. It can eliminate labor-intensive hand washing.
Unlike what its name implies, dry cleaning is not a 'dry' process. Clothes are soaked in a solvent other than water. Tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene), which the industry calls "perc," is the most widely used solvent. Alternative solvents are trichloroethane and petroleum spirits.
