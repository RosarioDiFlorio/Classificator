Bandh is a form of protest used by political activists in South Asian countries such as India and Nepal. It is similar to a general strike. During a bandh, a political party or a community declares a general strike. A Bharatha bandh is a call for a bandh across India, and a bandh can also be called for an individual state or municipality.
The community or political party declaring a bandh expects the general public to stay at home and not report for work. Most affected are shopkeepers, who are expected to keep their shops closed, as well as public transport operators of buses and cabs who are expected to stay off the road and not carry passengers. There have been instances when large metropolitan cities have been brought to a standstill.
A bandh is a powerful means of civil disobedience, and because of its huge impact on the local community, it is a much-feared tool of protest.
Burglary, forced closures, arson attacks, stoning, and clashes between the bandh organizers and the police are common during the period of closure.
