A worker director or employee-elected director is a member of a company's board of directors that is elected by the workforce of an organisation. Employees have a right by law to appoint directors to companies in most European Union member states. In the United States, trade unions have negotiated collective agreements, typically linked to employee stock ownership plans, to appoint board members.
