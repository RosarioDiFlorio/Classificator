The Thai Children’s Trust, formerly Pattaya Orphanage Trust, is a registered charitable organization in the United Kingdom (No 1085407) which supports vulnerable and disadvantaged children in Thailand. It helps fund projects for orphans, refugee children, HIV positive children and children with AIDS, homeless children, tsunami orphans and children and young people with disabilities. The Trust has recently helped support the Teacher Preparation Center, a training school for mobile teacher trainers, in Mae Sot. The TPC trains trainers who work in the Eastern states of Burma/Myanmar, trying to restore and improve educational standards in areas ravaged by years of civil war. The Trust has also found some funding for villageONE, a project combining education and community development which hopes to start work in Mon State, Burma/Myanmar, later this year.
They are reportedly the largest UK charity focusing on Thailand. They send over £700,000 to Thailand’s most vulnerable children, providing a safe and loving home, which includes daily necessities like food, shelter, medical care and education for over 1500 children.
