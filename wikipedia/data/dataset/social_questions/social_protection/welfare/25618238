Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) is a registered charity partially subvented by the government. With no support from the Community Chest, it relies on direct donations and fundraising among the community. All donations are tax exempt.
In 27 centres across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, HKSPC cares for children from newborn to 16-year-olds providing a stimulating environment in which to educate them and nurture their growth and development, and to educate parents on age appropriate parenting.
