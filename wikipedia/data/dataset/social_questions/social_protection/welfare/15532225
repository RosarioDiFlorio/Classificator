"Do you know where your children are?" is a question used as a public service announcement (PSA) for parents on American television especially during the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Two claims have been made to the origin of the phrase: WKBW-TV news anchor Irv Weinstein circa 1964, and Mel Epstein, the Director of On-Air Promotions at New York's WNEW-TV, who began using the phrase in 1967 in response to rising crime in the city.
The question "Do you know where your children are?", preceded by an announcement of the current time, is typically asked around 10:00 PM or 11:00 PM, depending on the market and the time of the local youth curfew, usually immediately preceding the station's late-evening newscast.
As of November 2017, this question is still asked before the beginning of a few 10:00 PM news reports, on Fox station WNYW for example.
The PSA was featured on Time magazine's "Top 10 Public-Service Announcements" list.
