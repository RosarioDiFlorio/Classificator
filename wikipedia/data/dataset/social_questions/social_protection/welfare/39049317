Driven by the prevalence of the Internet and different online forums, such as the Golden Forum, online uncovering becomes a social phenomenon and netizens use it to reveal the personal information of others through the online platform. This leads to the tarnishing of reputation of the victims. Online uncovering is a kind of cyber bullying.
