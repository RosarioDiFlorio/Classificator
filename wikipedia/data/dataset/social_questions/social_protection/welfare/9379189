The Southeast Asia Rural Social Leadership Institute (SEARSOLIN) is one of the outreach units of the Jesuit Xavier University located in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines. It is an international training center dedicated to the formation of socially committed and competent leaders in the struggle for poverty alleviation and holistic human development within the context of diverse cultural and religious traditions in Asia, Pacific and Africa. It aspires for no less than a just social order where respect for human dignity, deference of various religious beliefs, equitable distribution of wealth and care of the bounty of the earth shall prevail.
The training programs are geared towards the understanding of poverty, the process that lead or perpetuate it and adoption of the skills necessary to alleviate it such that in the final analysis, the poor will be primary beneficiaries of the SEARSOLIN programs.
