The Welfare Trait is a non-fiction science book written by King's College London Lecturer in the Neurobiology of Personality, Adam Perkins. It is based on five years of his research on long-term welfare recipients. His research suggests that long-term welfare recipients tend to have an over-representation of individuals with "aggressive, rule-breaking and anti-social tendencies - what he calls the 'employment resistant personality profile.'" Dr. Perkin's also found that these traits tend to also be more common in the children of welfare recipients compared to the general population which could suggest genetic transmission.
