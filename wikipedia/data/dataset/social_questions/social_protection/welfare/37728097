Geertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer (21 April 1896, Alkmaar â€“ 30 August 1978, Amsterdam) was a Dutch war hero, resistance fighter, and probably after Raoul Wallenberg and Aristides de Sousa Mendes the greatest savior of Jews. She was recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In all likelihood, she, together with others involved with Kindertransport, saved more than 10,000 Jewish children.
