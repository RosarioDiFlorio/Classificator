Nearly half of all refugees are children, and almost one in three children living outside their country of birth is a refugee. These numbers encompass children whose refugee status has been formally confirmed, as well as children in refugee-like situations with similar protection concerns. In addition to facing the direct threat of violence resulting from conflict, children forcibly displaced face various health dangers during migration and resettlement, including disease outbreaks and long-term psychological trauma, as well as inadequate access to water and sanitation, nutritious food, and regular vaccination schedules.
Refugee children, particularly those without documentation and those who travel alone, are also vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Although many communities around the world have welcomed them, refugee children and their families often face discrimination, poverty, and social marginalization in their home, transit, and destination countries. Language barriers and legal barriers in transit and destination countries often bar refugee children and their families from accessing education, healthcare, social protection, and other services. Many countries of destination also lack intercultural supports and policies for social integration. Such threats to safety and well-being are amplified for refugee children with disabilities.
