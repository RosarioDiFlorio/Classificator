The Online Hate Prevention Institute is a harm prevention charity established in 2012 based in Australia.
The organisation began with focusing on combating online forms of anti-semitism in a joint project with the Zionist Federation of Australia before deciding to expand their focus to include other forms of online hatred. 
The Online Hate Prevention Institute is recognised by the Australian federal government as a Harm Prevention Charity and is listed on the Harm Prevention register by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. 
On July 10, 2014 Andre Oboler of the Online Hate Prevention Institute accused Facebook of refusing to enforce its own Community Standards by allowing hate speech to remain online, stating that content is removed in the country where the report originated only and is still visible to others when view overseas. 
The Online Hate Prevention Institute developed a web based application titled Fight Against Hate to track response times by social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in responding to reports of hate speech.
