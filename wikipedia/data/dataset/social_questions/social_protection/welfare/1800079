In psychiatry, the term dippoldism (German: dippoldismus) is used to refer to the spanking (or other corporal punishment) of minors for sexual motives.
Dippoldism is the paraphilia of sexual arousal from spanking or otherwise applying corporal punishment to children. It is named after Andreas Dippold, a German schoolteacher who, in 1903, beat his pupil Heinz Koch to death.
