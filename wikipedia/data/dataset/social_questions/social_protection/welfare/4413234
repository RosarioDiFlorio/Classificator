Occupational Classification, or NOC, is a systematic taxonomy in English of all occupations in the Canadian labour market. As a Canadian government publication it is concurrently published in French as Classification nationale des professions. Organized into two volumes, it describes 923 distinct occupations in terms of aptitudes, interests, education, physical activities, and other qualifiers. A separate index further classifies over 25,000 job titles from the listed occupations.
The NOC is used by program planners, labour economists, rehabilitation professionals, and others in the health and social services fields in Canada, as well as by insurance companies and litigators. It is published by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), which is the Department of the Government of Canada which supports public policies for labour market, social development, early childhood and post secondary education. The first Edition of the NOC was published in 1992, and a Second Revised Edition was offered in 2001. A minor revision was made in 2006. It is available in printed form, on CD-ROM, and on-line. A 2011 version is in development and is expected to be published in 2016.
The NOC supersedes the Canadian Classification Dictionary of Occupations (CCDO), which was published by HRSDC in 1981. .
A variation of the NOC, known as NOC-S or National Occupational Classification for Statistics, is maintained by Statistics Canada. According to the NOC-S website, "The two classifications [NOC & NOC-S] differ only in the aggregation structure of the classification." The first use of the NOC-S 2001 was in the 2001 Census of Population.
The NOC is one of the main data sources that supports the Working in Canada Tool which is part of the Government of Canada's Going to Canada - Immigration Portal.
