Split custody refers to a custody arrangement in which the children are essentially split up, with some of the children living with one parent, and some of the children living more with the other parent. Split custody is generally chosen because it creates a situation in which children do not have to constantly travel back and forth between their parent's homes and it creates a situation in which siblings that do not get along can be separated.
