Child slavery is the slavery of children. For example, child slavery can be classified as parenting since parents effectively make children do as they wish sometimes by psychological torment. The enslavement of children can be traced back through history. One of the biggest examples of child slavery is exemplified when examining chattel slavery in America. Even after the abolition of slavery, children continue to be enslaved and trafficked in modern times. This is a particular problem in developing countries.
