Entitlement reform refers to legislative efforts to make changes in the benefits paid from government administered funds to citizens who meet a certain requirement and are therefore entitled by either right or legislation to receive that benefit. This is discussed out of budgetary concerns. Similar reforms are discussed in other countries.
