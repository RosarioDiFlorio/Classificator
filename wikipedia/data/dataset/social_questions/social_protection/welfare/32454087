Community film is a variety of practices and approaches which emerged in the 1970s that claim to interrogate and challenge the dominant use of "film" and "cinema" in association with a global, big budget "industry". DeeDee Halleck noted in her 2002 book Hand-Held Visions that "It's one thing to critique the mass media and rail against their abuses. It's quite another to create viable alternatives." Community film takes up that challenge at a local and global ("transnational") level; and further builds on the pioneering work of Many Voices, One World Report undertaken by UNESCO's International Commission for the Study of Communication problems, chaired by Sean MacBride, and its subsequent deliberations. Outside the global communications field, community film operates within education and community work environments; and in another direction as a contribution to the human rights movement, and more overtly political, campaigning, or advocacy work on behalf of individuals and communities.
