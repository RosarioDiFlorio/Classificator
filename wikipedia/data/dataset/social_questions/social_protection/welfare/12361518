Student financial aid in Finland consists of government payments (through Kela) that provide economic security to students and enable all students to study. Almost all Finnish students receive financial aid, including foreigners who are permanent residents or EU citizens. It is available in the form of:
a study grant
a government-backed student loan
a housing supplement (starting 1 August 2017, available only to those who are studying abroad or enrolled in a tuition-based programme at a folk high school or sports institute and living in the school dormitory).students are egilible for general housing benefits 

The qualifying conditions for student financial aid are:
admission to a school
full-time study
academic progress
need of financial assistance.
They are a kind of transfer payment. Similar systems, some of which are older, exist in some other countries where education is free of charge, e.g. Germany and Sweden. Student benefit is paid by the state to all qualifying students, excluding only those with full-time employment and income, and is thus distinct from an individually evaluated scholarship.
In addition, Finnish students enjoy several kinds of student benefits such as:
Partially state-funded meals at student cafeterias.
