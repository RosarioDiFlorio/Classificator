Military use of schools is a term used to refer to the various activities that national armed forces and non-state armed groups carry out in and around schools, universities, and other education facilities, in support of their military effort. Examples of this include using a school or a university as barracks or bases, for offensive or defensive deployments, for storage of weapons or ammunition, for military training of soldiers, as observation posts, and as a detention facility.
The United Nations Security Council has encouraged all "Member States to take concrete measures to deter such use of schools by armed forces and armed groups."
According to the UN Secretary-General: "The use of schools for military purposes puts children at risk of attack and hampers childrenâ€™s right to education... Such use of schools not only results in reduced enrolment and high drop out rates, especially among girls, but also may lead to schools being considered legitimate targets for attack."
