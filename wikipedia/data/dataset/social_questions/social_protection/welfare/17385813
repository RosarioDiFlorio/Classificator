The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) is responsible for investigating charges of abuse, neglect or exploitation of children, elderly adults and adults with disabilities. Prior to its creation in 2004, the agency had been called the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services (DPRS).
According to the Texas Attorney General, DFPS is neither a juvenile nor an adult criminal justice agency. The Texas Juvenile Justice Department is the state juvenile justice agency, while the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is the adult justice agency.
The agency is headquartered at the John H. Winters Human Services Center at 701 West 51st Street in Austin.
