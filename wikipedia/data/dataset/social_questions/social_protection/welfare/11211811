Second Harvest Toronto is a food rescue and redistribution charitable organization that strives to decrease hunger in the city of Toronto. The organization is based on the principle that fresh and prepared food should not be going to waste while in the same city people are hungry. As of 2010, Second Harvest rescues food from 600 food providers in the Greater Toronto Area including restaurants, grocery stores, and food warehouses. The organization delivers food using a fleet of eight refrigerated trucks that deliver the food to 200-plus  social service agencies in Toronto, including soup kitchens, women’s shelters, children’s programs, and drop-in centers. Food is re-distributed within 24 hours, and most often the same day. Second Harvest organizes several special events each year, the largest of which are Toronto Taste and Second Harvest Hero Day (formerly called "Lunch Money Day") each year to add to their fund-raising base.
