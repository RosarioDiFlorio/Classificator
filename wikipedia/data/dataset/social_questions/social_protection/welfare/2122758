The Malki Foundation (Hebrew: Keren Malki) is an Israeli charity organization based in Jerusalem that supports families of children with disabilities. It was founded in 2001 by the family of Malka Chana (Malki) Roth, who was killed at the age of 15 in the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing. The foundation exists as a memorial to her life.
Most families with disabled children have a difficult time finding equipment and services outside of an institution. The foundation's assistance allows families to keep their child at home with other siblings and the parents. All services and equipment are provided at no cost to the families. People of all religions and backgrounds are eligible for assistance.
