JPC de Sprengen is a penitentiary facility for boys (Juridisch Pedagogisch Centrum, Juridic Pedagogic Center) located in Wapenveld and Zutphen in the Netherlands. The facilities offer treatment as well as shelter or imprisonment.
The two locations have a total capacity for 150 youth aged 12 to 24 years old. Placement in De Sprengen can be done as punishment for a committed crime or as a measure to protect a boy before he commits crimes. The facility is run by the Dutch Ministry of Justice.
De Sprengen services all provinces in the country but in the future they will concentrate on clients from Gelderland, where both sites are located. De Sprengen wants to develop itself as a centre specialized in treating boys from the region with major behavioral problems. In order to attain this goal, JPC De Sprengen works closely and collaborates with other justice facilities, schools and youth organisations.
