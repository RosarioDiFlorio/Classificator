Cybertip.ca is Canada's official tipline for reporting the online sexual exploitation of children. The tipline is owned and operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, a charitable organization. Cybertip.ca accepts and addresses online and telephone reports from the public regarding child pornography (child abuse images and material), online luring, children exploited through prostitution, travelling to sexually exploited children, and child trafficking.
Cybertip.ca was launched as a national tipline with support from the Government of Canada in January 2005. Staff examine reports from the public and forward those that are deemed potentially illegal to law enforcement in the appropriate jurisdiction. Cybertip.ca contributes to public education and prevention through its online safety strategies and national awareness campaigns.
Cybertip.ca operates as one of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection's core services. Although the majority of Cybertip.ca's reports are provided online, the public is also able to contact the tipline by phone (1-866-658-9022) or fax (204-948-2177)
Cybertip.ca has received over 40,000 suspected cases from the Canadian public. As the central clearinghouse for online child exploitation, Cybertip.ca maintains a regularly updated list of specific foreign-hosted Internet addresses (URLs) associated with images of child sexual abuse, and provide that list in a secure manner to participating ISPs. Launched in January 2007, Project Cleanfeed Canada is designed to reduce accidental access to child sexual abuse images, as well as create a disincentive for those trying to access or distribute child pornography. Participating Internet Service Providers include Bell, Telus, Shaw, MTS Allstream, Rogers, Vid√©otron, Bell Aliant and SaskTel.
