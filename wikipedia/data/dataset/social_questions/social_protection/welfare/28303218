Commonly referred to as the "Guardianship Convention", the Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors, along with the other Conventions in 1902, was the Hague Conference's first effort at addressing international family law. Within a few decades it was the only family law Convention to retain any currency. It was also the only family law treaty that was expressly preserved and revived in the Treaty of Versailles and other post World War I peace treaties. The Guardianship Convention was written only in French and, with the Boll case, is the only Convention of the Hague Conference to ever be the principal subject of interpretation before a court with worldwide jurisdiction.
