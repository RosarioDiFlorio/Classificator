The Social Service Wing of the Jamaat coordinates with various NGOs in India under the umbrella of the Human Welfare Trust (HWT) like the Ideal Relief Wing (IRW), Islamic Relief Committee (IRC) and Tamil Nadu Relief Committee (TNRC). The IRW was an active participant in the rescue efforts during the Kashmir earthquake spending almost $200,000 for the relief work and also played important roles in the relief efforts in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The TNRC built 38 houses for victims of the Asian tsunami in Tamil Nadu at a total cost of Rs 12.5 million. It also built 160 permanent houses at Nagore, Pudupattinam and Kottakuppam and provided livelihood assistance to hundreds of families in those areas.
