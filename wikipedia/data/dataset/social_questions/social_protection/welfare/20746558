Musikhjälpen (Swedish: [mɵˈsiːkˌjɛlpən]; Music Aid) is the Swedish version of the Dutch Serious Request radio/television campaign. The show is an appeal for money which each year helps a certain cause. Three radio/television personalities are locked inside a glass house for 144 hours, and they broadcast live on Swedish public service radio network Sveriges Radio and on public services television through SVT. People send text messages requesting a song, with each text costing 50, 100, 200, or 500 Swedish kronor.
