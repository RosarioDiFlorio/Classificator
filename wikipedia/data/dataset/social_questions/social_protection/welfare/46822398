Pen's Parade or The Income Parade is a concept described in a 1971 book published by Dutch economist Jan Pen describing income distribution. The parade is defined as a succession of every person in the economy, with their height proportional to their income, and ordered from lowest to greatest. People with average income would be of average height, and so the spectactor. The Pen's description of what the spectator would see is a parade of dwarves, and then some unbelievable giants at the very end.
The original context of the parade is the United Kingdom, and the duration is one hour. The parade is used by economists as a graphical representation of income inequality because it's a form of Quantile function and it is considered useful when comparing two different areas or periods.
