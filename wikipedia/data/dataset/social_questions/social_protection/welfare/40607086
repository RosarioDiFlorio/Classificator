Master in Development Administration or Master of Science in Development Administration (MSDEA) is a post graduate academic degree in Community Development. It is intended to train professionals for careers in public and private development administrations. It aims to provide the scholars with the procedural and specialized skills and capability in translating national development plans and policies into precise programs and projects, planning, implementing, coordinating and managing the same for public equity. The course of education focused on the political as well as the economic scope of development.
The MDA provides professional training for careers with government, non-profit, and international development organizations. Core classes employ the case study method to build skills in program and project analysis. Cases include microfinance, primary health care, small enterprise development, public enterprise reform, agricultural extension, and others from across the developing world.
MDA classes focus on development theories, such as those oriented to government action, economic markets, and popular participation; skills, such as budgeting, human resource management, research and writing, and public speaking; methods, such as cost-benefit analysis, the logical framework, stakeholder analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and institutional analysis; and the history of the development administration field. This field is inherently interdisciplinary, involving concepts from economics, political science, and public administration. While the MDA program is designed primarily as a professional program, instruction is grounded in prominent theories from these disciplines and provides a secure foundation for doctoral studies in the social sciences.
Professionals who undergo this type of academic program may become development specialist, Urban & Regional Development Planners, development researchers, and Community Sustainability managers and community relations officers (especially in mining corporations where mining operations take place.)
The Program prepares individuals to be creative, innovative and entrepreneurial administrators of the various levels and agencies of government, non-government, and international organizations.
