Welfare reforms are changes in the operation of a given welfare system. Welfare reforms are often more aligned with neo-liberal policies. In the United States, welfare reform was used to get Congress to enact the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, which further reduced aid to the poor, to reduce government deficit spending without coining money.
