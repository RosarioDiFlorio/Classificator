The term Sixties Scoop refers to the practice, during the 1960s, of taking ("scooping up") children of Aboriginal peoples in Canada from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption. Provincially, each region had their specific adoption or fostering program and policy. For example, Saskatchewan had the Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) Program. The children were typically placed for adoption or fostering in Canada though a few were placed in the United States or western Europe.
The term "Sixties scoop" was coined by Patrick Johnston in his 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. It is a variation on the term "Baby Scoop Era", which refers to the period from the late 1950s to the 1980s when large numbers of children were taken from their parents for adoption. However and henceforth, the continued practice of taking Indigenous, Inuit and Metis children from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption is termed Millennium Scoop
An estimated 20,000 aboriginal children were taken from their families and fostered or adopted out to primarily white middle-class families, some within Canada and some in the US or Western Europe.
This government policy was discontinued in the mid-1980s, after Ontario chiefs passed resolutions against it and a Manitoba judicial inquiry harshly condemned it. This judicial inquiry was headed by Justice Edwin Kimelman, who published the File Review Report. Report of the Review Committee on Indian and MÃ©tis Adoptions and Placements (also known as the Kimelman Report).
Two lawsuits have been filed in Canada by former wards of the Sixties Scoop, with additional class actions planned, one in Ontario in 2010, and one in British Columbia in 2011.
