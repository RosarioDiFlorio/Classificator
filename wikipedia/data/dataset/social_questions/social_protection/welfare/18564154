An orphan (from the Greek: ορφανός orphanós) is a child whose parents are dead, unknown, or have permanently abandoned him or her. 
In common usage, only a child who has lost both parents due to death is called an orphan. When referring to animals, only the mother's condition is usually relevant (i.e. if the female parent has gone, the offspring is an orphan, regardless of the father's condition).
Children who have reached adulthood before their parents died are usually not described as orphans, as the term is generally reserved for children whose parents have died while they are too young to support themselves.
