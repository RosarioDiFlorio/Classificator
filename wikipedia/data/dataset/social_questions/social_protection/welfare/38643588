Rincón de Luz is a fictional orphanage and the primary setting for the first four, and the last two seasons of the Argentine television series Chiquititas. The exceptions are Chiquititas Season Five, where the story takes place in a granary, and Chiquititas Sin Fin, in which the children have a different home.
Rincón de Luz (literally "Corner Of Light") is also the title of a Chiquititas spin-of series that shares a similar plot, created by Cris Morena. The title Rincón de Luz replaced the previous one of Chiquititas, since Morena could not use the previous title due to copyright issues. Soon before its premiere, she stated that Chiquititas was "more than a title". The same name is used in the Chiquititas feature film.
The manor is located at the Pasaje del Sauce, 829, in Buenos Aires.
