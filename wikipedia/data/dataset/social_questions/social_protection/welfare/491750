For the general principles, see Residence in English law
Shared residence, or joint residence, refers to the situation where the child(ren) of parents who have divorced or separated reside(s) with each parent at different times. Shared residency may be granted in cases where both parents have parental responsibility. Shared residency does not mean that the time the child spends in each residence must be equal. Children Act 1989 defines a residence order as one "...settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom a child is to live". A sole order settles the child(ren) in the home of one parent. The other parent will usually be allowed contact. A joint or shared order allows the child(ren) to alternate periods of residence between the homes of both parents. Shared residence refers to a situation where the children live in two (or more) households. The term joint residence is used for the situation where the children live with two people who themselves live in the same household (for example, with their father and his partner.)
