The lost children of Francoism were the children abducted from Republican parents, who were either in jail or had been assassinated by Francoist troops, during the Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain. The number of abducted children is estimated to be up to 300,000. The kidnapped children were sometimes also victims of child trafficking and illegal adoption.
