In United States law, the Bradley Amendment 1986, Public law 99-509 42 U.S.C. ยง 666(a)(9)(c). Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement. Bill Bradley requires state courts to prohibit retroactive reduction of child support obligations. Specifically, it:
automatically triggers a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes past-due.
overrides any state's statute of limitations.
disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges.
requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support (the obligor) to promptly document changed circumstances or regard for his awareness of the need to make the notification.
But, like any other past-due debt, the obligee may forgive what is owed to them.
When past-due child support is owed to a state as a result of welfare paid out, the state is free to forgive some or all of it under what's known as an "offer in compromise". The state and government agencies are non-profit organizations.
