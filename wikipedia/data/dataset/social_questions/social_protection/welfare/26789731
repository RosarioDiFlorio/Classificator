Fetal abduction refers to the rare and macabre crime of child abduction by murder of an at term pregnant mother and extraction of her fetus through a crude cesarean section. In the small number of reported cases, few pregnant victims and about half of their fetuses survived the assault and non-medically performed cesarean.
Fetal abduction does not refer to medically induced labor or obstetrical extraction. The definition of the subject does not include compulsory cesarean sections for medical reasons nor child removal from parents for court-approved child protection. However, the "Children of the Disappeared" (desaparecidos) in the Argentine Dirty War are an example of criminal fetal abduction in state institutions as detailed by testimonies on cesarean delivery on desaparecidas and child adoption in a military hospital. Historical atrocities of cesarean extraction for fetal murder (not for child adoption) fall outside the subject definition.
