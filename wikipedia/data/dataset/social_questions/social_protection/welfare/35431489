The Draco Foundation was legally formed in 2010 but conceived by the New Zealand Resilience Trust in 2006 as part of its mission to assist in the development of resilience among communities throughout New Zealand. The Draco Foundation promotes democracy and the preservation of natural justice through two operational arms: Council Watch and the National Residents' Associations Database.
These activities, along with the Foundation itself, are non-partisan and funded through private donations. All the work performed by the Trust is adopts a community-centric approach and is run by volunteers.
Draco Foundation aims to educate the public about how the law works, especially around local government. They undertake research, hold forums and conferences, publish articles, and bring people from the civil society sector together. The Trust operates in the civil society sector, mainly with residents associations.
Draco funds Council Watch - a website that improves transparency, accountability and best practice in local government - and also the National Residents' Association Database.
