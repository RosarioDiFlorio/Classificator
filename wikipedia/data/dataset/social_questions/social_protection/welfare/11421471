Internet fraud prevention is the act of stopping various types of internet fraud. Due to the many different ways of committing fraud over the Internet, such as stolen credit cards, identity theft, phishing, and chargebacks, users of the Internet must make sure to avoid such scams.
Internet fraud must be prevented on two ends. First, there is the basic user who may be susceptible to giving away personal information in a phishing scam, or have it be acquired by rogue security software or a keylogger. In a 2012 study, McAfee found that 1 in 6 computers do not have any sort of antivirus protection, making them very easy targets for such scams. Business owners and website hosts are also engaged in the ongoing battle of preventing Internet fraud. Due to the illegal nature of fraud, they must ensure that the users of their services are legitimate. Websites with file hosting must work to verify uploaded files to check for viruses and spyware, while some modern browsers perform virus scans prior to saving any file (there must be a virus scanner previously installed on the system). However, most files are only found to be unclean once a user falls prey to one.
