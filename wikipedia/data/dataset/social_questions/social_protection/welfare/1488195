There are two fundamental theorems of welfare economics.
The First Theorem states that a market will tend toward a competitive equilibrium that is weakly Pareto optimal when the market maintains the following three attributes:
1. complete markets - No transaction costs and because of this each actor also has perfect information, and
2. price-taking behavior - No monopolists and easy entry and exit from a market.
Furthermore, the First Theorem states that the equilibrium will be fully Pareto optimal with the additional condition of:
3. local nonsatiation of preferences - For any original bundle of goods, there is another bundle of goods arbitrarily close to the original bundle, but that is preferred.
The Second Theorem states that, out of all possible Pareto optimal outcomes, one can achieve any particular one by enacting a lump-sum wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over.
