Safety Town is a program for children that teaches safety lessons about fire, pedestrians/traffic, water, guns, and poisons/drugs. It is also the name given to a replica town created to instruct children about safety measures.
The Safety Town program was founded by Officer Frend Boals in Mansfield, Ohio in 1937 after a child was struck and killed by a car on his way to school. The "National Safety Town Center" was founded in 1964 by Dorothy Chlad in Cleveland, Ohio.
