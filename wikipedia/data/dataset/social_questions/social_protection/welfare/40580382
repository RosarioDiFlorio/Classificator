Custody evaluation (also known as "parenting evaluation") is a legal process, in which a court-appointed mental health expert, evaluates a family and makes a recommendation to the court for custody, visitation and/or a parenting plan. When performing the custody evaluation, the evaluator is expected to act in the child's best interests.
