A girl's court is an gender responsive approach for girls in the juvenile justice system that links young "at-risk" females to social service agencies, providing informal sessions on everything from body image, education and counseling with a team of adults to provide trust and support.
Some half dozen such courts have emerged around the United States, each defining itself around the problems in the surrounding area. One common theme is to treat young sex workers as the victims of sex trafficking. Identifying reasons for entry into these behaviors such as childhood abuse and dysfunctional homes is important to understanding the nature of the crime and circumstances unique to girls.
