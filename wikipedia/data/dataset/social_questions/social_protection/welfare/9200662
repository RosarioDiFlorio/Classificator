A swimming pool fence is a type of fence placed around swimming pools, to create a passive barrier to restrict the access of small children, 0â€“5 years to the swimming pool. Swimming pool fences must have a self-closing and self-latching gate/s to be compliant to most countries' laws and codes.
Swimming pool fences are designed so that young children cannot climb over them or go through them. They are manufactured to strict standards to be sturdy, durable and non-climbable.
Most countries design, manufacture and install swimming pool fences to the International Code Councils (ICC) guidelines.
