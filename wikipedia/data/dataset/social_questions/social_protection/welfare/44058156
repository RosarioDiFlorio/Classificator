Started in 1994, Watoto Child Care Ministries is a branch of the Watoto Church in Uganda that builds villages with schools, churches, medical centers, and homes and populates them with new families built from orphans and widows. Currently there are three villages: Bbira and Suubi near Kampala and Laminadera outside Gulu. Other projects being undertaken by Watoto Child Care Ministries include baby homes, vocational training, and farms to support the villages. Watoto Child Care Ministries is also the organization that runs the Watoto Children's Choir which tours internationally every year. Watoto aims to "raise the next generation of African leaders".
