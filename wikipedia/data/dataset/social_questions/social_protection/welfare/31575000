The National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) is a data bank and an information management system that identifies who and where the poor are in the Republic of the Philippines. Data collection began in response to findings by the National Statistical Coordination Board that 30% of Filipino families have an income below that needed for "basic requirements". It is intended to inform government departments and policy-makers on the socio-economic status of nearly 400,000 households.
