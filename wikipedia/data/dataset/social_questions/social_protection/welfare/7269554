The Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity (in French: Ministère de l’Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale) is a government agency in the Canadian province of Quebec. Its primary function is to promote employment and provide financial support for economically disadvantaged people.
The department is overseen by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, who is a member of the Executive Council of Quebec. Ministerial responsibility for employment was separated from social solidarity in 2001, and a different minister assigned to each field. The positions were reunited in 2003.
Following minister François Blais's promotion to Educacation Minister, the agency was merged with the Ministry of Labour on February 27, 2015.
