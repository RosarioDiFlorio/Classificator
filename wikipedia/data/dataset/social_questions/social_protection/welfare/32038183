Wikiprogress is an online platform for sharing information on the measurement of social, economic and environmental progress. It is thought to facilitate sharing on ideas, initiatives and knowledge on "measuring the progress of societies". It is, like Wikipedia, open to all members and communities for contribution â€“ anyone interested in "progress" can register.
