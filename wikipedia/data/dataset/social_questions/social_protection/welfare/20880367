In economics, dynamic efficiency is a situation where it is impossible to make one generation better off without making any other generation worse off. It is closely related to the notion of "golden rule of saving". In general, an economy will fail to be dynamically efficient if the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy (sum of the growth rates of population and per capita income).
