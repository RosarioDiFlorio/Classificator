Lifestories: The Lost Boys of Sudan is a short documentary that explores the lives of eight Sudanese refugees. Displaced from their homes in the late 1980s due to a brutal civil war, the youngest boys were forced to flee alone. Pitted against an Arab Militia, wild animals, starvation, and thirst the boys survived a trek of 1,000 miles and twelve years in refugee camps before coming to the United States. Enduring such unimaginable hardships left them with many stories to tell. It is an under-reported and forgotten tale of survival and brotherhood. Directed by Jared D. Martin at the age of 14.
