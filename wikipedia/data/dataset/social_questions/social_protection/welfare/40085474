The Casitas del Sur case refers to the disappearance of several minors from children's refuges operated by the religious organization Iglesia Cristiana Restaurada (Restored Christian Church).
The case is a reference to the private Mexico City shelter 'Casitas del Sur' from which 126 children were rescued in January 2009. In addition to the 'Casitas del Sur' shelter, minors were reported missing from Centro de Adaptación e Integración Familiar A.C. (CAIFAC) in Monterrey, Nuevo León and from "La Casita" in Cancún, Quintana Roo. As of March 2012, fourteen children remained missing.
The missing children are allegedly abducted for religious indoctrination, illegal adoptions, organ trafficking, and trafficking of children. The Attorney General of Mexico offers a $1.2 million reward for information leading to the location and recovery of the missing children.
The case is the subject of the book Se venden niños by investigative journalist Sanjuana Martínez. La Jornada journalist Carlos Martínez García was granted protective measures after receiving threats for his report on the case.
