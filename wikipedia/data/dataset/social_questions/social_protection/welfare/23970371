NACEDA, the National Alliance of Community Economic Development Associations, represents more than 3,000 American community development corporations through a 45-member network of city, state and regional associations.
It was formed to support the work of community economic development (CED) associations, grassroots community development practitioners and their associations. NACEDA works to strengthen and expand the role of state CEDs in promoting the efforts of local CDCs, and building the capacity and reach of the CDC field.
