Sibling abuse (or intersibling abuse) is the physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse of one sibling by another.
Though several studies indicate that sibling abuse is far more common than other forms of family abuse, chronic maltreatment by siblings has only relatively recently become the subject of serious clinical study and concern. Sibling abuse is far less recognized than spousal or child abuse and is often considered less dangerous, although siblings who are a great deal larger and/or older than their younger counterparts may in fact be capable of lethal violence towards their victims.
Sibling abuse is significantly more likely to occur in dysfunctional, neglectful and/or abusive homes, and often reflects a lack of appropriate boundaries and discipline on the part of the parents. In many cases, sibling abuse can occur as "second hand abuse" in which children who have been harmed or maltreated go on to harm siblings. A 1982 study found that of 60% of children who witnessed their mothers abused by their fathers or vise-versa subsequently acted out the scene with their siblings. Similarly, those who witness abuse as children are more likely to abuse as adults: Malone and colleagues found that when children witnessed parental abuse they were more likely to behave abusively as adults, and that, contrary to common wisdom, girls from such families were more likely than boys to behave abusively towards partners as adults. The "Cinderella effect", which is a conventional wisdom in the English-speaking world, holds that sibling abuse is more common between half-siblings or full step-siblings than genetic siblings.
