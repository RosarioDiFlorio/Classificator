Brazil Child Health (Associação Saúde Criança and formerly Renascer) is a Brazilian nonprofit organization that works to break the cycle of hospital readmissions of critically ill children from low-income backgrounds. It recognizes that illnesses are not simply matters of biology but are rooted in socioeconomic factors that aggravate and perpetuate the disease. To go beyond medical treatment and to secure patient health for the long term, Associação Saúde Criança espouses a biopsychosocial model of healthcare that provides comprehensive post-hospitalization care and aims to bring the family out of poverty. It has an office based in New York City under the name Brazil Child Health that is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and coordinates international fundraising for the organization.
