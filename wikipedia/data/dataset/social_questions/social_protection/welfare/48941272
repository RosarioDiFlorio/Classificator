A serious case review (SCR) in England is held after a child or vulnerable adult dies or is seriously injured under circumstances where abuse or neglect are thought to have been involved. Its purpose is to learn lessons to help prevent future similar incidents. Similar procedures in other countries of the UK are called child practice reviews in Wales, case management reviews in Northern Ireland, and significant case reviews in Scotland. An SCR should be held if abuse or neglect is suspected to have been involved, a child has died or been seriously harmed and if there are concerns about the way organisations or professionals worked together to safeguard the child.
