William Francis Melchert-Dinkel (born July 20, 1962) is an American former licensed practical nurse who was found guilty of encouraging people to commit suicide. He allegedly told those contemplating suicide what methods worked best, that it was a decent choice to commit suicide, that they would be better off in heaven, and/or falsely entered into suicide pacts with them. He is a married father of two.
Melchert-Dinkel was originally convicted of two counts of assisting suicide for encouraging the suicides of a British IT technician in 2005 and a Canadian student in 2008 over the Internet. Those convictions were later overturned by the Minnesota Supreme Court when it found that part of the state law used to convict him was unconstitutional. On remand, Melchert-Dinkel was convicted on one count of assisting suicide, and one count of attempted assisting suicide.
