Building Sites Bite is a public information film produced for British schools to warn children about the danger of playing on building sites. It was written and directed by David Hughes and produced by Maggie Evans. The film was shot in early 1978 and is 28 minutes in duration. Because of the style of filming and grim subject matter, it is often compared to the earlier films, Apaches and The Finishing Line, both released the previous year.
