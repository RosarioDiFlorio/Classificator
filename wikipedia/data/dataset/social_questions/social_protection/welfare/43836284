Kindertransport – The Arrival is an outdoor bronze memorial sculpture by Frank Meisler, located in the forecourt of Liverpool Street station in London, United Kingdom. It commemorates the 10,000 orphaned Jewish children who escaped Nazi persecution and arrived at the station during 1938–1939.  The memorial was installed in September 2006, replacing Flor Kent's bronze Für Das Kind (For the Child), which was installed in 2003. It was commissioned by World Jewish Relief and the Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR).
