Emasithandane Children's Project (also known as Emasithandane) is a home for orphaned and other vulnerable children in Nyanga, Cape Town, South Africa, one of the poorest townships in the city. It was founded by Mama Zelphina Maposela who moved to Nyanga from the Eastern Cape to help address the orphan crisis in the area. There are about 25 children living in the home without any alternative place to go. Emasithandane has partnered with organizations such as the Desmond Tutu TB Centre, CHOSA, and People Environmental Planning to improve the lives of its children.
