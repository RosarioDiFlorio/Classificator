The New Approach to Appraisal (also NATA) was the name given to a multi-criteria decision framework used to appraise transport projects and proposals in the United Kingdom. NATA was built on the well established costâ€“benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment techniques (such as those contained in the Highways Agency's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)) for assessing transport projects and proposals.
In April 2011 the Coalition Government decided that the term NATA would no longer be used. However, the principles and key elements of the NATA framework remain in the Department for Transport's WebTAG Transport Analysis Guidance.
