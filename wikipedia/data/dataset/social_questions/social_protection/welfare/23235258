St. Patrick's Borstal Institution, Clonmel was established in 1906 as a place of detention for young male offenders aged between 16 and 21. Located in the centre of Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland, it was the only Borstal instituted in Ireland and was established on the site of the historic town gaol, the former adult prisoners having been transferred to other jails.
