Primary Parent or Primary carer is a term to describe the parent who has most parenting time with the children after separation. The other parent is then known as the secondary parent - arguably less pejorative than terms like single parent (when in fact there are two parents) or Parent With Care.
The term Primary Parent is also used colloquially to refer to the person who is principally looking after a child at a given point in time, regardless of parental relationship status.
