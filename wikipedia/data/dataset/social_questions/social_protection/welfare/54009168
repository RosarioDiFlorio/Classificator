Edna Phillips was a 70-year-old woman who was murdered on 16 July 1992 by two teenage girls, one of them her next-door neighbour, at her home on a council estate in Penywaun in South Wales. The details of the crime were made public soon after the start of the trial of the two boys who murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside, which contributed to the resulting moral panic in the United Kingdom.
