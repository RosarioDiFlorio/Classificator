The City Angels group is a non-confessional, independent, multiethnic and anti-racist group of street volunteers, founded in 1994 in Milan by Mario Furlan, an Italian journalist, writer and university professor of motivation and personal growth. The group is also present in Rome, Turin, Brescia, Florence, Venice, Parma, Modena, Messina, Bergamo, Rimini, Monza, Campomarino, Novara, Como, Varese, Cagliari, Lecco and Lecce; since 2014, they have also been active in Lugano, Switzerland. In Milan, the City Angels have twice received the "Ambrogino d'Oro", the city's highest official recognition. In 2008, the Ambrogino was awarded to the honorary City Angel Edward "Eddie" Gardner, a Ghanaian man who risked dying on July 20 of that year after being stabbed, in a racist attack, by three drug dealers shouting "dirty nigger!" because he was trying to convince young people not to take drugs.
