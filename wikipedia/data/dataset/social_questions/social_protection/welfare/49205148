Australian Unity is an Australian mutual company having its origins in the friendly societies movement. It was formed as the Manchester Unity International Order of Oddfellows in Victoria in Melbourne, Victoria on 7 December 1840 by eight men including Thomas Strode, publisher of the Port Phillip Gazette and Augustus Greeves, inspired by Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity. In 1993, Manchester Unity merged with the Australian Natives' Association to form Australian Unity. Later mergers occurred with Grand United, Lifeplan and Big Sky in 2005, 2008 and 2012. Australian Unity has about 4000 employees across healthcare, insurance and banking (in the guise of Big Sky Credit Union) divisions.
In 2012 Big Sky was merged with Australian Unity to become the banking arm of Australian Unity. Ownership of Big Sky Credit Union Limited was transferred to Australian Unity Limitedâ€™s subsidiary Lifeplan Australia Building Society Limited and renamed Big Sky Building Society Limited. Members of Big Sky Credit Union became members of Australian Unity.
The Manchester Unity Building is a Gothic Revival skyscraper in Melbourne, Australia, constructed in 1932 by the Manchester Unity I.O.O.F. in Victoria. The building was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth in 1947.
