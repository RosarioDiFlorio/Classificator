The Bellevue murders, or the Bellevue massacre, occurred on the night of January 3rd, and the early morning of January 4th, 1997, when Alex Baranyi and David Anderson, both 17, lured Kim Wilson, 20, to a Bellevue, Washington park and murdered her. Afterwards, they entered her family home and murdered Bill Wilson, his wife Rose Wilson, and their other daughter, Julia Wilson. Both Baranyi and Anderson were convicted and sentenced to serve four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.
Although the motives behind the murders were unclear, the boys exhibited psychological disturbance when they were brought in for questioning. When Baranyi was questioned about his motives, he calmly replied that he wanted to kill someone because he was "in a rut". Testimonies by Baranyi and Anderson, led investigators to suggest that they killed the Wilson family for the sheer experience of killing.
