MRR v GR was an Australian court case concerning child custody arrangements where the father wanted to remain living in Mount Isa, Queensland while the mother wanted to return to live in Sydney, NSW. The Family Law Act 1975 makes the "best interests of the child" the paramount consideration when making a parenting order. The High Court of Australia decided that a Federal Magistrate erred by failing to consider the "reasonable practicability" of a parenting order with an equal time custody arrangement that required the mother to live in Mount Isa. The matter was decided on 3 December 2009 with reasons subsequently published on 3 March 2010.
