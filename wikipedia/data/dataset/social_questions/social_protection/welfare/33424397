In some custody situations, it is possible that the child/children will not remain with either of their natural, biological, parents, but instead custody is awarded to a third person. Generally speaking, third-party custody occurs when one of two options occur:
The biological parents do not want custody of the child/children.
The biological parents are incapable of caring for the child/children.
