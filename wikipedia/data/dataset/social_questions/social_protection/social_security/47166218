Jan Pieter Kuiper (29 May 1922, Norg – 13 September 1985, Haarzuilens) was a professor of social medicine at the protestant Free University of Amsterdam. In 1975, Kuiper played a major role in the promotion of the idea of unconditional basic income in the Netherlands, after a conference where he gave a passionate and controversial speech. Later on he gave a series of lecture on the need to ‘disconnect productive labour and income’.
His ideas influenced Christian-Leftists and the ecologist movement.
