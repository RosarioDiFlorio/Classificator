Widowed Motherâ€™s Allowance was part of the United Kingdom system of Social Security benefits.
It was established under the National Insurance Act 1946 and abolished and replaced by Widowed Parent's Allowance in 2001. William Beveridge's view was: "There is no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life; if she is able to work, she should work. On the other hand, provision much better than at present should be made for those who, because they have the care of children, cannot work for gain or cannot work regularly".
