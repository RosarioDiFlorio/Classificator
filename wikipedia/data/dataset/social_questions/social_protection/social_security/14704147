The Primary Insurance Amount (abbreviated PIA), is a component of Social Security provision in the United States. Eligibility for receiving Social Security benefits is contingent upon the recipient: (i) having worked for at least 10 (noncontiguous) years and (ii) having paid the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax up to a maximum taxable earnings threshold. For the purposes of the United States Social Security Administration, PIA is used as the beginning point in calculating the annuity payment of benefits that is provided to an eligible recipient each month during retirement until the recipient's death. Generally, the more a person pays into the Social Security Trust Fund during their life, the higher their PIA will be. However, specific rules in its computation may deviate from this general rule.
