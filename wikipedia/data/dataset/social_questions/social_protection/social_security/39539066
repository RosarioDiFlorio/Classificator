The Habitual Residence Test is the criteria used by the United Kingdom to determine eligibility for welfare benefits such as the Employment and Support Allowance, the Jobseeker's Allowance, Pension Credits, and Housing Benefit. The test was introduced in 1994. It required close ties to the United Kingdom and intention to settle in the UK. It was revised in May 2004 to include a ‘right to reside’ requirement, based on directives of the European Union regarding right of residence. Provisions regarding right to reside include conducting business, working or looking for work, being a student, or having sufficient resources to be self-supporting.
