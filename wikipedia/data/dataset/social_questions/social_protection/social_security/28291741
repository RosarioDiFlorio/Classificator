The social dividend is the return on the capital assets and natural resources owned owned by society in a socialist economy, appearing most prominently as a key characteristic of market socialism in the form of a dividend payment to each citizen derived from the property income generated by publicly owned enterprises. The social dividend thus represents the individualâ€™s share of the capital and natural resources owned by society in a socialist system.
The social dividend concept has not yet been applied on any large scale in any national economy, but similar policies have been adopted on a limited basis. In both the former Soviet-type economies and Western mixed economies, the net earnings of state enterprises were considered a source of public revenue to be spent directly by the government to finance various public goods and services.
The concept of a social dividend overlaps with the concept of a universal basic income guarantee, but is distinguished from basic income in that a social dividend implies social ownership of productive assets whereas a basic income does not necessarily imply social ownership and can be financed through a much broader range of sources. Unlike a basic income, the social dividend yield varies based on the performance of the socially owned economy. Social dividends are the socialist analogue to basic income policies.
