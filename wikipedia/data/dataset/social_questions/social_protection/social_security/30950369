Pensions in Germany are based on a “three pillar system”.
First pillar: mandatory state pension insurance (gesetzliche Rentenversicherung). This part of the basic social security system. All employees and employers pay a percentage of salaries into this system.
Second pillar: Voluntary Occupational Pension Insurance
Third pillar: private insurance
