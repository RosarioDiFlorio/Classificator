Saints and Scroungers is a British television programme about welfare benefits, broadcast on BBC One and presented by Matt Allwright since 2013. It was presented by Dominic Littlewood from 2009 until 2012. But now more recently for the new season started on 7 September 2015, there is no physical presenter input but just an audio voice over from Mark Bazeley. It focuses on two groups of people: the vulnerable who need help and those who help them 'saints' and fraudulent claimants 'scroungers'. The series is repeated in the UK on Crime & Investigation Network.
