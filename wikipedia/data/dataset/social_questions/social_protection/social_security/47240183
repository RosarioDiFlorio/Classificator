Basic income (Swedish: basinkomst or medborgarlön) has been debated in the Nordic countries since the 1970s. It has mostly been seen as a radical and utopian proposal and not taken seriously by the big political parties. However, in recent years there has been some notable victories for the basic income movements in the region. In Sweden the Green Party (Miljöpartiet) is aiming for a state investigation on basic income. In Finland the Centre Party, which won the national election 2015 and leads the government, is pushing for a basic income pilot project. And in Iceland the Pirate Party, which has been leading the monthly polls 2015, has basic income (or investigation about it) as one of their top priorities. Some of the leading advocates in the Nordic countries are: Valter Mutt, Annika Lillemets, Lars Ekstrand, Osmo Soininvaara and Erik Christensen.
