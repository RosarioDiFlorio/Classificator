Local Authority Investigation Officers Group (LAIOG) is a British organisation involving Local Authority investigators. When it was created, it focused primarily on those involved in the investigation of Housing and Council Tax Benefit fraud. This is no longer the case, with LAIOG members now having a remit that includes all areas of investigation in Local Government.
LAIOG is recognised as a representative group in providing information and statistics to, for example, the UK parliament. The organisation is considered of sufficient importance to be mentioned by name in the fraud prevention policies of many Local Authorities and Department for Work and Pensions newsletters.
Although referred to under Fraud Squad in this encyclopaedia as an investigation unit, this is not strictly the case, although members do liaise during investigations.
