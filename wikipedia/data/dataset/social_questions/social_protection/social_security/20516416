Small Self Administered Scheme (SSAS) is a type of UK Occupational Pension Scheme.
Schemes are trust-based and established individually, usually by directors of limited companies for specified employees of the company. Since Pension Simplification (also known as A-Day), SSAS has been available for establishment by those who are not in a limited company (i.e. Partnerships and Families).
