The Pensions Act 2008 (c 30) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The principal change brought about by the Act is that all workers will have to opt out of an occupational pension plan of their employer, rather than opt in. A second change is the creation of a National Employment Savings Trust, a public pension provider for those who do not have an occupational pensions, which will function as a low-fee pension scheme in competition with existing funds.
