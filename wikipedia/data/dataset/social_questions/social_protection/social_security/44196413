List showing the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the United States and its territories since 1973. Repeated numbers indicate that they've been transferred to another location or they're shared by more than one location.
The above table is only valid for SSN issued before June 2011. On June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to "SSN randomization". SSN randomization affects the SSN assignment process. Among its changes, it eliminates the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, previously referred to as the Area Number, by no longer allocating the Area Numbers for assignment to individuals in specific states. The table above is based on out-of-date information. Numbers in the range of 650-699 most certainly have been issued (see related comment on the Talk page). Table above though it has been duplicated from a social security web site has been proven to be inaccurate. Multiple real world observations have verified numbers in the 590s were issued out of Florida in the late 1980s into the early 1990s.
