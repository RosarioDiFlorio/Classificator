The Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) is part of the UK welfare system that offers help to members of eligible schemes who have lost out on their pension either because their employer became insolvent between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005, or is solvent but under a "compromise agreement" no longer has to meet its commitment to pay its debt to the pension scheme.
