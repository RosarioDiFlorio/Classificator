The Pensions Regulator is a non-departmental public body which holds the position of the regulator of work-based pension schemes in the UK. Created under the Pensions Act 2004, the regulator replaced the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) from 6 April 2005 and has wider powers and a new proactive and risk-based approach to regulation.
The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority was established by the Pensions Act 1995 and came into full operation on 6 April 1997. It replaced the Occupational Pensions Board as the regulator of occupational pensions in the UK.
The Pensions Regulator has a clear set of objectives:
to improve confidence in work-based pensions by protecting the benefits of scheme members;
to reduce the risk of situations arising that may lead to claims for compensation from the Pension Protection Fund (PPF); and
to promote good administration of work-based pension schemes.
to maximise employer compliance with employer duties (including the requirement to automatically enrol eligible employees into a qualifying pension provision with a minimum contribution) and with certain employment safeguards
To meet these objectives The Pensions Regulator employs a risk-based approach, concentrating its resources on schemes which pose the greatest risk to the security of membersâ€™ benefits. The regulator also promotes high standards of scheme administration and works to ensure that those involved in running pension schemes have the necessary skills and knowledge.
David Norgrove was appointed the first chair of The Pensions Regulator in January 2005. After 2 terms, he was replaced by Michael O'Higgins in January 2011. Lesley Titcomb has been the chief executive since March 2015.
