The Pensions Commission was a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom, reporting to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, set up to keep under review the regime for UK private pensions and long-term savings.
The commission was announced in the Pensions Green Paper published in December 2002. It consisted of three Commissioners and a small secretariat. The chair was Adair Turner, the other members were John Hills and Jeannie Drake. The Commission has now reported and been wound up.
A more recent Pensions Commission was set up chaired by John Hutton.
