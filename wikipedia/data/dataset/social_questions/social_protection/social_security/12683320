Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) is the welfare benefit intended to give financial support to disabled people having difficulty finding work, and also to help them find suitable employment despite their disability.
ESA replaced three older benefits: Incapacity Benefit; Income Support paid because of an illness or disability; and Severe Disablement Allowance. New Labour introduced ESA for new claims in 2008 and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition expanded its scope in 2011.
