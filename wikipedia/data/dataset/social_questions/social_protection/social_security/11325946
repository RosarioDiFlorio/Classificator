In the United Kingdom Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is paid by their employer to all employees who normally pay National Insurance contributions (NIC), often referred to as earning above the Lower Earnings Limit (LEL) if they are sick for a period longer than 4 consecutive days but less than 28 weeks. The first 3 days of sickness are called waiting days. SSP is not paid to a number of categories of employees, including:
Those who are paid less than the national insurance lower earnings limit -in 2015 this is Â£112 pw
New employees who have not done any work under the contract of employment.
Pregnant employees in receipt of Maternity Allowance or Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)
Employees recently in receipt of Social Security Benefits (within the last 57 days).
Prisoners.
Employees on strike.
If the individual is unable to work due to medical reasons for longer than the 28 weeks, entitlement to SSP ceases, but the person may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance.
