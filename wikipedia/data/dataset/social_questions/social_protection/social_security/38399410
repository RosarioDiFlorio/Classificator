Basic income in India refers to the debate and practical experiments with basic income in India.
The debate has been fostered by the basic income-project organized by India’s Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) with support from UNICEF, which started 2011. The government has since then also declared that they will implement a national basic income, which began in January 2013.
