Basic income in Canada has been debated since at least the 1930s with the Social Credit movement, but as in other parts of the western world the discussion has increased during the last decades. Different names have been used, for example Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI), "Social Dividend" and "basic income". More specifically there have been plans to implement either a guaranteed minimum income or basic income; these referred to here as NIT (for negative income tax) and UD (for Universal Demogrant) respectively.
