Home Office Circular 46/2004 is guidance issued by the Home Office. Annex C of the circular addresses matters concerning the review of police injury pensions.
In January 2012 the circular was deemed to be unlawful in part by His Honour Judge Behrens, sitting at Leeds High Court. A further judicial review hearing, before His Honour Justice Supperstone at Leeds High Court in February 2012 held that part of Home Office circular 46/2004, concerning "Review of Injury Pensions once Officers reach 65", and paragraph 20 of section 5 of the Home Office 'Guidance on Medical Appeals under the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 and the Police (Injury Benefit) Regulations 2006' are inconsistent with the Police (Injury Benefits) Regulations 2006 and therefore unlawful.
An application for judicial review arising from further dispute over the legality of the Home Office guidance was settled by consent order in February 2014. The case to be heard was Regina on the application of John Slater v Secretaty of State for Home Department and The Chief Constable of Derbyshire, case number 16873/2013. The Home Office agreed to withdraw a further part of the guidance contained in Annex C to Home Office circular 46/2004.
Subsequently, on 21 February 2014, the Home Office withdrew the entirely of the Annex C guidance, and also similar guidance which formed part of a publication entitled, Guidance on Medical Appeals.
This article sets out a brief history of the circular.
