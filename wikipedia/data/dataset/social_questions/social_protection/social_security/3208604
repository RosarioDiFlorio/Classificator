Local Housing Allowance (LHA) was introduced on 7 April 2008 to provide Housing Benefit entitlement for tenants renting private sector accommodation in England, Scotland and Wales. The LHA system introduced significant changes to the way Housing Benefit (HB) levels are restricted and how benefit is paid. It did not replace Housing Benefit - it is just a different way of calculating entitlement under the existing Housing Benefit scheme: the Local Housing Allowance is based on the 30th percentile of local rented accommodation. LHA rates relate to the area in which the housing benefit claim is made. These areas are called Broad Rental Market Areas, defined as "where a person could reasonably be expected to live taking into account access to facilities and services."
LHA rates were set up so as to ensure tenants in similar circumstances and areas could claim similar amounts; ie based on their needs rather than based on their property, and so that in advance it was possible to know for an area how much rent could be covered by housing benefit. However it was found after LHA's first limited implementation in 9 Broad Rental Market Areas that rent levels rose more rapidly in those areas - particularly in those parts of these areas where previously the price was lowest - resulting in criticism that LHA could increase homelessness and remove the poor and unemployed from areas in which they could more easily find work, or find access to vital services related to disability needs.
