The Total Social Security Accounts are a synthesis statistic. They are compiled from numerous statistical sources (profit and loss accounts of social insurances, the Public Finance Statistics [EFS], the Swiss Social Insurance Statistics [SVS], etc.) and provide information on expenditures and their financing in the field of social security. On the expenditure side, the Total Social Security Accounts focus on social benefits and on the revenue side on employers' social security contributions, individual compulsory health insurance premiums, public funding and investment income. Figuratively speaking, the Total Social Security Accounts consist of a sub-structure and a superstructure, with the sub-structure comprising the absolute value of the revenues and expenditures and the superstructure the indicators into which the absolute values can be processed.
The Total Social Security Accounts are internationally comparable, as they are based on the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) developed by Eurostat.
