The pension scheme for elderly in South Korea developed relatively recently when compared to other democratic nations. One-half of Korea's population aged 65 and over lives in relative poverty, nearly four times higher than the OECD average of 13%. Elderly poverty is thus an urgent social problem. Furthermore, public social spending provided by general government (that is central, state, and local governments, including social security funds) per GDP in South Korea is the lowest among the OECD countries, a half of OECD average. 
There are three different types of pension incomes that the elderly (65 years or older) can receive: social welfare, public pension, and private pension.
