Universal Allocation Per Child (Spanish: Asignación universal por hijo) is a social security program in Argentina. It pays a monthly subsidy to families for each child under 18 or disabled. Despite the name, it is not yet a universal program, and currently applies only to families who do not have a regular reported income. A plan is in place to enlarge the scope of the program.
It was established in 2009 by a Necessity and Urgency Decree, signed by president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
