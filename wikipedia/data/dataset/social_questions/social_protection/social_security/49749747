The benefit cap is a British Coalition government policy that caps the amount in state benefits that an individual household can claim per year. The benefit cap was introduced at £26,000 per year (£500 per week) which is the average income of a family in the UK. For single people with no children it was set at £18,200 per year (£350 per week). The level of the benefit cap was subsequently lowered following an announcement in the July 2015 United Kingdom budget. From Autumn 2016 it was reduced to £20,000, except in London where it was reduced to £23,000.
The benefit cap was announced in the October 2010 Spending Review by the Coalition Government and was contained in the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and the Benefit Cap (Housing Benefit) Regulations 2012. It started being introduced in April 2013 and was fully implemented by September 2013. By 2014 a total of 36,471 households were having their payments reduced by the benefit cap, of which 17,102 were in London.
The policy was a facet of the Coalition government's wide-reaching welfare reform agenda which included the introduction of Universal Credit and reforms of housing benefit and disability benefits.
