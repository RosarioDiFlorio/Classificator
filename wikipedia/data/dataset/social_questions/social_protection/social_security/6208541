Work for the Dole is an Australian federal government program that is a form of workfare, work-based welfare. It was first permanently enacted in 1998, having been trialed in 1997. It is one means by which job seekers can satisfy their mutual obligation requirements. Other mutual obligation measures are accredited study, part-time work, Army Reserves and volunteer work. "Work for the Dole" continues as of 2017.
Under the Howard Government the scheme was compulsory and targeted the long-term unemployed. Shortly after the Rudd Government was formed it became voluntary. From 1 July 2015, Work for the Dole became effectively compulsory for the majority of unemployed people in Australia.
