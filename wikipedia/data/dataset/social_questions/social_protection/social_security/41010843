Yung-Ping Chen (born November 24, 1930) is an American economist and gerontologist of Chinese origin. He pioneered the concept of home equity conversion (reverse mortgages) in the United States and developed innovative approaches to the funding of Social Security benefits and long-term care. His scholarship has contributed to a better understanding of the economic, political, and social implications and challenges of today’s “mass aging” phenomenon—the ongoing and unprecedented shift to an increasingly elder-populated society.
