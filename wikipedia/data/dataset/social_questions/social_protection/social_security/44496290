Unemployment benefits in Ukraine are paid out by the State Social Security Fund in case of Unemployment (a part of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine) and financed by employers. An insured person pays 0.6% of its wages to the State Social Security Fund in case of Unemployment. A self-employed can only voluntary contribute. The employer pays 1.6% of the total wage. To be able to receive unemployment benefits one must be registered at an employment office, be able and willing to work, and have income less than the minimum wage (the minimum wage in Ukraine is 1,218 Ukrainian hryvnia). The benefit may be reduced, suspended, or terminated after an discharge for violating work rules or for filing in a fraudulent claim. The benefit is based on 50% of average earnings for persons with a 2 to 6 year career, 55% of average earnings for persons with a 6 to 10 years 60% of average earnings and if one has worked more than 10 years he will receive 70% of average earnings. In the first 90 calendar days 100% of the benefit is paid, the next 90 calendar days 80% is paid and after that time period 70%.
