The Philippine Social Security System (SSS; Filipino: Paseguruhan ng Kapanatagang Panlipunan) is a state-run, social insurance program in the Philippines to workers in the private, professional, and informal sectors. SSS is established by virtue of Republic Act No.1161, better known as Social Security Act of 1954. This law was later amended by Republic Act No. 8282 in 1997.
Government employees, meanwhile, are covered under a separate state-pension fund managed by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).
