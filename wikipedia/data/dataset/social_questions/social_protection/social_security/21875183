The Grenelle de l'insertion or Grenelle Insertion, concluded on 27 May 2008, refers to an open multi-party debate in France that gathered representatives of national and local government and organizations (industry, labor, professional associations, non-governmental organizations) on an equal footing, with goal of unifying a position on the reform of the national policy of insertion. It insisted on the need to reform the insertion system to make it more attractive for people to return to work. It was held from November 2007 to May 2008, instigated by President Nicolas Sarkozy. It led to various reforms, among them the implementation of the Revenue of Active Solidarity (RSA) in 2008.
