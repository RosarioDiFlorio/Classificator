Kela, abbr. from Finnish: Kansaneläkelaitos, Swedish: Folkpensionsanstalten (Fpa), English: The Social Insurance Institution (SII), is a Finnish government agency in charge of settling benefits under national social security programs. Kela was founded in 1937 to handle retirement pay. In the 1980s and 1990s, its role was expanded to handle other fields like child benefits, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, health insurance and student financial aid.
Kela is funded from compulsory payments to some of the administered schemes (24 % 2015) and by taxation. Coverage under the schemes is given to all permanent residents of Finland. Kansaneläkelaitos/Folkpensionsanstalten literally means "People's Pension Institute", reflecting its original function as the national provider of retirement benefits.
