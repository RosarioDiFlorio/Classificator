Basic income in Germany (German: Grundeinkommen), has been debated since the 1980s. There is a national network as well as many local groups. Some of the most well known proponent for the reform are Götz Werner, Katja Kipping and Susanne Wiest. German political parties who are working for basic income are the Pirate Party Germany, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, Die Violetten and since 2016 the Bündnis Gundeinkommmen, which gained admission to the German federal election in 2017.
