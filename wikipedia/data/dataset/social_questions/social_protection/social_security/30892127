A social pension (also known as a non-contributory pension) is a regular cash transfer to older people. Eligibility is based on age and citizenship or residency, and almost always on means such as income, assets or other pension income. Over 100 countries in the world have some form of social pension, although design varies significantly.  However, the social pension is among the guarantees of the social protection floor with ILO recommendation 202 (2012).
