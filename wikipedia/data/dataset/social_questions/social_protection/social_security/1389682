The Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN; until 2004 Basic Income European Network) is a network of academics and activists interested in the idea of a universal basic income based solely on citizenship and not on work requirement or charity. It serves as a link between individuals and groups committed to or interested in basic income, and fosters informed discussion on this topic throughout the world. BIEN's website defines a basic income as "a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement."
Formed in 1986, BIEN held its first international conference in Louvain-la-Neuve in September of that year. It expanded its scope from Europe to the Earth in 2004. From 1988 they published a paper newsletter three times per year; later replaced by an electronic NewsFlash distributed first six, and now twelve times per year. Since 2011, BIEN has sponsored a news website, called Basic Income News.
Every two years until 2014, and ever year since 2016, BIEN has organised an international congress gathering academics and activists for basic income. The most recent congress took place in Seoul, South Korea, in July 2016. The next Congress will take place in Lisbon, Portugal, in September 2017, followed by a Congress in Finland in the summer of 2018.
BIEN has recognized 20 affiliated national networks across the world and two transnational networks.
BIEN's secretaries have been Walter Van Trier (1986-1994), Philippe Van Parijs (1994-2004), David Casassas (2004-2014), Anja Askeland (2014-2016), and Julio Aguirre (2016-). In May 2016, BIEN appointed Malcolm Torry as its first General Manager.
