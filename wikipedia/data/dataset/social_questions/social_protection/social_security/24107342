Pension Credit is the principal element of the UK welfare system for people of pension age. It is intended to supplement the UK State Pension. It was introduced in the UK in 2003 by Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. It has been subject to a number of changes over its existence, but has the core aim of lifting retired people of limited means out of poverty.
