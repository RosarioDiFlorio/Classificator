Basic income, a welfare system in which every citizen (or permanent resident) regularly receives a sum of money without conditions, is an idea that has gotten more attention in recent years in Japan. According to Hirano Hiroya, a professor, the growing debate is understandable, as social exclusion, precarity in the labor market and poverty have increased in recent decades. Two political parties support basic income: New Party Nippon and the Green Party of Japan. Japanese academics arguing for basic income are for example Toru Yamamori and Hayato Kobayashi. Ronald Dore, a British sociologist specializing in the Japanese welfare state, is also engaged in the basic income debate for many years, arguing for its implementation. The main organization promoting basic income in Japan is BIEN Japan.
