The National Assistance Board was established by the National Assistance Act 1948 and abolished by the Supplementary Benefit Act 1966. It was preceded by the Unemployment Assistance Board (known from 1941 as the Assistance Board) and succeeded by the Supplementary Benefit Commission.
There was a separate National Assistance Board of Northern Ireland.
The National Assistance Act 1946 required local authorities, under the control of the Board, to provide residential accommodation for older and disabled people ‘in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them’. They were also able to register and inspect Homes run by charitable (non-profit) and private (for profit) organizations and to contribute to independent organizations providing ‘recreation or meals for old people’ or themselves provide these, or day centres, clubs etc.
