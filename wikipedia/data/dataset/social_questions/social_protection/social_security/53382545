Leaders of the industrial and scientific communities argue that, to offset the social costs created by automationâ€™s displacement effects, either robots should pay income tax, or their owners should pay a tax for replacing a worker with a robot. And this "robot tax" should be used to finance a universal basic income or guaranteed living wage. Bill Gates said the solution to the problem is simple, the government should start taxing robots i.e. make the robot owners cough up the money needed to re-establish the defunct workforce. But EU Commissioner Andrus Ansip, tasked with bringing Europe to the digital age, says no. He explained that a robot tax would only mean someone else would take the leading position and leave Europe behind.
