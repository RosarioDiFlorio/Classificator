Meyer v. Astrue, 662 F.3d 700 (4th Cir. 2011) was a landmark Social Security Disability Insurance case argued in Federal Court, resolving a conflict within the Circuit over the summary denial of requests for review when new evidence is submitted to the Appeals Council. After suffering severe injuries in an accidental fall, Maurice Eugene Meyer applied for Social Security Disability insurance benefits. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied his claim, noting that Meyer failed to provide an opinion from his treating physician. When Meyer requested review of his claim by the Appeals Council, he submitted a letter from his treating physician detailing the injuries and recommending significant restrictions on Meyer’s activity. The Appeals Council made this letter part of the record but summarily denied Meyer’s request for review; thus, the ALJ’s decision denying benefits became the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration.
