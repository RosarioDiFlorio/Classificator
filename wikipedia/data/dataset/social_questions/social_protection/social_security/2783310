The State Second Pension (S2P), or Additional State Pension, was introduced in the UK by the Labour Government on 6 April 2002, to replace the SERPS (State Earnings Related Pension Scheme). The main aim of this change was to skew existing Additional Pension (AP) benefits in favour of low and moderate earners at the expense of higher earners and to extend access to include certain carers and people with long-term illness or disability for the first time.
The Additional State Pension was replaced for new pensioners by the new State Pension on 6 April 2016.
