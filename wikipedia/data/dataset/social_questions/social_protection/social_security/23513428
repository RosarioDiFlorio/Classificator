A minimum employer contribution is a mandatory pension contribution which is made compulsory by the Pensions Act 2008 in the UK which comes into force in 2012. As a result, all staff are required to be automatically enrolled in a pension scheme when they join a firm.
The Cameron Ministry modified this rule by means of the 2011 Pension Act, which brought the rule into force in a series of tranches of employers, over several years (finishing by the end of 2017), instead of all at one moment. Rather than the original 3% of banded earnings, employers are only initially required to supply 1%; this will increase to 2% in 2018, and then to 3%.
The 2011 Pension Act established NEST, as a low cost pension provider, which employers default to using, if they are not able to make arrangements with any other provider, or would prefer not to do so. In practice, employers were more successful at finding alternative providers than the government had expected, and the restrictions placed on NEST, so that it didn't compete with other providers, are now deemed unnecessary by the government.
The Act also places requirements on defined contribution pension providers who have a choice of funds in which employees can invest; there must be a default option, which must be sensible, for employees who are automatically enrolled, and do not provide any preference about which funds they wish their contributions to be placed in.
