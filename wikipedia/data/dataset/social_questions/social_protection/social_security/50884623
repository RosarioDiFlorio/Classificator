The welfare cap is a self-imposed limit on the amount that the government of the United Kingdom can spend on certain social security benefits and tax credits. The welfare cap was first introduced in the 2014 United Kingdom budget. The policy took effect in 2015, and the limit for the financial year 2015–16 was set at £119.5 billion, amounting to 56% of total welfare spending. The policy was a facet of the Coalition government's wide-reaching welfare reform agenda which included the introduction of Universal Credit and reforms of housing benefit and disability benefits.
