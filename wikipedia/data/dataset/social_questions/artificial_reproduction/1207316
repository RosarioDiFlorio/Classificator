Sexual medicine is a medical specialty that deals with sexual health. At times heavily influenced by current local views on morality, with heavy cultural overlay, in broad terms this specialty is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all aspects which relate to sexuality.
Issues can be divided into two main areas of concern:
disorders of the sexual organs
disorders of the psyche affecting sexuality
Sexual medicine has four dimensions:
The promotional dimension (increases awareness and helps individuals have a healthy and fulfilling sex life)
The preventive dimension (counseling)
The curative dimension (clinical treatment of specific sexual disorders)
The rehabilitative dimension (helps patients regain sexual health)
