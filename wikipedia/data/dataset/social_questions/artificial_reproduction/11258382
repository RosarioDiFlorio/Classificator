Vaginal flora or vaginal microbiota are the microorganisms that colonize the vagina. It was discovered by the German gynecologist Albert DÃ¶derlein in 1892, and are part of the overall human flora. The amount and type of bacteria present have significant implications for a woman's overall health. The primary colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual are of the genus Lactobacillus, such as L. crispatus, and the lactic acid they produce is thought to protect against infection by pathogenic species.
