Abortion in Tonga is severely restricted by criminal law, as nearly all abortions are illegal. Abortions are illegal in Tonga, unless medical authorities cite preservation of maternal health, with up to three years' imprisonment for any woman who induces an abortion, and up to seven years' imprisonment for anyone with intent to procure a miscarriage who administers any drug or noxious thing, or unlawfully uses any means.
