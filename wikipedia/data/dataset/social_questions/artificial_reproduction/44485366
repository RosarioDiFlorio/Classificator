Abortion in Vanuatu is severely restricted by criminal law. Since 1981, abortions have been illegal in Vanuatu, unless medical authorities cite preservation of maternal health, with up to two years imprisonment for any woman who induces an abortion. Abortion is illegal in cases of rape, incest, and threats to fetal health.
