Libertarians promote individual liberty and seek to minimize the role of the state. In the abortion debate some libertarians support legal access to abortion as part of their general support for individual rights, especially in regard to what they consider to be a woman's right to control her body. Religious right and intellectual conservatives have attacked such libertarians for supporting abortion rights, especially since the demise of the Soviet Union. Other libertarians claim libertarian principles such as the non-aggression principle apply to human beings from conception, and that the universal right to life thus applies to fetuses in the womb. Some of those individuals express opposition to legal abortion.
