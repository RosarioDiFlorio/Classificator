Vaginal tightening is the tightening of the pelvic muscles to achieve or maintain the right degree of elasticity of the pelvic floor muscles.
These muscles must be able to contract to maintain continence, and to relax allowing for urination and bowel movements, and for sexual intercourse as well as for giving birth. They also support and protect the organs of the abdomen and hold the bladder in its proper place.
The pelvic muscles can become stretched or weakened due to ageing and more specifically due to pregnancy. This often happens after a difficult childbirth which overstretches or tears the pelvic muscles and can also be the result of giving birth to several babies within a very short time span. Their under use can also cause pelvic floor weakness. Like for any other muscle, pelvic muscles need exercise to work well. In the same vein, the change in hormones related to menopause could weaken these muscles, as well as damage caused through long term straining, chronic constipation or cough or overweight.
Vaginal tightening can be achieved in different ways, all effective in their own way and can be complementary.
