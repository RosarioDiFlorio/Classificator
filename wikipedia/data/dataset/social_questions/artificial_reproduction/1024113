Abortion in Chile is legal in the following cases: when the mother's life is at risk, when the fetus will not survive the pregnancy, and in the case of rape during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (14 weeks, if the woman is under 14 years old). Between 1989 and 2017 Chile had one of the most restrictive abortion policies in the world, criminalizing its practice without exception.
The bill permitting abortion was approved by the National Congress in August 2017, and became law a month later after surviving a constitutional challenge brought by the conservative opposition. Medical coverage will be available before the end of 2017.
