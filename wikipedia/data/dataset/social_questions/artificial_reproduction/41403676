A baby stag is a celebratory event held for a man shortly before he enters fatherhood to celebrate his "last days before fatherhood" or merely to spend time with his male friends. The baby stag is usually planned by a friend or a group of friends of the future father and is modeled after that of a bachelor party. Typically the event is held before or early in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
As per North American tradition, women will hold a baby shower for female friends of the mother which entails a gathering to celebrate the future birth of their child. The baby stag was created for the father as soon-to-be fathers have historically been excluded from holding specific events to celebrate their future parenthood.
