The placental microbiome is the nonpathogenic, commensal bacteria present in a healthy human placenta and is distinct from bacteria that cause infection and preterm birth in chorioamnionitis. Until recently, the healthy placenta was considered to be a sterile organ but now genera and species have been identified that reside in the basal layer.
The placental microbiome more closely resembles that of the oral microbiome than either the vaginal or rectal microbiome.
