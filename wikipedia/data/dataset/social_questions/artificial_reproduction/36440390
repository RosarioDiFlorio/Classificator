Bei Bei Shuai (Chinese: 帅贝贝) is a Chinese immigrant to the United States who became the subject of international public attention from 2011 to 2013 when the authorities of the state of Indiana charged her with murder and attempted feticide after her failed suicide attempt allegedly resulted in the death of the child she was pregnant with. The British newspaper The Guardian described Shuai's case as well as those of other women who lose their unborn babies in cases of maternal drug addiction or a failed suicide attempt, as part of a "creeping criminalisation of pregnancy across America".
