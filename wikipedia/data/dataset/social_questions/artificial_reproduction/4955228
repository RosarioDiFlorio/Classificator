Spermatogenesis arrest is a complex process of interruption in the differentiation of germinal cells of specific cellular type, which elicits an altered spermatozoa formation. Spermatogenic arrest is usually due to genetic factors resulting in irreversible azoospermia. However some cases may be consecutive to hormonal, thermic, or toxic factors and may be reversible either spontaneously or after a specific treatment.
