The sexuality of Abraham Lincoln (1809â€“1865), the 16th President of the United States, has been a topic of debate among some scholars. Lincoln was married to Mary Todd from November 4, 1842, until his death on April 15, 1865, and fathered four children with her. The topic came to greater attention due to a 2005 book The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln by psychologist C. A. Tripp, which described Lincoln as allegedly having a detached relationship with women, in contrast with a close male friend he allegedly shared a bed with. According to the book Lincoln the Unknown, Lincoln chose to spend several months of the year practicing law on a circuit that kept him living separately from his wife. In 1928, a prominent writer had pointed to a close male friend of the young Lincoln as a possible lover that was denounced as absurd at the time.
