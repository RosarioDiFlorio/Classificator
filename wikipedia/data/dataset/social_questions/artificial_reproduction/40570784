Dannah Gresh (born 1967) is a best-selling Christian author and public speaker on the topic of sexual theology and Christian parenting. She uses social science and medical research to defend a conservative position on relationships and gender. Gresh's conversational and edgy speaking style generates tremendous listener response. In addition, FamilyLife Today, Midday Connection and Focus on the Family have included their television and radio interviews with Gresh in “best of” annual showcases.
The foundation behind all of Gresh’s work is her belief in having a strong parent/child relationship. This belief led her to create Secret Keeper Girl, a connecting event for 8-12 year old girls and their mothers. The event will visits about 120 cities nationwide each year, during which dynamic 20-something women and wise, seasoned moms teach modesty and true beauty through interactive experiences like fashion shows, games, and more. Dannah also offers an event for mothers who are seeking to connect to their teen daughter called Pure Freedom. Over 500,000 have attended her live events.
Gresh is now the author of over 30 titles including What Are You Waiting For? The One Thing No One Ever Tells You About Sex, Six Ways to Keep the "Little" in Your Girl, Six Ways to Keep the "Good" in Your Boy, Get Lost: Your Guide to Finding True Love, and Lies Young Women Believe: And the Truth that Sets Them Free which she co-authored with Nancy Leigh DeMoss.
