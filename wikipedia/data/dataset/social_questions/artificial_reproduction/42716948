Induction of final maturation of oocytes is a procedure that is usually performed as part of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to render the oocytes fully developed and thereby resulting in optimal pregnancy chances. It is basically a replacement for the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge whose effects include final maturation in natural menstrual cycles.
The main medications used for induction of final maturation are human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and GnRH agonist. In fresh (rather than frozen) autologous cycles of in vitro fertilization, final oocyte maturation triggering with GnRH agonist instead of hCG decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but decreases live birth rate. In cycles followed by oocyte donation, use of GnRH agonists instead of hCG decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate.
