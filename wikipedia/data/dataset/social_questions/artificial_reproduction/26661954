Spalding's sign is a sign used in obstetrics. It is named for Alfred Baker Spalding.
It is an indicator of fetal death. When fetal death has occurred, abdominal sonar examination may reveal an overriding of the fetal cranial bones. Most estimates place the precise time of fetal death at about 4â€“7 days before overlapping and separation of the fetal skull bones appear.
