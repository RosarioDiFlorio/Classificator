Rho(D) immune globulin is a medication used to prevent Rh isoimmunization in mothers who are Rh negative and to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in people who are Rh positive. It is often given both during and following pregnancy. It may also be used when Rh negative people are given Rh positive blood. It is given by injection into muscle or a vein. A single dose lasts 2 to 4 weeks.
Common side effects include fever, headache, pain at the site of injection, and red blood cell breakdown. Other side effects include allergic reactions, kidney problems, and a very small risk of viral infections. In those with ITP the amount of red blood cell breakdown may be significant. Use is safe with breastfeeding. Rho(D) immune globulin is made up of antibodies to the antigen Rho(D) present on some red blood cells. It is believed to work by blocking a person's immune system from recognizing this antigen.
Rho(D) immune globulin came into medical use in the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom a 1500 unit (300 mcg) vial costs the NHS about 58.00 pounds. In the United States a course of treatment costs more than 200 USD. It is made from human blood plasma.
