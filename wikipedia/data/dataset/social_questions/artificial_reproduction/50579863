Abortion in Oklahoma is legal under United States law, following the decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973. In 1992, the Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey upheld the legality of abortion but granted states permission to create restrictions, so long as they did not create an "undue burden" for women who sought abortion.
Oklahoma has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US. 2016 was the first legislative session in over a decade that did not see an abortion restriction pass. In 2016, Oklahoma legislators approved Senate Bill 1118, which would criminalize abortion providers and charge them with first degree murder. The felony would be punishable by up to three years imprisonment, and the doctor would lose their medical license. Critics denounce the bill as breaking federal law that permits women to seek an abortion. If enacted, opponents of the measure have promised to challenge its constitutionality in the courts. On May 20, 2016, Governor Mary Fallin vetoed the bill before it could become law, citing its wording as too vague to withstand a legal challenge.
In 2016, a law called the Humanity of the Unborn Act, which would have approved government mandated signage in public women's restrooms across the state, was revised only to require additional signage in abortion clinics. State Rep. Justin Humphrey proposed legislation that would require a pregnant woman to ask her sexual partner for permission to access abortion care. State Rep. George Faught authored legislation to ban abortion in the event of fetal genetic abnormalities, without exceptions for rape or incest. Faught defended the bill, saying, in reference to rape and incest, “God can bring beauty from ashes.” His comments drew further criticism from opponents in the Oklahoma House.
