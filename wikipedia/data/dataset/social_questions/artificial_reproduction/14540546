The corona of glans penis refers to the circumference of the base of the glans penis in human males which forms a rounded projecting border, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis.
It is the location where some males may develop Hirsuties papillaris genitalis, or "pearly penile papules", a common and harmless condition.
