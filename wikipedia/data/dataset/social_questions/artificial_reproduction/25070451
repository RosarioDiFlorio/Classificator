Psychiatric disorders of childbirth are mental disorders developed by the mother related to the delivery process itself. They overlap with the Organic prepartum and postpartum psychoses and other psychiatric conditions associated with having children. ; symptoms include rage, or in rare cases, neonaticide.
There are many distinct forms of psychosis which start during pregnancy (prepartum) or after delivery (postpartum). In Europe and North America, only one – polymorphic psychosis (postpartum psychosis)– is commonly seen. Postpartum bipolar disorder, referred to in the DSM-5 as bipolar, peripartum onset, is a separate condition with no psychotic features. Historically, about one quarter of psychoses after childbirth were 'organic' and would now be classified as a form of delirium. This means that a severe mental disturbance, usually in the form of delirium, develops as a complication of a somatic illness.
