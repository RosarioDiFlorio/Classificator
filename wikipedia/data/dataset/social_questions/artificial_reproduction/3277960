Unassisted childbirth (UC) refers to the process of intentionally giving birth without the assistance of a medical birth attendant. It may also be known as freebirth, DIY (do-it-yourself) birth, unhindered birth, and unassisted home birth.
Unassisted childbirth is by definition a planned process, and is thus distinct from unassisted birth due to reasons of emergency, lack of access to a skilled birth attendant, or other. It is also different from homebirth, although most UCs do happen within the home.
Vital Statistics Canada defines an "unassisted/unattended" birth as one that takes plece without a registered medical attendant, regardless of what other birth professionals may have been in attendance (doulas, non-medical or traditional birth attendants, etc.) Many "unassisted" births involve the attendance of a non-medical birth attendant, though the definition of unassisted birth sometimes means there is only family or peers in attendance and no professional support whatsoever.
