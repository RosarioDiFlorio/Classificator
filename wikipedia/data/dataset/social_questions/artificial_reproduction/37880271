Promiscuity tends to be frowned upon by many societies, expecting most members to have committed, long-term relationships with single partners. Female promiscuity is not unique to humans, and has been observed in other animals, including primates.
Most societies have historically been more critical of women's promiscuity than of heterosexual men's. Among women, as well as men, inclination for sex outside of committed relationships is correlated with sex drive, but social and cultural factors have also been observed to influence sexual behavior and opinion.
