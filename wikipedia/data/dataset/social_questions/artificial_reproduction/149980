Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), also known as fetal growth restriction (FGR) or intrauterine growth retardation, refers to poor growth of a fetus while in the mother's womb during pregnancy. The causes can be many, but most often involve poor maternal nutrition or lack of adequate oxygen supply to the fetus.
At least 60% of the 4 million neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth weight (LBW), caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, and genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, demonstrating that under-nutrition is already a leading health problem at birth.
Intrauterine growth restriction can result in a baby being Small for Gestational Age (SGA), which is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age. At the end of pregnancy, it can result in a low birth weight.
