A push present is a gift one gives to an expectant mother to mark the occasion of her giving birth. Though most often given by the father, in practice the present may be given by anyone before or after childbirth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents is a recent trend and appears to be growing in the United States. Etiquette experts suggest that this gift is not obligatory nor akin to the same gift-giving etiquette as one would expect for a wedding.
