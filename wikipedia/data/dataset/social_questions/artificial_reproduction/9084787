A female urination device, female urination aid, or stand-to-pee device (STP) is a device which aids a woman or a trans man to urinate while standing upright. Variations include basic disposable funnels to more elaborate reusable designs. Female urination devices have increased in popularity since the 1990s. They are used for outdoor pursuits, and for medical reasons.
In addition, fixed installation and relocatable urinals are available for use by girls and women. Some designs require the user to supply their own personal female urination device, while other designs do not have this expectation.
