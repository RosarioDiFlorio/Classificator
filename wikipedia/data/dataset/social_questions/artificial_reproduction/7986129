The Concept Foundation is a non-profit foundation which was established by the UNDP/UNFPA/WHO/WB Special program in Reproductive Health (WHO/HRP), PATH, the World Bank in 1989 in Bangkok, Thailand, "as a mechanism through which WHO’s rights associated with an injectable contraceptive, Cyclofem, could be licensed to potential producers in developing countries". Cyclofem, also known as Lunelle and Cyclo-Provera, is a once-a-month injectable contraceptive which contains 25 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate—the same ingredient as Depo Provera—and 5 mg of estradiol cypionate.
The Concept Foundation is currently an active partner in a total of 10 public-private partnerships involving pharmaceutical manufacturers. Since its inception in 1989, more than 120 million doses of Cyclofem have been manufactured and sold world wide. Concept Foundation products have been manufactured in 8 different countries and are made available in more than 30 developing countries.
