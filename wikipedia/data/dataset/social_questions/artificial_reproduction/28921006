Abortion in Liechtenstein is illegal in almost all circumstances, punishable by prison terms for the woman and the physician. An attempt to legalize it in 2011 was defeated by voters, and in April and November 2012, the Landtag failed to advance proposals to loosen abortion laws.
Section 96 of the Liechtenstein Penal Code, 1987, provides that abortion is illegal except in cases of serious danger to the woman's life or health that can only be prevented with an abortion, or when the woman was under the age of 14 at conception and unmarried to the man who impregnated her. Illegal abortions are punishable by prison terms of up to three years for the physician, and up to one year for the woman. Section 98 of the Penal Code additionally criminalizes performing or encouraging an abortion without a careful inquiry into its medical necessity, and any type of promotion of abortion services.
In the double referendum on abortion on 27 November 2005, 81% of voters rejected a "For Life" proposal to prohibit all abortion, while 80% passed the Landtag's counterproposal, which had been condemned by anti-abortion campaigners.
A proposal to legalize abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy or when the child would be disabled was defeated by 52.3% of voters in the 2011 referendum held on 18 September. Prince Alois had previously threatened to veto the proposal if it passed.
