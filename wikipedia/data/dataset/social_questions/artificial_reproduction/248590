Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as lutropin and sometimes lutrophin) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. In females, an acute rise of LH ("LH surge") triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cellâ€“stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with FSH.
