The uterine horns are the points where the uterus and the fallopian tubes meet. They are one of the points of attachment for the round ligament of uterus (the other being the mons pubis).
The uterine horns are far more prominent in other animals (such as cows and cats) than they are in humans. In the cat, implantation of the embryo occurs in one of the two uterine horns, not the body of the uterus itself.
Occasionally, if a fallopian tube does not connect, the uterine horn will fill with blood each month, and a minor one day surgery will be performed to remove it. Often, people who are born with this have trouble getting pregnant, as they only can be fertilised once every other month, as both ovaries are functional. The spare egg, that cannot travel the fallopian tube, is absorbed into the body.
