Kegel exercise, also known as pelvic floor exercise, consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, now sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Kegel muscles". The exercise can be performed multiple times each day, for several minutes at a time, for one to three months, to begin to have an effect. At the bottom of the pelvis, several layers of muscle stretch between the legs. The muscles attach to the front, back, and sides of the pelvic bone.
Kegel exercises can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up the bladder and help keep it from leaking.  Exercises are usually done to reduce urinary stress incontinence (especially after childbirth) and reduce premature ejaculatory in men.
Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises. They were first described in 1948 by Arnold Kegel.
