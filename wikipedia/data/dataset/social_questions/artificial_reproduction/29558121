A baby planner is a private maternity consultant. They meet with expecting and new parents and offer education, resources and support. They may also recommend products, resources, services, support and additional education for their clients.
Baby planners may work with expecting parents throughout the entire duration of their pregnancy or may meet with them for just a few sessions.
While baby planners are involved with helping expecting parents plan their pregnancies and guiding new parents through the postpartum period, baby planners who do not hold additional medical licensing are not medical professionals and do not provide medical opinions, treatments, examinations or diagnoses.
