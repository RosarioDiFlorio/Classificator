Maternal somatic support after brain death occurs when a brain dead patient is pregnant and her body is kept alive to deliver a fetus. It occurs very rarely internationally. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990â€“96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age.
