The Prince Edward Island Reproductive Rights Organization (PRRO) is a special interest group advocating to have abortions performed in Prince Edward Island. To date, PEI is the only Canadian province that does not perform surgical abortions on its own soil. Abortions are provided by the PEI health care system at a nearby Halifax medical center. PRRO became active in November 2011, when they held a public education rally outside of the provincial legislature.
The Prince Edward Island Reproductive Rights Organization held a second rally on October 20, 2012, and were joined by other pro-choice groups across the country who were demanding abortion access on Prince Edward Island as their primary objective.
PRRO was founded by students of a local college.
