Assisted zona hatching (AZH) is a procedure of assisted reproductive technology in which a small hole is made in the zona pellucida, using a micromanipulator, thereby facilitating for zona hatching to occur. Zona hatching is where the blastocyst gets rid of the surrounding zona pellucida to be able to implant in the uterus.
