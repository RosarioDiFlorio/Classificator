A vestibulectomy is a gynecological surgical procedure that can be used to treat vulvar pain and vulvar vestibulitis. The amount of tissue removed during the surgery can vary. The surgery takes place below the urinary meatus, down to the border of the perineal area and includes the fourchette. Incisions are made on each side adjacent and parallel to the labia minora. The structures removed are the hymen, mucous membrane, Bartholin glands ducts and minor vestibular glands. In some surgeries, the amount of tissue removed is not so extensive. Vaginal mucosa tissue remains attached and then is pulled downward to cover the area where tissue was removed. This surgery is most often used to treat vulvodynia and lichen sclerosus.
Complications related to vestibulectomy include bleeding, infection. Long-term complications can be weakness of the anal muscles, cosmetic changes, development of a Bartholin's cyst, a decline in vaginal lubrication. Reports of satisfaction with the outcome of the surgical procedure can be as high as 90%.
