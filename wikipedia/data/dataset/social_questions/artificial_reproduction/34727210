The North Carolina Women's Right to Know Act (House Bill 854 / S.L. 2011-405) is a recently passed North Carolina act creating a "more stringent abortion law" and it has been faced with extensive criticism. The law was passed and went into effect in October 2011. The bill outlines several new stipulations which must be met and carried out before a woman can receive an abortion. It was originally vetoed by Governor Bev Perdue but the veto was overridden by the General Assembly. "Legal challenges have temporarily blocked similar laws in Texas and Oklahoma. North Carolina is the third state to require a provider to place ultrasound images in a womanâ€™s line of sight and to describe them in detail".
