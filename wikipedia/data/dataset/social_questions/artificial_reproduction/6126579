Transgender sexuality is the sexuality of transgender people.
Historically, studies assumed that transgender sexuality might be distinct from human sexuality, as experienced by all others. For much of the 20th century, what was described as "transsexualism" was believed to be sexual in nature, and so was defined along these terms.
In fact, like all other genders, transgender people exhibit the full range of possible sexual orientations and interests, including the potential for a lack of sexual attraction.
