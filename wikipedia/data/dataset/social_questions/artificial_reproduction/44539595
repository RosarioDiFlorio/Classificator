Abortion in Fiji is legal if the abortion will save the woman's life or if the pregnancy gravely endangers the woman's physical or mental health. In 2010, abortions to end pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest became legally available to women. In Fiji, any approved abortion requires authorisation from a physician.
