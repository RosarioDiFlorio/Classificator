In methods of abortion, dilation and evacuation (D&E also sometimes called dilation and extraction) is the dilation of the cervix and surgical evacuation of the contents of the uterus. It is a method of abortion as well as a therapeutic procedure used after miscarriage to prevent infection by ensuring that the uterus is fully evacuated.
In various health care centers it may be called by different names:
D&E (Dilation and evacuation)
ERPOC (Evacuation of Retained Products of Conception)
TOP or STOP ((Surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy)
D&E normally refers to a specific second trimester procedure. However, some sources use the term D&E to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and evacuation, which includes the first trimester procedures of manual and electric vacuum aspiration.
