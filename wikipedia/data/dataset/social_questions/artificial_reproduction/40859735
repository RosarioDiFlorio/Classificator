Celibacy syndrome (Japanese: セックスしない症候群, sekkusu shinai shōkōgun) is a media hypothesis proposing that a growing number of Japanese adults have lost interest in sexual activity and have also lost interest in romantic love, dating and marriage. The theory has been reported by unknown members of "Japan's media" according to journalist Abigail Haworth of the Guardian. Following the report, the theory gained widespread attention in English media outlets in 2013, and was subsequently refuted by several journalists and bloggers.
