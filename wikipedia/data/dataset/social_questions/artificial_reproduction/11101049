Forceps are a surgical instrument that resembles a pair of tongs and can be used in surgery for grabbing, manoeuvering, or removing various things within or from the body. They can be used to assist the delivery of a baby as an alternative to the ventouse (vacuum extraction) method. They are sometimes referred to as obstetrical forceps.
