Uterine serpins are members of the A clade of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of proteins and are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. These proteins appear to be inactive protease inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to regulate immune function or participate in transplacental transport.
