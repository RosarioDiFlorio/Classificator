Richard Starkie was a British doctor who was charged with distributing illegal narcotics while performing abortions in 1921. Starkie, a former police surgeon, began illegally performing abortions during the early 1900s. He continued performing abortions until his arrest on July 17, 1921 and was charged with administering narcotics for the purpose of performing an abortion on a married woman as well as prior abortions on four unmarried patients. Although acquitted on abortion charges, he was found guilty for administering drugs and sentenced to nine months imprisonment at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. He was reportedly met by about 600 of his former patients following his release.
