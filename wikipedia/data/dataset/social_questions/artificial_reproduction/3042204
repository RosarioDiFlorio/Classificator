Male infertility refers to a male's inability to cause pregnancy in a fertile female. In humans it accounts for 40â€“50% of infertility. It affects approximately 7% of all men. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.
