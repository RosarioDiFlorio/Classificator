Birthright International is an international pro-life organization of crisis pregnancy centers. It offers a range of services designed to "help support a woman's desire not to have an abortion," including referrals to legal, medical and psychological services, as well as a range of community support assistance such as financial aid.
The organization, founded in 1968 by Louise Summerhill, has its international headquarters in Toronto, Ontario Canada, and has nearly 300 chapters worldwide, primarily in Canada and the United States, but also in South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, and Colombia.
Birthright has a philosophy of avoiding direct involvement in pro-life political advocacy.
