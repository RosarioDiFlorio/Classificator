Elizabeth Jordan Carr (born December 28, 1981 at 7:46 am) is the United States' first baby born from the in-vitro fertilization procedure and the 15th in the world. The technique was conducted at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk under the direction of Doctors Howard Jones and Georgeanna Seegar Jones, who were the first to attempt the process in the United States. She was delivered at Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia by Dr. Mason Andrews weighing 5 pounds 12 ounces (about 2600 g).
The parents of Carr were Judith Carr, a 28-year-old schoolteacher at the time, and her husband, Roger Carr, 30, of Westminster, Massachusetts. Elizabeth's mother had been unable to conceive normally because complications during earlier unsuccessful pregnancies had forced removal of her fallopian tubes.
A graduate of Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts, Carr worked as a journalist for a newspaper in Maine, Central Maine Newspapers in Augusta, which publishes the Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel. They are part of the Seattle Times Family group of newspapers. Following her time in Maine, Carr began work at Boston.com, the Boston Globe's online presence. She was recently named editor of Dailybreak.com.
Carr was named number one Portland Magazine's 2007 list of Maine's Most Intriguing People.
Dr. Howard Jones, 98, visits with Elizabeth Carr Comeau and her husband, David, at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk on Thursday, July 24, 2008.
On August 5, 2010, Carr gave birth to her first child, Trevor James Comeau. He was conceived naturally.
