Postpartum confinement (also known as "Sitting the month": 坐月子 "Zuo Yue Zi" in Mandarin or 坐月 "Co5 Jyut2" in Cantonese) is a Chinese custom practised by many women of East Asian descent for recovery following birth, typically for 1 month, with regional variations at different lengths from 40 days, 2 months to 100 days. Similar practices are popular among Japanese women called 産後の肥立ち and Korean women called 삼칠일 "Samchilil" for at least 21 days. The custom is referred to as 'confinement' as women are advised to stay indoors for recovery from the trauma of birth and feed the newborn baby. Aspects of traditional Chinese medicine are included, with a special focus on eating foods considered to be nourishing for the body and help with the production of breastmilk. In Guangdong and neighboring regions, new mothers are barred from visitors until the baby is 12 days old, marked by a celebration called 'Twelve mornings' (known as 十二朝). From this day onwards, Cantonese families with a new baby usually share their joy through giving away food gifts such as pork knuckles with ginger and vinegar, while some families mark the occasion by paying tribute to their ancestors. In ancient China, women of certain ethnic groups in the South would resume work right after birth, and allow the men to practice postpartum confinement instead.
