Unintended pregnancies are pregnancies that are mistimed, unplanned or unwanted at the time of conception. Unintended pregnancies may also result from rape, incest or various other forms of forced or unwanted sex.
Vaginal sexual activity without the use of contraception through choice or coercion is the predominant cause of unintended pregnancy. The incorrect use of a contraceptive method, and failure of the method chosen also contributing. Available contraception methods include use of birth control pills, a condom, intrauterine device (IUD, IUC, IUS), contraceptive implant (implanon/nexplanon), hormonal patch, hormonal ring, cervical caps, diaphragms, spermicides, or sterilization. Women choose to use a contraceptive method based on method efficacy, medical considerations, side effects, convenience, availability, friends' or family members' experience, religious views, and many other factors. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally or politically undesirable.
Unintended pregnancies may be unwanted pregnancies or mistimed pregnancies. Worldwide, 38% of pregnancies (about 80 million pregnancies) were unintended in 1999. Unintended pregnancies are the main reason for induced abortions, resulting in about 42 million induced abortions; not all unintended pregnancies result in abortions or unwanted children. Unintended pregnancy has been linked to numerous maternal and child health problems. States that have legalized abortions and easier access to abortions have lower rates of child neglect and better living conditions for children overall. Which can be attributed to the fact that children in those states are more likely to be wanted when they are born.
