Vaginal seeding is a procedure whereby vaginal fluids (and hence vaginal microbes) are applied to a new-born child delivered by caesarean section.
The purpose is to create a biome that is equivalent to a baby delivered vaginally. The motivation is that some research has linked delivery by caesarean section to a higher rate of asthma, propensity to become overweight, and autoimmune conditions.
