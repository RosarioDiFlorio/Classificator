Male pregnancy is the incubation of one or more embryos or fetuses by male members of some species. In nearly all heterogamous animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the Syngnathidae family (pipefish, seahorses and the leafy seadragon), males perform this function. Some humans who, based on their gender identity, are men have become pregnant. Male humans incubating fetuses are also a recurring theme in speculative fiction.
