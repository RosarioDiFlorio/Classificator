A menstrual cup is a feminine hygiene product that is inserted into the vagina during menstruation. Its purpose is to prevent menstrual fluid (blood containing uterine lining) from leaking onto clothes. Menstrual cups are usually made of flexible medical grade silicone and shaped like a bell with a stem. The stem is used for ease of insertion and removal. The bell-shaped cup seals against the vaginal wall just below the cervix. Every 4â€“24 hours (depending the amount of flow), the cup is removed, emptied and rinsed, then reinserted.
Unlike tampons and pads, cups collect menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it. One cup is reusable for up to five years or more. This makes the overall long-term cost lower than the cost of disposable tampons or pads. However, the initial upfront cost is higher. Menstrual cups are also promoted as more practical and eco-friendly than pads and tampons.
