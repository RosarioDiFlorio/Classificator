Erotic target location error (ETLE) is having a sexual preference or strong sexual interest in features that are somewhere other than on one's sexual partners.
When one's sexual arousal is based on imagining oneself in another physical form (such as an animal, an infant, or an amputee) the erotic target is said to be one's self, or erotic target identity inversion.
The terms "erotic target location error" and "erotic target identity inversion" were first used in 1993 by sexologist Ray Blanchard.
