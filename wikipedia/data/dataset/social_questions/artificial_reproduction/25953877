Abortion in Hungary was subject to legal liberalization as early as 1953 The abortion law was changed three times since then, in 1956, 1973, and 1992.  As a result of that Hungary has a liberal abortion law. While women have to seek the approval of a committee before having an abortion, a number of various hypothetical situations have been placed into the law allowing for an abortion, so the request has become a mere formality.
Abortion is allowed up to twelve weeks. But in cases of severe disability, it can be 24 weeks. However, counselling sessions are required for women who want to have an abortion and they must wait minimum three days between requesting an abortion and having one.
