Mary Anne "Mamie" Cadden (27 October 1891 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA â€“ 20 April 1959 in Dublin, Ireland) was an Irish midwife, backstreet abortionist, and convicted murderer. She was born October 27th, 1891 in Scranton, Pennsylvania to the Irish parents of Patrick and Mary Caden. In 1895, Cadden and her family returned to Ireland in County Mayo, where she completed years of schooling. Once she obtained her spot on the list of licensed midwives in Dublin, she opened a series of maternity nursing homes to aid women with health issues and to perform illegal abortions. After a series of criminal convictions, Cadden lost her status as a licensed midwife. In 1944, Cadden was charged and convicted for the murder of 33 year old Helen O'Reilly. She was sentenced to life in prison, and after a year at Mountjoy prison, she was declared insane and moved to the criminal lunatic asylum Dundrum, where she died of a heart attack on April 20th, 1959. Although many people committed backstreet abortions during the period of Cadden's life, Cadden was the only person in Ireland to receive the death penalty for a maternal death occurring as a result of an abortion. As the most notorious Irish abortionist, the term 'Nurse Cadden' has become synonymous with evil.
