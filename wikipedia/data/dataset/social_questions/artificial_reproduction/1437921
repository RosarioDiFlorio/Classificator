Edwin Carlyle "Carl" Wood, AC, CBE, FRCS, FRANZCOG (28 May 1929 â€“ 23 September 2011) was a prominent Australian gynaecologist, best known for his pioneering work developing and commercialising the technique of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). He gained considerable international and national attention for his wide-ranging contributions in the field of women's health over a period of almost 50 years, although not all of it was positive given the controversial nature of many of his endeavours.
