An uterine orgasm or "womb orgasm" is an orgasm of the uterus, usually by stimulation of an area just outside the cervix, of the cervix itself or by stimulation of the vaginal wall adjacent to this organ. Uterine orgasms can also occur without stimulation. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that this is a type of sexual climax.
