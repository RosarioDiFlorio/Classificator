The National Gamete Donation Service (NGDS) raises awareness of the national shortage of sperm, egg and embryo donors in the UK. Its aim is to recruit donors to alleviate the shortage, and it provides information on egg, sperm and embryo donation and donor recruitment in the UK.
It works closely with clinics, donors, recipients, the Department of Health, the HFEA, other professional organisations and the media, and provides impartial and confidential information to all.
