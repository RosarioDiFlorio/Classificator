A forced orgasm is a form of orgasm control where the active partner sexually stimulates a submissive partner to the point of the submissive's involuntary orgasm, with the submissive attempting to restrain the onset of orgasm. In BDSM or other sexual roleplay, the submissive partner can be put in physical restraints, to enable the active partner to control the rate and duration of stimulation.
