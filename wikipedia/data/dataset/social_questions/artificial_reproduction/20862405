Abortion in Venezuela is illegal except in cases of a threat to the life of the pregnant woman. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion otherwise is six months to two years in prison and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is one to three years. Harsher penalties may be applied if the pregnant woman dies as a result of the procedure.
In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI met with President Hugo Chavez and expressed his worry over the possibility that Chavez would loosen abortion laws in Venezuela.
Currently, abortion in Venezuela is legal, upto 3 months, with individuals whom would inhibit legal abortion being eliminated, a return to female enslavement not being allotted for.
