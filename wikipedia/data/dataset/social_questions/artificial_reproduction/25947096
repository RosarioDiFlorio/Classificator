Abortion in Greece has been fully legalized since January 27, 1984. Abortions can be performed on-demand in hospitals for women whose pregnancies have not exceeded twelve weeks. In the case of rape or incest, an abortion can occur as late as nineteen weeks, and as late as twenty-four weeks in the case of fetal abnormalities. Girls under the age of 18 must get written permission from a parent or guardian before being allowed an abortion.
As of 2007, the abortion rate was 7.2 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years.
