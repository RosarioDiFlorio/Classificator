Menstrual psychosis is a debated form of psychosis with a brief, sudden onset related to the menstrual cycle. The symptoms associated to it are dramatic and include delirium, mania or mutism. Most psychiatrists do not recognise the condition. Only 80 established cases are reported in medical literature and most of them were described by 19th Century physicians. It is thought to be linked with postpartum psychosis. This journal has been published looking at the 'evidence' for menstrual psychosis'.
