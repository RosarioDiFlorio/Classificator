The bedding ceremony refers to the wedding custom of putting the newlywed couple together in the marital bed before numerous witnesses, thereby completing the marriage. In most traditions the newlyweds were put in bed by their family, friends, and neighbors.
The purpose of the ritual was to establish the consummation of the marriage, either factually (with the couple having their first sexual intercourse) or only symbolically,there fore the union could in some jurisdictions be annulled. It symbolized the community's involvement in the marriage and especially in the couple's sexual intimacy, but also their marital fidelity. The legally binding nature of the ceremony varied greatly from place to place and through time.
