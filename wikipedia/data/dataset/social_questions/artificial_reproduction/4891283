Cloth menstrual pads are cloth pads worn to absorb the menstrual flow during a woman's period. They are a type of reusable feminine hygiene product, and are an alternative to disposable sanitary napkins or to reusable menstrual cups. They are less expensive than disposable pads, reduce the amount of waste produced and may also have health benefits.
Generally they are made from layers of absorbent fabrics (such as cotton or hemp) which are worn by a woman while she is menstruating, for post-birth bleeding or any other situation where it is necessary to absorb the flow of blood from the vagina, or to protect underwear from regular discharge of vaginal fluids. After use, they are washed, dried and then reused.
