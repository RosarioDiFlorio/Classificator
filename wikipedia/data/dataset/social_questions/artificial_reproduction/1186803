The fundiform ligament or fundiform ligament of the penis is a specialization, thickening, of the superficial (Scarpa's) fascia extending from the linea alba of the lower abdominal wall.
It runs from the level of the pubic bone, laterally around the sides of the penis like a sling, and then unites at the base of the penis before going to the septum of the scrotum.
It is just superficial to the suspensory ligament.
Although rarely mentioned, this ligament is also found in females.
