Embryokines (Greek: embryuon "embryo" + kin≈çs "movement") are regulatory molecules produced by the reproductive tract that modulate embryonic development.
Among the molecules that function as embryokines are insulin-like growth factor-1, cytokines (e.g., colony stimulating factor 2), WNT regulatory proteins (i.e., DKK1 and members of the transforming growth factor family (e.g., activin).
