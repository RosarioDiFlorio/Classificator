Uterine hyperstimulation or hypertonic uterine dysfunction is a potential complication of labor induction. It is defined as either a series of single contractions lasting 2 minutes or more OR a contraction frequency of five or more in 10 minutes. Uterine hyperstimulation may result in fetal heart rate abnormalities, uterine rupture, or placental abruption. It is usually treated by administering terbutaline.
