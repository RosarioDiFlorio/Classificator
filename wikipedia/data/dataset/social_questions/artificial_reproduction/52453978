Miriam Friedman Menkin (8 August 1901 – June 8, 1992), née Miriam Friedman, was an American scientist who was most famous for her in vitro fertilization (IVF) research with John Rock. In February 1944, she became the first person to conceive human life outside of the body.
Menkin was born on August 8, 1901, in Riga, Latvia. She and her family moved to the United States two years after she was born. Her father worked as a doctor in New York City and was successful enough to let her family live comfortably. In 1922, Menkin graduated from Cornell University with an undergraduate degree in histology and comparative anatomy. She attended Columbia University for her graduate program and earned a master's degree in genetics only one year after graduating from Cornell. She taught biology and physiology for a short period while setting her sights on medical school. However, women were rarely admitted to medical school during this time period and Menkin was not accepted. Menkin married Valy Menkin, a Harvard medical student, in 1924. She still aimed to earn a Ph.D. in biology, but she needed to provide financial support while her husband finished medical school. Thus, Menkin obtained another undergraduate degree in secretarial studies from Simmons College. Menkin ended up finishing the Harvard Ph.D. requirements two separate times but did not receive a degree because she could not afford the course fees.
Menkin and Valy had two children: a son named Gabriel and a daughter named Lucy.
