The British Black Panthers or the British Black Panther movement (BBP) was a black power organization in the United Kingdom that fought for the rights of black people and peoples of colour in the country. The BBP were inspired by the US Black Panther Party, though they were unaffiliated with them. It included activists of Black as well as South Asian origin. The movement started in 1968 and lasted until around 1973.
