Power posing is a refuted hypothesis in psychology that claims that by assuming a "powerful" posture, subjects can induce positive hormonal and behavioral changes. It was introduced in a 2010 paper by Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy, and Andy Yap. The idea has been referred to as pseudoscience.
Scholars have reported being unable to replicate power posing effects in follow-up studies. The theory has been described as an example of the replication crisis in psychology, in which initially seductive theories could not be replicated on follow-up tests.
Dana Carney, the lead author of the original article, issued a statement in 2016 abandoning the theory: "I do not believe that 'power pose effects' are real...the evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable", while Cuddy has continued work on it.
