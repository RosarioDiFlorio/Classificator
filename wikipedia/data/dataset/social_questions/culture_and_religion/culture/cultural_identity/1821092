Iberian federalism, Pan-Iberism or simply Iberism (Spanish, Basque, Portuguese and Galician: Iberismo, Catalan: Iberisme) was a pan-nationalist ideology developed mainly during the beginning of the 19th century, supporting the federation into a single state of all the countries of the Iberian Peninsula under the name of Spain.
These unification ideas were promoted mainly by minority republican and socialist movements. There was never any popular support in Andorra, Gibraltar in favour of joining such a project.
