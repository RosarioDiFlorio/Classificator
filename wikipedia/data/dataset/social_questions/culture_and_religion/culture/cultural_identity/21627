A nation state, or nation-state, is a type of state that reflects both the political entity of a state and the cultural entity of a nation, this being from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and, potentially, its status as a sovereign state. A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity, whilst a nation is a cultural or ethnic one. The term "nation state" implies that the two coincide, in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it.
The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state, city state, empire, confederation, and other state formations with which it may overlap. The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the "nation state".
