Ethnopluralism or ethno-pluralism is a right-wing and neo-fascist approach to the diversity of different ethnic groups. It is proposed as an alternative to multiculturalism, and would involve separation and segregation of different ethnicities and cultures within a country, while allowing each group some degree of autonomy.
