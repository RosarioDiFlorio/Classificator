The National Party (Afrikaans: Nasionale Party) was a political party in South Africa founded in 1915 and disbanded in 1997. It first became the governing party of the country in 1924. It was in opposition during the World War II years but it returned to power and was again in the government from 4 June 1948 until 9 May 1994. At this time, it began implementing its policy of racial segregation, known as "Apartheid". The policies of the party also included the establishment of a republic, and the promotion of Afrikaner culture.
During the 1980s, large fractions of the party's support base whose members were unhappy about the party's gradual dismantling of the apartheid system left for the Conservative Party. After 1990, the National Party opened up its membership to all racial groups and rebranded itself a civic nationalist, rather than an ethnic nationalist, conservative political force. It participated in the Government of National Unity between 1994 and 1996. In an attempt to distance itself from its past, the party was renamed the New National Party in 1997. The attempt was largely unsuccessful and the new party was disbanded in 2005.
