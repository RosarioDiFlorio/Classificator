The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a United States based non-governmental organization (NGO) aimed at advancing fat acceptance, directed by Allen Steadham. Unlike the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA), the organisation has an international slant, and has several overseas branches, though many of its operations remain within the U.S. at present.
