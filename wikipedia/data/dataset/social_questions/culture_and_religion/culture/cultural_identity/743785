The ruling class is the social class of a given society that decides upon and sets that society's political agenda.
The sociologist C. Wright Mills (1916â€“1962), argued that the ruling class differs from the power elite. The latter simply refers to the small group of people with the most political power. Many of them are politicians, hired political managers, and military leaders. The ruling class are people who directly influence politics, education, and government with the use of wealth or power.
