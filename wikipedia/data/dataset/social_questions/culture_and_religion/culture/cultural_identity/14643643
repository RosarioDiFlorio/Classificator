Restrictions on political parties have existed in many countries at various times. In Uganda, for instance, political parties were restricted in their activities from 1986; in the non-party "Movement" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist but could not campaign in elections or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this 19-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.
Egypt has been criticized for restricting political party activity. In Europe; Germany, Italy, Turkey, and France have laws allowing the government to ban extremist groups, especially far-right and/or neo-nazi organizations.
