Women in Animation (WIA) is a non-profit organization with the purpose of furthering, promoting, and supporting female animators in the art, science and business of animation. WIA has chapters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Dublin, Pune, and Toronto. WIA feels that the lack of women in the animation profession is because "there has been very little work to intentionally change the status quo." In order to help women enter the animation profession, WIA has created a mentorship program, a voice over group, a scholarship, talks, and events. Marge Dean is the current co-president of WIA along with Kristy Scanlan.
