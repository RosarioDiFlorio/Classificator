Age Concern was the banner title used by a number of charitable organisations (NGOs) specifically concerned with the needs and interests of all older people (defined as those over the age of 50) based chiefly in the four countries of the United Kingdom.
In addition to providing practical support to individuals, Age Concern campaigned on issues such as age discrimination and pensions, and works to influence public opinion and government policy about older people.
Numerous Age Concern organisations have been established throughout the UK, working at national and local levels. At the national level, four Age Concern organisations covered England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Local Age Concerns vary from small village groups to countywide organisations. In England, over 370 of the individual charities were members of a national federation. Although each was a separate registered charity working under the Age Concern banner, the federation allowed members to collaborate at local, regional and national levels, to share resources, expertise and influence.
Similar organisations also exist in New Zealand, Spain, Ukraine, and elsewhere under similar banners. There is a strong international network considered to be one of the leading authorities on aging related issues.
Since the merger of Age Concern England and Help the Aged, Age UK has taken over the mantle of the national face of Age in the UK, and several local organisations have also adopted the new name, many local organisations continue to operate as Age Concerns.
