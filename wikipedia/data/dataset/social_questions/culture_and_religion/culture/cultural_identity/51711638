Cypriot nationalism, also known as Cypriotism, refers to one of the nationalisms of Cyprus, a shared identity of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots highlighting shared economic, political and social rights. Cypriot nationalism supports the reunification of Cyprus and the end of foreign interference (by Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom). Variants of this nationalism have been espoused by the leftist Progressive Party of Working People and the liberal United Democrats.
The successful Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which followed a coup d’état in Cyprus ordered by the military junta in Greece led to the marginalisation of Greek Cypriot nationalism and rise of Cypriotism, in opposition to Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot nationalism. Cypriotism and Greek Cypriot nationalism contrasts, with opposing views on Cyprus dispute causes and solution perspectives, corresponding to left-right political opposition. The slogan for Cypriotism is "Cyprus belongs to its people", while for Greek Cypriot nationalism it is "Cyprus belongs to Greece".
