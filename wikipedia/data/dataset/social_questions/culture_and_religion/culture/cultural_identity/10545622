Los Siete de la Raza was the label given to seven young Latinos from the Mission District of San Francisco, California who were involved in an altercation with the police that resulted in the death of an officer in 1969. The incident and the subsequent trial became a cause célèbre of the Latin-American community and the New Left. All seven were acquitted.
