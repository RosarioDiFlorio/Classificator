The 1931 Cyprus revolt or October Events (Greek: Οκτωβριανά, Oktovriana) was a anti-colonial revolt that took place in Cyprus, then a British crown colony, between 21 October and early November of 1931. The revolt was spearheaded by Greek Cypriot nationalists who advocated the Enosis (Union) of the island with Greece. The defeat of the rebels led to a period of repressive British rule known as "Palmerocracy" (Παλμεροκρατία), that would last until the beginning of World War II.
