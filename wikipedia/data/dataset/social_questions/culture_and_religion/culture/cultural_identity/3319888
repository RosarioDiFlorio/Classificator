Cunningham v Homma is a famous decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that upheld a British Columbia law that prohibited Japanese Canadians and Chinese Canadians from voting.
The Council held that, although the federal government had the exclusive jurisdiction over "naturalization", the right to vote in provincial elections was not inherent for naturalized citizens, but rather had to be legislated. Thus, it was up to the municipalities to determine who could have the right to vote and could prohibit any naturalized ethnic group they chose.
