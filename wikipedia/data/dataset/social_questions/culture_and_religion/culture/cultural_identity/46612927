On March 5, 2013, Parrish Dennison was shot and killed by Albuquerque police officers Perdue, Dedler and Aragon. Dennison was suspected of being one of three people attempting to sell a stolen banjo from the robbery of a local music store. Police fired on Dennison after they alleged that he pointed out a revolver on them. Dennison's mother, Charlotte Ingraham asserts that footage from a helicopter camera shows otherwise. Police video from after the shooting shows Dennison on the ground with a gun in his hand. Since the incident Dennison’s family has filed a lawsuit for a wrongful death. The shooting was ruled as justified by the Bernalillo County District Attorney's Office.
A witness to the incident says that Dennison did not point a gun at officers before the shooting, and that Dennison tried to break through a window but bounced off before police fired upon him. The witness said, "He never once pointed the gun at them, nothing… He just hit that window and just bounced back and then boom, boom, boom."
