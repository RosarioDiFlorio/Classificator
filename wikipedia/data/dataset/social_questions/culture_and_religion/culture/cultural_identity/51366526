Lochtegate is a name of a scandal involving United States swim team members Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz, and Jack Conger during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While initial news stories reported that Lochte and three other US swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint after a night out in Rio, later details emerged that the "armed robbers posing as police" were actually security guards at a gas station where the swimmers had urinated outside the bathroom and Lochte allegedly vandalized a framed poster, and ended with the swimmers providing money to the guards. Some of the swimmers were detained in Brazil as witnesses. Ultimately, the athletes each released statements, and one swimmer paid a fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to get his passport back. Lochte apologized for not being more candid about the gas station dispute and overshadowing the ongoing Olympic games, then lost four major sponsorships but gained others.
Lochte was charged in Brazil with falsely reporting a crime. The scandal gained significant media attention and "embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics." In July 2017 the court in Brazil dismissed the charges against Lochte, although the prosecutors can still appeal that dismissal.
