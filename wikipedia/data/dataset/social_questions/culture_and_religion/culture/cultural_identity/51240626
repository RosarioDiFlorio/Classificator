Cuspers is a name given to those born during the cusp years of two generations.
Following their "BridgeWorks Generations Survey", Lancaster and Stillman identified the following cuspers: Traditionalist/Baby Boomer, born 1940–1945; Baby Boomer/Generation Xer, born 1960–1965; Generation Xer/Millennial, born 1975–1980; and Millennial/Generation Z, born 1995-2000 
Other sources define the Generation X/Millennial cusp using later birth years. The Oregon Trail Generation, a name given to those born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years, uses the late 1970s to early 1980s. Other names for those born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years include Xennials and Generation Catalano.
Mark Wegierski of the Hudson Institute defines the Baby Boomer/Generation X cusp as between 1958–1967.
