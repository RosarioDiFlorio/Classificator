"Such a nasty woman" was a phrase used by 2016 American presidential candidate Donald Trump referring to opponent Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate. The phrase made worldwide news and became a viral call for some women voters and has also launched a feminist movement by the same name.
The phrase influenced memes, popular culture, books and magazines, art exhibits, theater and concert productions, and came to be known as a women's rights rallying cry by some in the media.
