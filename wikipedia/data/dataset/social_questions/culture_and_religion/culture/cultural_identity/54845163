Islam Nusantara or Indonesian (Islamic) model is a distinctive brand of Islam developed in Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago) at least since the 16th century, as a result of interaction, contextualization, indigenization, interpretation and vernacularization of universal Islamic values, according to socio-cultural reality of Indonesia. The term was first officially coined, proposed and promoted by Indonesian Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama in 2015, as an alternative for interpretation and representation of global Islam that currently dominated by Arabic or Middle Eastern perspectives.
Islam Nusantara is defined as an interpretation of Islam that takes into account local Indonesian customs in forming its fiqh. On June 2015, Indonesian President Joko Widodo has openly expressed his support for Islam Nusantara, which in his view is the moderate form of Islam compatible to Indonesian cultural values.
