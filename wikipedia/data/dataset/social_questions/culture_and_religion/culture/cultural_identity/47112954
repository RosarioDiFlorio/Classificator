The Organization for the Resolution of Agunot (ORA) is a New York-based nonprofit organization which advocates for the elimination of the infliction of abuse from the Jewish divorce process. The organization advocates on behalf of agunot and promotes the universal adoption of Jewish prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal (a get is a bill of Jewish divorce). Although 98% of the people ORA helps are women, they also support men who's wives refuse to accept a get. ORA views get-refusal is considered to be a form of domestic abuse. Rabbi Jeremy Stern is the Executive Director of the organization.
