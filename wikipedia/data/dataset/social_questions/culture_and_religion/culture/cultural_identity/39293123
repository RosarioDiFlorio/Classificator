The social news site Reddit has occasionally been the topic of controversy due to the presence of communities on the site (known as *subreddits*) devoted to explicit or controversial material. Yishan Wong, the site's former CEO, has stated that "We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it."
The subreddit /r/jailbait, devoted to suggestive or revealing photos of underage females, was one of the most prominent subreddits on the site before it was closed down in October 2011 following a report by CNN. The controversy surrounding /r/Creepshots, devoted to revealing or suggestive photos of women taken without their awareness or consent, occurred a year after /r/jailbait's closure. The /r/Creepshots controversy prompted a Gawker expos√© of one of the subreddit's moderators by Adrian Chen, which revealed the real-life identity of the user behind the account, Michael Brutsch. This started discussion in the media about the ethics of anonymity and outing on the Internet.
