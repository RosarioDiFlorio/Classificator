Olivia Anne Marie Forsyth (born May 1960) is a former spy for the apartheid government in South Africa. With the agent number RS407 and code name "Lara", Forsyth attained the rank of lieutenant in the Security Branch of the South African Police. Forsyth was recognised in intelligence circles as the apartheid government's "most outstanding spy" next to Craig Williamson, but was described by the African National Congress (ANC) as a "terrible, incompetent and inefficient spy".
Forsyth defected to the ANC but was later incarcerated in its prison camp, Quatro, in northern Angola. Following her escape into Luanda, Forsyth spent six months hiding in the British embassy there.
