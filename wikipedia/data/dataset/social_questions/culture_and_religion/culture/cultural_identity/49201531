Ten Years (Chinese: 十年; Jyutping: Sap6 Nin4) is a 2015 Hong Kong dystopian speculative fiction anthology film. It offers a vision of the semi-autonomous territory in the year 2025, with human rights and freedoms gradually diminishing as the mainland Chinese government exerts increasing influence there. Produced on a shoestring budget, the film was a surprise hit, beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens at the Yau Ma Tei cinema where it was first released.
Due to the film's sensitive political themes, mainland Chinese authorities censored reports mentioning Ten Years except in terms of condemnation. State television channels and major internet sites were prohibited from broadcasting the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards live as the film was nominated for Best Film, which it eventually won.
