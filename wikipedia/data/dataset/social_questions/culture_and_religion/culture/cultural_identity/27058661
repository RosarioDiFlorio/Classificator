Yugoslavism (Serbo-Croatian: Jugoslavizam/Југославизам, Slovene: Jugoslavizem) or Yugoslavdom (Serbo-Croatian: Jugoslovenstvo/Југословенство, Slovene: Jugoslovanstvo) refers to the nationalism or patriotism associated with South Slavs and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavism has historically advocated the union of all South Slav populated territories now composing Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia (and the disputed region of Kosovo), Slovenia, and Macedonia. It became a potent political force during World War I with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Yugoslavist militant Gavrilo Princip and the subsequent invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary. During the war the Yugoslav Committee composed of South Slav emigres from Austria-Hungary (including twelve Croats, three Serbs, and one Slovene), supported Serbia and vouched for the creation of a Yugoslav state. On 1 December 1918, King Alexander of Serbia proclaimed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, commonly known as "Yugoslavia". During the Yugoslav period, a Yugoslav identity (the "Yugoslav nation", Jugoslovenska nacija) was propagated.
