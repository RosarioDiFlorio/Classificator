Discrimination and violence against people of Chinese descent in Indonesia has been recorded since at least 1740, when the Dutch Colonial Government killed up to 10,000 people of Chinese descent during the Chinezenmoord. In the period since then, discrimination and violence have been recorded on the part of both foreign and Indonesian governments. The worst outbreaks took place in 1965 after the failed coup attempt during anti-communist purges and in 1998, when Chinese businesses were forcibly burned down and obliterated, while dozens of women raped during the May riots.
The discrimination can take the form of violence, diction or language use, and restrictive legislation. Due to this discrimination, Chinese Indonesians have suffered an identity crisis, unable to be accepted by both native Chinese and native Indonesians.
