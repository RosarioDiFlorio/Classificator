Since 1994, Youth on Board (YOB) has been a leader in the field of youth organizing and youth-adult partnerships in the Boston area and beyond. YOB is a youth-led, adult supported program where young people of color have the space and tools to recognize and utilize the power they hold to dismantle political and economic structures that reinforce inequity. YOB believes in the power of young people to transform their communities by recognizing that when young people are fully engaged—when their voices are heard, their opinions matter, and their unique perspective is respected—they commit themselves to making their schools, their communities, and their own lives better.
YOB has worked in more than 5 countries, 27 states, and over 100 schools and isa project of YouthBuild USA.
