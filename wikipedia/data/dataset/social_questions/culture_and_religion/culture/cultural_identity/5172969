An ethnic majority refers to a condition in which a particular ethnic group comprises the majority of a particular population. It is frequently based on genealogy. For example, we can refer to the Caucasian race, or the Asian race, or the black race. However, it can also refer to a commonality in cultural or religious practices, as well as linguistic or behavioral practices.
