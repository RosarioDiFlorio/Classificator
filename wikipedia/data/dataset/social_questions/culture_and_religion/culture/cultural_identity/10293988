The Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People (Crimean Tatar: Къырымтатар Миллий Меджлиси, Qırımtatar Milliy Meclisi; Ukrainian: Меджлiс Кримськотатарського Народу, Medzhlis Krims'kotatars'koho Narodu; Russian: Меджлис крымскотатарского народа, Medzhlis Krimskotatarskogo Naroda) is the single highest executive-representative body of the Crimean Tatars in period between sessions of the Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People.
The Mejlis is a member institution of the European Union's Platform of European Memory and Conscience.
The Mejlis was outlawed by Russia in 2016 (for "the use of propaganda of aggression and hatred towards Russia, inciting ethnic nationalism and extremism in society") and listed as an extremist organization after Russia had gained full control of Crimea after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea.
