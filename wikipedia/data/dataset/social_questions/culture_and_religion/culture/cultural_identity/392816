The term Greater Romania (Romanian: România Mare) usually refers to the borders of the Kingdom of Romania in the interwar period. It also refers to a pan-nationalist idea.
As concept, the main goal is the re-creation of a nation-state which would incorporate all Romanian speakers. The phrase is strongly associated with the Kingdom of Romania between 1918 and 1940, often considered the realization of the pan-Romanian goal. In 1918, after the incorporation of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia, the Romanian state reached its largest peacetime geographical extent ever (295,049 km²). Nowadays, the concept serves as a guiding principle for the unification of Romania and Moldova.
The idea is comparable to other similar conceptions such as Greek Megali Idea, Greater Hungary, Greater Bulgaria, Greater Serbia, as well as Greater Albania.
