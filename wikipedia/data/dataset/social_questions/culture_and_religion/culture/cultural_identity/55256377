Racists Anonymous is a support group, based on the Alcoholics Anonymous model, which views racism almost as a mental illness. The group was created by Sunnyvale, California United Church of Christ pastor Ron Buford over his frustration with typical attempts to deal with race issues which merely either left him feeling angry, or white participates leaving feeling guilty. The first meeting was held in 2015 following various police shootings and the Dylann Roof mass murder. As of September 2017, 90 congregations in four countries have requested the program's kit, and several have established their own programs independently. A basic dictum of the organization is that all people are racist to varying degrees, and that it is impossible not to be racist if raised in American culture, and that one can engage in self-improvement, as opposed to "fixing" oneself.
