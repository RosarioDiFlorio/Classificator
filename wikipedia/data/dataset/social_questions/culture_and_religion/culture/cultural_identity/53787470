The Human Library is an international organization and movement that first started in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2000 with the aim to challenge prejudice against social contact among people. Similar to how a traditional library works, the Human Library participants can be checked out, at which point they engage in conversations and share stories with the public. The Human Library Organization is currently active in over 60 countries.
The organization began in Copenhagen in 2000 when a series of living books were created for a festival run by Stop the Violence. The first permanent Human Library was established in Lismore, Australia in 2006.
