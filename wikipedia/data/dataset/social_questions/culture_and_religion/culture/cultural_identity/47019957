Constitution of Croatia in its preamble defines Croatia as nation state of ethnic Croats, country of traditionally present communities that constitution recognize as national minorities and country of all its citizens. National minorities explicitly enumerated and recognized in Constitution are Serbs, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Hungarians, Jews , Germans, Austrians, Ukrainians, Rusyns, Bosniaks, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Russians, Bulgarians, Poles, Romani, Romanians, Turks, Vlachs and Albanians. Article 12 of the constitution states that official language in Croatia is Croatian language, but also states that in some local governments another language and Cyrillic or some other script can be introduced in official use.
The official use of minority languages is defined by relevant national legislation and international conventions and agreements which Croatia signed. The most important national laws are Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities, Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities and The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities. Relevant international agreements are European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Certain rights were achieved through bilateral agreements and international agreements such as Treaty of Osimo and Erdut Agreement.
The required 33.3% of minority population in cetrain local government unit for obligatory introduction of official use of minority languages is considered high taking into account that The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of Council of Europe consider threshold from 10% to 20% reasonable. Croatia do not always show favorable views on issue of minority rights but Croatian European Union accession process positively influenced public usage of minority languages.
