Four airlines, British Airways, Qantas, Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia, have attracted criticism for controversial seating policies which discriminate against adult male passengers on the basis of their sex. The companies refuse(d) to allow unaccompanied children to be seated next to adult males on their flights, leading to criticism that they regard all men as a danger to children.
The policies resulted in protests against the airlines and criticism by civil liberties and children's charities. British Airways ended its policy in August 2010 following successful legal action undertaken by Mirko Fischer.
