Generation Z (also known as iGeneration, Post-Millennials, or Homeland Generation) is the demographic cohort after Millennials. Currently, there are numerous additional competing names used in connection with them in the media. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends, but demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as starting birth years. At the present time, there is little consensus regarding ending birth years.
Most of Generation Z have used the Internet since a young age, and they are generally comfortable with technology and with interacting on social media.
