In Spain, the White Terror, also The Francoist Repression (la Represión Franquista) was the series of political actions taken by the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War (17 July 1936 – 1 April 1939), and during the first decade of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. For nine years (1936–45), the mass killings of the loyalists to the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39) included the Popular Front, liberals, Socialists, Trotskyists, Communists, anarchists, Protestant Christians, freethinkers, intellectuals, Freemasons, and Galician, Catalan, and Basque nationalists.
To eliminate Red leftism in Spain, the White Terror realized the political reaction of the Nationalists, the re-establishment of the monarchic status quo ante in place of the democratic Spanish republic. The right-wing notion of a limpieza (cleansing) of society was the essential political strategy of the Franco government, thus, the assassinations began immediately after the nationalists captured a place. The Civil Guard (nationalist military) and the fascist Falange realized political violence against civilians in name of Franco, and were ideologically legitimized by the Roman Catholic Church as defenders of Christendom.
Throughout the Franco dictatorship (1 October 1936 – 20 November 1975), the Law of Political Responsibilities (Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas), promulgated in 1939, reformed in 1942, and in force until 1966, gave legalistic color of law to the political repression that characterized the dismantling of the democratic republic; and served to punish loyalist Spaniards who survived the military coup d’état against the Spanish Republic in July 1936.
Many historians of the Spanish Civil War believe that the death toll of the White Terror (58,000–400,000), because of its extent and duration, was greater than the death toll of the Red Terror (38,000 – ~172,344 ). However, some historians of the Spanish Civil War believe that the death toll of the Red Terror was greater than the death toll of the White Terror.
The political repression of the White Terror was formal policy of the Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War, and of the government of Gen. Franco until 1945 — six years after the war's end in 1939. In 2015, the government of Spain refused Spanish historians access to the pertinent government archives, open to foreign historians, which would allow determining the physical whereabouts and political fate of victims of the White Terror.
