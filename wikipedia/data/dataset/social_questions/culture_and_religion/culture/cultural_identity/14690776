Cultural nationalism is a form of nationalism in which the nation is defined by a shared culture. It is an intermediate position between ethnic nationalism on one hand and civic nationalism on the other. Therefore, it will focus on a national identity shaped by cultural traditions and by language, but not on the concepts of common ancestry or race.
"Cultural nationalism" does not tend to manifest itself in independent movements, but is a moderate position within a larger spectrum of nationalist ideology. Thus, moderate positions in Flemish, Hindu nationalisms can be "cultural nationalism" while these same movements also include forms of ethnic nationalism and national mysticism.
