The 1990s uprising in Bahrain (Arabic: الانتفاضة التسعينية في البحرين‎) also known as the uprising of dignity (Arabic: انتفاضة الكرامة‎) was an uprising in Bahrain between 1994 and 1999 in which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand democratic reforms. The uprising caused approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999 and a referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the National Action Charter. The uprising resulted in the deaths of around 40 civilians and at least one Bahraini soldier.
