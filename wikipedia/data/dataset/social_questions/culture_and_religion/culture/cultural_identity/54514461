Blackface in contemporary art covers issues from stage make-up used to make non-black performers appear black (the traditional meaning of blackface),to non-black creators using black personas. Blackface is generally considered an anachronistically racist performance practice, despite or because of which it has been widely used in contemporary art. In recent years many black artists have engaged in the practice as a form of deconstruction and critique.
