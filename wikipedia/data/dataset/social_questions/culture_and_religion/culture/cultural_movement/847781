The Toronto Blessing, a term coined by British newspapers, describes the Christian revival and associated phenomena that began in January 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church (TAV), which was renamed in 1996 to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship (TACF) and then later in 2010 renamed to Catch the Fire Toronto. It is categorized as a neo-charismatic evangelical Christian church and is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing impacted charismatic Christian culture in both positive and negative ways. Negative impacts came in the form of criticism and denominational disputes while positive impacts were more evident over time as the movement spread into other nations. Criticism primarily centered around disagreements about charismatic doctrine, the latter rain movement, and whether or not the physical manifestations people experienced were in line with Biblical doctrine or were actually heretical practices. The Toronto Blessing also is reported as having an influence on the Brownsville Revival and the Lakeland Revival which later occurred in Florida and included similar styles of worship, ministry, and supernatural manifestations.
