A vision board or dream board is a collage of images, pictures and affirmations of one's dreams and desires, designed to serve as a source of inspiration and motivation, and to use the law of attraction to attain goals. The usefulness of vision boards has been endorsed by celebrities such as Jim Carrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey and Steve Harvey. Oprah's website formerly offered an "O Dream Board" tool for making dream boards.
