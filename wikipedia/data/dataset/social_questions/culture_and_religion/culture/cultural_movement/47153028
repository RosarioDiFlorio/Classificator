The Billion Soul Harvest represents the emergence of a global movement within the Christian church to win a billion souls for Christ.
At least two global leadership networks have been formed to support the movement: the Global Pastors Network formed in 2003, with 800,000 members, and Billion Soul Network formed in 2007, with a membership of 475,000 churches worldwide.
Former NYC Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, has been a conference speaker and proponent of the movement.
Driving forces propelling the movement forward include conferences, books and significant prayer initiatives.
Over two hundred church denominations now participate in the movement.
The emergence of the movement was influenced by Bob Jones, after he reported a supernatural encounter with God in 1975 where he was told to "Prepare the people, for I am going to bring a billion souls in one great harvest".
