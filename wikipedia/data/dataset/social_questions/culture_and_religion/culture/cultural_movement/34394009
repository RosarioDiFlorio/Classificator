Serenbe is a New Urban village, located in the semi-rural area within the city limits of Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, in Fulton County, in the Atlanta metropolitan area. According to the Serenbe's website, Serenbe had over 600 residents as of February 2015.
Serenbe has drawn national attention as an example of New Urbanism in the South. With its organic farm and land-use plan that encourages conservation of agricultural land, Serenbe is at the same time an example of development-supported agriculture, a nascent movement in real estate development that preserves and invests in agricultural land use. The village is also noted as a destination for visitors seeking to experience its New Urbanist design, its natural setting and its farm-to-table restaurants, shopping and accommodations.
