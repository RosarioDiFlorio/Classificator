Mubashir Hassan (Urdu: مبشر حسن; 22 January 1922) is a Pakistani civil engineer and science administrator known for his work in Hydraulics and his political role in the development of the atomic bomb project.
In 1967, Hassan co-founded the Pakistan Peoples Party, a democratic socialist political force, with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and J.A. Rahim. In 1972, Hassan helped Bhutto establish the Ministry of Science, where he financially assisted large number of Pakistan's academic scientists in the application of Science in warfare. During the 1970s, Hassan emerged as effective public policy maker and was in effect as third Prime minister's science adviser, and was seen as a strong vocal and proponent of democratic technocracy and of the centrality of technological innovation and entrepreneurship for both economic and geopolitical security. However, after removal of Prime minister Bhutto, Hassan became troubled, and was successfully silenced by the military government of General Zia-ul-Haq.
