Heroin Anonymous (HA) is a non-profit group founded in Phoenix, AZ in 2004 to help heroin addicts achieve and maintain sobriety. Modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous, HA is a fellowship of heroin addicts who meet regularly to help each other practice complete abstinence from all drugs and alcohol. Heroin Anonymous does not provide drug counseling, medical or psychiatric treatment, or chemical dependency treatment.
HA groups exist in 19 US states, Canada and the UK., including a meeting started in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2004. At HA meetings, members talk about their addiction, their difficulties, and their accomplishments. Members maintain anonymity by addressing one another with only first names. Alcoholics Anonymous is used as a guidebook.
Heroin Anonymous is entirely self-supporting but charges no membership fees. They accept donations from members, and they decline outside contributions. They are not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution. HA's stated intention is to avoid controversy and endorsement or opposition to external causes.
The first ever Heroin Anonymous World Convention was held in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2014.  The second Heroin Anonymous World Convention will be held in Portland, Oregon in 2018 to celebrate HA's 14th year of operation.
