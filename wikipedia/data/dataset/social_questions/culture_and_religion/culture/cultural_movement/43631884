Ray Robinson (born Perry Ray Robinson; 12 September 1937 â€“ approx. 25 April 1973), was an American civil rights activist from Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement. He had been active in Mississippi and Washington, DC, supporting the March on Washington and the Poor People's Campaign. He disappeared while participating in the 1973 American Indian Movement resistance in the Wounded Knee incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
His family never saw him again, and his wife believed he was killed there. She struggled to get Robinson's disappearance investigated. In 2014 the FBI confirmed that Robinson had been killed and buried on the reservation in April 1973; it released redacted documents to the Robinson family under a Freedom of Information Act suit, including redacted interviews with cooperating witnesses. His remains have not been found. The FBI said it had closed his case.
