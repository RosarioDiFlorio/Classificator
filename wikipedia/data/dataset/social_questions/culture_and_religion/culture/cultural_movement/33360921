The Occupy Wall Street protests have inspired a wide international response. There have been hundreds of Occupy movement protests worldwide over time, intended and organized as non-violent protest. This is a list of some of their locations. Months before the Occupy movement began, the Movimiento 15-M planned to hold events in many nations on October 15, 2011. The Occupy movement joined in and also held many events in many nations on that day. A list of proposed events for the 15 October 2011 global protests listed events in 951 cities in 82 countries. Reportedly the large manifestation in Rome ended in violence. Protest camps were built at many of the protest locations from Honolulu to Zeulenroda, often near banking institutions or stock markets. Many locations had further manifestations at the following weekends until "Guy-Fawkes" day since the Guy Fawkes mask had become protester fashion. Many US-American Occupy groups kept activity alive until spring 2012, some are still active.
On the one-year anniversary of the Occupy Movement (September 17, 2012), the Guardian published the "Occupy Directory"'s map as a "The map of the Occupy world."
