The Integral Urban House was a pioneering 1970s experiment in self-reliant urban homesteading. The house was located 1516 5th St. in Berkeley, California. The founders were California State Architect Sim Van der Ryn and Bill & Helga Olkowski, authors of the City People's Guide to Raising Food, and the project was run by the Farallones Institute (which Van der Ryn founded).
The Sierra Club published a book about the experiment in 1979. Elements of the home included a vegetable garden, chickens, rabbits, a fish pond, beehives, a composting toilet, solar power and more.
Mother Earth News published an article on the house in 1976.
