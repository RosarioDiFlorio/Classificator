Ein Harod (Meuhad) (Hebrew: עֵין חֲרוֹד מְאֻחָד‎) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located in the Jezreel Valley near Mount Gilboa, it falls under the jurisdiction of Gilboa Regional Council. In 2016 it had a population of 739.
The kibbutz was the home of Yitzhak Tabenkin, one of founders of the United Kibbutz Movement, and was a symbol of the kibbutz collectivist ideology. However, in 2009 it began a process of privatization.
