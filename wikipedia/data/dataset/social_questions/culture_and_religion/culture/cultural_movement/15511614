Ramot (Hebrew: רָמוֹת‎, lit. "Heights") is a moshav and Israeli settlement near the eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee in the western Golan Heights. Named "Ramot" because it is located on two hills, it falls under the jurisdiction of Golan Regional Council. In 2016 it had a population of 509.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
