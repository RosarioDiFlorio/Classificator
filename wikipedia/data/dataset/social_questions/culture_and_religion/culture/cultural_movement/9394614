Better Democracy is a non-partisan lobby group in New Zealand, formed with the objective of bringing about binding citizens initiated referendums as a form of direct democracy (New Zealand has allowed for non-binding citizens initiated referendums since 1993). The group was founded by Steve Baron in 2003 and originally known as Voters' Voice.
