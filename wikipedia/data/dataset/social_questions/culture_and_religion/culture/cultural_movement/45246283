Stop Bild Sexism (Schluss mit dem Bild-Sexismus) is a campaign opposing what its organizers describe as the objectification of women in Bild-Zeitung, the most popular newspaper in Germany. The paper has been criticized by numerous sources over the years for its sexist representations of women. The campaign's first aim is to persuade the newspaper to stop publishing photographs of the "BILD-Girl," a topless model. It also asks that the newspaper start reporting on women and women's issues in the same way that it writes about men.
Stop Bild Sexism was inspired by the No More Page 3 campaign in the UK to persuade The Sun newspaper to abandon its practice of publishing images of half-naked women.
