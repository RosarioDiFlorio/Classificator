Beit HaArava (Hebrew: בֵּית הָעֲרָבָה‎, lit. House of the Arava) is an Israeli settlement and kibbutz in the West Bank. Located near the Dead Sea and Jericho at the eponymous Beit HaArava Junction, the intersection of Highway 1 and Highway 90, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megilot Regional Council. In 2016 it had a population of 183.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
