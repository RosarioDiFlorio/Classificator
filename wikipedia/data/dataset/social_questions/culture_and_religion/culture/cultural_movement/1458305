Johan Geeraard Adriaan T'Hooft (9 May 1956 â€“ 6 October 1977) was a Flemish Belgian neo-romantic poet. He is well known for his hippie/junkie lifestyle, death-related poetry and early death at age 21 from a drug-related suicide. These elements have made him a legend in his native country. His life and death by overdose were made into a movie, the English title Junkie's Sorrow.
