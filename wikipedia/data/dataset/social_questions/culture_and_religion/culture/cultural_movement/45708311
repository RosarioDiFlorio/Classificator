Blockupy is a movement protesting against austerity. The Blockupy alliance includes trade unions and Germany's Linkspartei.
Representing grass-roots critics of supranational financial institutions such as the “troika”: the European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), its name is derived from the Occupy movement which sprang up in Wall Street in 2011.
Organisers have verbally supported (since July 2015, former) Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis's criticism that ECB policy towards Athens is “asphyxiating”.
