McKinney v University of Guelph [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229 is the Supreme Court of Canada case that decided that, for the purpose of determining the application of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, universities were not part of government. As such, that the mandatory retirement age for University teachers does not violate equality rights under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In doing so the court refined the scope of the Charter as it applies to government bodies as well as the definition of "law" within the ambit of the Charter.
