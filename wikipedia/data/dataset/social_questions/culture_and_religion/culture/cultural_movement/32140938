Glitter bombing is an act of protest in which activists throw glitter on people at public events. Glitter bombers have frequently been motivated by, though not limited to, their targets' opposition to same-sex marriage.
Some legal officials argue glitter bombing is technically assault and battery. It is possible for glitter to enter the eyes or nose and cause damage to the cornea or other soft tissues potentially irritating them or leading to infection, depending on the size of the glitter. Whether a prosecutor would pursue the charges depends on a number of factors.
In 2012, University of Colorado-Boulder student Peter Smith faced up to six months in jail and a fine of $1000 for allegedly glitter bombing presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a Colorado campaign event.
