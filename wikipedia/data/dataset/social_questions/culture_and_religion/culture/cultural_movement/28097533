African Americans and American Jews have interacted throughout much of the history of the United States. This relationship has included widely publicized cooperation and conflict, and—since the 1970s—has been an area of significant academic research. Cooperation during the Civil Rights Movement was strategic and significant, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The relationship has also been marred by conflict and controversy related to such topics as the Black Power movement, Zionism, affirmative action, and the role of a small number of American Jews, among a large number of other Americans and others, in the Atlantic slave trade.
