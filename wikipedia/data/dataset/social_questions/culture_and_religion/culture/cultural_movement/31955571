The Village is an ongoing project to create an eco-village community with commitments to ecological, social and economic sustainability. This community is being developed on 67 acres (270,000 m2) of farmland within the townland of Oxpark purchased in 2005 and merges with the existing village of Cloughjordan, County Tipperary in Ireland. The first residents moved into their homes in the eco-village in December 2009. The Village has been declared an unfinished estate. The advantage for early adapters is that the household charge of â‚¬100 will not be levied for 2012.
A 500m2 array of solar water heating panels, was launched in May 2011. This will provide additional hot water for the district heating system which is now powered by a wood chip boiler.
A community-supported agriculture scheme was established in 2008. Members of Cloughjordan community farm are drawn from the eco-village and surrounding area. The farm aims to supply member's families with much of their food using biodynamic principles. The farm cultivates 12 acres within the eco-village and land between Cloughjordan and Shinrone.
Village Education Research and Training (VERT) is a working group within the eco-village. It is committed to running courses encouraging best practice in sustainable living.
Twenty nine near zero-energy buildings in the village were open to the public during the "Near Zero Energy Buildings Open Doors Ireland" event held in November 2013. Other NZEB Open Doors events took place in Belgium, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Hungary, France, Malta, Slovenia, Poland under the NZEB 2021 program promoted by the European Union.
A community amphitheatre, created within the eco-village was opened by Michael D. Higgins, President of Ireland in April 2017.
