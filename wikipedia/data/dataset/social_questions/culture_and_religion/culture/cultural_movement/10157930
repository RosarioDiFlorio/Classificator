The Lord’s recovery is a term coined by the Christian preacher Watchman Nee and promoted by Witness Lee that refers to a cumulative recovery of truths lost during what they refer to as the "degradation" of the church beginning from the second century. Although Nee and Lee recognized that there were recoveries before the time of the Reformation, their opinion was that the Lord’s recovery began with Martin Luther in the Reformation because it was from then that “significant” recoveries were made.
