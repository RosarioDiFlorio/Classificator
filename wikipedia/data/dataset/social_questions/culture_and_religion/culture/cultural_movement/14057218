The Propagandists were a nineteenth-century political group in The United Kingdom led by the Radical ex-Chartist John Bedford Leno. They would speak on behalf of common workers in legal and social matters and met weekly at the "Windsor Castle" pub in Holborn.
It was from the "Propagandists" that the Reform League was later established in 1865 to press for manhood suffrage and the ballot.
