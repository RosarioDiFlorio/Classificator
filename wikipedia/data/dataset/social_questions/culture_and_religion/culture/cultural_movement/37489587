The California Criminal Syndicalism Act (Stats. 1919, c. 188, p. 281; it was codified at California Penal Code §§ 11400 et seq.) was a law of California in 1919 under Governor William Stephens criminalizing syndicalism. It was repealed in 1991.
One of the Act's most well-known convictions was that of Charlotte Anita Whitney, which led to the Act being upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Whitney v. California (1927), which was itself explicitly overturned in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), effectively declaring the Act unconstitutional.
The Act must be viewed in the context of the First Red Scare and the turbulent labor history of the United States in the early 20th Century. From 1910–1920, 20 states enacted laws criminalizing syndicalism.
