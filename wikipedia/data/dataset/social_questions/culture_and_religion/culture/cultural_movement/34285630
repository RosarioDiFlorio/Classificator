Occupy Cork was a peaceful protest and demonstration against alleged economic inequality, social injustice and corporate greed taking place on the junction of the Grand Parade and South Mall and at the NAMA-listed Stapleton House on Oliver Plunkett Street in the Irish city of Cork. The group occupied Stapleton House after receiving the keys to the building on 25 December 2011. The camp was dismantled on 13 March 2012.
