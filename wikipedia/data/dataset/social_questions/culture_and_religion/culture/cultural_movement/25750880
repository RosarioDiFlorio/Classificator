This article is about the community in St. Charles County, for the town located in Sullivan County, see: Newtown, Missouri.
New Town at St. Charles is a partially completed planned community within the city of St. Charles, Missouri. The community's developers espouse the principles of Traditional Neighborhood Design and New Urbanism. New Urbanists designers advocate walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods with relatively high population densities, as an alternative to the urban sprawl of conventional, automobile-centered suburbs. When complete, New Town will cover 755 acres (3.06 km2), will contain up to 5,700 dwellings, and will be one of the largest new urbanist communities in the United States. It is expected to take 12 to 15 years to complete.
