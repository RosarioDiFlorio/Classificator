EVA lanxmeer (Eva-Lanxmeer or E.V.A. Lanxmeer) is the name of an ecological neighbourhood (240 houses) built from 1994 to 2009 in the Dutch town of Culemborg in the Netherlands. It is an environmentally friendly housing development.
It was initiated by Marleen Kaptein, who was looking for a more sustainable way of building housing in urban areas. The project was a strong partnership between future inhabitants and the city of Culemborg, consultants and other people.
It incorporates many of the principles of high environmental quality and eco-towns, but its principal originality is the promotion of the constant participation of the inhabitants. Indeed, this neighbourhood (except for its masterplan) was designed and conducted with representatives of future residents in a creative process (bottom-up; from bottom to top and not imposed by management or administration), and is often regarded as a model in several areas (for example in Europe by Energie-Cit√©s and in France by the Department of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea). It has therefore become an international reference, regularly visited by architects, urbans planners, developers, futurists or groups interested in sustainability, from European countries, and sometimes the United States, Japan, etc..
