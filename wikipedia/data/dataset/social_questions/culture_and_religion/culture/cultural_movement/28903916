The American Left has consisted of a broad range of individuals and groups that have sought fundamental egalitarian changes in the economic, political, and cultural institutions of the United States. Leftist activists in the United States have been credited with advancing social change on issues such as labor and civil rights, civil liberties, peace, feminism, LGBT rights, minimum wage and environmentalism, as well as providing critiques of capitalism.
