Carmit is a new community in the northern Negev of Israel within the jurisdiction of Meitar located near Cramim Forest.
The community was founded for olims from North America. A neighborhood for ultra-orthodox Jews was also planned. In 2005 the District Planning and Building Commission of the Southern Region approved the construction of 739 housing units for Carmit's Phase A. Residents moved into the first neighborhood during 2013, with the community eventually intended to comprise over 2,500 housing units, each on an area of 1/8 acre (1/2 dunam).
Absorption to Carmit is being carried out by the Jewish National Fund, the Jewish Agency, the Meitar local council and the OR Movement that has established six new communities in the Negev and Galilee â€“ Sansana, Merchav Am, Mitzpe Ilan, Haruv, Be'er Milka, and Gva'ot Bar.
