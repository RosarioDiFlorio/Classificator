Deep Springs College is a small liberal arts two-year college in Deep Springs, California, United States. With fewer than 30 students at any given time, the college is the smallest institution of higher education in the United States. After completing two years at Deep Springs, students may elect to receive an associate degree, though this seldom happens in practice. Most continue their studies at other universities, out of which two-thirds go on to earn a graduate degree, and over half eventually earn a doctorate.
Deep Springs is in Deep Springs Valley in Inyo County, California near the larger Owens Valley and about 25 miles (40 km) over mountain passes from the nearest town, Dyer, Nevada, and 45 miles (72 km) from the nearest town of significant size, Bishop, California. The official name of the institution is "Deep Springs College." It was founded under the name "Deep Springs, Collegiate and Preparatory."
From its inception in 1917, the college has been all-male, until its board voted in fall 2011 that the college would begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013. In 2012 legal challenges were lodged against the Trustees' action, disputing their authority to change the admissions policy, including an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students and delaying coeducation until the 2018â€“2019 academic year at the earliest. On 13 April 2017, the California Court of Appeal, 4th District, decided the case of Hitz v. Hoekstra ruling that the college may admit women. On 29 June 2017, the California Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the California Court of Appeal decision, an action that should permit the admission of women once the College is able to complete planning procedures previously put on hold. On August 31, 2017, the Deep Springs board of trustees voted once again to admit women, starting with the class that will enter in the fall of 2018.
