The Spanish Trade Union Organisation (Spanish: Organización Sindical Española), commonly known as Vertical Syndicate (Sindicato Vertical), was the only legal trade union organisation in Francoist Spain (1940–1975), and a main component of the Movimiento Nacional Francoist apparatus. Previous unions, like the anarchist CNT and the socialist UGT, were outlawed and driven underground.
