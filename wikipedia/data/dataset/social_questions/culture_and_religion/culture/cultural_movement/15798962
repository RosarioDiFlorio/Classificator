Yonatan (Hebrew: יוֹנָתָן‎) is an Israeli settlement and moshav located in the central Golan Heights. Initially a moshav shitufi, it underwent a privatization process to become a community settlement. The settlement is affiliated with the Hapoel HaMizrachi movement, and is under the jurisdiction of Golan Regional Council. In 2016 it had a population of 662.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
