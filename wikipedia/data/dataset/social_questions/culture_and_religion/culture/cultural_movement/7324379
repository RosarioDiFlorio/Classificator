The good life is a term for the life that one would like to live, or for happiness, associated (as eudaimonia) with the work of Aristotle and his teaching on ethics.
Eudaimonia is a term that means happiness and is a central aim of stoic philosophy. A contemporary book by William B. Irvine entitled A Guide to the Good Life  sums up what 'the good life' is and how one might achieve it.
People who hope for a better world feel the need for a shared vision of the "good life," a vision that is flexible enough for innumerable individual circumstances but comprehensive enough to unite people in optimistic, deliberate, progressive social change.
