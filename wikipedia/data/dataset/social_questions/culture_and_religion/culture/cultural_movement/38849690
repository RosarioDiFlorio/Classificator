Bundism was a secular Jewish socialist movement, whose organizational manifestation was the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Yiddish: Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Ruslandâ€Ž), founded in the Russian Empire in 1897.
The Jewish Labour Bund was an important component of the social democratic movement in the Russian empire until the 1917 Russian Revolution; the Bundists initially opposed the October Revolution, but ended up supporting it due to pogroms committed by the Volunteer Army of the White movement during the Russian Civil War. Split along communist and social democratic lines throughout the Civil War, a faction supported the Bolsheviks and eventually was absorbed by the Communist Party.
The anti-Communist socialist Bundist movement continued to exist as a political party in independent Poland in the interwar period as the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland, becoming a major, if not the major, political force within Polish Jewry. Bundists were active in the anti-Nazi struggle, and many of its members were killed during World War II.
After the war, the International Jewish Labor Bund, more properly the "World Coordinating Council of the Jewish Labor Bund", was founded in New York, with affiliated groups in Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Israel, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. Individuals associated with the Jewish Labour Bund played important roles in Western social democratic movements, such as Canada's New Democratic Party.
