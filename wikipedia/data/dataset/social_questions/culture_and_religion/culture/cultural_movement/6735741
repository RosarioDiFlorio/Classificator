The Convergence Movement is a movement among evangelical and charismatic churches in the United States and elsewhere to blend charismatic worship with liturgies from the Book of Common Prayer and other liturgical sources.
The movement was inspired by the spiritual pilgrimages of modern Evangelical writers like Thomas Howard, Robert E. Webber, Peter E. Gillquist and the ancient Christian writers and their communities. These men, along with theologians, scripture scholars, and pastors in a number of traditions, were calling Christians back to their roots in the primitive church.
