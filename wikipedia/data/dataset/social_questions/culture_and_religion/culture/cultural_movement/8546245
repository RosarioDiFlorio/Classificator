Skaneateles Community was a utopian social experiment established in 1843 by the Society for Universal Inquiry and Reform in a 350-acre (1.4 km2) farm near Mottville, in Skaneateles in Upstate New York. It was one of several communities established by the Society prior to the Civil War. It survived for three years. John A. Collins (1810-1900), a noted abolitionst, became the community leader. During its life, the community had about a hundred members who shared living quarters as well as work on farm, sawmill, and print shop. Although economically viable, internal differences and Collins' waning leadership resulted in the dissolution of the community.
