Mevo'ot Yericho (Hebrew: מְבוֹאוֹת יְרִיחוֹ‎) (lit. "Doorway to Jericho"), founded in 1999, is an Israeli settlement and a community settlement located in the West Bank's southern Jordan Valley just north of Jericho, in the Yitav Valley. The site is 150m below sea level. It falls under the municipal jurisdiction of the Bik'at HaYarden Regional Council.
The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.
