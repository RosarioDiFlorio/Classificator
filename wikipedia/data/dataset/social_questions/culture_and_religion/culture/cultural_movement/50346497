Grand River Christian Community is a Hutterite Christian community, located some 5 miles west of Jamesport, Missouri, and some 6 miles northeast of Gallatin, Missouri, at K Road. The community was founded in 2014 as a daughter colony of Elmendorf Christian Community in Minnesota. The community lives off farming and manufacturing. As of 2016 the minister was Alvin Wurtz, a brother of minister Gary Wurtz of Elmendorf.
In January 2014 three families, six adults and five children, moved from Elmendorf to Grand River. In 2016 there were some 50 people living there. Even though living a private life, the community is open to visitors and seekers.
