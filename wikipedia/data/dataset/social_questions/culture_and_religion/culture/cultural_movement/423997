Meherabad (meher meaning friend from Iranian "Mihir", ultimately from Sanskrit "Mithira"; "abad" meaning a prosperous settlement, or a flourishing colony) was originally an ashram established by Meher Baba near Arangaon Village, India in 1923 about 9 kilometres (6 mi) south of Ahmednagar. It is now the site of Meher Baba's samadhi (shrine/tomb) as well as facilities and accommodations for pilgrims. A large number of buildings mostly associated with the earlier decades of Babaâ€™s work, the graves of disciples, and a range of pilgrim accommodation and charitable establishments are also there. Many Baba lovers work or live in the vicinity.
Meherabad is a popular place of pilgrimage for both Eastern and Western followers of Meher Baba with reported numbers of around 30,000 annual pilgrims at Amartithi (the commemoration of his death, January 31). The Meher Pilgrim Center and Meher Pilgrim Retreat located there are open to the public. There is also a free dispensary and school.
Established in May 1923, Meherabad was the first permanent residence of Meher Baba and his disciples in Ahmednagar district. In 1944 Meher Baba moved his residence north to Meherazad located 24 kilometres (15 mi) away on the other side of Ahmedagar.
