United Macedonia (Macedonian: Обединета Македонија, Obedineta Makedonija), or Greater Macedonia (Голема Македонија, Golema Makedonija), is an irredentist concept among ethnic Macedonian nationalists that aims to unify the transnational region of Macedonia in southeastern Europe (which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913) into a single state that would be dominated by ethnic Macedonians but all individuals in all ethnic groups, such as Greek Macedonians and Albanian Macedonians, would have equal rights and protection under the law. The proposed capital of such a United Macedonia is the city of Thessaloniki or Salonika (Solun in the Slavic languages) in Greek Macedonia, which ethnic Macedonians and the Yugoslav leader Tito had always dreamed of incorporating into their own states (along with the hinterland of Greek Macedonia, which they came to call Aegean Macedonia).
