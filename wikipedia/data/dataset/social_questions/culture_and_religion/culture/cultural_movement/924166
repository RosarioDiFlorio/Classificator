Laws affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people vary greatly by country or territoryâ€”everything from legal recognition of same-sex marriage or other types of partnerships, to the death penalty as punishment for same-sex romantic/sexual activity or identity. Laws that affect LGBT people include, but are not limited to, the following:
sodomy laws that penalize consensual same-sex sexual activity, and age of consent laws that may impose higher ages for same-sex sexual activity
laws concerning the recognition of same-sex relationships, including same-sex marriage, civil unions, domestic partnerships, etc.
laws concerning LGBT parenting, including adoption by LGBT people
anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education (also anti-bullying legislation), public accommodations, etc.
"bathroom bills" affecting access to sex-segregated facilities by transgender people
hate crime laws imposing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated violence against LGBT people
laws concerning access to assisted reproductive technology
laws concerning access to sex reassignment surgery and hormone replacement therapy
legal recognition and accommodation of reassigned gender
laws related to sexual orientation and military service
laws regarding donation of blood by men who have sex with men
As of March 2017, 23 countries, most of them located in the Americas and Western Europe, recognize same-sex marriage.
As of August 2017, 73 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions have laws criminalizing homosexuality, with most of them located in Asia and Africa. In 2006 that number was 92. As of May 2016, 16 countries have an unequal age of consent law.
In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, which was followed up with a report from the UN Human Rights Commission documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including hate crime, criminalization of homosexuality, and discrimination. Following up on the report, the UN Human Rights Commission urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.
