The Racial Equality Proposal was an amendment to the treaty under consideration at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference offered by Japan. Though broadly supported, it did not become part of the Treaty of Versailles, largely because of the opposition of Australia and the United States. Its rejection led to the alienation of Japan from the other great powers and increased nationalism leading up to World War II.
