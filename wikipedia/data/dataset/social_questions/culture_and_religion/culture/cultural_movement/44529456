The London Black Revolutionaries (also known as the London Black Revs, the Black Revs for short) is a revolutionary socialist British political organisation centred in London. The organisation's membership is rumoured to be a mix of Caribbean and South Asian youth, who had been part of an oppositional faction and split of more than 550 members from the Socialist Workers Party (UK) in 2012–13. Its closed membership consists primarily of Black British and British Asian youths, who define themselves as a strictly working-class, grassroots organisation based on anti-racist, anti-fascist, anti-homophobic and anti-sexist principles. Rejecting pacifism, the Black Revolutionaries take a militant approach to their activities, employing direct action as a tactic. The organisation is said to be primarily based in Brixton, South London.
The London Black Revs follows in the development of past Black organisations such as the Black Eagles and the Race Today Collective led by Darcus Howe, a Trinidadian organiser in the Black communities of Notting Hill and Brixton, known for organising a demonstration of 20,000 people in response to the New Cross house fire – the bombing of the home of a West Indian family at 439 New Cross Road, Lewisham, South London, that resulted in the deaths of 13 young black persons, aged from 14 to 22, including 27 others were seriously injured – with the New Cross Massacre Action Committee (NCMAC).
