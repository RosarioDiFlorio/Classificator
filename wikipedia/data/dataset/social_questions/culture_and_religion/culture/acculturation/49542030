The Islamic Reporting Initiative (IRI) is an independent not-for-profit organization leading the creation of the IRI standard; the guiding integrated Corporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting standard based on Islamic principles and values that works towards achieving international standards of best practice. The framework will enable organizations to inclusively assess, report, verify and certify their CSR and philanthropic programs supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Founded on 4 April 2015, the IRI seeks to make CSR reporting standard practice in organizations across the Islamic world and OIC countries in particular. The IRI is headquartered in The Netherlands, and (as of 2016) has members in more than 50 countries. In 2015, the IRI was commended by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest inter-governmental organization after the United Nations, with membership of 57 states over four continents.
