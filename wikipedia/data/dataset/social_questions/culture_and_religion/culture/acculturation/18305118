The immigration sign is an American highway safety sign warning motorists to avoid immigrants darting across the road. It depicts a man, woman, and child with pigtails running. The signs were erected in response to over one hundred immigrant deaths due to traffic strikes from 1987 to 1990 in two corridors along Interstate 5 along the San Ysidro Port of Entry at the Mexico-United States border and approximately 50 miles (80 km) north at the San Clemente United States Border Patrol checkpoint in Camp Pendleton.
