LRN, founded in 1994, is an American company specializing in advising and educating organizations like the NFL, Dell, Kellogg's and Pfizer about ethics and regulatory compliance, as well as corporate culture, governance and leadership. The Washington Post reported in 1995 that LRN's low overhead enabled the company to "offer bargain prices to clients" positioning the company to be disruptive to the legal industry. Later evolved into a training, advisory and education firm. The company is guided by the philosophy of founder Dov Seidman, based on his New York Times best-selling book How.
