The Decreasing Demand Procedure is a procedure for fair item assignment. It yields a Pareto-efficient division that maximizes the rank of the agent with the lowest rank. This corresponds to the Rawlsian justice criterion of taking care of the worst-off agent.
The procedure was developed by Dorothea Herreiner and Clemens Puppe.
