The AL procedure is a procedure for fair item assignment between two people. It finds an envy-free item assignment of a subset of the items. Moreover, the resulting allocation is Pareto efficient in the following sense: there is no other envy-free allocation which is better for one person and not worse for the other person.
The AL procedure was first published by Brams and Kilgour and Klamler. It was later generalized by Haris Aziz to handle the case where agents may express indifferences.
