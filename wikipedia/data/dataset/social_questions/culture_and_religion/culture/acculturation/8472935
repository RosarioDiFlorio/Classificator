Chindian (Chinese: 中印人; pinyin: Zhōngyìnrén; Cantonese Yale: Jūngyanyàn) is an informal term used to refer to a person of both Chinese and Indian ancestry. There are a considerable number of Chindians in Malaysia and Singapore, where people of Chinese and Indian origin immigrated in large numbers during the 19th and 20th centuries. There are also a sizeable number living in Hong Kong and smaller numbers in other countries with overseas Chinese and Indian diaspora, such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana in the Caribbean, as well as in Thailand, the Philippines, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
