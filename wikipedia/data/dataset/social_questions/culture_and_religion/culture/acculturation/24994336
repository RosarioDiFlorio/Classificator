Jarek Molski is a disabled man known for filing hundreds of lawsuits against small businesses for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Since a 1985 motorcycle accident that left him paralyzed, Molski has filed over 400 lawsuits against California small businesses due to lack of handicap parking, misplaced handrails, and other Disabilities Act violations.
Molski has received heavy criticism over his lawsuits. In 2004, a Federal judge accused Molski of extortion, calling him a "hit-and-run plaintiff", and barred Molski from filing further lawsuits. Moski appealed the judge's order to the United States Supreme Court, but was denied after they refused to hear his case.
