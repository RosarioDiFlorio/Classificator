Panethnicity is a political neologism used to group various ethnic groups together based on their related cultural origins; these are usually geographical, racial or linguistic or all of those simultaneously. The term was coined in 1992 by Yen Espiritu to refer to Asian Americans, a group of disparate ethnic groups, all of which trace their origin to Asia which serves as the sole basis for the grouping, regardless of any other characteristics.
It has since seen some use as a replacement of race; for example, the aforementioned Asian Americans can be described as "a panethnicity" of various unrelated peoples of Asia, which are nevertheless perceived as a distinguishable group within the larger multiracial North American society.
More recently the term has also come to be used in contexts outside multiculturalism in US society, as a general replacement for terms like ethnolinguistic group or racial group.
The concept is to be distinguished from "pan-nationalism", which similarly groups related ethnicities but in the context of either ethnic nationalism (e.g. Pan-Arabism, Pan-Celticism, Pan-Germanism, Pan-Iranism, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Turkism), or civic nationalism (e.g. Pan-Africanism).
