Anti-Dumping Measures on Biodiesel by the European Union. Argentina and Indonesia were the two biggest exporters of biodiesel to the European Union. Together, they were responsible for about 90% or 2.5mn tonnes of the biodiesel imports of the European Union in 2012. But by mid-2012, the European Union accused Argentina and Indonesia of dumping their biodiesel in the European Union, meaning that they were both selling their biodiesel under the price of the home market and implemented anti-dumping tariffs on biodiesel from the two countries, effectively halting flows.
