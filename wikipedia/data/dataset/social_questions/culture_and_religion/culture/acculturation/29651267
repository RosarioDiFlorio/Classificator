Communist Albania maintained labour camps (Albanian: Kampe pune, meaning work camps) throughout the territories it controlled. The first Albanian Communist labour camps were around Tirana (although several other camp systems were developed in the north and south of the country as well). A number of camps existed between 1946 and 1991.
