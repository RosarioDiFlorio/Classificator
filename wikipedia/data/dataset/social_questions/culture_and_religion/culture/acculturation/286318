Consumers Union (CU) is a United States-based non-profit organization focusing on product testing, investigative journalism, and consumer advocacy. Consumers Union publishes a magazine and a website, both called Consumer Reports. As of January 2016, its CEO is Marta Tellado, who has served in the position since 2014.
Founded in 1936, CU was created to serve as a source of information that consumers could use to help assess the safety and performance of products. Since that time, CU has continued its testing and analysis of products and services, and attempted to advocate for the consumer in legislative and rule-making areas. Among the reforms in which CU played a role were the advent of seat belt laws, the exposure of the dangers of cigarettes, and more recently, the enhancement of consumer finance protection and the increase of consumer access to quality health care.
The organization has also expanded its reach to a suite of digital platforms.
The organizationâ€™s headquarters, including its 50 testing labs, are located in Yonkers, New York, while its automotive testing track is in East Haddam, Connecticut. CU is funded by subscriptions to its magazine and website, as well as through independent grants and donations.
