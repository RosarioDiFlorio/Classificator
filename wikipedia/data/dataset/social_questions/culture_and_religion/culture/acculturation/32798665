Following the election on 3 October 2010, a process of formation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Council of Ministers had begun. The resulting election has produced a fragmented political landscape without a coalition of a parliamentary majority more than a year after the election. The centralist Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the largest party in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb autonomist Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the largest party in the Republika Srpska, each have 8 MPs of the total 42 MPs of the House of Representatives (28 from FB&H and 14 from RS). Similarly, a crisis of government is also present at the local levels, as well as the Federal entity.
As of late 2011, the government has been solved, however the country remains in a situation of perpetual political crisis, especially the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
After months of dysfunction, and arguments about legality, the short-lived Government of the Federation had collapsed in February 2013.
