The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) practices affirmative action and offers reservation to backward sections of the society. SC/ST/OBC candidates mostly selected against general seats with high marks. However, a few backward class students still face casteism in India so all SC/ST/OBC candidates are offered relaxed admission norms for selection in IIT via reservations.
