Bohnanza is a German-style card game of trading and politics, designed by Uwe Rosenberg and released in 1997 by Amigo Spiele in German and by Rio Grande Games in English. It is played with a deck of cards with comical illustrations of eleven different types of beans (of varying scarcities), which the players are trying to plant and sell in order to raise money. The principal restriction is that players may only be farming two or three types of bean at once, but they obtain beans of all different types randomly from the deck, and so must engage in trading with the other players to be successful. The original game is for three to five players and takes about one hour to play, but the Rio Grande edition adds alternative rules to allow games for two or seven players.
The name is a pun on the words "bonanza" and "Bohne" (German for "bean"). The official English release preserved the name Bohnanza.
