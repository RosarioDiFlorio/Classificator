The International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF) was an independent, nonprofit global members' organisation of multinational companies that worked with business, government and civil society, focusing on sustainability, growth, and leadership issues.
John Brock, Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Enterprises, described IBLF as “an outstanding organization—somewhere you can discuss critical issues, exchange industry best practices, and identify ways to solve tomorrow’s problems”.
The International Business Leaders Forum ceased to operate in October 2013. Several programmes initiated by the organisation continue its work. These include The Partnering Initiative now an independent, not-for-profit global organisation dedicated to unleashing the power of partnership for development.
