London TravelWatch is a statutory British consumer organisation that campaigns for improvements to transport in London. It is the transport watchdog for services provided by Transport for London, which includes facilities for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. It is also the watchdog for National Rail companies in the London area and significant parts of the South East. It also deals with individual complaints by passengers against the relevant transport operators. However, it takes up a complaint only after the operator has already dealt with it, if the complainant remains dissatisfied. It is therefore in consumer representation terms an "appeals body". It is funded by the London Assembly and was established in its current form in July 2000.
