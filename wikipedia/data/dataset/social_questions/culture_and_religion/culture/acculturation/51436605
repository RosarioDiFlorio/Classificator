The Levmoreâ€“Cook moving-knives procedure is a procedure for envy-free cake-cutting among three partners. It is named after Saul X. Levmore and Elizabeth Early Cook who presented it in 1981.  It assumes that the cake is two-dimensional. It requires two knives and four cuts, so some partners may receive disconnected pieces.
