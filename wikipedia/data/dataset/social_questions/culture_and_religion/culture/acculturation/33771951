Indian Judiciary has pronounced some Judgments upholding reservations and some judgments for fine tuning its implementations. Lot of judgments regarding reservations have been modified subsequently by Indian parliament through constitutional amendments. Some judgments of Indian judiciary has been flouted by state and central Governments. Given below are the major judgments given by Indian courts and its implementation status:
1990: Syndicate Bank SC & ST Employees Association (Through its General Secretary Sh K S Badalia) & Others Vrs. Union of India & Others {1990 SCR(3) 713; 1990 SCC Supl. 350}: The Apex Court of the country held that reservation is applicable and available in selection method of promotions of Group-A/Class-1 Officers up to highest (Scale VII :General Manager) level and the Govt of India have committed mistake in not giving reservation to SC & ST Officers w.e.f. 01st January, 1978, the date from which the policy of reservation in Promotions was introduced/ implemented in Public Sector Banks. This judgment was implemented half heatedly only in Syndicate Bank up to April 1993. This historic and landmark judgment couldn't be implemented in other banks/Departments due to bad leadership in the SC & ST Employees Associations/ organizations of some banks like SBI, UCO Bank, Allahabad Bank, etc. because instead of getting this judgment implemented in their banks they, based on this judgment, filed Writ Petitions in Supreme Court and High Courts where they failed. To get this judgment implemented in all Banks, PSUs and Govt. Departments Mr. KS Badalia has struggled hard but he couldn't get any support from any Association, Organization and Political leader.
