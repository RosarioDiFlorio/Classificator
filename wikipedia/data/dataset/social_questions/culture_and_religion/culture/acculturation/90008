Creole peoples (and its cognates in other languages such as crioulo, criollo, creolo, cr√©ole, kriolu, criol, kreyol, kreol, kriol, krio, kriyoyo, etc.) are ethnic groups which originated from creolisation, linguistic, cultural and racial mixing between colonial-era emigrants from Europe with non-European peoples, climates and cuisines. Typically, they are partially or fully descended from White European colonial settlers.
The development of creole languages is attributed to, but independent of, the emergence of creole ethnic identities.
