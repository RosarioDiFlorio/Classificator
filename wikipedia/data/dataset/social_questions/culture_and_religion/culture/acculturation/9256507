Funeral Consumers Alliance is a nonprofit federation of organizations ("memorial societies" or "funeral planning societies"), founded in 1963, which operates in the United States and Canada. The alliance's stated goal is that it is "dedicated to protecting a consumer's right to choose a meaningful, dignified, affordable funeral." Based in South Burlington, Vermont, its oldest (and founding) member is the Seattle-based People's Memorial Association, founded on January 12, 1939.
