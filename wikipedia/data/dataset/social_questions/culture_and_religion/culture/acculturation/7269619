A strike suit is a lawsuit brought by a single person or group of people with the purpose of gaining a private settlement before going to court that would be less than the cost of the defendant's legal costs. Such suits frequently appear where the defendant is a considerably larger entity than the plaintiff, such as a corporation or an estate.
