The Australian Press Council (APC) was established in 1976 and is responsible for promoting good standards of media practice, community access to information of public interest, and freedom of expression through the media. The council is also the principal body with responsibility for responding to complaints about Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets.
Regulation of broadcast media in Australia is conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
The APC was only established after the Federal Government began preparation of legislation to create a government authority to ensure accountability in 1975.
In accordance with its Constitution, the Council pursues its goals by:
considering and dealing with complaints and concerns about material in newspapers, magazines and journals, published either in print or on the internet;
encouraging and supporting initiatives to address the causes for reader's complaints and concerns;
keeping under review, and where appropriate, challenging developments which may adversely affect the dissemination of information of public interest and may consequently threaten the public's right to know;
making representations to governments, public inquiries and other forums as appropriate on matters concerning freedom of speech and access to information;
undertaking research and consultation on developments in public policy affecting freedom of speech, and promoting;
promoting an understanding of the roles and activities of the Council through forums and consultations; and encouraging feedback for Council's consideration
The Council is funded by its publisher members in the newspaper and magazine industries. It relies on publishers and editors to respect the Council's standards and decisions, to adhere voluntarily to standards of good practice and to publish adjudications the result from complaints made against them. It has no legal or legislative power to fine or penalise the press.
