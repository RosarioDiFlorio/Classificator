The discovery of tetracycline engendered an enormous amount of litigation. In late 1958, the U.S. government charged Pfizer and American Cyanamid with price fixing in connection with tetracycline.  That and other related litigation lasted until 1982. Often, the series of cases is referred to as the “antibiotics litigation.”
