Country Reports on Human Rights Practices are publications on the annual human rights conditions in countries and regions outside the United States, submitted annually by the United States Department of State to the United States Congress. The reports cover internationally recognized individual, civil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The first report covered the year 1976, issued in 1977.
The People's Republic of China has responded to frequent criticism in this report by releasing a similar annual report titled the "Human Rights Record of the United States."
