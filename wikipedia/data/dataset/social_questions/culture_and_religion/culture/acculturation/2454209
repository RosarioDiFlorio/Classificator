The adjusted winner procedure is a procedure for envy-free item assignment. It is used to partition a bundle of goods between two players in such a way as to minimize envy and maximize efficiency and equitability. The procedure is used in divorce settlements and illustrates the concept of Nash equilibria.
The method is also interesting from an ethical perspective as it appears to encourage honesty.
