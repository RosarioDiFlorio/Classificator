A dispute mechanism is a structured process that addresses disputes or grievances that arise between two or more parties engaged in business, legal, or societal relationships. Dispute mechanisms are used in dispute resolution, and may incorporate conciliation, conflict resolution, mediation, and negotiation.
Otherwise known as grievance mechanisms, dispute mechanisms are typical non-judicial in nature, meaning that they are not resolved within the court of law. According to research produced by the non-judicial grievance mechanism task force of John Ruggie, Special Representative of Business and Human Rights to the United Nations, those who design and oversee non-judicial mechanisms should acknowledge core human rights processes defined by "all core UN human rights treaties.‚Äù
Dispute mechanisms comprise a way for socially responsible businesses to meet requirements of corporate responsibility-related agreements or pacts, reduce risk while capacity-building or developing internationally, and assist larger processes that create positive social change.
Dispute mechanisms are an increasingly effective tool for establishing communication channels between businesses and communities. When successful, they offer a trusted way for local peoples or communities to voice and resolve concerns related to development projects, while providing companies with transparent, effective ways to address community concerns. According to a publication by the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman of the World Bank Group, "locally-based grievance resolution mechanism(s) provide a promising avenue by offering a reliable structure and set of approaches where local people and the company can find effective solutions together." Generally, it is agreed that a well-functioning grievance mechanism should:
Provides a predictable, transparent, and credible process to all parties, resulting in outcomes that are seen as fair, effective, and lasting
Builds trust as an integral component of broader community relations activities
Enables more systematic identification of emerging issues and trends, facilitating corrective action and preemptive engagement.
