The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations was founded in 1981 by the President and Deans of Harvard University to improve relations among racial and ethnic groups at the University. The Harvard Foundation sponsors activities to promote interracial and intercultural awareness in the Harvard community that range from student-led discussions on issues regarding diversity to ceremonies that highlight the multicultural contributions of people within and beyond Harvard. The current and founding director of the Foundation is Dr. S. Allen Counter, who leads an administrative coordinator, a programming fellow, and a team of student interns.
