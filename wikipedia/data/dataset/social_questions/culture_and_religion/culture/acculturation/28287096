Anti Raggers is a non-political student group spread over the universities in Sri Lanka. There is no special bond or whatever to hold this group together. Only their self beliefs of doing what is correct is considered. The major view of the students and lecturers in the group is to prevent ragging and bullying on freshers. Also they act as a protective group for the freshers in the universities.
Although there is a lot of political pressure being built up on the group by certain political parties whose major aim is to gather student votes, the Anti Raggers or 'Boggu' or 'Ala' as they are fondly named keep on their good work throughout. The current government of Sri Lanka is also against the Ragging system so hopefully these two parties will be able to stop this ugly feature in the university system.
University Independent Conversion Movement convenor Yukthi Ekadeera affiliated to the Sri Lankan government, accused the Inter University Students’ Federation(IUSF) ”Anthare” of being responsible for ragging (initiation) incidents and other acts of violence in Sri Lankan universities, and declared that it would go to court to demand a ban on the IUSF.
