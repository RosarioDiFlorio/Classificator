The Institute for Justice and Reconciliation (IJR) is a non-governmental organisation and think tank based in Cape Town, South Africa. It was forged out of the country’s Truth and Reconciliation process in 2000. The aim was to ensure that lessons learnt from South Africa’s transition from apartheid to democracy were taken into account as the nation moved ahead. Patron of the IJR is Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu.
