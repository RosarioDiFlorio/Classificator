Imbros or İmroz, officially changed to Gökçeada since 29 July 1970, (older name in Turkish: İmroz; Greek: Ίμβρος Imvros), is the largest island of Turkey and the seat of Gökçeada District of Çanakkale Province. It is located in the Aegean Sea, at the entrance of Saros Bay and is also the westernmost point of Turkey (Cape İncirburnu). Imbros has an area of 279 km2 (108 sq mi) and contains some wooded areas.
According to the 2016 census, the island-district of Gökçeada has a population of 8,776. The main industries of Imbros are fishing and tourism. Today the island is predominantly inhabited by settlers from the Turkish mainland that mostly arrived there after 1960, but from the indigenous population about 300 Greeks are still remaining, most of them elderly, but including some families with children. The island was primarily inhabited by ethnic Greeks from ancient times through to approximately the 1960s, when many emigrated to Greece, western Europe, the United States and Australia, due to a campaign of state-sponsored discrimination. The Greek Imbriot diaspora is thought to number some 15,000.
