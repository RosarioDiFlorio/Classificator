State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (AIR 1951 SC 226) is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India. This judgement led to the First Amendment of the Constitution of India. It was the first major judgement regarding reservations in Republic of India. In its ruling the Supreme Court upheld the Madras High Court judgement,which in turn had struck down the Communal Government Order (G.O) passed in 1927 in the Madras Presidency. The Communal G.O had provided caste based reservation in government jobs and college seats. The Supreme Court's verdict held that providing such reservations was in violation of Article 16 (2) of the Indian Constitution.
