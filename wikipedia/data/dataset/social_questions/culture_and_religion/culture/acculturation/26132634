A scapegoat is an animal who takes on the sins of others, or is unfairly blamed for problems. The concept originally comes from Leviticus, in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert (via a cliff) with the sins of the community. Other ancient societies had similar practices. In psychology and sociology, the practice of selecting someone as a scapegoat has led to the concept of scapegoating.

And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for Azazel.
