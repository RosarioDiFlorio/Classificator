Heightism is prejudice or discrimination against individuals based on height. In principle, it refers to discriminatory treatment against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range of height in a population. Height discrimination is most common against shorter than average men and is generally accepted and ignored. Constitutionally tall women have resorted to high dosages of oestrogen to reduce their height.
Research indicates that the human brain uses height as a heuristic for determining social status and fitness. The brain automatically associates physical size with leadership potential, power, strength and intelligence, a effect which has been discovered in infants as young as 10 months old. Evolutionary psychologists theorise that this is due to height indicating that the individual had been better fed, indicating higher social status and thus resources available to them, as well as indicating general health and physical strength, the latter of which can be useful in asserting dominance. The automatic association between height and the aforementioned traits has also been found to be much stronger when it comes to assessing men than women. This means that in general, height is an honest signal of a individual's social status.
