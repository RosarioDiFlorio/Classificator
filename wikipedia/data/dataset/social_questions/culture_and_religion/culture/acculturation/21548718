The term "Polish Border Strip" (German: Polnischer Grenzstreifen; Polish: polski pas graniczny) or "Polish Frontier Strip" refers to those territories which the German Empire wanted to annex from Congress Poland after World War I. It appeared in plans proposed by German officials as a territory to be ceded by the Kingdom of Poland to the German Empire after an expected German and Central Powers victory. German planners also envisioned forced expulsion and resettlement of the Polish and Jewish population which would be replaced by German colonists. The proposed area of the Border Strip comprised up to 30,000 kmÂ² (approximately the size of Belgium), and up to 3 million people were to be removed by the German Empire to make room for Germans. The strip was also intended to separate the Polish inhabitants of Prussian-held Greater Poland from those in Congress Poland.
The plan has been described by historian Hajo Holborn as the first instance in modern European history of removing whole populations as a planned solution to national conflicts.
