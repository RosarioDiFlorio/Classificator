Mun Awng (born 1960) is a Kachin singer, song writer, and pro-democracy activist. Awng was born in the Kachin State in north of Burma to a small Christian minority. His Christian name was Dennis Daws, a name he later changed. Awng became a popular singer and musician in Burma during the 1980s. Due to having participated in the wave of anti-government demonstrations in 1988, that resulted in more than 3,000 dead civilians, he was forced to leave Burma and has been living in exile in Eidsvoll, Norway since. He fled to Norway to work with the opposition Democratic Voice of Burma radio and television broadcaster. From abroad he continued to release albums and activists sang his songs while facing down the military in both the 1996, and the 2007 anti-government street protests. Awng is considered a "subversive element" by the military junta in Burma.
