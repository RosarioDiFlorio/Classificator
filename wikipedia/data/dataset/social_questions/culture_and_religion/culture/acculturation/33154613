Persecution of Hazara people refers to the systematic discrimination, ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Shia Hazara people, who are primarily from the central highland region of Hazarajat in Afghanistan. Significant populations of the Hazara people are also found in Quetta, Pakistan and Mashad, Iran as part of the Hazara and Afghan diasporas. The persecution of Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, with Babur from Kabulistan. It is reported that during the reign of Emir Abdur Rahman (1880â€“1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved. Syed Askar Mousavi, a contemporary Hazara writer, claims that half the population of Hazarajat was displaced, shipped to neighbouring Balochistan in British India and Khorasan Province in Iran. This led to Pashtuns and other groups occupying parts of Hazarajat. The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres committed by the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Although the situation of the Hazaras has not yet improved in Afghanistan even after the end of the Taliban government's reign in 2001, thousands of Hazara people have been persecuted in neighboring Pakistan, by sunni extremist groups in recent years.
