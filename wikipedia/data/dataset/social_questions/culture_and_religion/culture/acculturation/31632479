The Council for Mass Media in Finland (Finnish: Julkisen sanan neuvosto, abbr. JSN; Swedish: Opinionsnämnden för massmedier) is a self-regulatory organ of the Finnish mass media. It controls journalists related to publishers who have adopted the good journalistic guidelines and makes resolutions on the bases of appeals. It was established in 1968 and one of its goals was to diminish the need for juridical investigations in the courts mainly caused by criticism of the leftist radicals in the late 1960s.
