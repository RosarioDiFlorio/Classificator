Jamie Awe vs. LucasFilm Ltd. was lawsuit filed by Belizean archaeologist Jamie Awe on behalf of Belize against Lucasfilm, its owner Disney, and Paramount Pictures over the use of a crystal skull replica in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In his complaint Awe demanded the return of the Crystal Skull, which he said was a national treasure, from a treasure-hunting family who allegedly stole it. The lawsuit further claimed damages from profits of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Neither Lucasfilm nor Paramount reacted immediately to news of the lawsuit. They said the artifact was found in Peru and was of unspecified Native American heritage. The case was ultimately settled out of court by way of a confidential agreement between the parties.
