South Africa has a liberal constitution that protects all basic political freedoms. However, there have been many incidents of political repression, dating back to at least 2002, as well as threats of future repression in violation of this constitution leading some analysts, civil society organisations and popular movements to conclude that there is a new climate of political repression or a decline in political tolerance. Bishop Rubin Phillip has said that "a dark night is settling over our country as the light of our democratic dawn dims". Some have linked the increase in repression to the influence of the 'security cluster' under the Jacob Zuma presidency.
It has been argued that "Zuma has enhanced the coercive capacity of the state" and that he has focused on "building a state based on fear". It has also been argued that repression has affected poor people's organisations most seriously but that repression directed against poor people has been systemically under-reported in the media. It has been claimed that senior ANC politicians are responsible for the repression of grassroots activists. 
Serious concern has been expressed about police brutality in South Africa. Sipho Hlongwane, writing in Business Day, has argued that "South Africa is a brutal police state." According to Greg Marinovich "The police are acting with impunity. Their political masters are acting with impunity. In the South Africa of 2012, if you are poor and without political clout, you are on your own." Amnesty International has expressed serious concerns about brutality, including torture and extrajudicial killings, at the hands of the police in South Africa. Ronnie Kasrils has argued that there has been a "descent into police state depravity" under Jacob Zuma. It has been observed that "Torture is routine practice in South Africa's police stations and prisons".
