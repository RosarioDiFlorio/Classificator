A majority is the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements.
"Majority" can be used to specify the voting requirement, as in a "majority vote". A majority vote is more than half of the votes cast.
A majority can be compared to a plurality, which is a subset larger than any other subset considered. A plurality is not necessarily a majority as the largest subset considered may consist of less than half the set's elements. This can occur when there are three or more possible choices.
In British English the term majority is also alternatively used to refer to the winning margin, i.e. the number of votes separating the first-place finisher from the second-place finisher.
Other related terms containing the word "majority" have their own meanings, which may sometimes be inconsistent in usage.
It is a situation when more than half the members in a group support a decision it is called majority
