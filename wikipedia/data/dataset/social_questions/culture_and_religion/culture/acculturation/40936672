The Press Recognition Panel was created by the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press. The Press Recognition Panel's function is to carry out activities relating to the recognition of press regulators.
In October 2016, IMPRESS became the UK's first recognised press regulator, after its application was approved by the independent PRP Board.
