Operation Mavhoterapapi (English: Operation Where You Put Your X), was a large scale Zimbabwean government campaign to punish those who supposedly voted for the Movement for Democratic Change in the 2008 presidential election rather than for ZANU-PF.
However, the campaign met with harsh condemnation from Zimbabwean opposition parties, church groups, non-governmental organizations, and the wider international community.
