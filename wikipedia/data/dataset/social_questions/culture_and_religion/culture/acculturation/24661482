Ashley Kriel, a 20-year-old South African activist, was killed by police in Cape Town on 9 July 1987 for his role in advocating anti-apartheid actions. In 1999, Jeffrey Benzien was granted an amnesty by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission for his part in the killing.
On his release from prison in February 1990, Nelson Mandela acknowledged Ashley Kriel's sacrifice for the anti-apartheid struggle.
In his memory, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation and the University of the Western Cape created the annual Ashley Kriel Memorial Youth Lecture to highlight youth leadership challenges throughout the country.
