The Global Pound Conference series (GPC) is a series of conferences about alternative dispute resolution (ADR) being held in many cities in several countries in 2016/2017. The title of the current conference series is "Shaping the Future of Dispute Resolution & Improving Access to Justice".
The series was inspired by Harvard law professor Roscoe Pound and a 1976 conference named for him, which was an impetus for the growth in the popularity of mediation in the USA
The GPC series will bring a Global Pound Conference to multiple locations around the world in 2016 and 2017. It aims to raise awareness about the various dispute resolution methods that are available, and will bring together users, providers and advisors in several countries to discuss the future direction of ADR.
