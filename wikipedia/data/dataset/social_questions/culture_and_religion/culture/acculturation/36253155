Herb Cohen is an American negotiation expert.
Cohen is a corporate and government negotiator and strategy consultant in areas of commercial dealings and crisis management. He is the author of New York Times bestseller You Can Negotiate Anything and has written several articles and blogs, and has given countless speeches on topics related to deal-making, sales, negotiating, branding, and motivating.
In 1980, Herb Cohen was dubbed "The World's Best Negotiator" by Playboy Magazine. Also, in the June 1981 issue of Time Magazine, it is stated: "If you are ever in a crucial life-changing negotiation, the person you want on your side of the table is Herb Cohen." Washington Post Syndicated Columnist Jack Anderson, on Thursday, February 12, 1981, wrote this quote: "To help get our fifty-two hostages back from Iran, the Carter Administration called upon Herb Cohen, an internationally respected negotiator. He not only told Jimmy Carter's people what they were doing wrong--while they were doing it--but predicted the release of the hostages almost to the exact hour....On the other hand, Ronald Reagan responded as Cohen recommended, and the Iranian's reacted as Cohen predicted--on the exact deadline he had foreseen."
In 1995, Publisher's Weekly stated that You Can Negotiate Anything was the fifth best selling audiobook of all time.
Cohen, represented by the Executive Speakers Bureau, was selected as one of the five most In-Demand keynote speakers in North America in 2001.
