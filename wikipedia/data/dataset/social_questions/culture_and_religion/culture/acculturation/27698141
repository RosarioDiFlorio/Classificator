Mrs. Mary J. Hayden was born in 1830 in Athens, Maine as Mary J. Bean, and spent her early childhood with her grandparents in the town of Cornville, Maine. In 1845 Miss Bean emigrated with her parents to the wilds of Wisconsin, where in 1847, she met and married Gay Hayden. In 1850, they emigrated to the Oregon Territory and settled in what is now Vancouver, Washington. In 1851 upon hearing of the Donation Land Claim Act, a year after the act was passed by Congress, they settled on an island situated on the Columbia River between modern-day Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington that would become known as Hayden Island. Gay Hayden proceeded to build a grand home and live on the island for five years with Mary and their twin children. Together and individually, they would both become well-known pioneers of the Pacific Northwest.
