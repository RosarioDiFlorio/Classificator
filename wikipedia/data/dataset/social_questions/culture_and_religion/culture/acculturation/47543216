Neither the Constitution of Czech Republic nor any other Czech law contains any specific mention of an official or state language of the Czech Republic. German, Polish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Romany, Slovak and Croatian are spoken in the Czech Republic, but only the first four are recognized as official minority languages. The Czech Republic signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2000.
