United States of Banana is a 2011 postcolonial work of fiction by the Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi. It is a mixed-genre work which blends experimental theater, prose poetry, short story, and essay with a manifesto on democracy and American power in a postâ€“September 11 world. The postmodern book narrates the author's violent displacement from her home in the Battery Park neighborhood in New York City.
