Universalism is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have universal application or applicability. A community that calls itself universalist may emphasize the universal principles of most religions and accept other religions in an inclusive manner, believing in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine. For example, some forms of Abrahamic religions claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and feel inclusive.
Christian Universalism is focused around the idea of universal reconciliation, also known as universal salvation — the doctrine that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.
A belief in one fundamental truth is also another important tenet. The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the Rig Veda states, “Truth is one; sages call it by various names.” 
Universalism has had an influence on modern Hinduism, in turn influencing western modern spirituality.
Unitarian Universalism emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality and focuses on the universal principles of most religions. It accepts all religions in an inclusive manner.
