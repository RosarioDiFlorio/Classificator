Christianity and Islam are the largest religions in the world and share a historical and traditional connection, with some major theological differences. The two faiths share a common place of origin in the Middle East, and consider themselves to be monotheistic.
Christianity developed out of Second Temple Judaism in the 1st century CE. It is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow him are called Christians.
Islam is a monotheistic religion that developed in the 7th century CE. Islam, which literally means "surrender" or "submission" (to God), was founded on the teachings of Muhammad as an expression of surrender to the will of Allah.
Muslims have a range of views on Christianity, from viewing Christians to be fellow possessors of monotheistic scriptures to regarding them as heretics. Christian views on Islam are diverse and range from considering Islam a fellow Abrahamic religion worshipping the same God, to believing Islam to be heresy or an unrelated cult.
Christianity and Islam both consider Jesus to be the Jewish Messiah of the Hebrew scripture. Christians generally consider Jesus to be the Son of God, while Muslims consider the Trinity to be a division of God's Oneness and a grave sin (shirk). Muslims believe Jesus (Isa) to be a messenger of God, not the son of God.
Christianity and Islam have different scriptures, with Christianity using the Bible and Islam using the Quran, however Muslims believe that Gospel was also sent by God beforehand. Both texts offer an account of the life and works of Jesus. Belief in Jesus is a fundamental part of Islamic theology, and Muslims view the Christian Injeel as altered, while Christians consider Gospels to be authoritative and the Quran to be a later, fabricated or apocryphal work. Both religions believe in the Virgin birth of Jesus through Mary, but the Biblical and Islamic accounts differ.
