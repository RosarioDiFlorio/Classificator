The ARIA Music Award for Best World Music Album, is an award presented within the Artisan Awards at the annual ARIA Music Awards. The ARIA Awards recognise "the many achievements of Aussie artists across all music genres", and have been given by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) since 1987.
Album recordings by a group or solo artist are eligible. The award is handed out for an indigenous, ethnic, folk or cross-cultural recording, and cannot be entered into any other genre category. The final nominees and winner is chosen by a judging school, which comprises between 40 and 100 members of representatives experienced in this genre.
Gypsy fusion band Monsieur Camembert, oud virtuoso Joseph Tawadros and Yolngu singer-songwriter Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu have each won the award the most times with three wins.
