Vulnerable area (sv: Utsatt område) is a term applied by police in Sweden to areas with high crime rates and social deprivation. In the December 2015 report, these areas numbered 53. In the June 2017 report, these totalled 61.
All the areas are situated south of the town of Gävle and most most are areas constructed during Million Programme (MP), although there are towns north of Gävle having MP areas they do not experience the crime rate of some southern MP areas.
