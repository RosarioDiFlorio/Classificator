Maltenglish, also known as Manglish, Minglish, Maltese English or Maltingli≈º, refers to the phenomenon of code-switching between Maltese, a Semitic language, and English, a Germanic language.
Both Maltese and English are official languages in Malta, and about 88% of the Maltese people can speak English as a second language. Various Maltese social groups switch back and forth between the two languages, or macaronically mix lexical aspects of Maltese and English while engaging in informal conversation or writing.
Maltenglish can also refer to English loanwords in the Maltese language.
