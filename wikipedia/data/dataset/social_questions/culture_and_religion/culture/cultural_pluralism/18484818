Psi Sigma Phi (ΨΣΦ) Multicultural Fraternity, Incorporated was founded December 12, 1990, at Montclair State University and New Jersey City University. The Eighteen Founding Fathers believed that multiculturalism is not indicative of the physical composition of an organization on a chapter or national level; it is viewed as a state of mind––a philosophy that embraces any and all aspects of cultural identity with unconditional respect and equality.
