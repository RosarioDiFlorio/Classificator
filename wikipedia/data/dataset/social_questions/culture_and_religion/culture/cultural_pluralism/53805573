Ovarian Psycos is a bicycle brigade established in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, in 2010, that supports young women of color in leadership and empowerment activities. The group was founded by Xela de la X, a mother, artist, activist and a survivor of sexual abuse. She formed the group as a feminist community sisterhood that feels comfortable taking up space as well confronting the harassment of women. The women come from working class communities in North and East L.A. and rides are organized monthly on the full moon.
A documentary by Joanna Sokolowski and Kate Trumbull-LaValle premiered in 2016 at SXSW and was screened on March 27, 2017 on the KCET Independent Lens program.
