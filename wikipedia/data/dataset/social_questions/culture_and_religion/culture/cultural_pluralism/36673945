Aram of the Two Rivers is an album by bass guitarist Jonas Hellborg, released in 1999 through Bardo Records.
It was recorded live in Syria in 1996 at two venues: the Al Azam Palace in Damascus and one of the oldest caravanserais in Aleppo.
Composed of six improvised suites, the album is an "infectious" (Eric Saidel, All About Jazz) fusion of jazz and Arabic music,melding Hellborg's polyrhythms and Middle Eastern modal harmonic structures with authentic sounds of ethnic instruments played by talented local musicians.
Darbukas (Tarek Malas and Mahfouz Al Hosaini) and riqq (Nabil Khaiat) are assisting Hellborg's acoustic bass in its rhythmic and melodic drive, joined by ney player Mased Sri al Den on the first three tracks and violinist Hadi Backdonas on the last three. The result is a collection of intriguing, though pleasantly accessible, silence-breathing arrangements with virtuous melodic exchanges, unison played ideas and haunting (at times even dance-like) rhythms.
