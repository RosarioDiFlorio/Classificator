Umar's Assurance, or al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya (Arabic: العهدة العمرية‎), is an assurance of safety given by the Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab to the people of Aelia, the Roman name for Jerusalem. Several versions of the Assurance exist, with different views of their authenticity.
The significance of the Assurance is discussed by early Muslim historians such as al-Waqidi, al-Baladhuri, in addition to Ibn al-Athir and Abu al-Fida’. The text of the document is included, either abridged or as long text, in the works al-Ya'qubi, Eutychius, al-Tabari (copied from Sayf ibn Umar), al-Himyari, Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali, and Ibn al-Jawzi.
Opinions differ on the authenticity of the different versions of the Assurance. Many historians have questioned the authenticity of the Christian versions of this pact and argue that such documents were forged by Christian scribes to secure their possession of some religious sites. Some historians consider aspects of al-Tabari's version to be authentic. For instance, Moshe Gil while discussing al-Tabari's version points out that "the language of the covenant and its details appear authentic and reliable and in keeping with what is known of Jerusalem at the time."
