The First Nations Endangered and Endangered Languages Program (FNEL, formerly known as the First Nations Languages Program, FNLG) was initiated in 1996 as part of University of British Columbia’s ongoing commitment to community-based collaboration with First Nations peoples, in recognition of the profound importance of First Nations languages, and the rich cultural traditions they represent. FNEL and UBC’s Vancouver Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓-speaking Musqueam people.
