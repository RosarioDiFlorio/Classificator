An English-medium education system is one that uses English as the primary medium of instructionâ€”particularly where English is not the mother tongue of the students.
Initially associated with the expansion of English from its homeland in England and the lowlands of Scotland and its spread to the rest of Great Britain and Ireland, the rise of the British Empire increased the language's spread, as has the increased economic and cultural influence of the United States since World War II.
A working knowledge of English is perceived as being valuable; for example, English is very dominant in the world of computing. As a result, many states throughout the world where English is not the predominant language encourage or mandate the use of English as the normal medium of instruction.
