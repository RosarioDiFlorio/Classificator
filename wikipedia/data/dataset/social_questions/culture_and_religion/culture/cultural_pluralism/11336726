LOTE or Languages Other Than English is the name given to language subjects, other than English, at Australian, New York, and other schools. The name evolved from 'heritage language', a term first used to refer to languages other than French and English in Canada. Later modified in relation to Australia to refer to languages other than English. LOTEs have often historically been related to the policy of multiculturalism, and tend to reflect the predominant non-English languages spoken in a school's local area, the idea being to play a part in the maintenance of cultural identities in local communities.
LOTE is also used to describe written material presented in languages other than English.
