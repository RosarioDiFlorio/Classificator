StarDict, developed by Hu Zheng (胡正), is a free GUI released under the GPL for accessing StarDict dictionary files (a dictionary shell). It is the successor of StarDic, developed by Ma Su'an (馬蘇安), which version numbers it follows.
According to StarDict's earlier homepage on Sourceforge, the project has been removed from SourceForge due to copyright infringement reports. There is now a StarDict project on Google Code.
