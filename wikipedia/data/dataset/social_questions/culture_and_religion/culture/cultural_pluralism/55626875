MANA, A National Latina Organization, also known as MANA and formerly known as the Mexican-American Women's National Association, is a national Latina organization that advocates for equality and empowers Latinas through leadership development and programming. MANA was founded in 1974 as the Mexican American Women's National Association, making it one of the oldest consistently active Mexican-American advocacy organizations, and as of 2000 is considered the largest Latina organization in the United States. The organization was formed to address the intersection of Mexican-American and women's needs for equal rights: Second-wave feminism primarily benefited white women and the Chicano Movement perpetuated male dominance and traditional gender roles. The founders created MANA with the intent of having a uniquely Latina-oriented organization, and as of 2000 MANA is considered the largest Latina organization in the United States. MANA publicizes and addresses Latina perspectives and needs through Social movements, Leadership education, and Advocacy within federal, state, and local governments. They have been involved with multiple major social movements throughout their history, including advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment and Reproductive rights, and focus on education, leadership development, women's healthcare, and racial discrimination through their work. MANA currently operates from its home base in Washington, D.C. and has local chapters across the nation.
The organization was founded as the Mexican American Women's National Association, but was renamed MANA, A National Latina Organization in 1994. This renaming officially welcomed women of all Hispanic identities, who had previously been members but were not included in the organization's name or mission statement.
