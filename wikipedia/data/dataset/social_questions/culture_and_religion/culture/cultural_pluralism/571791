BBC Asian Network is a British radio station whose target audience is young people aged 15-35 of South Asian descent (Bangladeshi/Indian/Pakistani), and anyone with an interest in South Asian affairs. The music and news comes out of the main urban areas where there are significant communities with these backgrounds. The station has production centres in London (Broadcasting House) and Birmingham (The Mailbox).
In mid 2017, BBC Asian Network's management was merged with that of BBC Radio 1Xtra. Head of BBC Asian Network Mark Strippel was given joint control of both stations, creating a super-network for two of the UK's largest ethnic minority groups.
BBC Asian Network now broadcasts mainly in English, but has retained Sunday evening shows with language content covering five major South Asian regions: Southern India and Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Punjab, Bangladesh and Gujarat. The station's output consists largely of music and talk programmes, with a daily documentary series Asian Network Reports.
