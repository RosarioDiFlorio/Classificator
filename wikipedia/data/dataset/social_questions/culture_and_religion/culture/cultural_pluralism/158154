Manglish (or sometimes Malglish or Mangled English) is an English-based creole spoken in Malaysia.
The vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from English, Malay, Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tamil, Malayalam and, to a lesser extent, various other European languages, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series.
The Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or Bahasa Rojak, but it differs from the Rojak language by the usage of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly, as their accent of Malay and the jargon are particularly alien to regular Malaysian (West Coast) speakers. This distinction can be heard in the film 'Baik Punya Cilok', in which one of the characters speaks in an authentic Terengganu/Kelantan Manglish.
Manglish in the West coast of West Malaysia is very similar (and often identical) to Singlish.
