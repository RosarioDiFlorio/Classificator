An offshore medical school is a medical school that caters "primarily to foreign (North American) students, wishing to practice medicine in the US and Canada" according to the World Bank, compared to local public schools that focus on their home nation. Nonetheless, the local economies often benefit from the academic and economic influence from those schools. Such schools are chiefly located in the Caribbean.
