English Plus is an American movement formed in reaction to the English-only movement. The intent was to promote greater acceptance of language diversity in the United States in order to encourage a broader American cultural development and more international perspectives. This would be achieved by encouraging education in English as well as secondary languages across the entire population, for immigrants and natives alike. This movement has been supported by language education professionals and minority language advocacy groups.
"English Plus" resolutions have been passed in the U.S. states of New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.
