The Edinburgh Mela is an annual multi-cultural festival held in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is one of the 12 festivals that make up the Edinburgh Festival. The first mela, a Sanskrit word meaning "gathering" or "to meet", was held in 1995 at Meadowbank Stadium, and was organised by members of the city's minority ethnic communities. The festival moved to Pilrig Park in 2000, and to Leith Links in 2010. Running over three days in September, the event attracts around 20 to 25,000 people each year.
Creative Scotland said "The [2010] program aimed to and successfully reflected a range of cultural influences and intercultural influences through the selection of music, film, arts, workshops, and stalls. The festival site contributed massively to the overall Mela program offering a center and focus for celebration, community togetherness and providing the context for a great family day out."
