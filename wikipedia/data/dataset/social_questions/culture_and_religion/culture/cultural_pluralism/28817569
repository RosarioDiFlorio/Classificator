The Pontifical Institute of Arabic and Islamic Studies (Latin: Pontificium Institutum Studiorum Arabicorum et Islamisticae, Italian: Pontificio Istituto di Studi Arabi e dâ€™Islamistica, P.I.S.A.I.) is a Roman Catholic academic organization in Rome, Italy.
The Institute was created in 1926 in Tunis by the Society of Missionaries of Africa (the White Fathers). Its aim was the specific formation of missionaries to live in an Arab-Muslim environment.
In 1949, the centre of studies was moved to Manouba, near Tunis, where the Arabic language and Islamic sciences were taught, while the Tunis centre was becoming what up to today is called the Institute of Arab Literature.
In 1960, the centre was established as a pontifical institute and, in 1964, because of the policy of nationalisations, it was transferred from Tunis to Rome, where it received the support of Pope Paul VI as an instrument for interreligious dialogue, "in keeping with the new spirit of the Second Vatican Council".
