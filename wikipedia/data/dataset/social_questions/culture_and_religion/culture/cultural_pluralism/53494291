In linguistics, the term near-native speakers is used for people who are "highly proficient speakers who are distinguishable from native speakers, but only in small ways." Analysis of native and near-native speakers indicates that they differ in their underlying grammar and intuition, meaning that they do not interpret grammatical contrasts the same way. However, this divergence typically does not impact a near-native speaker's regular usage of the language.
