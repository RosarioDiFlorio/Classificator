Domestic Multiculturalism is a phrase used to define the variety of cultures within the boundaries of a specific domestic geographic area. An example of domestic multiculturalism is the variety of cultures located within the United States. The Southern United States has a distinctly different set of accepted norms than does the West Coast of the United States as does the Northern Plains. These differences in accepted behaviors constitute the variety and value of the “melting pot” of the United States.
