The 1791 German–Serbian dictionary, referred to as the Avramović Dictionary (; full title in German: Deutsch und Illyrisches Wörterbuch zum Gebrauch der Illyrischen Nation in den K. K. Staaten; full title in Slavonic-Serbian: Нѣмецкïй и сербскïй словарь на потребу сербскагѡ народа въ крал. державахъ, transliterated as Německij i serbskij slovar' na potrebu serbskago naroda v kral. deržavah, meaning "German and Serbian Dictionary for Use by the Serbian People in the Royal States"), is a historical bidirectional translation dictionary published in the Habsburg Empire's capital of Vienna in 1791, though 1790 is given as the year of publication in some of its copies. Containing around 20,000 headwords in each direction, it is the largest Serbian dictionary of the 18th century. Vuk Karadžić possibly used it as a source for his Serbian Dictionary, which first appeared in 1818 as the first book in modern literary Serbian.
The Avramović Dictionary translates between Slavonic-Serbian, which was the dominant literary language of Serbs at the time, and German, which had been a subject in Serb schools in the Habsburg Empire since 1753. Teodor Avramović adapted Jacob Rodde's German–Russian dictionary published in 1784 in Leipzig. Avramović was a proofreader at the Cyrillic printing house of Joseph Kurzbeck (alternative spelling: Kurzböck), who published the German–Serbian dictionary. The vernacular Serbian used in the dictionary reflects a dialect of the Serbs in Vojvodina.
