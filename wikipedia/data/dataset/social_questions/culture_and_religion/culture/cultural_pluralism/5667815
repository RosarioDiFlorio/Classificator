Under the Ottoman Empire's millet system, Christians and Jews were considered Dhimmi (meaning "protected") under Ottoman law.
Orthodox Christians were the largest non-Muslim group. With the rise of Imperial Russia, they began to rebel motivated by newly found nationalism, undeterred by the better treatment they received.
Conversion to Islam in the Ottoman Empire involved a combination of individual, family, communal and institutional initiatives and motives. The process was also influenced by the balance of power between the Ottomans and the neighboring Christian states.
