A heritage language is a minority language learnt by its speakers at home as children, but never fully delevoped, because speakers grow up with a dominant language, in which they become more competent. Polinsky & Kagan label it as a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to barely speaking individuals of the home language. In some countries or cultures where they determine one's mother tongue by the ethnic group, a heritage language would be linked to native language. The term can also refer to the language of a person's family or community, which the person does not speak or understand but with which they culturally identify.
