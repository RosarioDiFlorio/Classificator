The Altägyptisches Wörterbuch (English: Ancient Egyptian Dictionary) is a dictionary of the Egyptian language developed by the Research Centre for Primary Sources of the Ancient World at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW) in Berlin, Germany. Intended to be a complete documentation of the Egyptian lexicon, it encompasses varied meanings of words in different texts over 3000 years of linguistic history. The dictionary is entirely based on primary source material, including inscriptions from temple walls, roads, tombs, papyrus, and potsherds from religious, legal, administrative, and literary texts. The Altägyptisches Wörterbuch is publicly available on the internet and is a current project continuously updated by the BBAW.
