In computing, Russification involves the localization of computers and software, allowing the user interface of a computer and its software to communicate in the Russian language using Cyrillic script.
Problems associated with Russification before the advent of Unicode included the absence of a single character-encoding standard for Cyrillic (see Cyrillic script#Computer encoding).
