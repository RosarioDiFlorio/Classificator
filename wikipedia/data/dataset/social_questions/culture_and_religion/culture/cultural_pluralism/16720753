This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color is a feminist anthology edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E. Anzaldúa. First published in 1981 by Persephone Press, the second edition was published in 1983 by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. The book's third edition was published by Third Woman Press until 2008, when its contract with Third Woman Press expired and it went out of print. In 2015, the fourth edition was published by State University of New York Press, Albany.
This Bridge centered the experiences of women of color and emphasized the points of intersectionality within their multiple identities, challenging white feminists who made claims to solidarity based on sisterhood. Writings in the anthology, along with works by other prominent feminists of color, call for a greater prominence within feminism for race-related subjectivities, and ultimately laid the foundation for third wave feminism. This Bridge has become "one of the most cited books in feminist theorizing" (emphasis in original).
