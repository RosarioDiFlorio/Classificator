Songlines is the name of a British based magazine launched in 1999 that covers music from traditional and popular to contemporary and fusion, featuring artists from around the globe.
Songlines is published eight times a year and contains CD reviews, artist interviews, guides to particular world music traditions, concert and festival listings and travel stories. Every issue comes with an accompanying compilation CD featuring sample tracks from 10 of the best new releases reviewed in that issue and 5 additional tracks chosen by a celebrity. A podcast containing highlights of each issue is available to download through iTunes or through the Songlines website.
The magazine is edited by Simon Broughton, co-editor of The Rough Guide to World Music.
The name was chosen based on the aboriginal mythological concept of Songlines.
