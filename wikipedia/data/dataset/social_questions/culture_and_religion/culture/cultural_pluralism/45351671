The Theory of Basic Human values, developed by Shalom H. Schwartz, is a theory in the field of intercultural research. The author considers the theory as an essential extension of previous approaches to comparative intercultural research theories, such as the Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, and has been extensively applied in cross-cultural studies of individual values. The Theory of Basic Human Values tries to measure Universal Values that are recognised throughout all major cultures. Schwartzâ€™s theory identifies ten such motivationally distinct values and further describes the dynamic relations amongst them. To better graphically portray these relationships, the theory arranges the ten values in a circular structure.
