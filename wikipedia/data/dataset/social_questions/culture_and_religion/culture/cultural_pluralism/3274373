The Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne ("Research and Study Group for European Civilization"), also known by its French acronym GRECE (French for "Greece") is an ethnonationalist think-tank, founded in 1968 by the journalist and writer Alain de Benoist.
GRECE distinguishes itself from other traditionalist conservative organizations in displaying specific interest for Germanic and Nordic cultures, rejection of Christianity and monotheism, and advocating neopaganism.
