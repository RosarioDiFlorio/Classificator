The Servus Heritage Festival is a three-day festival honouring Alberta's cultural heritage and cultural diversity, which is held annually over the August long weekend in William Hawrelak Park in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. With the Servus Credit Union as title sponsor since 2007 it is currently known as the Servus Heritage Festival.
The Festival is organized annually by the Edmonton Heritage Festival Association since 1976. At that time eleven communities united with the intent to display their cultures by offering traditional cuisine, entertainment, interpretive materials, and crafts to visitors.
Today in 2015 at its 40th annual anniversary the festival includes more than 85 different cultures in over 60 pavilions, where people present their cultural roots and local and national communities. The tents feature food, entertainment, artwork and crafts, clothing, and teach visitors about various cultures with displays including photos, paraphernalia, and stories.
