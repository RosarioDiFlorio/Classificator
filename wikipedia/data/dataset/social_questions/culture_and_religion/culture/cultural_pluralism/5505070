Peacefrog Records is an independent record label based in London, United Kingdom. The label produces releases in many different styles of electronic music, as well as branching out into folk and indie artists such as José González, Nouvelle Vague and Little Dragon. The label was started by Pete Hutchison and Paul Ballard in 1991. After the Lodger 303 E.P., Ballard withdrew from Peacefrog Records. The record label subsequently released a number of techno records by artists including Luke Slater, Moodymann and Suburban Knight. The label has built up a following over the years, increased by the mainstream success of José González and has become synonymous for synching many of its recently signed artists music to film and television. Notable examples of this include the 2006 iconic Sony Bravia "Balls" (Jose Gonzalez) and in 2011, Twinings "Sea" (Charlene Soraia). Both artists enjoyed top 10 single success as a consequence. Jose Gonzales LP "Veneer" was certified Platinum in 2006 and Charlene Soraia's "Wherever you will go" certified gold in 2012 with sales in excess of 500,000. Other artists signed to the label who have enjoyed commercial success include Nouvelle Vague who achieved sales of over 1 million worldwide over the 3 albums recorded for the label. Peacefrog is also an active and successful music publishing company.
