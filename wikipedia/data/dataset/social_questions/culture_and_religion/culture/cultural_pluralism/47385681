Milege Afrojazz Band, commonly known as Milege, is a world music band from Uganda, made up of young talented musicians from Uganda whose enthusiasm is derived from the diverse cultural music traditions of the different tribes of Uganda into which they fuse contemporary elements to express the likeness of Uganda’s people in a more current context. As of 2015 Milege's members are; guitarist Manana F. Birabi, vocalist Joanita Katushabe, lead vocalist Gloria Akugizibwe, bassist Paul Owembabazi and violinist Alison Nadunga as a seasoned member.

The band has also shared stages with some of the biggest names in African music history including Zimbabwean Oliver "Tuku" Mtukudzi, Maurice Kirya from Uganda, Mame N’Diack from Senegal and Uganda's oldest band, Afrigo Band.
On August 12th 2017, Milege won their very first award at Young Achievers Award in a tight race beating The Triplets Ghetto Kids, Eddy Kenzo, Sheebah Karungi and Geosteady in the Creative Arts (Music) category.
