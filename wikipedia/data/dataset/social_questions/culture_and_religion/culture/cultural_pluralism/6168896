To be multifaith is to feel an affinity with aspects of more than one religion, philosophy or world-view, and perhaps to believe that no one is superior to the others. This term should not be confused with interfaith, which concerns the communication between different religions.
This is inherent to Relativism but exists among followers of other religions such as Confucianism and the Bahá'í Faith, as well as followers of the more liberal currents within Christianity, Islam and Judaism.
