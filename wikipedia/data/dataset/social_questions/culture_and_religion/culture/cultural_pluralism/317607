Music of Nepal refers to the various musical genres heard in Nepal. With more than fifty ethnic groups, the music of the country is highly diverse. Genres like pop, rock, Nep-hop ko bato, folk, classical music, and ratna music are widely found, but many less common genres are yet to be cataloged. Rap also sometimes appears on the Nepalese music charts. Many of the country's musical bands are based in Kathmandu valley, especially the recent ones focused on pop and rock.
