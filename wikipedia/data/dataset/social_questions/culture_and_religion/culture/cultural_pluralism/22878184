"Yé ké yé ké" is a song by Guinean singer Mory Kanté. It was released in 1987 as a single from his third studio album Akwaba Beach. The song became an international hit, it was one of Africa's best-ever selling hits as well as being a European number one in 1988, making it the first ever African single to sell over one million copies. The song was a top five hit in France, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands where it topped the chart for two consecutive weeks. A remix named the "Afro Acid Mix" was especially made to the UK release where it reached No. 25. In 1994, German techno duo Hardfloor remixed the song and released this new version with moderate success. Due to the international popularity of the song, Cantopop singer Priscilla Chan made a cover version (地球大追蹤) which was part of her 1988 album "The Color of Autumn".
