Texxas Jam was the informal nickname of an annual summer rock concert called the Texxas World Music Festival (1978â€“1988). It was held in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl, and in Houston, at either the Astrodome or the Rice Stadium on the campus of Rice University.
The original Texxas Jam was a three-day festival held over July 4 weekend in 1978 and encompassed rock and country. Texxas Jam was created by Louis Messina, promoter of Pace Concerts in Houston, and David Krebs, manager of the rock acts Ted Nugent and Aerosmith. Krebs wanted to duplicate the music festival California Jam II (held March 18, 1978 in Ontario, California) in Texas. Krebs was unfamiliar with the territory, so he contacted Messina in Houston.
A book, Texxas Jam:1978-1988, was published in March 2011 covering all 11 Texxas Jams.
