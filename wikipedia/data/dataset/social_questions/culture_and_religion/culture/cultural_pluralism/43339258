John Emil Augustine (born March 12, 1975) is an American novelist, short story writer, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, mental health advocate, and teacher. Augustine’s literary works are best known for their emphasis on the author’s own spousal abuse at the hands of a mentally unstable wife and the effects of that abuse on subsequent relationships. Less than a year after its release, his first novel, From the Abyss (2013), was recognized as one of the "50 Self-Published Books Worth Reading" by Indie Author Land, 2013/14. His musical career spans four decades (1987–present); however, little information has been released by Augustine himself regarding his career in music. His participation in the Minneapolis music scene is alluded to in his memoir-oriented novels as well as in subsequent interviews.
