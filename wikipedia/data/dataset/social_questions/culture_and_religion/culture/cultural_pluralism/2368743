As of Unicode version 10.0 Cyrillic script is encoded across several blocks, all in the BMP:
Cyrillic: U+0400–U+04FF, 256 characters
Cyrillic Supplement: U+0500–U+052F, 48 characters
Cyrillic Extended-A: U+2DE0–U+2DFF, 32 characters
Cyrillic Extended-B: U+A640–U+A69F, 96 characters
Cyrillic Extended-C: U+1C80–U+1C8F, 9 characters
Phonetic Extensions: U+1D2B, U+1D78, 2 Cyrillic characters
Combining Half Marks: U+FE2E–U+FE2F, 2 Cyrillic characters
The characters in the range U+0400–U+045F are basically the characters from ISO 8859-5 moved upward by 864 positions. The next characters in the Cyrillic block, range U+0460–U+0489, are historical letters, some being still used for Church Slavonic. The characters in the range U+048A–U+04FF and the complete Cyrillic Supplement block (U+0500-U+052F) are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script. Two characters in the block Phonetic Extensions block complete the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet: U+1D2B ᴫ CYRILLIC LETTER SMALL CAPITAL EL and U+1D78 ᵸ MODIFIER LETTER CYRILLIC EN.
Unicode includes few precomposed accented Cyrillic letters; the others can be combined by adding U+0301 ("combining acute accent") after the accented vowel (e.g., ы́ э́ ю́ я́) (see below).
The following two diacritical marks not specific to Cyrillic can be used with Cyrillic text:
U+0301 ◌́ COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT (= Cyrillic stress mark), in Combining Diacritical Marks block U+0300–U+036F
U+20DD ◌⃝ COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE (= Cyrillic ten thousands sign), in Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols block U+20D0–U+20F0
In the table below, small letters are ordered according to their Unicode numbers; capital letters are placed immediately before the corresponding small letters. Standard Unicode names and canonical decompositions are included.
