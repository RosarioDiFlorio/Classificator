Carabram is an annual multi-cultural festival in Brampton, Ontario, founded in 1982.
The festival was founded after volunteers from different ethnic communities wanted to organize a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. With a name based on a similar Toronto event, the Caravan Festival of Cultures, Carabram's first event included Italian, Scottish, Ukrainian, and West Indian pavilions. By 2003, forty-five-thousand visitors visited 18 pavilions. Canada itself had an anchor pavilion in the late-1980s and early-1990s, but ceased when it failed to get sponsorship.
Brampton Transit runs a free service connecting the pavilions, for people presenting a ticket to the festival.
