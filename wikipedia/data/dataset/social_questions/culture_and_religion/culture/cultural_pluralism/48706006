Third Woman Press is a Queer and Feminist of Color publisher founded in 1979 by Norma Alarcón which she began as a journal in the 1979 when she realized that "there weren't enough other women of color or Latinas for me to have a conversation with."
The press was closed in 2004 and reopened by Sara Ramírez in 2011.
Third Woman Press has also published works by notable women of color such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Cherrie Moraga, Carla Trujillo, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha and Ana Castillo.
