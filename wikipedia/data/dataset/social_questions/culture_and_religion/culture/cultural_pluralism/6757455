Cultural translation represents the practice of translation, which involves cultural differences. Cultural translation can be also defined as a practice whose aim is to present another culture via translation. This kind of translation solves some issues linked to culture, such as dialects, food or architecture.
The main issue that cultural translation must solve consists in translating a text as showing cultural differences of this text, in respecting the source culture.
