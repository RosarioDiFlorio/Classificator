Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (Hindustani: गंगा जमुनी तहज़ीब, گنگا جمنی تھذیب‎, Ganges-Yamuna Culture) is a term used for the culture of the central plains of Northern India, especially the doab region of Ganges (Ganga) and Yamuna rivers, which is regarded as a fusion of Hindu and Muslim elements.
The region of Awadh in the state of Uttar Pradesh is usually considered to be the center of this culture. Allahabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Faizabad-Ayodhya, and Varanasi (Benares) are a few of the many centres of this culture.
Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana in south central part of the India, is also considered an example of communal harmony.
Nawabs of Awadh were fore-runners of this culture.
