"Im Nin'alu" (אם ננעלו‎) is a Hebrew poem by 17th-century Rabbi Shalom Shabazi. It has been set to music and sung by Israeli singer Ofra Haza and others. The poem opens with the words

אם ננעלו דלתי נדיבים דלתי מרום לא ננעלו
Im nin'alu daltei n'divim daltei marom lo nin'alu
Even if the gates of the rich are closed, the gates of heaven will never be closed.
