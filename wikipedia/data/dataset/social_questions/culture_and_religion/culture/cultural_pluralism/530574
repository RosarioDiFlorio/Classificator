Standard English (SE) is any form of the English language that is accepted as a national norm in an English-speaking country. In the British Isles, particularly in England and Wales, the term Standard English usually is associated with the Received Pronunciation-accent and UKSE (United Kingdom Standard English) for grammar and vocabulary. In Scotland the standard language is Scottish Standard English; in the U.S., it generally is associated with a broad range of speech known as General American; and in Australia SE is associated with General Australian English.
