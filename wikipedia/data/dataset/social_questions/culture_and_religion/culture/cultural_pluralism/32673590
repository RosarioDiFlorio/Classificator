Motéma Music is an independent American record label focused on jazz and world music, as well as other creative projects by virtuosic musicians and composers. It was founded by Jana Herzen in San Francisco in 2003, and is now based in Harlem, New York City. Among the artists on the label are Gregory Porter, Ginger Baker, Monty Alexander, Kellylee Evans, Randy Weston, Charnett Moffett, Geri Allen, Lynne Arriale, Rufus Reid, Marc Cary, Jean-Michel Pilc, Lakecia Benjamin, and René Marie. The name means "heart" in the African language of Lingala. Motéma has been described as "what Blue Note was to the jazz labels of the 60s...for the 21st century" and "a welcoming beacon, documenting brilliant improvisers who are rapidly expanding the art form."
