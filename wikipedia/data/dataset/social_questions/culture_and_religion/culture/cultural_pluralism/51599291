The documentary spans inside American Immersion school systems. This film illustrates Americans in the 21st Century and the growing of bilingualism.
Speaking in Tongues begins in a public kindergarten classroom made up of white students and Asian American students. What’s different about this traditional American class room is the teacher only speaks Chinese to her students. Because these children are so young they aren’t getting frustrated by the language barrier instead they are interested and fascinate by something they aren’t used to. This process takes time but teaches the children to remember and focus on signals and speech repetition to eventually comprehend what language is being brought to them. By only hearing a language they are not accustom too, they have no opportunity to confide in English, their first language. The ideal time to become bilingual is before the age of 13. Within the film, every student was immersed before this age. With learning more than one language it benefits your brains and flexibility of ones brain.
Immersion also which is called Language immersion is known as teaching a new language to a group of students solely through that language. Language Immersion is currently being used across the United States but has yet been showed on film other than Speaking in Tongues.
