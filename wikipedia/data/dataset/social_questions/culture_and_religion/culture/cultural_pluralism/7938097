EMMA (Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy) is an organization that raises awareness of discrimination through media campaigns, social networking, and the EMMA Awards 1998-2004.
The EMMA Awards promote diversity within the media industry by publicly recognizing the levels of excellence achieved by the multicultural community, and the qualities that each ethnic group brings to the professional and commercial success of the United Kingdom.
The EMMA Awards is a globally recognized awards ceremony. Lord Richard Attenborough received the 2001 Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London. In the previous year EMMA honored Nelson Mandela.
The UK EMMAs were screened on the Internet in May each year and accompanied by an online voting system. The award categories were revamped for UK EMMA 2002 to reflect a more dynamic entertainment and information based awards ceremony. EMMA hopes that the awards will help to redefine the depth of global cultural diversity and the standards of professional achievement.
