CEDRAC (Centre de documentation et de recherches arabes chrétiennes) is the abbreviated name of the research and documentation center for Arabic Christianity.
This internationally known center for scholarly research was established in 1986 by Fr. Samir Khalil Samir and was incorporated in 1996 into the Université Saint-Joseph.
The center holds 23,000 books and Multimedia-items. The disciplines studied are history, philosophy, philology, and religion: Christianity, Islam and other religions of the region with a focus on Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Egypt. The literature is in several languages and comprises documents about these religions from their origin to the present day. Moreover, it organises seminars and conferences and prepares and publishes various publications.
The CEDRAC sees itself as following in the tradition of the researchers Louis Cheikhô and Georg Graf who worked in this discipline in Beirut at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century.
