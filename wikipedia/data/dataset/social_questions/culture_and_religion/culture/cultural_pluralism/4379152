Southall Black Sisters (SBS) is a non-profit all-Asian organisation based in Southall, West London, England. This Asian women's group was established in August 1979 in the aftermath of the death of anti-fascist activist Blair Peach, who had taken part in a demonstration against a National Front rally at Southall Town Hall.
