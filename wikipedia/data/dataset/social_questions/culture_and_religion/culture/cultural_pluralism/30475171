Dedoose is a web application for mixed methods research developed by academics from UCLA, with support from the William T. Grant Foundation, and is the successor to EthnoNotes.
Dedoose is designed, developed, and operated by SocioCultural Research Consultants (SCRC), whose majority of ownership (i.e. 2 people) consists of academics from UCLA.
Dedoose is an alternative to other qualitative data analysis software, explicitly aimed at facilitating rigorous mixed methods research. It is used by researchers funded by the William T. Grant Foundation, including among those in its Faculty Scholars Program. Dedoose and EthnoNotes have gained recognition for their integration of qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods in combination with interactive data visualizations. The Dedoose family of tools have been used in a wide variety of studies in many industries from medical, market research, social policy research, and other academic social science research
