The school Union College, Tellippalai was established by the American Missionaries in 1816 and it will celebrate its bi-centennial anniversary in 2016. It is located in Tellippalai, Jaffna, Sri-Lanka. It was one of the most affected schools in Sri-Lanka due to the 30 years of Sri Lankan civil war. It started operating in its original location with some semblance of normalcy since 2011.
The Union College Old Students Association, Sydney has carried out yearly get-together and cultural programs since 2008 to raise funds to support the school. It has donated books, bicycles, furniture, computer software and sporting equipment to the school.
The association is planning to celebrate the bi-centennial in Sydney, Australia along with the school celebrations. The organisation celebrated the 200th anniversary of the school at Sydney on May 28, 2016.  An article appeared on page 42 of the August 2016 issue of the Canada Monsoon Journal
