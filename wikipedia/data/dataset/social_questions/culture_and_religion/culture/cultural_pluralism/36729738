Ars Moriende is an album by bass guitarist Jonas Hellborg, released in 1994 through Day Eight Music. Performed together with percussionist and overtone singer Glen Velez, the recording is a journey into a state of meditation on the subject of life and death. The three relatively long pieces tell a story that's in turn relaxing and impetuous, and simultaneously modern and ancient, familiar and exotic sounding. "As always, Hellborg amazes with his skill and emotiveness." (Walter Kolosky for Jazz.com) The album was awarded a Swedish Grammy for the best instrumental album of the year 1994.
