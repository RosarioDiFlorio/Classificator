Bisalog, also Tagbis, is a portmanteau of the words 'Bisaya' and 'Tagalog' which refers to either a Visayan language or Tagalog being infused with words or expressions from the other.
Speakers of Bisalog may often code-switch with English, as well, resulting in what is sometimes called Bistaglish or Tagbislish.
The word also used by radio station DZRH as a news/talk show where it brings the latest news from around the provinces (via Aksyon Radyo) every Sunday at 7am.
