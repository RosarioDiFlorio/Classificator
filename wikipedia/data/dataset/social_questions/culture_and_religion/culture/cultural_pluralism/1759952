Unity in diversity (Latin: unitas in varietate) is a political motto advocating federalism multiculturalism. The phrase is a deliberate oxymoron, the rhetorical combination of two antonyms, unitas "unity, oneness" and varietas "variety, variousness".
The phrase can be traced to Leibniz, who uses it as a definition of "harmony" (Harmonia est unitas in varietate) in his Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei super omnia (1677/8). In modern politics it was first used, as In varietate unitas, by Ernesto Teodoro Moneta in the context of Italian Unification. In 1943 it invoked by Ad√©lard Godbout, Premier of Quebec, in the context of the situation of French Canadians within Canada. The variant In varietate concordia was adopted as the motto of the European Union in 2000.
