Sathya Sai Baba (born Sathya Narayana Raju; 23 November 1926 â€“ 24 April 2011) was an Indian guru, cult leader  and philanthropist. He claimed to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi.
Sai Baba's materialisations of vibhuti (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces, and watches, along with reports of miraculous healings, resurrections, clairvoyance, bilocation, and alleged omnipotence and omniscience, were a source of both fame and controversy. His devotees considered them signs of his divinity, while skeptics viewed them as simple conjuring tricks. 
The Sathya Sai Organisation, founded by Sai Baba "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement", has over 1,200 Sathya Sai Centres (branches) in 126 countries. Through this organisation, Sai Baba established a network of free hospitals, clinics, drinking water projects, auditoriums, ashrams and schools.
