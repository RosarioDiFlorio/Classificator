Porglish or Portuglish (referred to in Portuguese as portinglês – Brazilian: [pɔʁtʃĩˈɡles], European: [puɾtĩˈɡleʃ] – or portunglês – pt-BR: [poʁtũˈɡles], pt-PT: [puɾtũˈɡleʃ]) refers to various types of language contact between Portuguese and English which have occurred in regions where the two languages coexist. These range from improvised macaronic admixture of and code-switching between the languages by bilingual and partially bilingual users, to more-or-less stable patterns of usage. The name is a portmanteau of the English words Portuguese and English, while its Portuguese translation is a portmanteau of the Portuguese words português and inglês.
This kind of pidgin is rare but observable in Macau and other Portuguese-speaking regions in Asia and Oceania, among English-speaking expatriates and tourists in Portugal and Brazil, and Portuguese speakers in countries of the English-speaking world, primarily in North America and Oceania, but also Africa, South America, Caribbean and Asia. The best-studied example of this is spoken in the Portuguese communities in California, in Hawaii (pidgin contributions) and in the region between Fall River and New Bedford in Southeastern Massachusetts.
