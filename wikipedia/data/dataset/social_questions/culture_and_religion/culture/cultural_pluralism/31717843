Mestiza Double Consciousness is a term coined by Peruvian-American Sociologist Sylvanna Falcón in her explanatory study entitled “Mestiza Double Consciousness: The Voices of Afro-Peruvian Women on Gendered Racism.” The term explains how Afro-Peruvian women have become engaged in activism and organized against racism, how they have become aware of their social positions, and how, as an outcome, they have formed a different consciousness that did not previously exist, which Falcón calls the “Mestiza Double Consciousness.”
