To a subtopic: This is a redirect to a subtopic of the redirect's title.
If the redirect topic is detailed enough to sustain its own article, then use {{R with possibilities}} and {{R printworthy}} in addition. If notability of the subject is supportable, then by all means be bold and convert this redirect into an article about the topic.
