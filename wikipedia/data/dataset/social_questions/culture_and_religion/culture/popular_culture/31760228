Go the Fuck to Sleep is a book written by American author Adam Mansbach and illustrated by Ricardo Cort√©s. Described as a "children's book for adults", it reached No. 1 on Amazon.com's bestseller list a month before its release, thanks to an unintended viral marketing campaign during which booksellers forwarded PDF copies of the book by e-mail.
