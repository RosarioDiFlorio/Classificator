Bridge and tunnel (often abbreviated B&T or BNT) began as a pejorative term for people who commute into Manhattan from surrounding communities. Controversy exists over whether this term extends to all individuals outside of Manhattan or rather outside the area served by the New York City Subway, a trip that, due to Manhattan's geography, requires passing over a bridge and/or through a tunnel in a car. It can be used to describe residents of the other four New York City boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island – but typically refers to those who travel into the city from upstate New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Long Island.
