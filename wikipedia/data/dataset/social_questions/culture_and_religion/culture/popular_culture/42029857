Diaosi (Chinese: 屌丝; pinyin: Diǎosī) is a Chinese slang term, often used in a comedic manner, that refers to a young male of mediocre appearance. Born in a humble family, he has no car, no house, and no connections. Yet as the term went viral on the Internet, Chinese youth (regardless of sex) from all backgrounds began to embrace it. It is slowly transforming into a descriptor of the ordinary Chinese citizen who faces everyday struggles and hardships.
