Moha (Chinese: 膜蛤; pinyin: Mó Há,pronounced [mwǒ.xǎ]), literally "admiring toad" or "toad worship", is an internet meme spoofing Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and paramount leader of China. It originated among the netizens in mainland China and has become a subculture on the Chinese internet. In the culture, Jiang is nicknamed ha, or "toad", because of his amphibious resemblance. Netizens who moha (worship the toad) call themselves "toad fans" or "toad lovers" (simplified Chinese: 蛤丝; traditional Chinese: 蛤絲), or "mogicians" (simplified Chinese: 膜法师; traditional Chinese: 膜法師) which is a wordplay of mofashi (simplified Chinese: 魔法师; traditional Chinese: 魔法師, magician) in Mandarin.
Another nickname for Jiang is "elder" or "senior" (simplified Chinese: 长者; traditional Chinese: 長者), for he once called himself an "elder" or "senior" when he was berating a Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung who questioned him. A video clip recording this event spread on the internet and led to the rise of the culture around 2014, when Hong Kong was experiencing a period of political instability. Initially, netizens extracted Jiang's quotes from the video and imitated his wording and tone, for parody and insult. However, as the culture develops, some imitations have taken to carrying affection toward him. The quotes for imitation have also evolved to include what he said during his leadership, and in his personal life.
