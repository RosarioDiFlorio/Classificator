"Hockey Scores" was a song entered in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's contest to replace The Hockey Theme as the theme song of Hockey Night in Canada.
Written by Logan Aubé of Aurora, Ontario, the song is described by the National Post as "an endearingly insane cacophony of screaming babies, screeching animals and gunshot blasts", and by The Globe and Mail as sounding "a lot like a baby riding an unco-operative sheep through an industrial grinder". Aubé originally posted the song on Something Awful, asking participants to vote for it on the CBC's contest website. "Hockey Scores" quickly became the most viewed and among the highest rated of the contest's submissions, though the CBC would not make the decision based on popularity alone.
Although he described the song in his original Something Awful post as "mostly comprised of cat and sheep sounds, baby cries, and gunshots/explosions", Aubé has more recently called it "a beautiful theme encompassing the heart of hockey", claiming that the gunshots symbolize the hard-hitting nature of ice hockey, the cat noises symbolize the grace and agility required by hockey players, and the baby sounds represent Canadians' childlike wonder at watching hockey. Other reviewers have called it "absolutely and irrefutably atrocious".
The song was not among the five selected by the CBC as semi-finalists.
