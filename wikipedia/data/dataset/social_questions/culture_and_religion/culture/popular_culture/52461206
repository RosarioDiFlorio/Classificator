Bana al-Abed (Arabic: بنا العبد‎; born 7 June 2009) is a Syrian girl from rebel-held Aleppo who, with assistance from her English-speaking mother, allegedly sends messages through Twitter documenting the siege of the city. Most of these tweets have documented issues such as airstrikes, destruction, hunger, displacement, the prospect of her and her family's death, her longing for a peaceful childhood, the al-Bab district of eastern Aleppo, and her general calls for peace.
Al-Abed's Twitter account, @AlabedBana, was created on September 24, 2016. Within two days of setting up the account, this 7-year-old girl had used the #HolocaustAleppo, #MassacreInAleppo, #StopAleppoMassacre hashtags and tweeted at Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama and Syrian President Bashar Assad. Twitter has verified al-Abed's account, indicating that "an account of public interest is authentic." The account has nearly 370,000 followers, and is managed by Bana's mother Fatemah. On December 4, 2016, during the 17th Aleppo offensive, her account was taken down, but it was back up within two days and she has been tweeting since.
