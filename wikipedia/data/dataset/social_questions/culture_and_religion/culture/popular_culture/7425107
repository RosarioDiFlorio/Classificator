Line Rider is an internet game, with versions available for Microsoft Silverlight and Flash. It was originally created in September 2006 by Boštjan Čadež (also known as "fsk"), a Slovenian student. Originally appearing on DeviantArt on September 23, 2006, Line Rider quickly became an internet phenomenon.
Line Rider is featured by several websites, such as Yahoo!, but is mainly used on the website Linerider.com, Time Magazine's website and has appeared in several McDonald's commercials for the Snack Wrap in 2008. Line Rider was also selected by staff and voted by users as the Best Webtoy of 2006 in the Jay is Games polls.
