Doppelg채nger Week happens mostly over the first week in February, starting on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday. It is an internet meme/game where users of social networking websites change their profile pictures to that of celebrities, athletes, historical figures, or friends with whom they share appearance traits.
Twins that are not of genetic relation. The meme started in 2010.
Although it was reportedly started by Bob Patel, who was constantly told by workmates that he looks like Tom Selleck, the earliest record of Doppelg채nger Week can be found on Facebook's Doppelg채nger Week Page.
This is most likely coincidence or misrepresentation, the founder of the Facebook page promoting the game and meme remains anonymous. Because of this, the Facebook page will not be authenticated by Facebook and all future postings on the page are restricted. No postings for Doppelganger Week 2015 and on will be possible until Facebook allows the Page to be authenticated.
"It's Doppelg채nger Week on Facebook; change your profile picture to someone famous (actor, musician, athlete, etc.) you have been told you look like. After you update your profile with your twin or switched at birth photo then cut/paste this to your status."
