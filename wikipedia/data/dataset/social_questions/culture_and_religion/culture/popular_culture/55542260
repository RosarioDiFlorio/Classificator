The husband stitch or husband's stitch is a purported historical surgical procedure in which one or more sutures (stitches) than necessary are used to repair the perineum of a woman that has been torn or cut (the latter being episiotomy) during childbirth. The claimed purpose is to tighten the vagina and thereby enhance the pleasure of her male sex partner during penetrative intercourse.
It is viewed as an urban legend by some in the medical profession. Others have described it as a joke to relieve tension. Some regard it as a feminist issue.
While repair of the perineum may be medically necessary, an extra stitch is not, and may cause discomfort. Use of the term occurred in the medical literature once in 1885.
