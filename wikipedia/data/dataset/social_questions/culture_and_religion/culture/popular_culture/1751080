The National Youth Theatre of Great Britain is a registered charity in London. It is committed to the development of young people through the medium of creative arts, and aims to use theatre to aid in this objective. It was founded in 1956 as the world's first youth theatre and has built a reputation as a breeding ground for renowned actors such as Daniel Craig, Daniel Day-Lewis, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba, Colin Firth, Derek Jacobi, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane, Helen Mirren, Rosamund Pike, and Kate Winslet, as well as musicians such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Ed Sheeran (see here for a full list).
Every year, the National Youth Theatre holds acting auditions and technical theatre interviews around the United Kingdom; on average, it receives over 5000 applicants. Currently, around 500 places are offered on summer intake acting and technical courses (in costume, lighting and sound, scenery and prop making, and stage management), which offer participants membership of the National Youth Theatre upon completion. Members are then eligible to audition for the company's productions, which are staged in London's West End, around the UK, and internationally.
Members staged the Olympic and Paralympic Team Welcome Ceremonies at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In 2013, the National Youth Theatre raised their age limit to 25 and introduced a new six-week summer course called Epic Stages to cater for performance and production talent in their new upper age group of 18â€“25. In summer 2014, members staged the Village Ceremonies at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
