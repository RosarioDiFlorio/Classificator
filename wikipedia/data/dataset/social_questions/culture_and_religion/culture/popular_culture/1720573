Anton Gustafsson better known by his stage name Anton Maiden, (born February 24, 1980 in Kinna, Västergötland – died November 1, 2003 in Borås, Västergötland) was a Swedish Internet celebrity that achieved fame around 1999 by singing over MIDI and MOD-versions of Iron Maiden songs. He became famous as a phenomenon of geek and DIY culture.
He started by publishing some songs on the Internet for a small group of friends. After being encouraged by them, he made some songs available to the public in his album Anton Gustafsson tolkar Iron Maiden, which was distributed under Lunacy and Nihilism record labels. In an interview with the Swedish newspaper Expressen (dated June 2000), he told journalist Martin Carlsson that Iron Maiden fans "think that my interpretations are a disgrace to Iron Maiden. But that was never my intent."
Apparently led by feelings of depression, Anton Gustafsson committed suicide in November 2003, and was found dead in Borås after having been missing for a week.
