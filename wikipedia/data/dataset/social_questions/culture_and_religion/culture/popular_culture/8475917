BIFF, later sometimes B1FF, was a pseudonym on, and the prototypical newbie of, Usenet. BIFF was created as and taken up as a satire of a partly amusing, partly annoying, mostly unwelcome intrusion into a then fairly rarefied community. BIFF had a Commodore Vic-20 at first and a Commodore 64 later. BIFF posts were limited to 40 character lines to look like they'd come from those machines.
