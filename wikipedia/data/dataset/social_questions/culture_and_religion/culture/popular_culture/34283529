"I would rather cry in a BMW" is a quotation that became an online sensation in the People's Republic of China in 2010. It originated from Ma Nuo, a 20-year-old female contestant on the television show Fei Cheng Wu Rao (also known in English as If you are the One). The line was in response to a question by an unemployed suitor who asked if Ma would "ride a bicycle with him" on a date. The series of events have been summed up in the media with the quip "I would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle."
