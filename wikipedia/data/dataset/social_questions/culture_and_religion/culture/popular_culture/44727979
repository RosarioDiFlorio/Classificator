An Indian princess (or Native American Princess) is a representation of indigenous women of the Americas . Often Indian princesses are portrayed as daughters of Tribal chiefs. Typically, Indian princesses are depicted as cartoons that conform to unnatural standards of beauty. The most famous and legendized Indian "princess" is Pocahontas. Neo-feminist scholars have stated that the myth of Pocahontas helps to perpetuate white Eurocentric values because she leaves her tribe and becomes a Christian and this arguably insinuates that Christianity is better than traditional indigenous religion. Thus, the myth of Pocahontas becomes a method of to promoting Eurocentric values and norms and tool of colonialism.
