Comping (an abbreviation of accompanying; or possibly from the verb, to "complement") is a term used in jazz music to describe the chords, rhythms, and countermelodies that keyboard players (piano or organ), guitar players, or drummers use to support a jazz musician's improvised solo or melody lines. The term is also used for the action of accompanying, and for left hand part of a solo pianist.
