Genji: Days of the Blade, known in Japan as Genji: Kamui Sōran (GENJI -神威奏乱-, GENJI -Kamui Sōran, lit. Genji: the Godly Disturbance), is an action game that was released for the PlayStation 3. Genji: Days of the Blade takes place three years after the end of Genji: Dawn of the Samurai. The Heishi clan, seemingly vanquished at the end of Dawn of the Samurai, has returned, its military strength bolstered by the use of unholy magic that allows its legions of soldiers to turn into hulking demons. Yoshitsune and his stalwart friend Benkei must do battle with the newly restored Heishi army; this time, however, they gain two powerful allies in their war—the priestess Shizuka, and the spear wielder, Lord Buson. Like the previous Genji game, Days of the Blade is loosely based on the classic work The Tale of the Heike.
The game's presentation at E3 2006, where the producer said that the game was "based on famous battles, which actually took place in ancient Japan" and then battled what he described as a "giant enemy crab", sparked the "Giant Enemy Crab" meme.
