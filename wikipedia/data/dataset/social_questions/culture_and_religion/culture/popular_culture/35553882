Anontune is a proposal for a "fault-tolerant and open platform for social music" from Anonymous. Its current beta implementation allows users to create playlists of song titles which are then playable through Anontune's music engine. Since the music engine works by searching other networks like YouTube these playlists can then be shared without sharing any actual music. Thus Anontune's music engine is more like a client-side metasearch engine than any previous systems. Anonymous hopes that this will make the platform immune from copyright infringement lawsuits by never directly hosting or linking to copyrighted music or allowing it to be downloaded.
