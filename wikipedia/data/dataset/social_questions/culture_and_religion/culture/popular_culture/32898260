El Fua is an Internet meme involving a viral YouTube video of an intoxicated Mexican man called Julio César Segura, who claims to have divine powers, including fortune-telling and revival of the dead.
El Fua became viral after an online news program, Nayarit en Línea, from Nayarit, Mexico, uploaded the video to YouTube, becoming quickly popular both on that website and on Twitter.
