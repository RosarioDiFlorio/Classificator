Kanye Zone is a browser game developed by Otter Spice Productions. It was released on March 9, 2012, and involves the player controlling a bumper in order to prevent an image of American musician Kanye West's head from entering a circle of increasing size, referred to as his "zone". The game incorporates sound clips from West's song "Niggas in Paris", and its premise is a parody of the song's lyrics.
Created by roommates Michael Frederickson and Stephen Barlow and inspired by 1980s video games, Kanye Zone reached the front page of Reddit and received considerable media attentionâ€”Frederickson was interviewed by MTV, and several other news outlets reported on the game, some praising its simplicity and addictiveness. In May 2013, a follow-up game, titled Pitbull Party and based on the rapper Pitbull, was released.
