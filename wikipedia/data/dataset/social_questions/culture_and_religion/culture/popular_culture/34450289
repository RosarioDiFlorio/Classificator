Censor bars (often known as black bars or censor boxes) are a basic form of text, photography, and video censorship in which "sensitive" information or images are occluded by black, gray, or even white rectangular boxes. These bars have been used to censor various parts of images. Since the creation of digital editing software which can apply less obtrusive effects such as pixelization and blurring, censor bars are usually only used for satire.
