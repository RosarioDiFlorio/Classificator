Battle Dome was a syndicated American television series that aired from September 1999 to April 2001. It combined elements of American Gladiators â€“ inspired athletic competition with scripted antics more reminiscent of professional wrestling. Recurring character-athletes known as "Warriors" competed against weekly contestants in a variety of physically demanding (and sometimes dangerous) events. The series was filmed at the Los Angeles Sports Arena and produced by Columbia TriStar Television.
The entire first and second season of Battle Dome is available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon Video.
