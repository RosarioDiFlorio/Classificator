Cats That Look Like Hitler is a satirical website featuring photographs of cats resembling Adolf Hitler. Most of the cats have a large black splotch underneath their nose, much like the dictator's toothbrush moustache, and an expression like a human looking stern. Some have diagonal black coloration on their head, like Hitler's hairstyle. The site was founded by Koos Plegt and Paul Neve in 2006 and became widely known after being featured on several television programmes across Europe and Australia. The site is now run only by Neve; as of February 2013 he had approved photographs of over 8,000 cats.
