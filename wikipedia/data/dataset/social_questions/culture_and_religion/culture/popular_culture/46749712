The Retro Chameleon (originally called the Retro VGS then Coleco Chameleon prior to the loss of the Coleco Holdings (owner of the Coleco brand name) licenseis a cancelled video game console. Its creators have stated that it was inspired by the Second to Fifth Generations (1976-1999) of home video game consoles, and like most consoles of those generations, the Retro VGS had planned to run all of its games on individual cartridges, as opposed to optical discs and digital download. The Retro VGS was not expected to support any manner of online connectivity whatsoever, meaning all hardware and software released would have been the final product, and would not have the ability to update after release. A Kickstarter campaign was initially planned to raise funds for the project, but this was later moved to Indiegogo one week before the start of the campaign when a physical prototype was not produced.
On March 8, 2016, Retro VGS pulled down their online social media presence after Coleco Holdings had withdrawn their support and involvement from the project.
