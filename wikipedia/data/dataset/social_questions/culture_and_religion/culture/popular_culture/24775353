w00tstock is a touring variety show billed as "3 Hours of Geeks & Music". It was created in 2009 by Wil Wheaton, Adam Savage and Paul and Storm. The first shows took place in 2009 in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and as of July 2015, a total of 20 shows had been presented.
The name is a play on words combining Woodstock, the notable 1969 counterculture music festival, and w00t, a piece of internet slang that expresses excitement.
