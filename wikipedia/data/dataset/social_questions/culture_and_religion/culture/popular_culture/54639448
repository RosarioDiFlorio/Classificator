Crabcore is an internet meme that originated in 2009, mocking metalcore guitarists who squat low with their legs spread in a "crab-like" stance while performing. It has been referenced on South Park and mimicked by a variety of musical groups leading many magazines and agencies, such as Rolling Stone, Houston Press, and NPR to classify it as a jocular musical style or microgenre.
