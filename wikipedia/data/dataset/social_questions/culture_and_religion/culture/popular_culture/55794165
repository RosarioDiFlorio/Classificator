This is a list of Laos's representatives and their placements at the Big Four international beauty pageants, considered the most important in the world. The country has yet to appear in one of the four pageants:
The criteria for the Big Four inclusion are based on specific standards such as the pageant's global prominence and prestige approved by worldwide media; the quality and quantity of crowned delegates recognized by international franchisees and pageant aficionados; the winner's post pageant activities; the pageant's longevity, consistency, and history; the sincerity of the pageant's specific cause, platform, and advocacy; the overall pre-pageant activities, production quality and global telecast; the enormity of internet traffic; and the extent of popularity amongst pageant fans across the globe.
