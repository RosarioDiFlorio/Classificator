CodeLaunch is an annual competition between individuals and groups who have software technology startup ideas. The competition is produced by Frisco, TX based custom software consulting company Code Authority with help from some entrepreneurial sponsors around North Texas. The concept was founded by Code Authority in 2010 and has benefited at least 7 startup companies. Ideas for mobile applications are common but the competition is also open to cloud based SAAS line of business applications and any idea which would require a software development project to “launch”. The competition targets “embryonic” stage and “very early” stage startups. Well-established brands with already existing products in the marketplace are welcome, but are not the primary focus. The purpose of the competition is to create a medium through which the best people and ideas can connect with investors and conversely investors can find projects which they wish to support. Competitors are not required to give up any equity and not obligated to partner in any way. It does not cost anything to participate in the competition.
