"Manolo Cabeza Huevo" (Spanish for "Manolo the Egg head", although interpreted as "Manolo the Testicle head") is a series of famous Spanish abusive prank calls made by the New York radio show El Vacilón de la Mañana (Spanish for The Morning Party).
The original set consisted in three prank calls; in these, the presenter of the show (which itself is known for making prank calls of this nature), called a person named Manuel (original for Manolo), a superintendent of a New York City building. After calling Manuel, "Manolo Cabeza de Huevo", Manolo would react angrily and insult the caller. The harassment calls were presented in the show and uploaded to the Internet.
The popularity of the prank calls was so high that El Vacilón eventually did more set of prank calls, which were again presented and uploaded. The prank calls sets were topics of discussion in many Internet blogs and forums; some users even elaborated Adobe Flash animations to depict Manolo's reaction to the calls. The sets have since become an Internet phenomenon, and have received a small cult following. The calls themselves also appeared on the discs that El Vacilón made (Vacilon 69, Tortilla Party, Luis y Moon's Chant for Neta, and SinÑEMA TóGRAFICO).
