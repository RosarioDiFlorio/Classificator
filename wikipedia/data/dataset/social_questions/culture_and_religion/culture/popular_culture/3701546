Hotel Mario is a puzzle video game developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the Philips CD-i in 1994. The primary character of the game is Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. Defeating a Koopaling on the hotel's final stage takes the player to the following building.
After Nintendo decided not to have Sony create an add-on for the Super Famicom/Super NES, they gave Philips permission to use their characters in games for Philips' CD-i.
The games resulting from the license were widely criticized, with Hotel Mario being regarded as one of the worst Mario games and one of the worst video games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the unresponsive controls and especially for the cutscenes that used full motion video.
