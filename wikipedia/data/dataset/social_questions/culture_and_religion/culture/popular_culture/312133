Beanie Babies are a line of stuffed animals (a.k.a. plush toys) created by Ty Warner, the man who founded Ty Inc. (named in November 1991). The toys are unique because each toy is stuffed with plastic pellets ("beans") rather than conventional soft stuffing (PVC and PE), giving Beanie Babies a more flexible feel. In a rare interview, the publicity-averse Warner said, "The whole idea was it looked real because it moved."
During the later half of the 1990s, the toy emerged as a major fad, and were collected not only as toys but also as a financial investment due to the high resale value of some Beanie Babies.
