Domenica Cinque was an Italian entertainment television news program broadcast every Sunday on Canale 5 and rerun on Mediaset Plus and Mediaset Extra. It was produced in collaboration with Videonews. In 2012 it was cancelled due to low audience, and afterward replaced by Domenica Live with Barbara D'Urso as host.
