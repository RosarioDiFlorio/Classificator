The National Academic Games Project is the oldest continuously running program involving the Academic Games competitions in the United States. The earliest tournaments took place in the late 1960s on the campus of Nova High School in Davie, Florida. Nova was the beta test site for "Propaganda", and other games. Today, participating schools include Hancock County, West Virginia's Weir and Oak Glen middle and high schools; South Park, Pennsylvania schools; Suncrest Middle School and Morgantown High School, West Virginia schools; and many Michigan teams.
