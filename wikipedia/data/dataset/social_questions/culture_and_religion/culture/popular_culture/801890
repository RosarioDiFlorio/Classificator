The Kennedy curse is a term for the series of misfortunes involving members of the Kennedy family of the United States of America. While Ted Kennedy publicly wondered whether a "curse actually did hang over all the Kennedys" during his own testimony about the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969, skeptics have argued that many of the events are normal, and it is not improbable that a large extended family would experience them.
