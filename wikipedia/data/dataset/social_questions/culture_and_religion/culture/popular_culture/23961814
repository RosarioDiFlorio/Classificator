"Accidents Will Happen" is a two-part episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation that aired in the middle of season 3. The first part aired originally on 26 January 2004, and the second part originally aired on 9 February 2004. Due to the content discussed in this episode, it was shelved from United States broadcast for several years. It was aired in the US for the first time after, the television station, The N, decided to air it during what was called "Cast Picks". Cassie Steele, who plays Manny Santos, the main character of this episode, chose this as her "pick". It was not shown again until a later date, when The N decided to air an "every episode ever" marathon, before the premiere of the 6th season.
