Danbo (ダンボー, Danbō, "cardboard") is a fictional cardboard box robot character from Kiyohiko Azuma's manga series Yotsuba&!. In the ADV Manga English translation of the manga the name Cardbo was used, but the name was restored to Danbo in the later released Yen Press English translation.  In reality, Danbo is merely a person inside of a costume made of cardboard. Danbo was later picked up as an Internet meme, and inspired various electronic gadgets.
