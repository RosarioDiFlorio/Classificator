Giga Pudding is a dessert creation kit manufactured by the Japanese toy company Takara Tomy first released in 2007. The product itself comes with all the ingredients required, and a large bucket to prepare in and create a twenty serving cr√®me caramel intended to be shared. A commercial for Giga Pudding made in 2008 has since garnered much attention on YouTube, with the commercial itself reaching over 7 million views as of July 2017 and other related videos reaching the 1 million mark. There was a ten-hour challenge made from parts of the commercial. There is also a song on YouTube that kids enjoy.
Giga Pudding does not go in a bowl. Giga Pudding is usually served on plates being shaped as a pyramid without a tip and edges; but also cylinder that doesn't stay straight.
