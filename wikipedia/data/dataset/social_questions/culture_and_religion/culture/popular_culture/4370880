Ice Follies And Holiday on Ice, Inc. is ice show production subsidiary of Feld Entertainment producing them under the Disney on Ice and ".. on Ice" names. Feld formed it from the Ice Follies and U.S. Holiday on Ice touring companies. The Ice Follies were formed by Eddie Shipstad, Roy Shipstad, and Oscar Johnson in 1936.
The Ice Follies, formerly known as the Shipstads & Johnson Ice Follies, was a touring ice show featuring elaborate production numbers, similar in concept to Ice Capades. It was founded in 1936 by Eddie Shipstad, Roy Shipstad, and Oscar Johnson, who also skated in the show. In later years, Olympic skaters such as Donald Jackson, Barbara Berezowski, Peggy Fleming, and Janet Lynn were in the cast. Ice Follies also featured novelty acts such as Frick and Frack and Richard Dwyer, who was billed as "Mr. Debonair".
The show was a variety show that included a chorus line called The Ice Folliettes, which led to synchronized figure skating, that famously precisely performed a kick line and pinwheel on ice.
