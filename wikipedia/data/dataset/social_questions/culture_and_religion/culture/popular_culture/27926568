Methaqualone is a sedative-hypnotic drug similar in effect to barbiturates, a general CNS depressant. Its use peaked in the 1960s and 1970s as a hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug, commonly known as Quaaludes ( KWAY-lewdz), particularly in the 1970s in North America, or as Mandrax (methaqualone 250 mg combined with diphenhydramine 25 mg).
