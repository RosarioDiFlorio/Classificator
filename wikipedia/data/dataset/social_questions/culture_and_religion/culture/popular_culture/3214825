The Buckwheat Boyz was an American musical group founded by Marcus Bowens and Jermaine Fuller, with the later addition of J.J. O'Neal and Dougy Williams. The Buckwheat Boyz were signed by Koch Records, and recorded their first and only full-length record. From this self-titled album, the song "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" became popular on the Internet after a flash music video featuring an animated dancing banana was created. The popularity of the song increased as it was featured on television shows such as The Proud Family, Family Guy, and Regular Show.
