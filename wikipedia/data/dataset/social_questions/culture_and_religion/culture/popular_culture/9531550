Pig shows are an event where pigs are evaluated for their quality. They are evaluated on a multitude of things which include composition (muscle vs. fat), capaciousness, and skeletal integrity along with general appearance and conformation to their respective breed. Other names for a pig show include swine show and hog show. A pig show is frequently part of a larger agricultural show.
