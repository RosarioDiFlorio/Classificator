Nabilla Leona Benattia, well known as Nabilla, (born February 5, 1992), is a Franco-Swiss model and personality on reality tv. She has appeared in L'Amour est aveugle (2009), Hollywood Girls (2012–2014), Les Anges de la télé-réalité (2012–2013) and her own TV show Allo Nabilla (2013–2014).
She became known in France for her one-liner "non, mais allô quoi" on les Anges de la télé-réalité. The line was subsequently used in ads from brands such as IKEA and Carrefour. It gave rise to a number of parody videos viewed millions of times on YouTube, including a Downfall parody. She registered the phrase as a trademark at the Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle.
