Partido da Imprensa Golpista (PiG, English: Pro-coup Press Party) is a term used by left-wing Brazilian websurfers since 2007 to characterize an alleged attitude of the Brazilian mass media towards President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva during the 2006 presidential election. The term was popularized by journalist Paulo Henrique Amorim in his blog. Whenever he uses the term, Amorim writes it with an "i" in lowercase as a pun with the name of the web portal "iG".  where he was a journalist before he was dismissed on March 18, 2008, which he describes as a process of "ideological cleansing".
The term is also used by journalists Luiz Carlos Azenha and Rodrigo Vianna on their blogs, which also helped to spread its popularity.
The term gained notoriety when it was first used in the Brazilian Congress in a speech by Pernambuco Congressman Fernando Ferro, a member of the Workers' Party. He said that film director and Rede Globo commentator Arnaldo Jabor should run for "President of the PIG".
