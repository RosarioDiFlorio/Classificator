The Digg Patriots were an online US conservative activist group which shared news stories and opinion articles on the then popular social media website, Digg. The group started as an invitation-only Yahoo! Groups email list after Digg removed inter-member Instant Messaging. Using a subscription mailing list service to replace Digg "shouts," members of the group shared links, and requested each other to vote up ("digg") or vote down ("bury") other members' submissions. This generated controversy after the mailing list was made public, with allegations that the group was "gaming the system".
