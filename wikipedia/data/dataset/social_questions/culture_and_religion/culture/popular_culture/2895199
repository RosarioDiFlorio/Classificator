Much of film as an art form grew out of several earlier traditions in the fields of (oral) storytelling and literature (relating to the screenplay), theatre (relating to the theatre director/film director, a cast of actors, a production team that can include a scenic or set designer, lighting designer, costume designer) and visual art. Especially after the silent film era sound design and music (relating to the soundtrack and film score) became important factors.
The technology of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics, with sound recording and reproduction becoming important after the silent film era.
Precursors of film are often referred to as pre-cinema, or 'precinema'. This term is disliked by several historians, partly because it seems to devalue the individual qualities of these media by presenting them as a small step in the development of a later invention. For instance: the flip book, zoetrope and phenakistiscope are very tactile devices that allow study and play by manipulating the motion by hand, while the projected image in cinema is untangible. The study of precursors of film is also part of a wider and less teleological approach called media archaeology.
Many of the precursors of film are also referred to as "philosophical toys", or "optical toys".
