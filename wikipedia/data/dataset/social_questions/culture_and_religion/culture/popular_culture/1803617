A head shot or headshot is a specific type of portrait where the focus is on person's face. The term is usually applied for photographs that realistically demonstrate a person's appearance for branding or casting. This includes promotional pictures of actors, models, and authors, but other uses are also common, such as identification and corporate portraits.
