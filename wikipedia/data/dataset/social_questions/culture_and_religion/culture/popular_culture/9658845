Kay's Cross was a large stone cross (roughly 20 feet (6.1 m) high by 13 feet (4.0 m) wide) located at the base of a hollow in northeastern Kaysville, Utah, United States. Its origins are disputed, and several urban legends are tied to the site. The cross was demolished with explosives by unknown persons in 1992.
