Loituma Girl (also known as "Leekspin") is a Flash animation set to a scat singing section of the traditional Finnish folk song "Ievan Polkka," sung by the Finnish quartet Loituma on their 1995 debut album Things of Beauty. It appeared on the Internet in late April 2006 and quickly became popular. The animation consists of six frames showing the Bleach anime character Orihime Inoue twirling a leek, set to a 27-second loop from the song.
