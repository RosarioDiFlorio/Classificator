Just Journalism was a UK-based research organisation and pressure group, which commented on Israel and the Middle East. Its stated goals were to focus "on how Israel and Middle East issues are reported in the UK media." The organisation published online analyses in response to news stories, reported on "long-term trends", and opinion pieces for external publications.
It was established in the spring of 2008 with Michael Weiss as executive director. Just Journalism was closely associated with the Henry Jackson Society (HJS), sharing an office with it.
When Just Journalism was closed, in September 2011, citing "lack of funds" as the reason, Robin Shepherd, international affairs director of the Henry Jackson Society and a member of Just Journalism's advisory board, said: "This is a great pity and the cause of Israel in Britain will be the poorer for it."
