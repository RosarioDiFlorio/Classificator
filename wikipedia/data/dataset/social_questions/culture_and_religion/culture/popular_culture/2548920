Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 4 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of Australia's Funniest Home Video Show, depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air part-way through the broadcast of its first and only episode at the demand of the network's owner, Kerry Packer.
