The term "Elvis sightings" refers to the conspiracy theory that Elvis Presley did not die in 1977, but went into hiding for various reasons and is still alive. This notion was popularized by the books of Gail Brewer-Giorgio and other authors. Several people even claim to have seen Elvis after he was supposed to have died. One rash of alleged sightings took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the late 1980s. Such reports encountered much public ridicule and became fodder for humorous publications like the Weekly World News.
Elvis was rumored to have appeared in the background of an airport scene in the 1990 film Home Alone. In an interview with USA Today, director Chris Columbus responded "If Elvis was on the set, I would have known". In June 2016, a video of an elderly man in Graceland was alleged to be Elvis.
Bill Bixby, who co-starred with Elvis in Clambake and Speedway, hosted two television specials investigating the subject: The Elvis Files (1991), and The Elvis Conspiracy (1992).
A 1990 Accolade computer game Les Manley in the Search for the King was based on Elvis sightings, where the titular hero attempts to find Elvis in order to win a million dollar contest. The hero finally does so after suffering a near death experience and seeing Elvis in Heaven leading a choir composed of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and other deceased musicians.
