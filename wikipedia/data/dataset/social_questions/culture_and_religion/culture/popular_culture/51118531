Gutmensch (German cultural term similar to "do-gooder"; literally good human) is an ironic, sarcastic disparaging term for a person or a group. Those who use the term believe that Gutmenschen have an overwhelming wish to be good and overeagerly seek approval. This comes along with moralising and proselytising behaviour and a dogmatic, absolute perspective, which does not allow deviant views. In political rhetoric Gutmensch is used as a polemic term. See also Stereotype or Personality.
