From a song: This is a redirect from a song title to a more general, relevant article such as an album, film or artist. Linking to the specific album or film in which the song appears is preferable and linking to the artist should be done only when the album or film does not have a page on Wikipedia.
There is consensus that the majority of songs do not meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Songs should only have an individual article when there is enough material to warrant a detailed article.
