Stars on Ice is a touring figure skating show produced by IMG. It was founded in 1986 as a vehicle for IMG client Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist in men's figure skating. The production is a theatrical show featuring a small cast of elite skaters who perform together in ensemble as well as solo numbers. Hamilton retired from regular touring in 2001.
Stars on Ice was originally conceived as an ice show for adults, without the skating Smurfs or cartoon characters typical of other commercial ice shows of the period such as Ice Capades or Disney on Ice. It started on a shoestring budget, playing only a few dates in small-town arenas. The first national tour was conducted in 1987-88. In 1992, IMG bought out the rival “Skating” tour from Bill Graham Presents and merged its resources with those of Stars on Ice. Among the acquisitions from the “Skating” tour was Sandra Bezic, who took over as Director and Choreographer of Stars on Ice for over a decade. In recent years until 2016, Jef Billings had served as Director. Throughout its history, Stars on Ice has won 3 Emmy Awards and the 1994 ACE Cable Award for Best Sports Special.
Stars on Ice tours the United States, Canada, and Japan on an annual basis, and has also staged shows in Europe, Brazil, and Korea. The Tour has played over 1,500 shows in its 30 seasons.
