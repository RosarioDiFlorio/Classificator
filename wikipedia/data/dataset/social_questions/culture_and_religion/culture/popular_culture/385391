Captain Falcon (キャプテン・ファルコン, Kyaputen Farukon), also known as Falcon or C. Falcon, is a fictional character in the racing video game series F-Zero. He first appeared in the series' first installment, and is the de facto mascot of the F-Zero series. Within the series, he is a mysterious racer who is among the best on the circuit, as well as a renowned bounty hunter. Falcon also represents the F-Zero series in each entry of the Super Smash Bros. series.
In the GP Legend continuity, writers portrayed Falcon differently from previous games; here, "Captain Falcon" is a title passed down and held by the best racer in the world. The incumbent Captain Falcon throughout the series is known by the alias Bart Lemmings and owns and operates a small bar in Mute City. While under his Captain Falcon disguise, Lemming aids fellow protagonist Rick Wheeler.
