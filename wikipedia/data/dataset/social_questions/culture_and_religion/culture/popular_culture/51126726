Ibotta is a Denver, Colorado based mobile technology company that enables users with its smartphone app to earn cash back on in-store and mobile purchases with receipt and/or purchase verification.
It was founded by current CEO Bryan Leach, for which he was named by Ernst & Young as a regional Entrepreneur of the Year for 2015. Jim Clark is an investor and board member. As of 2016, Ibotta has received over $73 million in funding.
The company partners with brands and retailers to offer rebates and discounts on consumer packaged goods, retail purchases, and restaurant dining through a mobile app, similar to traditional coupons or rebates. Ibotta also has cash back and rebates on alcohol (wine, beer and spirits) that can be purchased at bars, restaurants, liquor, and grocery stores. Ibotta users must be of legal drinking age, even if the consumer has no intention of purchasing beer or wine, or if they patronize a business that does not sell such items.
The app is available on both iOS and Android devices and is available only in the United States as of October 2016. Ibotta claims to work at over 500,000 locations within the United States.
