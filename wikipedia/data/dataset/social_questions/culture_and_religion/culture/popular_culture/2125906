The official title of "state electrician" was given to some American state executioners in states using the electric chair during the early twentieth century.
The first state electrician was Edwin Davis in the state of New York. He carried out the execution of William Kemmler, the first man executed with the electric chair. Davis also conducted the electrocution of the first woman on the electric chair - that of Martha M. Place.
