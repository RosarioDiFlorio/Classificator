Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack (born Frankfurt-am-Main 11 July 1893, died Allambie Heights, in Sydney 7 January 1965) was a German/Australian artist.
His formative education was 1912–1914 at Debschitz art school in Munich. He studied at the Bauhaus from 1919 - 1924 and remained working there until 1926 where, along with Kurt Schwerdtfeger, he further developed the Farblichtspiele ('coloured-light-plays'), which used a projection device to produced moving colours on a transparent screen accompanied by music composed by Hirschfeld Mack. It is now regarded as an early form of multimedia. He was a participant, along with the former Bauhaus master Gertrud Grunow, in "den II. Kongreß für Farbe-Ton-Forschung (Hamburg 1. - 5. Oktober 1930)" (Second Congress for Colour-Sound Research, Hamburg). Music and colour theory remained lifelong interests, informing his art work in a number of media, and it was the inspiration for his well-respected and influential teaching.
