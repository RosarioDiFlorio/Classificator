The notinism is an artistic movement created in the early 90's by Holeg Spies, Thierry Saint-Paul and Alexandra Mercier. These three artists created and developed the notinism art movement throughout the installation, "Notinism.org" which toured the world as far afield as India and Japan, showing at venues such as the National Museum of Modern Art of France (Pompidou Centre), the Canon Urban Lenz Exhibition in Tokyo and contemporary art exhibitions in Europe and New York. The "notinism" has been considered as a new form of surrealism merging a musical field of vision and video paintings with a mysterious crypted website www.notinism.org .
The notinism to be read NOT IN ISM calls for uses of art and technologies as a form of political resistance.
