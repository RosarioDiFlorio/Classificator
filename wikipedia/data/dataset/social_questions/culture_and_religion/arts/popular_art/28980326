This is a list of 20th-century Russian painters of the Russian Federation, Soviet Union, and Russian Empire, both ethnic Russians and people of other ethnicities. This list also includes painters who were born in Russia but later emigrated, and those born elsewhere but immigrated to the country and/or worked there for a long time. Artists are arranged in chronological order within the alphabetical tables. The basis for inclusion in this List can serve as the recognition of the artistic community, confirmed by authoritative sources, as well as the presence of article about the artist in Wikipedia.
