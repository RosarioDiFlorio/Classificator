The Czech painter and graphic designer Jan Kubíček (December 30, 1927 – October 14, 2013) was one of the most radical Central European exponents of constructivist and concrete art. He also spent more than a decade illustrating children's books for Czechoslovakia's main publishing house Albatros and designed iconic film posters and book covers throughout the 1960s. Moreover, having passed through a significant Lettrism phase during the early 1960s, he left behind an impressive body of photographs, illustrations and graphic art for which he received the 1999 Vladimír Boudník Award.
