Captain Goodvibes, a.k.a. the Pig of Steel, is the creation of Australian cartoonist Tony Edwards and an icon of Australian surfing culture from the 1970s. In 1992 Captain Goodvibes was named by Australia's Surfing Life magazine as one of "Australia's 50 Most Influential Surfers." The character was inspired by American cartoonist Gilbert Shelton's underground comix character, Wonder Wart-Hog, a.k.a. the "Hog of Steel."
