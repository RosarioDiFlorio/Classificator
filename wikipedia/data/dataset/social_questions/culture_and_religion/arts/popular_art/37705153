William Edward Barnsley (7 February 1900 â€“  2 December 1987) was a designer and maker of furniture, teacher and important figure in the 20th Century British craft movement. He was the son of Sidney Barnsley who trained as an architect with Norman Shaw, and the nephew of Ernest Barnsley. These two family members were leading figure heads of the Arts and Crafts movement along with their friend, Ernest Gimson.
Barnsley's most celebrated work is possibly the archbishop's throne and lectern in Canterbury Cathedral.
