The Cut is a BBC television teen drama, first broadcast in September 2009. The series was developed by Geoffrey Goodwin and Holby City writer, Al Smith in collaboration with KateModern producer Pete Gibbons and Hollyoaks director, Sarah Walker. The Cut is broadcast in 25-minute episodes on BBC Two, with each episode being broadcast in daily five-minute chunks on the website throughout the week before. The BBC describe it as reflecting the way many young people want to consume content which a critic has more cynically interpreted as for those with even the shortest of attention spans.
The first series ran on TV and online from September to December 2009. The second series was broadcast from April through to August 2010, and the third series started only two months later, and ran from October to December 2010. In March 2011, it was officially announced that The Cut had been axed and would not return for a fourth series. However, a team of fans have set up a scriptwriting team on Facebook, under the name Writers of The Cut: Series 4 and Beyond, which works on continuing the series and publicising the scripts.
