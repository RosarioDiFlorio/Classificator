Modern Two, formerly the Dean Gallery, in Edinburgh, is one of Scotlandâ€™s national art galleries. It is part of the National Galleries of Scotland.
Since its opening it has housed the Paolozzi Gift, a collection of his works given to the National Gallery of Modern Art in 1994 by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi. It contains a large collection of Dada and Surrealist art and literature, much of which was given by Gabrielle Keiller. It is also used for temporary exhibitions.
The Dean Gallery is twinned with the National Gallery of Modern Art which lies on the opposite side of Belford Road.
