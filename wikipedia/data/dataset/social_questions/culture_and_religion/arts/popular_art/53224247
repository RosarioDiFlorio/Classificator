The banner of Misericordia (Mercy) is a work of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí projected for the procession to the Sanctuary of Misericordia in Reus of the reusians residing in Barcelona, as one of the acts for the Holy Year. It is known by the two front and back photographs published in the Semanario Católico de Reus (Reus Catholic Weekly magazine) in July of that year. It included another photograph of the procession in which Gaudí is seen as part of a large group of pilgrims and the banner being carried by one of them. Another previous issue of the same publication contains a description with references to the materials that it was built. The banner remained in the sanctuary and unfortunately, in July 1936, it was destroyed in the events of the Spanish Civil War. Between 2003 and 2007 was carried out the project and construction of a replica based on the detailed study of the photographs, using the same materials and techniques than the original. It is currently being exhibited in the crypt of the Sagrada Familia Temple in Barcelona. Remains pending the Virgin image and some metallic elements.
