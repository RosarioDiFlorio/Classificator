Silver Studio was one of the most influential textile design studios in the UK from its formation in 1880 until the middle of the twentieth century.
The studio, founded by Arthur Silver, designed some of the most famous fabric, wallpaper, carpet and metalwork designs for companies such as Liberty's, Turnbull and Stockdale, Sanderson and Warner and Sons Ltd, all of which used the Silver Studio's designs for their own ranges of wallpapers and textile.
At its most productive, the studio created more than 800 designs per year. The studio was renowned for its distinctive Art Nouveau style, although over the years they produced a wide variety of different designs and styles, including many of the famous "Liberty"-styles. During the Second World War, the Studio undertook many designs for U.S. clients as a useful way to gain foreign exchange.
