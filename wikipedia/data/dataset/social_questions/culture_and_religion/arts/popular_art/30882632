Archive is a publishing and research platform based in Berlin.
It consists of a publishing house, an exhibition space and a magazine. Its activities are focused on the publishing field and experimentation with editorial formats and concepts. Archive investigates art practices in the context of a larger cultural and social sphere. Its concern is to explore distribution possibilities and to provide a critical discussion about the functions of an exhibition. Archive translates, organizes, and circulates critically invested materials. It was founded in 2009 by Chiara Figone.
