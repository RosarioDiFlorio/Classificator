Vivid (stylised as VIVID) was a centre for the production and exhibition of media art, located in the Digbeth area of Birmingham, England.
Vivid commissioned and exhibited work both for its own exhibition space and for other locations, provided spaces and resources for the production of interdisciplinary art and hosted a programme of residencies for visiting artists, commissioned major new works and large scale touring exhibitions from artists and exhibited artists' work.
After failing to win Arts Council funding Vivid closed in 2012. Vivid Projects was started soon after by the Vivid curatorial team and is based at Minerva Works in Digbeth.
