The Ukrainian National Revival (Ukrainian: Українське національне відродження) took place during a historical period of time when the territory of modern Ukraine was divided between the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire after the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century. The period took place soon after the Haidamaka Uprisings (also known as Koliivshchyna) rocked lands of former Cossack Hetmanate.
It was a period when the Ukrainian national resistance was almost entirely subjugated and went completely underground. All the state institutions of the Cossack Hetmanate were completely liquidated along with the Cossack movement. The European territory of the Russian Empire had successfully crossed the Dnieper and extended towards the Central Europe as well as reaching the shores of Black Sea.
Nonetheless, the period also is considered to be the beginning of the modern Ukrainian literature among which first were works of Ivan Kotliarevsky. Number of Ukrainian historians such as Volodymyr Doroshenko and Mykhailo Hrushevsky divided that period in three stages. The first stage stretches from the end of the 18th century to 1840s. The second stage covers period of 1840s-1850s. The third period is the second half of the 19th century.
