Synthetic Impressionism is style of painting that combines the carefully observed color and expressive paint handling of impressionist painters with the abstraction of space and multiple exaggerated viewpoints of cubist painters. The forerunners of this style include Van Gogh, CÃ©zanne, and Chaim Soutine.
Contemporary proponents of this style include the American artists James Michalopoulos and Charles Tersolo.
