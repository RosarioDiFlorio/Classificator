Fiesta, often called Fiestaware, is a line of ceramic glazed dinnerware manufactured and marketed by the Homer Laughlin China Company of Newell, West Virginia since its introduction in 1936, with a hiatus from 1973 to 1985. Fiesta is noted for its Art Deco styling featuring concentric circles—and its range of solid, bright colors.
Both Fiesta's original shapes and its glazes were designed by Frederick Hurten Rhead, Homer Laughlin's art director. Several of the original shapes were redesigned (and other new shapes added) by Jonathan O. Parry, who became Homer Laughlin's art director in 1984. When the Fiesta line was re-introduced in 1986, it featured a more durable, vitreous composition.
Fiesta is sold from "open" stock, where customers select by the piece, rather than by the set—and can mix and match pieces from the entire color range.
According to the Smithsonian Institution Press, Fiesta's appeal lies in its bright colors, modern design, and affordability. In 2002, The New York Times called Fiesta "the most collected brand of china in the United States".
