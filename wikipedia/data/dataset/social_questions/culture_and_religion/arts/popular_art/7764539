A bail handle, or simply bail, is a handle that consists of an open wire loop that moves freely within two fixed mounts or ears. It may be used for carrying an item, such as a bucket or kettle, or as a drawer pull.
A flip-top closure on a bottle or jar is sometimes called a bail closure.
Decorative bail handles appeared on pieces of French Rococo furniture during the early 18th century. These handles on drawers were rounded and hinged onto an escutcheon plate and hung down in the shape of a half moon or arch. Due to being hinged, they were able to move up and down and they were usually elaborately decorated.
