Lucia Moholy, born Lucia Schulz, (18 January 1894, Prague, Austria-Hungary — 17 May 1989, Zürich, Switzerland) was a photographer. Her photography documented the architecture and products of the Bauhaus and introduced their work to a post-World War II audience. However, Moholy was seldom credited for her work, which was often attributed to László Moholy-Nagy or Walter Gropius.
