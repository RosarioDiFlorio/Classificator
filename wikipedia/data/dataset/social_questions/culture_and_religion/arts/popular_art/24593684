Unrealised Projects is an artist run web-based project established in London by Sam Ely and Lynn Harris in 2003. Unrealised Projects investigates the potential of unrecognised, unfinished or unfulfilled ideas. The project is ongoing.
Lisa Le Feuvre writing on Art Failure states:
“Other, more recent, catalogues of unrealised projects are Hans Ulrich Obrist’s Unbuilt Roads or the online archive Unrealised Projects devised by artist Sam Ely and Lynn Harris. These collections show proposals that have been deemed failures before they have been realised, yet nonetheless they are released into the space of critical engagement.” 
Unrealised Projects have participated in Publish And Be Damned an annual independent publishing fair in both 2009 and 2006, in June 2009 Volume 4 publication (a partial introduction to a process in progress) was launched at the Liverpool Artists Book Fair at A Foundation.
