Ball-Nogues Studio is a design and fabrication practice based in Los Angeles, California. Led by Benjamin Ball and Gaston Nogues, the studio’s work falls between the categories of art, architecture and industrial design. The practice is known for creating site-specific architectural installations out of unorthodox materials such as stainless steel ball-chain and spheres, paper pulp, garments, and coffee tables. The studio focuses on the process of creation, with an emphasis on the research and exploration of materials and fabrication methods. Much of the studio’s work involves expanding the potential of materials  and manufacturing techniques.
