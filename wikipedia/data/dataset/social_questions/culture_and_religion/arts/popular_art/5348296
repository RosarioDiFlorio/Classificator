The pluginmanifesto is a document written by Ana Kronschnabl that looks at the challenges for filmmaking for the internet and other reduced bandwidth platforms (such as mobile phones, PDAs and PlayStation Portables). The author noted, "The pluginmanifesto arose out of a need...In discussion with others we realised that most people assumed that we [those who make web films] were approaching this new technology from the same angle that many others were â€“ that of trying to deliver film or television over the Internet. This was not what we were trying to do. We felt that the Internet was not just a new viewing platform, but a new medium, as different as TV is from film and film is from theatre."
The document is written in the tradition of other creative manifestos, such as the Dogme95 manifesto. The pluginmanifesto was launched Watershed Media Centre in Bristol on 17 May 2001. The author never intended the manifesto to remain a static document, but looked for wider input and evolution of the ideas within, "The text of the pluginmanifesto can be freely copied and modified. Indeed we encourage you, along with other filmmakers, artists, geeks and web-users, to take the contents of this document and evolve it in-line with your experiences, ideas and perspectives" The manifesto was published as copyleft under the Design Science License and the author encouraged others to revise or re-write the document as they wished.
