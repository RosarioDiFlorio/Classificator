Feminist art is a category of art associated with late 1960s and 1970s feminism, as well as the movement in general. The art form has criticized traditional gender expectations and the art historical canon, using art to create a dialogue between the viewer and the artwork through a feminist lens. Rather than creating artwork for the visual pleasure of the viewer, feminist art aims to make the viewer question the social and political norms of society in the hopes that it will inspire change, helping further feminist goals of ending sexism and oppression. Media used range from traditional art forms such as painting to more unorthodox methods such as performance art, conceptual art, body art, craftivism, video, film, and fiber art. Feminist art has served as an innovative driving force towards expanding the definition of art through the incorporation of new media and a new perspective.
