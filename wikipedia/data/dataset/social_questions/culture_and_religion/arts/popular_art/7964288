Rip Off Comix was a long-running underground comix anthology published between 1977 and 1991 by Rip Off Press. For much of its run, the series served as a vehicle for Gilbert Shelton's work, particularly Wonder Wart-Hog. For a period the title billed itself "the International Journal of Humor and Cartoon Art" and showcased the work of European cartoonists from a variety of countries. As time passed, the sensibility of the anthology changed from underground to alternative comics. For many years, the series was edited by Rip Off Press co-publisher Kathe Todd.
