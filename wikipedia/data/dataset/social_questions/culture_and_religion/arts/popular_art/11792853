Jeż Jerzy (George the Hedgehog) is a popular Polish comic book title created by two young artists, Rafał Skarżycki (script) and Tomasz Lew Leśniak (drawings).
The comic strip first appeared as part of a children's magazine called Świerszczyk. Originally, the strips were aimed at children with Jerzy the Hedgehog having adventures in a fairy tale land. In 1996, the strips were published in the magazine Ślizg in an "adult version".
The adult version of the comic strip was a satire on politics and modern Poland. The comic makes fun of groups like the police, ecologists, the subcultures of skinheads or dresiarze, or individuals, such as politicians (Andrzej Lepper and Grzegorz Kołodko). In the adult version, which has often been compared to South Park, the characters often swear, drink alcohol and take drugs. It is often violent and has scenes of nudity. Jerży has become a part of the skateboarding subculture. The adult version is still running and many versions of the comic books were published both in and outside of Poland.
