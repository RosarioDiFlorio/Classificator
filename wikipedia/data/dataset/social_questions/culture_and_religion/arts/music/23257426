PJ Library is a program of the Harold Grinspoon Foundation, a North American Jewish non-profit organization based in West Springfield, Massachusetts. It was created in December 2005 as a Jewish engagement and literacy program for Jewish and interfaith families with young children.
PJ Library is modeled after Dolly Parton's Imagination Library program. PJ Library sends out free Jewish children's books and music to Jewish and interfaith families on a monthly basis by subscription. It is a North America program that is implemented on a local level. The program is largely underwritten by HGF, but depends on local supporting partners.
