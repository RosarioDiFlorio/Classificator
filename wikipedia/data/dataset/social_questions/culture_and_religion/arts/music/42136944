Turning the beat around, abbreviated as TBA in some music textbooks, is a form of temporary tactus or pulse (music) in popular electronic music and electronic dance music. This includes forms of syncopation that issue a challenge to dancers to find the downbeat. In this terminology a "reverse TBA," involves the explicit contradiction of a previously established pulse. The term is to be distinguished from downtempo.
