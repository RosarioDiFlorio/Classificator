Dirty Slippers is a Hungarian pop-rock band from Gyula, Hungary. The band celebrated its 10 Year Anniversary in 2015. The still very young members began to play in concerts as teenagers, and thanks to the luck and hard work they became famous in 2009 with their hit “Élned kell”, which also became the advertising song of the Hungarian campaign against cervical cancer. The music video hits came after, like “Te vagy a Fény”, “Hang vagy Jel”, which song was hummed by the whole country, and “Egy a vége”. In 2012 appeared the LP Közel Hozzád, which was recorded in the USA with George Shilling, the producer of Madonna and Oasis. The LP made it to the Hit List of MAHASZ on the first week. The fan base of the band suddenly increased, because from 2009 until the present day Dirty Slippers is the opening act of Republic, in arenas and festivals too. Three European tours guaranteed the international success of the band. First with The Coronas, which is the favorite band of the Beatles-frontman Paul McCartney, then with the Romanian legend Rezident EX, and last time with the star band The Last Vegas, discovered by Guns N’ Roses. Together they conquered the European clubs with crowded audience. The Hungarian press wrote about this tour many times like this: “Dirty Slippers stands on the doorstep of worldwide success.”
The overwhelming success of live concerts, the hits, and the plenty more fans from every ages helped Dirty Slippers to become one of the most searched bands in Hungary by 2016.
