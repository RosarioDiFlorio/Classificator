MidPoint Music Festival (MPMF) launched in 2001 in Cincinnati, Ohio, as an independent music festival and industry conference. The annual three-day event occurs each September in the city's downtown and historic Over-the-Rhine entertainment district. Founded by Cincinnati musicians Bill Donabedian and Sean Rhiney, the festival was acquired in 2008 by Cincinnati CityBeat, a weekly alternative newspaper.
The festival has expanded since CityBeat acquired it. The estimated attendance in 2008 was 13,500. This doubled to 27,000 people in 2012. This is partly due to the larger bands booked and the large outdoor space available for headliners at the newly renovated Washington Park in Over-the-Rhine.
Though the festival used to take place in various locations throughout the greater Cincinnati region (including one venue in Newport, KY), it is now condensed to downtown and Over-the-Rhine, a burgeoning arts district just north of the downtown Cincinnati business district.
