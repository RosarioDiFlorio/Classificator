The Tsifteteli (Greek: τσιφτετέλι; Turkish: Çiftetelli), is a rhythm and dance of Anatolia and the Balkans with a rhythmic pattern of 2/4. In Turkish the word means "double stringed", taken from the violin playing style that is practiced in this kind of music. There are suggestions that the dance already existed in ancient Greece, known as the Aristophanic dance Cordax. Nowadays it is to be found not only in Greece and Turkey, but also in the whole of the Southeastern Mediterranean region.
