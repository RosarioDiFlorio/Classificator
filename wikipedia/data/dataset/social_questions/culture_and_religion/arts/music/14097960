The Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp is an interactive musical event, that takes place in various locations worldwide involving various Rock Stars on various dates.
Attendees play, write and record music in professional rehearsal and recording studios alongside those from the music industry, culminating in an event where attendees perform live on stage at a well known venue. Participants are formed into bands, each with its own rock star mentor. Over the course of the experience, campers learn band dynamics, song writing, receive instrument training, and hear from industry speakers and participate in Q&A sessions with well known musicians.
The event is targeted at players of any talent level, from novice to advanced. It is geared more toward adults, with the average attendee age being between 35 and 55. Founded in 1997 by David Fishof, approximately 6,000 people have thus far participated. A television reality series, Rock N' Roll Fantasy Camp, produced by Mark Burnett Productions aired on VH1 Classic for two seasons. The "Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp All-Stars" gave a live performance at the 2009 Screen Actors Guild Post Awards Party.
