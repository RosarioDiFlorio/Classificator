Poi E is an album released by New Zealand MƒÅori culture group the Patea Maori Club. In 1984 the totally Maori language title track Poi-E topped the New Zealand Pop charts for four consecutive weeks, and was that year's biggest selling single - outselling all international recording artists.
Dalvanius Prime, the album's producer and leader, was known for merging the styles of traditional Maori show bands and more recent Maori hip-hop.
Later, in the early 1990s, Poi E was produced as a Maori musical with additional songs, and in 2000, selections were performed in Sydney, at the Waitangi Day Concert
