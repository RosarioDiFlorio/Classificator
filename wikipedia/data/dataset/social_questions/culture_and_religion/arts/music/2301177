Dance/Electronic Singles Sales (previously known as Hot Dance Singles Sales and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales) was a chart released weekly by Billboard magazine in the United States, established in 1985. It measured the sale of commercially released singles that deal with dance music and remixes.
The Hot Dance Singles Sales once included non-dance songs and singles without dance remixes if they were released as maxi singles, including singles by such artists as the Industrial metal band Ministry and alternative rock band The Smiths. It was felt that this rule misled the chart's purpose of measuring the sales of dance music, and thus non-dance/non-remix maxi singles have more recently been excluded from this chart. As a result, although many non-dance acts release singles today in the maxi single format, they are not included in this chart unless the single includes dance remixes.
At first when the chart was introduced, it had a 50-song chart position. By 2001, it was reduced to 25 and after the introduction of the Dance Airplay Chart in 2003 was reduced even further to its current 10-song chart position. They were also featured alongside the Dance Club Play Chart in the print edition of Billboard until 2003, when it became online only through Billboard.biz. On January 17, 2013, Billboard added a new chart, Dance/Electronic Songs, which tracks the 50 most popular Dance and Electronic singles and tracks based on club play, single sales, radio airplay, digital downloads, and online streaming as reported on the Dance Club Songs, Dance/Mix Show Airplay, Dance Single Sales, and Dance/Electronic Digital Songs component charts.
Billboard discontinued the chart after 2013, as it was incorporated into the Dance/Electronic Songs chart and due to the decreasing number of vinyl sales.
