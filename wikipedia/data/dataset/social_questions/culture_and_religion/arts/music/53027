A supergroup is a music group whose members are previously successful as solo artists or as part of other groups or well known in other musical professions. Usually used in the context of rock and pop music, the term has been applied to other musical genres such as opera (The Three Tenors).
Supergroups are sometimes formed as side projects and thus not intended to be permanent, while other times can become the primary project of the members' careers. It became popular in late 1960s rock music for members of already successful groups to record albums together, after which they normally split up. Charity supergroups, where prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s.
