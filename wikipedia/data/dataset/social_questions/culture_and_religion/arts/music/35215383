Beatová síň slávy (Czech for Beat Hall of Fame or simply BSS) is a listing of people who have significantly contributed to Czech (or Czechoslovak) rock music. Nominations are made in three categories, musician, dead musician, and band; and each year's selections are voted on by the listeners of the Radio Beat radio station.
