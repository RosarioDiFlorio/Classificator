Protests during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, have had many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. "The Star-Spangled Banner" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, protests also occurred when a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" and "Hail, Columbia".
