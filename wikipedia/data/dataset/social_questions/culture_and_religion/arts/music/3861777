The Biscuit Brothers is a half-hour Emmy-award winning public television program produced in Austin, Texas. It first went on the air in Austin, Texas in 2004 and then premiered nationwide in 2005. The show uses a mixture of live-action, puppetry, and animation to teach music and cultural communication through music to children and their families.
The project was created and is produced by Allen Robertson, Jerome Schoolar, and Damon Brown. The show features include "The Instrument of the Day", "Crazy Classics", and has songs that everyone can sing along with.
The Biscuit Brothers have performed live in hundreds of venues across Texas as well - most notably at the Austin City Limits Music Festival (ACL Fest) in 2004, 2005, and 2006. They are the musical host of the annual Austin Family Music Festival.
