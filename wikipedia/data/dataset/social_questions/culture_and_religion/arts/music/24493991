Music described as piano six hands (or piano trio). is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one or two pianos. Because of the limited range available to each player, many of the pieces written for this combination are elementary in nature; many more are arrangements of pieces for other forces. But there are a small number of original works, and a handful of virtuoso three-player groups have emerged in the 21st century.
