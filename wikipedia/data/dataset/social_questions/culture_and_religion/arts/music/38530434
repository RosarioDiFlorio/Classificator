A concert residency (also known as musical residency or simply residency) is a series of concerts (typically of live music), similar to a concert tour, but only performed at one location. The concert residencies have been a staple of Las Vegas Strip for decades, pioneered by singer-pianist Liberace in the 1940s and Frank Sinatra with the Rat Pack in the 1950s.
According to Billboard, Celine Dion's A New Day... is the most successful concert residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($444.69 million in 2016 dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows. This commercial success was credited for revitalizing Las Vegas residencies, which was always known as a place where singers go to when their careers are in decline.
