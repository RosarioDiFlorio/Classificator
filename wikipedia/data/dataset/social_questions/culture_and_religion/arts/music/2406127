The Halifax Pop Explosion is a music festival that takes place every fall, two weeks after Thanksgiving, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The term "Halifax Pop Explosion" also came to be adopted in the 1990s as the name of the Halifax alternative rock music scene as a whole, which at that time featured acts such as Sloan and Thrush Hermit.
