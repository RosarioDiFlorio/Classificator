Dark culture (German Schwarze Szene, Portuguese cultura obscura, Spanish escena oscura, Italian scena Dark or scena gotica), also called dark alternative scene includes goth and dark wave culture, electro subculture (with genres like electro-industrial, aggrotech and dark electro) and parts of the neofolk and post-industrial subcultures. In this context the "culture" is not to be understood as closed subculture, but as social environment, a milieu, which comprises people with similar interests and preferences (e.g. "dark music").
