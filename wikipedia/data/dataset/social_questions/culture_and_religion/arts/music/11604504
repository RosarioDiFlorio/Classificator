This article is a list of piano brand names from all over the world. This list also includes names of old instruments which are no longer in production.
Many of these piano brand names are "stencil pianos", which means that the company which owns the brand name is simply applying the name to a piano manufactured for them by another company, and that the same or very similar pianos are sold under differing "stencil" brands. This often applies to old brand names, revitalized to give an air of heritage to a new piano line, or to pianos manufactured specifically for individual dealers or shops. Also, some brand names have models that are manufactured in entirely different manufacturing plants or countries than another model of the same brand.
