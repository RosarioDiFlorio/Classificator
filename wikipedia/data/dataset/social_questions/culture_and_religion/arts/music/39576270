Musikhaus Thomann is a German-based retailer of musical instruments, studio, lighting, and pro-audio equipment. Thomann became widely known primarily due to its large online retail operation, Thomann Cyberstore. According to a 2014 article in the largest Upper Franconian newspaper based in Bavaria, the Fränkischer Tag (de), Musikhaus Thomann is the largest online retailer of its category of merchandise, worldwide. Hans Thomann, Sr., founded the company sixty-three years ago (in 1954) as a family business in Treppendorf — part of the village of Burgebrach, in Bavaria, Germany — where the Musikhaus Thomann headquarters endures today (2017). And, as of 2017, the company is still family-owned.
