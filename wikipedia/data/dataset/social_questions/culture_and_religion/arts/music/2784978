SoundSpectrum, previously known as WhiteCap Technologies is a software company founded in 2000 that develops music visualization software. Using properties of the music such as its beat and time-varying spectrum, the software generates dynamic visuals to complement the music.
Today, SoundSpectrum is a provider of real-time audio visualization applications, featuring the G-Force and WhiteCap visualizers, as well as the SoundSpectrum Darkroom video export application. G-Force was licensed by Apple Computer for use in iTunes in 2001 and again in 2003. The software is also licensed by Microsoft and Yahoo.
