In jazz, the altered scale or altered dominant scale is a seven-note scale that is a dominant scale where all non-essential tones have been altered. This means that it comprises the three irreducibly essential tones that define a dominant seventh chord, which are root, major third, and minor seventh and that all other chord tones have been altered. These are:
the ninth, which has two altered forms: minor ninth and augmented ninth
the eleventh, which has one altered form: the augmented eleventh
the fifth, which has two altered forms: the diminished fifth and the augmented fifth
and the thirteenth, which has one altered form: the minor thirteenth
The altered forms of some of the non-essential tones coincide (augmented eleventh with diminished fifth and augmented fifth with minor thirteenth) meaning those scale degrees are enharmonically identical and have multiple potential spellings. The natural forms of the non-essential tones are not present in the scale. This means it contains no major ninth, no perfect eleventh, no perfect fifth, and no major thirteenth. An altered scale on C contains the notes:
C (root),
D♭ (minor ninth)
D♯ (augmented ninth)
E (major third)
F♯ (augmented eleventh) or G♭ (diminished fifth)
G♯ (augmented fifth) or A♭ (minor thirteenth)
B♭ (minor seventh).
This is written below in musical notation with the essential chordtones coloured black and the non-essential altered chordtones coloured red.

The altered scale is made by the sequence: semitone – tone – semitone – tone – tone – tone – tone.
The abbreviation "alt" (for "altered") used in chord symbols enhances readability by reducing the number of characters otherwise needed to define the chord and avoids the confusion of multiple equivalent complex names. For example, "C7alt" supplants "C7♯5♭9♯9♯11", "C7−5+5−9+9", "Caug7−9+9+11", etc.
