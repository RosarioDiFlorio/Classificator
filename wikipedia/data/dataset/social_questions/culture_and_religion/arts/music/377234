In music, a solo (from the Italian: solo, meaning alone) is a piece or a section of a piece played or sung by a single performer. Performing a solo is "to solo", and the performer is known as a soloist.
The plural is soli or the anglicised form solos. In some context these are interchangeable, but soli tends to be restricted to classical music, and mostly either the solo performers or the solo passages in a single piece. Furthermore, the word soli can be used to refer to a small number of simultaneous parts assigned to single players in an orchestral composition. In the Baroque concerto grosso, the term for such a group of soloists was concertino.
