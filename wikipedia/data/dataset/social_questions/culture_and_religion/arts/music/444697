Xeremiers or colla de xeremiers is a traditional ensemble that consists of flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe) and xeremies (bagpipes). Majorca has produced popular singer-songwriters like Maria del Mar Bonet. British DJs like Paul Oakenfold made the vacationing island of Ibiza a capital of house music, leading to the creation of Balearic Beat. Francesc Guerau and Antoni Literes are among the best known classical composers of the islands.
