Although the term promenade concert is often associated today with the Proms summer classical music concert series founded in 1895 by Robert Newman and the conductor Henry Wood, the term originally referred to concerts in the pleasure gardens of London, where the audience could stroll about while listening to the music (French se promener = to walk).
