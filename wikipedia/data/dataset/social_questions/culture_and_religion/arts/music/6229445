The Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumentenbau ("ZfI") (Journal for the Construction of Musical Instruments) was a German-language journal dealing in large part with the manufacture of musical instruments. It was published in Leipzig from 1880 through 1943 and serves as a chronicler of the musical world and as an intelligent reporter on some of the more technical aspects of instrument development.
