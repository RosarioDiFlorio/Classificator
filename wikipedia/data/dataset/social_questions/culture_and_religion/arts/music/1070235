The MOBO Awards stands for "Music of Black Origin" and was established in 1996 by Kanya King and Andy Ruffell. The MOBO Award show is held annually in the United Kingdom. Since its inception in 1996, the MOBO Awards has become one of Europeâ€™s biggest and most influential music award ceremonies, celebrating excellence in black music in the UK and internationally for more than 20 years in the musical fields of hip-hop, grime, RnB, soul, reggae, jazz, gospel, and African music. The MOBO Awards are seen as a UK equivalent to the BET Awards and Soul Train Awards.
In 1996, the MOBO Awards was the first black music awards of its kind to be televised on mainstream terrestrial television, where it was first broadcast on Carlton Television from London's Connaught Rooms. Across its 22 year history, the MOBO Awards has been broadcast on Channel 4, BBC Television, ITV2 and most recently Channel 5.
In 2009, the awards ceremony was held for the first time in Glasgow. Prior to that, it had been held in London. In 2011, the ceremony returned for a second time to Scotland. The awards then moved to Leeds for the first time in 2015. The awards show returned to Leeds in 2017.
The first MOBO award was presented to UK trio Baby D, in the Best Dance Act category.
From the outset MOBO has played an instrumental role in the careers of numerous UK artists such as Stormzy, Craig David, Rita Ora, Ms Dynamite, Krept and Konan and Kano.
