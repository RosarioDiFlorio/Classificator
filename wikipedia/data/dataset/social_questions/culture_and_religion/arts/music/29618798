In music, a blind octave is the alternate doubling above and below a successive scale or trill notes: "the passage being played...alternately in the higher and lower octave." The device is not to be introduced into the works of "older composers," (presumably those preceding Liszt).

Alternately, a blind octave may occur "in a rapid octave passage when one note of each alternate octave is omitted." The effect is to simulate octave doubling using a solo instrument.
