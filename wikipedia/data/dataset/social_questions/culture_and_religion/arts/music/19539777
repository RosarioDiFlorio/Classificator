"The Devil's Dream" is an old fiddle tune of unknown origins. Played as either a jig or a reel, it is attested to as a popular tune from at least 1834 in New England. It also appears in a folk tale from central England dated to c. 1805.
The Devil's Dream is, and has been since its introduction, a popular tune with fiddlers and dancers and has been recorded numerous times.
It is used by Bernard Herrmann as one of the principal themes in the film score to the movie The Devil and Daniel Webster to represent the plight of the New Hampshire farmers.
