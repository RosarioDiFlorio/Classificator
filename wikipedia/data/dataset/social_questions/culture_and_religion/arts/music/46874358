The participation of Tatarstan in the Bala Turkvision Song Contest was originally planned to begin in Istanbul, Turkey, at the inaugural Bala Turkvision Song Contest in 2015. Maidan Television (MTV) was responsible for the selection process of their participant, for their debut in 2015. Saidä Möxämmätcanova was selected as Tatarstan's first representative for the Bala Turkvision Song Contest 2015. However, they were forced to withdraw from the contest on 7 December 2015, due to the Russia–Turkey relations in the aftermath of the 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown near the Syria–Turkey border on 24 November 2015.
