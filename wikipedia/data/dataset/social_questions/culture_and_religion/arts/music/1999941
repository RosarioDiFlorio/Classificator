Sub-bass sounds are the deep, low- register pitched pitches approximately below 60 Hz and extending downward to include the lowest frequency humans can hear, assumed at about 20 Hz. In this range, human hearing is not very sensitive, so sounds in this range tend to be felt more than heard. Sound reinforcement systems and PA systems often use one or more subwoofer loudspeaker cabinets that are dedicated solely to amplifying sounds in the sub-bass range. Sounds below sub-bass are called infrasound.
