The World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT) is an international, non-profit music therapy corporation, organized under the laws of the state of North Carolina in the USA. The WFMT's mission is to promote global awareness of both the scientific and artistic nature of the profession, while also contributing to its development. The Federation advocates for the recognition of music therapy as an evidence-based profession through its support of educational programs, clinical practice, and research. WFMT is divided into eight global regions representing different parts of the world: Africa, Australia/New Zealand, North America, Latin America, Southeast Asia, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific. Detailed listings of countries within each region can be found in the federation's bylaws, posted on its website.
