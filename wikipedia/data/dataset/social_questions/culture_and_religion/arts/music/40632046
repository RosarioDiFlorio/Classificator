Hip-hop based education (HHBE) refers to the use of hip-hop, especially rap songs and lyrics, as curricular resources.
Integrating hip-hop into academic curriculum gives youth more interest in education and promotes literacy. HHBE advocates believe that hip-hop can be used in classrooms to inspire youth to be agents of social and political. Bringing hip-hop in to educational environment to connect with today's youth is becoming a popular approach that some teachers are deciding to take.
The implementation of hip-hop into curriculum promotes cultural relevance to youth of color, affirmation of urban identities, and deeper learning through connection with something relevant to youth.
