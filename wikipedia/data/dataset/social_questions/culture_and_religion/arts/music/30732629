Choral Songs in honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria is a collection of 13 choral songs by 13 British composers issued on the occasion of the 80th birthday of Queen Victoria in 1899.
In 1897-1898 the Master of the Queen's Music Sir Walter Parratt proposed a volume of choral songs modelled on The Triumphs of Oriana (1601) as part of the planned 80th birthday celebrations. He recruited 13 British composers, and in 1899 a limited edition of only 100 copies was produced entitled Choral Songs in honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.
