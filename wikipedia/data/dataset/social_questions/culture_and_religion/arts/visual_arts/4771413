Venezuelan art has a long and eventful history. Venezuela's museums and galleries are well on the way to forming a new discourse in which the public can experience and interact. Capturing the Venezuelan public view and interact with the installations and collections within a museum setting, re-establishes a new base for understanding the Venezuelan patron. This considered, the museum visitor is better understood and served as it is realized that a modern Venezuela, is represented as a diverse culture, intertwined with the traditional. The proactive cultural center strives to reacquaint itself with its audience, who in fact, are participants and beneficiaries of such cultural and heritage organizations. An effort by the Venezuelan government to connect its people to its cultural organizations, is a response to a cultural diversity and changes within.
Venezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late nineteenth century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the twentieth century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré, the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez, the Meta-realism artist Pajaro and Yucef Merhi.
