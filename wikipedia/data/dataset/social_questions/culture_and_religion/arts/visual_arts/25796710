The Royal Drawing Society was founded in 1888 in Great Britain and Ireland, with the aim of teaching drawing for educational reasons.
The methods of instruction were based on the idea that very young children attempt to draw before they can write. They have very astute perception and retentive memory. The society aimed at using drawing as a means of developing these characteristics of children. It promoted the teaching of drawing in schools.
Lord Leighton, Sir John Millais, and Sir Edward Burne-Jones aided in the society's activities.
