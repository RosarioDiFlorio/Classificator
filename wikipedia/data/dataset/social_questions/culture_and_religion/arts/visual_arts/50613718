Tile art is a small arrangement of tiles, or in some cases a single tile, with a painted pattern or image on top. It is often used as an umbrella term that includes other forms of tile-based art, such as mosaics, micromosaics, and, stained glass.
Unlike mosaics, tile art can include larger pieces of tiles that are pre-decorated. While mosaics use pieces of tesserae or another material to construct a pattern from small components, other methods, such as engraving, carving, and molding may be used in tile art. While mosaics are considered a type of tile art, there are many other forms that are also considered tile art.
