The World of Anna Sui was an exhibition housed at London's Fashion and Textile Museum from 26 May to 1 October 2017.
The exhibition was curated by the museum's head curator Dennis Nothdruft and focused on the effect Sui's work has had on the history of fashion design. The exhibit featured over 100 looks from the Suiâ€™s archive, spanning the entirety the designer's career from 1981 to 2017. It also marked the first time an American fashion designer had been the feature of a retrospective exhibit in the United Kingdom. One key theme of the exhibition was the exploration of national identity through the medium of fashion and textiles.
