The xartcollection was created in 1968 in Zurich, Switzerland by Sandro Bocola and three partners: Heinz Bütler, Rolf Fehlbaum and Erwin Meierhofer.
Xartcollection’s concept was to industrially produce three-dimensional “Multiples” in limited and signed editions. The company’s philosophy was to make contemporary Art available to a large public and its “Multiples” where sold worldwide in art galleries, design- and furniture stores namely at “Wohnbedarf”[1] in Switzerland.
Internationally renowned artists such as Max Bill, Getulio Alviani, Richard Hamilton (artist), Allen Jones (sculptor), Joe Tilson, Peter Phillips (artist) and others participated in this project. Most of xartcollection's "Multiples" were produced by the firm of Reif, Relo-Kunststoffe in Lörrach, Germany. In 1971 xartcollection also created "Xart Walls"[2] which industrially produced wallpapers designed by known artists such as Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle. The "Xart Walls" where manufactured by the firm "Marburg Wallcoverings" in Kirchhain, Germany.
Despite its international reputation the company went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1973.
