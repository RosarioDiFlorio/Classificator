Designer toys, also called "Art Toys", are novelty toys and collectibles created by independent artists and designers, which they usually produce in limited editions. Artists use a variety of materials, such as ABS plastic, vinyl, wood, metal, latex, and resin. Many designer toys are plush toys. Creators often have backgrounds in graphic design, illustration or self-described low brow art; some artists have classical art and design training, while others are self-taught. The first designer toys appeared in the 1990s.
