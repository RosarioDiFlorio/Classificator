Masterpiece, magnum opus (Latin, great work) or Chef-d'œuvre (French, master of work, plural Chefs-d'œuvre) in modern use is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. Historically, a "masterpiece"' was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
