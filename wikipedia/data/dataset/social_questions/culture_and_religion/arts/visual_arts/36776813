Pegasus ArtWorks is the statewide arts program for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware, part of the nationwide movement of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.
Created in 2002 to create broad based access to high yield arts programs, Pegasus ArtWorks provides direct access for at risk youth to high quality arts programs. The classes are taught through structured artist in residence programming, and include fine and performing arts as well as art/craft (such as quilting). Classes utilize the arts to teach literary proficiency, reading, mathematical, scientific, and cultural understanding in a contextualized manner. The arts are also utilized to teach leadership, teamwork, build self-confidence and expose youth to critical thinking skills.
Pegasus ArtWorks was named a "Notable Local Initiative" in 2010 by educational initiatives The Finance Project and ICF International. Inc
Pegasus ArtWorks was highlighted by the Delaware Division of Arts for Excellence in Arts Education in 2012. This included a short documentary piece on Content Delaware, a non-commercial project highlighting arts and culture in Delaware.
