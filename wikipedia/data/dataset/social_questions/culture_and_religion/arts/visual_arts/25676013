The Ontario Society of Artists (OSA) was founded in 1872. It is Canada's oldest continuously operating art society. The establishment of a provincial art museum and art school were the two foremost objectives of the Society. The list of objectives drawn up by the founding executive also included the fostering of Original Art in the province and the holding of Annual Exhibitions. Prominent businessman William Holmes Howland was invited to be President of the Society.
