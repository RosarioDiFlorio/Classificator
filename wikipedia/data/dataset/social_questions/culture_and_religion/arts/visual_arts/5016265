Expressionist architecture is an architectural movement in Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the expressionist visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in Germany. Brick Expressionism is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in The Netherlands (Amsterdam School). In the 1950s, a second movement of expressionist architecture developed, initiated by the Ronchamp Chapel Notre-Dame-du-Haut (1950â€“1955) by Le Corbusier. This second and international movement is called "Expressionist architecture since the 1950s" (see below). Expressionist architecture is one of the movements in "Modern architecture".
