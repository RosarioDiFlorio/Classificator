Zenitism (Serbo-Croatian: Zenitizam / Зенитизам) was an art movement in Yugoslavia from 1921 until 1926, first in Zagreb from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in Belgrade. The movement was mainly involved in visual arts, graphic design, poetry, literature, theatre, film, architecture and music. Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."
Most of its ideas were communicated through the Zenit magazine which Ljubomir Micić launched and which published 43 issues.
