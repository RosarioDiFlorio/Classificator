Kmart realism, also termed Dirty realism is a form of minimalist literature found in American short fiction. It is defined as "A literary genre characterized by a spare, terse style that features struggling, working-class characters in sterile, bleak environments". These short stories "represent and reproduce the disintegration of public life [and] the colonization of private life by consumer capitalism". John Gardner, in critical works such as On Moral Fiction, criticized this style using the term "brand-name fiction writers."
