Design education is the teaching of theory and application in the design of products, services and environments. It encompasses various disciplines of design, such as architecture, landscape architecture, graphic design, user interface design, web design, packaging design, industrial design, fashion design, information design, interior design, sustainable design, transgenerational design, and universal design. The values and attitudes which underlie modern design schools differ among the different design schools.
Design is about problem solving. Design education is learning how to apply practical methods, prior knowledge, and natural talent to solve new problems.
It is also referred to as Creative Education.
Having a complete design education can lead to professions such as architect, graphic designer, UX designer, creative director, art director, content strategist, web designer, web developer, illustrator, information architect, interior designer, visual designer, service designer, UI designer and wireframe architect.
In 1970, in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore there were no design schools. However, as of the early 2000s there are more than 23 design schools within the three Asia countries.
