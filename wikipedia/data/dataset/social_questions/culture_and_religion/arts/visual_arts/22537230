The Ellen Frank Illumination Arts Foundation's Cities of Peace exhibition displays areas of the world that have been wrought with conflict. Her website reads: “Frank’s visit to Jerusalem in 1999 inspired her to produce the first painting in the series and to visualize the creation of other works representing additional cities that have survived strife. The series directs action through hopeful energy by celebrating the best of the human spirit, transforming anguish into beauty.”  Under the artistic direction of Ellen Frank, the project was produced by interns of many different origins at the Illumination Atelier of Ellen Frank Illumination Arts Foundation.
The exhibition premiered in the Laurie M. Tisch Gallery of the JCC Manhattan 2005-2006, but the most recent exhibition took place on January 7, 2009 in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. As of now, the cities included in the project are Baghdad, Kabul, Jerusalem, Beijing, Hiroshima, New York City and Lhasa.The project continues, with pieces devoted to other cities such as Hanoi, Seoul and Warsaw. Each painting of the series includes a gold leaf; Frank explains that this leaf symbolizes the necessity of understanding as a prerequisite for peace. In addition, a crimson leaf, meant to represent the color of human blood, is tucked into each piece in honor of the dead. According to Frank, each country’s unique artistic traditions are incorporated in the respective paintings; these include illuminated manuscripts, embroidery, architectural mosaics, icons, tapestries, woodcarvings and metalwork, and micrography.
