Visual design elements and principles describe fundamental ideas about the practice of visual design.
As William Lidwell stated in Universal Principles of Design:

The best designers sometimes disregard the principles of design. When they do so, however, there is usually some compensating merit attained at the cost of the violation. Unless you are certain of doing as well, it is best to abide by the principles.
