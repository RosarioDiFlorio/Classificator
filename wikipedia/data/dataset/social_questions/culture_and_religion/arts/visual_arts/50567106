The Ghetto Biennale is an international contemporary arts exhibition, held every two years in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The two informal neighborhoods known as Lakou Cheri and Ghetto Leanne in the Grand Rue sector of downtown Port-au-Prince act as a primary site for the Ghetto Biennale in the month of December.
