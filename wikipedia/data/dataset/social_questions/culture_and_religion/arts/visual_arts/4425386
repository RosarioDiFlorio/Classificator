The Uptown Art Fair is the largest art fair of its kind held in Minnesota. The three-day-long fair is held every year, always during the first full weekend in August and always in Uptown, an eclectic neighborhood in south Minneapolis. The fair features artists in 12 media including sculpture, painting, jewelry, ceramics, wood and more. More than $2 million worth of artwork is sold during the event. The event attracts around 375,000 people over the course of the three-day weekend, and features about 350 artists, 20 food vendors and hundreds of volunteers. The art fair is the second largest event in Minnesota, second only to the Minnesota State Fair. The fair is free to attend and visitors can browse the art on display, purchase a piece or chat with the artist. The event also features food, a live performance stage, a youth art fair, and more.
