Digital Arts and Culture was a conference series that was established by Espen Aarseth in 1998, and was one of the first academic events to gather researchers, practitioners and artists working within the field of digital arts, cultures, aesthetics and design. The DAC conference started out as an annual conference, and was held every second year, until 2009.
