Āina-kāri is a kind of interior decoration by putting small pieces of mirror together in geometric forms or in forms of flowers and shrubs. By this art, a craftsman creates a beautiful shining space in a building with cut mirrors in various forms. The reflex of light through numberless formed mirror pieces gives out brightness and effulgence. Beside the decoration use, this art is used as a strong durable cover for an interior space of a building.
