The Rolf Schock Prizes were established and endowed by bequest of philosopher and artist Rolf Schock (1933â€“1986). The prizes were first awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1993, and since 2005 are awarded every three years. Each recipient currently receives SEK 400,000 (ca. US$ 60,000). A similar prize is the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy, established by the Inamori Foundation.

Logic and Philosophy (decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)
Mathematics (decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences)
Visual Arts (decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts)
Musical Arts (decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music)
