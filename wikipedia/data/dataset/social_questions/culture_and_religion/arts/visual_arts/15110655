Art Basel is an international art fair with three shows staged annually in Basel, Switzerland; Miami Beach, Florida; and Hong Kong. Each show is organized into sectors which showcase contemporary artworks by established and newly emerging artists. In addition to the artworks shown by participating galleries, the shows offer parallel programming produced in collaboration with the host cityâ€™s local institutions. While Art Basel provides a platform for galleries to show and sell their work to collectors, museum directors, and curators, it also attracts a large international audience of art spectators and students.
Galleries who apply to Art Basel shows undergo a review by a selection committee of international gallerists serving multi-year terms. During the week-long process, each application is considered for participation in the show following standards established by Art Basel.
