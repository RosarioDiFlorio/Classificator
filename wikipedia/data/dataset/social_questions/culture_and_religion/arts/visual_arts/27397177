The Arts Map was an international on-line resource to locate and identify artists and their studios, as well as galleries, art schools, museums, performing arts facilities, and related associations, service organizations, and businesses around the world, which are related to the arts. Public art in communities could be identified. The resource focused especially upon the great range of fine arts and things related to them. Using specific names or more generalized selections made in an extensive check-box listing system and combined with the Google maps application and technology, The Arts Map was used to search for what existed in a specific place, region, or country as well as to look up a subject by name or category. Each entry was created by its subject and an example of their work could be up-loaded. A highly detailed map of the community on each listing page identified the location. The reference tool was created by Robin Colodzin and Jonathan Talbot.
