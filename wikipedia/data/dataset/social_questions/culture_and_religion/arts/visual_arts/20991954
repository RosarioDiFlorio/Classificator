Hamish Fulton (born 1946) is a British walking artist. Since 1972 he has only made works based on the experience of walks. He translates his walks into a variety of media, including photography, illustrations, and wall texts. Since 1994 he has begun practicing group walks. Fulton argues that 'walking is an artform in its own right' and argues for wider acknowledgement of walking art. Hamish Fulton is represented in London by Maureen Paley.
