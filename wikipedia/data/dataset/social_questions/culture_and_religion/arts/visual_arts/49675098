A Design sprint is a time-constrained, five-phase process that uses design thinking to reduce the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market.

With more than 500 new apps entering the market every day, what does it take to build a successful digital product?

This process helps the team in clearly defining goals, validating assumptions and deciding on a product roadmap before one line of code is written. Main pillars of this process: Business strategy, interdisciplinary collaboration, rapid prototyping, and user testing. This design process is similar to Sprints in an agile development cycle that incorporates the same principles of learning early. Design sprints typically last one week.
