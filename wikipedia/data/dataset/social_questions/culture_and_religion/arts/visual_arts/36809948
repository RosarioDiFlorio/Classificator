The depiction of night in paintings is common in Western art. Paintings that feature a night scene as the theme are mostly portraits and landscapes. Some artworks involve religious or fantasy topics using the quality of dim night light to create mysterious atmospheres. They tend to illustrate the illuminating effect of the light reflection on the subjects under either moonlight or artificial light sources.
