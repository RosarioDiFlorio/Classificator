Flash Art is a bimonthly magazine focused on contemporary art. It was founded in Rome in 1967 by Italian publisher and art critic Giancarlo Politi. The magazine has been based in Milan, Italy since 1971. Originally a bilingual publication, it was split in two separate editions, Flash Art Italia (in Italian) and Flash Art International (in English) in 1978 when Helena Kontova joined the editorial team. It also publishes Flash Art Czech & Slovak Edition and Flash Art Hungary.
Flash Art extensively covered the Arte Povera artists in the 1960s, before they became known in the English speaking world.
Flash Art is especially known for featuring Andy Warhol's final interview before his death in 1987.
It has been described as "the confident, international journal of European and North American contemporary art" "distinguished by a cacophony of voices and congenial chaos".
