The Takovo Uprising is the title of two nearly identical oil paintings by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. They depict rebel leader Miloš Obrenović inciting his countrymen against the Ottoman Empire and initiating the Second Serbian Uprising.
The first version, 160 by 256 centimetres (63 by 101 in), was painted in Paris in 1894 and first exhibited in Belgrade the following year. The second, measuring 125.5 by 190 centimetres (49.4 by 74.8 in), was composed specifically for King Alexander, who had also commissioned the first version. As part of his preparations, Jovanović studied authentic costumes and armaments from the time of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović incited the people. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting.
Lithographic reproductions of the painting were soon made widely available, and distributed by the Serbian Ministry of Education in secondary schools, teachers' schools, and seminaries, contributing to its subsequent popularity. The first version is on permanent display at a museum in Gornji Milanovac, while the second is in the possession of the National Museum of Serbia. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson identifies it as one of Jovanović's finest works.
