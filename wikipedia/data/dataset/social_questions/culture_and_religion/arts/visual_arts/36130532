KunstRAI is an annual art fair for modern and contemporary art held at the RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands, every May. From 2006 to 2011 it was known as Art Amsterdam. The 2012 Art Amsterdam was to have been held at a different time and location but was cancelled; a KunstRAI did however take place in May 2012.
