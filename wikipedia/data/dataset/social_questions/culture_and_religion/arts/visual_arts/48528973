FÃ©lix Thomas (1815-1875) was a French architect and painter born in Nantes, France in 1815. After graduating from high school Clemenceau, he studied briefly at the Polytechnique before being admitted to the Beaux-Arts where he studied under Louis-Hippolyte Lebas. His skills as a draftsman led him to work as project architect on several major archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia and Assyria during the 1850s. Archeaological work provided opportunities for Thomas to demonstrate his skills as an illustrator and interpreter of historic architectural buildings. He only turned to full-time painting in his later life and is noted for works within the Orientalist genre.
