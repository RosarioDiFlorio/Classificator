Aranzi Aronzo is, as described on the official webpage, the combination of Mr. Aranzi and Mr. Aronzo, which releases Japanese-styled crafts books. In reality, Aranzi Aronzo is a company run by Mrs. Saito and Ms. Yomura that produces original goods. Their catch phrase is "cute, strange, cool, silly, a little bit horrible, stupid and comfortable ARANZI ARONZO". The company has created several stores, books, exhibitions, and advertisements and in 2007, some of the books were published in North America by Vertical Inc.
The style of Aranzi Aronzo has been described as kawaii, meaning Japanese cute; using expressive mascots, Aranzi Aronzo has effectively created a colorful cast of characters featured in the books. The Aranzi Aronzo characters have been also put on t-shirts, notebooks, and postcards, to name a few things.
