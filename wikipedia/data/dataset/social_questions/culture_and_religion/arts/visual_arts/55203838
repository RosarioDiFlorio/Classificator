Scholarships as "grants for production activities" are given to the winners who are selected by at least one from each school. It is hosted by Japan Traffic Culture Association, a nonprofit organization in Japan, and was established in 1980 as TAKIFUJI Art Award (later changed to International TAKIFUJI Art Award).
