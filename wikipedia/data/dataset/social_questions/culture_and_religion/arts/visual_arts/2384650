Sculpey (often misspelled as Sculpy) is the brand name for a type of polymer clay that can be molded and put into a conventional oven to harden, as opposed to typical modeling clays, which require a much hotter oven, such as a kiln. Until it is baked, Sculpey has a consistency somewhat like Plasticine. It is sold in many colors, though it can also be painted once baked. It has become popular with modeling artists.
The primary ingredient in Sculpey is polyvinyl chloride, augmented with fillers, plasticizers and colorants. Aside from the hazards of overheating and combustion, which can generate hydrochloric acid and other toxins, Sculpey is nontoxic both before and after hardening.
