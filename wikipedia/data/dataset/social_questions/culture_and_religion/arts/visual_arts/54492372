PIPA Prize is an initiative of PIPA Institute in partnership with the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro â€“ MAM/RJ to bring visibility to and encourage the production of contemporary art in Brazil.
Created in 2010, the yearly award is considered one of the most important art prizes in Brazil. Although it supports up-and-coming artists, PIPA Prize's mission is not to discover new talents, but to recognize new Brazilian contemporary artists that already have a critical following and a place in the art market.
