Carbon dust is an artistic technique in which carbon dust is applied to a prepared surface via dry brushes. Highlights may be painted on or scratched out later in the process. Dust is prepared by rubbing carbon pencils against an abrasive surface, such as a metal file. The technique was popularized by Max Br√∂del (1870-1941) and became widely used among medical and scientific illustrators in the twentieth century.
