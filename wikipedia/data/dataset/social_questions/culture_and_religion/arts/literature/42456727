Louis Rosenberg (born May 24, 1969) is a technologist, prolific inventor, entrepreneur, and writer. He attended Stanford University, where he earned his bachelors, masters, and PhD degrees. His doctoral work focused on robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality, and resulted in the Virtual fixtures system for the U.S. Air Force, the first immersive Augmented Reality system ever built (1992). Rosenberg then founded a number of successful technology companies, including the early VR company Immersion Corporation which went public in 1999 (NASDAQ: IMMR), the 3D digitizer company Microscribe which was used in the making of Shrek, Ice Age, and Titanic, and the mobile / augmented reality company Outland Research. Rosenberg also worked as a tenured professor at California Polytechnic State University. In 2014, he founded Unanimous A.I., an artificial intelligence company that enables human groups to amplify their collective brainpower by forming real-time online swarms. Unanimous AI became well known in 2016 when its Artificial Swarm Intelligence technology called "UNU" made a series of accurate predictions about world events, including predicting the 2016 Academy Awards, the 2016 Kentucky Derby, the 2016 Super Bowl, and the rise of Donald Trump. Rosenberg recounted the science that lead to these predictions in a TED talk delivered in 2017 in Kansas City.
