In fiction, a plot hole, plothole or plot error is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot. Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events, and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline.
While many stories have unanswered questions, unlikely events or chance occurrences, a plot hole is one that is essential to the story's outcome. Plot holes are usually seen as weaknesses or flaws in a story. Characters who lack common sense often create plot holes. Consumers of fiction who encounter plot holes have been said to question their own intelligence, and find it relieving to describe plot holes as such. Plot holes have been said to be more frequent in film than in novels due to the need for a film to show links between exciting events. Plot holes can be major or minor depending on the scene they appear in.
