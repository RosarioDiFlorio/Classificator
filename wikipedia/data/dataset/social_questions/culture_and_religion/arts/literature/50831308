Theatrum Mundi (or the Great Theater of the World) is a metaphorical concept developed throughout Western literature and thought, apparent in theories of the world such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and a popular idea in the Baroque Period among certain writers. This metaphysical explanation of the world portrays the world as a theater (apparent in Shakespeare's saying that "all the world's a stage") wherein people are characters and their actions form a drama, with God as the author, specifically for some Christian thinkers. This metaphor can take various forms, some more deterministic than others, and has also been formulated in different fashions, such as the world as chess game by the Persian philosopher Omar Khayyam. In each formulation of the theatrum mundi, though, the world is a sum greater than its parts, where various roles are played by different actors.
