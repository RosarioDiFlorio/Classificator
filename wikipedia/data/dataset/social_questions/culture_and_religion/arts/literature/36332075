TopXNotes is a hybrid personal note and information organizer and password protector for Macintosh computers which allows notes to be entered and organized. It syncs notes to mobile devices â€” iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
Formatting options are placed in a toolbar above the current note, including font, size, style, text color, emphasis color (highlighting), document color, and justification. The program also offers the option of checking spelling as text is being entered.
Sorting by note name, category, creation date, or modified date allows desired notes to be isolated. A search function locates text inside any or all notes.
Categories can be created and assigned to notes. Notes or groups of notes can be imported or exported.
TopXNotes can password-protect the entire database or individual notes. It also supports write-protected notes.
The QuickNotes function puts the notes most often used at-hand even when the program itself is hidden.
The program keeps several backups in its data folder, allowing a previous version of a note to be retrieved even if it was deleted.
The program contains its own Read Me file as well as built-in help.
