The Liaden universe ( lee-AY-den or ) is the setting for an ongoing series of science fiction stories written by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller. The series covers a considerable time period, some thousands of years in all, although since it also covers more than one universe the exact chronology is unclear. However the main timeline extends across only a few generations.
The central stories primarily concern Clan Korval, a leading house in Liaden society. The stories are primarily in the genre of space opera, with heavy doses of romance, intrigue, and wizardry.
As of early 2016 the series comprises eighteen novels and at least twenty-one chapbooks (the stories within them now available as ebooks or in collections), and the authors have contracted to write five further novels.
