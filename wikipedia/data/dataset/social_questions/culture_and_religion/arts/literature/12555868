A literary society is a group of people interested in literature. In the modern sense, this refers to a society that wants to promote one genre of literature, e.g. the World Science Fiction Society, or a specific writer -- see, for example, the list of poetry groups and movements. Such societies typically engage in research about their chosen author or genre, publishing a newsletter and holding meetings to deliver papers. Some are overtly academic and scholarly; others are more social groups of amateurs who appreciate a chance to discuss their favourite writer with other hobbyists.
