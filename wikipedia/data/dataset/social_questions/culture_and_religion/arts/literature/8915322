Fairy tales are stories that range from those originating in folk lore to more modern stories defined as literary fairy tales. Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of a Fairy tale, Folklore, Fable, Mythology, and Legend, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs "from an oral folk tale"; written by "a single identifiable author"; can be characterised as "simple and anonymous"; and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to folktales.
