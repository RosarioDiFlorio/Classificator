Classical Malay literature, also known as traditional Malay literature, refers to the Malay-language literature from the Malay world, consisting of areas now part of Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia; works from countries such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka have also been included. It shows considerable influences from Indian literature (such as in the tales of Ramayana and Mahabharata) as well as Arabic and Islamic literature (including tales of the prophet Muhammad and his companions). The term denotes a variety of works, including the hikayat, poetry (in two major forms, the syair and the pantun), history, and legal works.
