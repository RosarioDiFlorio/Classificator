Bhashya (Sanskrit: भाष्य) is a "commentary" or "exposition" of any primary or secondary text in ancient or medieval Indian literature. Common in Sanskrit literature, Bhasya is also found in other Indian languages. Bhashya are found in various fields, ranging from the Upanishads to the Sutras of Hindu schools of philosophy, from ancient medicine to music.
The Indian tradition typically followed certain guidelines in preparing a Bhasya. These commentaries give meaning of words, particularly when they are about condensed aphoristic Sutras, supplementing the interpreted meaning with additional information on the subjects. A traditional Bhasya would, like modern scholarship, name the earlier texts (cite) and often include quotes from previous authors. The author of the Bhasya would also provide verification, acceptance or rejection of the text as interpreted, with reasons, and usually include a conclusion. The title of a commentary work sometimes has the title of the text commented on, with the suffix "-Bhashya".
Among the earliest known Bhashya are included the Maha-bhashya of Patanjali from the 2nd century BCE, and Sabara Bhashya of the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, dated to have been likely composed between 100 BCE to 200 CE, but no later than the 5th century. An example of Buddhist literature Bhashya is Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośa-Bhāṣya.
