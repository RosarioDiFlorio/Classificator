Société des anciens textes français (SATF) is a learned society founded in Paris in 1875 with the purpose of publishing all kinds of medieval documents written either in langue d'oïl or langue d'oc (Bulletin de la SATF, 1 (1875), p. 1). Its founding members are Henri Bordier, Joseph de Laborde, A. Lamarle, Paul Meyer, Léopold Pannier, Gaston Paris, Auguste-Henry-Édouard, marquis de Queux de Saint-Hilaire, baron Arthur de Rothschild, baron Edmond de Rothschild, baron James N. de Rothschild and Natalis de Wailly.
From 1875 to 1936, the SATF published a yearly bulletin distributed to its members only.
Since its foundation, the SATF have also published a series of critical editions and even, sometimes, facsimile editions, a series that amounts today to approximately 180 volumes.
