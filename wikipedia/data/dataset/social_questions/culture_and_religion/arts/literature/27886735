LeapFrog Tag is an electronic handheld stylus that stores audio for proprietary paper books made by LeapFrog Enterprises. When in use the stylus is scanned across the page of a book, activating the stylus to play the prerecorded audio stored inside the stylus. When a word is scanned, for example, the stylus "reads" the word aloud to the user. The user can also play various games through this technique. LeapFrog Enterprises introduced it as the successor to the LeapPad which served as a platform for interactive books. The Tag stylus and the proprietary Tag books are primarily targeted to young children learning to read.
The Tag reader offers an alternative to either audiobooks or a supervisory person reading aloud, chiefly for before children are able to read on a particular level. It can teach phonics and help children develop a sense of independent reading, which, in turn, helps them become better readers.
LeapFrog has developed a number of titles and book sets that target specific phonic skills. These sets can be used as a supplement to support a reading or literacy curriculum currently implemented in the classroom. LeapFrog's Tag reader is accessible to a wide variety of students' learning abilities. Because Tag readers are designed with both full reading and individual word recognition this allows for differentiation. Tag also helps students learning English as a second language
