Stiefografie, also called Stiefo or Rationelle Stenografie (Rational Shorthand), is a German shorthand system. It was invented by Helmut Stief (1906â€“1977), a German press and parliamentary stenographer, and first published in 1966.
Helmut Stief was dissatisfied with the Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift so he created a much simpler alternative system. According to Stief the eponymous shorthand system Stiefografie can be quickly learned within a very short time. There are only 25 characters to learn in the first level Grundschrift (business script). Stiefografie is in Germany the most popular form of the new stenography systems published since the 1950s.
