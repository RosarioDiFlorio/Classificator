The Q-Collection Comic Book Preservation Project is a non-profit project aimed at preserving historic comic books from the 1930s to the 1960s (the Golden and Silver ages of comic book production).
The preservation of these key comics is necessary due to the acidic pulp paper that the books were printed on during the first fifty years of this art : “Comic books were not designed to last for generations, under normal storage conditions”. The project's method of preservation is to remove the pages from the comic books, find any missing pieces and duplicate them if necessary and laminate each page. Once laminated, the comics are encapsulated in binders that open for reading and then close up to protect their contents.
