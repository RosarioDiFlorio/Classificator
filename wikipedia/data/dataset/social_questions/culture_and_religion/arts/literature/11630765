Pure alexia, also known as agnosic alexia or alexia without agraphia or pure word blindness, is one form of alexia which makes up "the peripheral dyslexia" group. Individuals who have pure alexia suffer from severe reading problems while other language-related skills such as naming, oral repetition, auditory comprehension or writing are typically intact.
Pure alexia is also known as: "alexia without agraphia", "letter-by-letter dyslexia", "spelling dyslexia", or "word-form dyslexia". Another name for it is "Dejerine syndrome", after Joseph Jules Dejerine, who described it in 1892; however, when using this name, it should not be confused with medial medullary syndrome which shares the same eponym.
