A brochure is an informative paper document (often also used for advertising) that can be folded into a template, pamphlet or leaflet. A brochure can also be a set of related unfolded papers put into a pocket folder or packet. Brochures are promotional documents, primarily used to introduce a company, organization, products or services and inform prospective customers or members of the public of the benefits.
Brochures are distributed inside newspapers and are handed out personally or placed in brochure racks in high traffic locations. They may be considered as grey literature. They are usually present near tourist attractions or as sales literature.
