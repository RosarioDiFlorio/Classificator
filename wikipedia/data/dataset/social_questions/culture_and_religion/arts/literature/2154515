The Spalding Method is the methodology and educational philosophy of The Writing Road to Reading program. The Spalding philosophy is child centered, that is the physical and mental well-being of students is a primary concern of Spalding teachers. High expectations for all children are central to the philosophy. These principles of learning and instruction are applied throughout the spelling, writing, and reading curricula.
Spalding instruction is explicit, interactive, diagnostic, and multisensory. Teachers model, coach, and provide support as needed; students articulate, reflect, and explore new concepts. Careful daily observation of student progress enables teachers to differentiate instruction to meet student needs. Students see, hear, say, and write using all channels to the brain to enhance retention. All elements of the language are integrated in spelling, writing, and reading lessons. The kindergarten through to sixth-grade curricula is structured, sequential, and cumulative. Phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, high-frequency vocabulary are taught in spelling. In the writing lesson, the same high-frequency words are used to teach word meanings, usage, word parts, grammar, and composition. In the reading lesson, students learn the attributes of fine literature, the structure of narrative and expository text, fluency, listening and reading comprehension. They learn to monitor their comprehension while reading, to make connections with prior knowledge and the text, to predict word meanings, type of writing, outcomes and so forth. They learn to reorganize (reformat) the information in text and use it to mentally summarize to enhance comprehension.
