The farmer's daughter is a term for a stock character and stereotype in fiction for the daughter of a farmer, who is often portrayed as a desirable and naive young woman. She is described as being an "open-air type" and "public-spirited", who will tend to marry a hero and settle down.
The character also forms the basis for a series of jokes, known as farmer's daughter jokes, which tend to be sexual in nature and focus on acts of promiscuity. The plot usually involves the seduction of the daughter by another stock character, the peddler.
