The Language Experience Approach (LEA) is a method for teaching literacy based on a child's existing experience of language.
Some of the components of the LEA were used in the 1920s, and this approach to initial literacy has been more widely used for the past thirty years. Especially in the context of open learning, teachers use the students' existing language and prior experiences to develop reading, writing and listening skills.
Roach Van Allen, first described his approach in the 1960s; he indicated how this strategy could create a natural bridge between spoken language and written language by stating:

What I can say, I can write
What I can write, I can read
I can read what I write and what other people can write for me to read.
