Genre studies is an academic subject which studies genre theory as a branch of general critical theory in several different fields, including the literary or artistic, linguistic, or rhetorical.
Literary genre studies is a structuralist approach to the study of genre and genre theory in literary theory, film theory, and other cultural theories. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the telling of a story and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or semiotic codes) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.
Linguistic genre studies is best described by two schools of literary genre, the Systemic Functional Linguistics or "SFL", scholars of this school believe that language structure is an integral part of a text's social context and function. SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres usefulness in pedagogy.
English for Specific Purposes or "ESP" is another school of genre studies that examines the pedagogical implications of genre. ESP scholars focus on how genre can help non-native English speakers on how to use the language and its conventions through the application of genre analysis, the identification of discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in the specific discourse community, etc for bringing changes in epideictic schemata.
Another one is Rhetorical Genre Studies or "RGS" studies genre as social action. RGS emerged from Carolyn R. Miller's article "Genre as Social Action".
