A demi-sonnet is a poetic form. Demi-sonnets include seven lines of varying length and tend to be aphoristic in nature. Each poem ends with an internal full or slant rhyme. The name comes from the fact that the form is half the length of a traditional 14-line sonnet. The form was invented in 2009 by American poet Erin Murphy whose fourth book of poetry, Word Problems, is a collection of demi-sonnets.
