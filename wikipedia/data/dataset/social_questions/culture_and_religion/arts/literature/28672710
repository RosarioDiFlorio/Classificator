The Connotations Society for Critical Debate was founded in 1998. It is formed by the private subscribers to Connotations: A Journal for Critical Debate. The society makes possible the critical exchange promoted by Connotations.
Members receive two issues of Connotations per year. Regularly updated lists keep members informed of their colleagues' research interests. Members are also invited to the biennial Connotations symposia.
