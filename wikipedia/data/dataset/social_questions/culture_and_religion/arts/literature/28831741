Camila Batmanghelidjh, CBE (; Persian: کامیلا باتمانقلیچ‎ Kamylā Batmanghelych; born 1963) is an Iranian-born author and former charity executive in the United Kingdom. She is best known as the founder of Kids Company, a charity which worked with marginalised children and young people in the UK.
Between 1996–2015, Batmanghelidjh became a high-profile "media darling", fêted by celebrities and politicians for her work with Kids Company. In 2007, The Guardian described her as "one of the most powerful advocates for vulnerable children in the country". She was dubbed the "Angel of Peckham".
In 2015, amid allegations of mismanagement and the squandering of funds, Batmanghelidjh was forced to step down as the charity's chief executive, and Kids Company was closed, by then insolvent, despite receiving millions of pounds in government funding.
