Ada Celeste Sweet (born 23 February 1853) was an American reformer and humanitarian from the U.S. state of Wisconsin. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed her United States agent for paying pensions in Chicago, the first position as disbursing officer ever given to a woman by the US government. She established a strict system of civil service reform, which made her unpopular with politicians. In addition to being the founder of the ambulance system for the Chicago police, she found time to do literary and philanthropic work, and to labor for governmental reforms.
