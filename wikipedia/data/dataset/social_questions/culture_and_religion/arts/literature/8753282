Polyphony (Russian: полифония) is concept taken up by literary theory, speech act theory and linguistics to refer to the simultaneity of points of view, perspectives, and voices within a particular narrative plane. The concept was introduced by Mikhail Bakhtin, using a metaphor based on the musical term polyphony.
Bakhtin's, primary example of polyphony was Fyodor Dostoyevsky's prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoyevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or description of situations one variable angle. Instead, according to Bakhtin, Dostoyevsky aimed for fully dramatic novels of ideas in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly.
In 2015, Svetlana Alexievich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature «for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time»
