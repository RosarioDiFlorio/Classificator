WYPL (89.3 FM) is a non-commercial radio station that serves the area of Memphis, Tennessee, in the United States. The station is owned by the award-winning Memphis Public Library & Information Center and provides an open radio reading service to patrons, a type of service usually available elsewhere in the United States only on special leased receivers.
Volunteers present daily readings of The Commercial Appeal, USA Today, and other newspapers. The station also features book readings, author interviews, news programming provided by BBC News, and audio simulcasts of the midday newscasts of WMC-TV (Channel 5), along with the NBC Nightly News. The station has been selected by the American Foundation for the Blind as the Model Radio Reading Service.
Locally produced programs include Book Talk, which features interviews with authors; Library News; Eye On Vision, which features interviews with doctors and also provides information on research and development in vision and eye care; and Night Owl, a story-reading program aimed at children 6 and under, co-ordinated to a probable bedtime.
It is unknown exactly when the station first signed on the air as a subcarrier station but it moved to the 89.3 frequency on April 17, 1991; that frequency first went on air as WLYX, a station owned by Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College), and was known as "The Alternative." The free format station was operated by a volunteer staff with broadly eclectic taste, and was widely influential in bringing punk and new wave to the Memphis market in the early 1980s.
