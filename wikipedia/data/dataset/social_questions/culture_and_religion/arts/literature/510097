LIX is a readability measure indicating the difficulty of reading a text developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo Björnsson. It is computed as follows:

  
    
      
        
          LIX
        
        =
        
          
            A
            B
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              C
              ⋅
              100
            
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{LIX}}={\frac {A}{B}}+{\frac {C\cdot 100}{A}}}
  , where

  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is the number of words,

  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   is the number of periods (defined by period, colon or capital first letter), and

  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   is the number of long words (more than 6 letters).
