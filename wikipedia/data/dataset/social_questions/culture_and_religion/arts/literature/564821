The numero sign or numero symbol, № (also represented as Nº, No, No. or no. (US English), or No or no (UK English) plural Nos. or nos. (US English) or Nos or nos UK English ), is a typographic abbreviation of the word number(s) indicating ordinal numeration, especially in names and titles. For example, with the numero sign, the written long-form of the address "Number 22 Acacia Avenue" is shortened to "№ 22 Acacia Avenue", yet both forms are spoken long.
Typographically, the numero sign combines the upper-case Latin letter N with a usually superscript lower-case letter o, sometimes underlined, resembling the masculine ordinal indicator. In Unicode, the character is U+2116 № Numero sign (HTML &#8470;).
The Oxford English Dictionary derives the numero sign from Latin numerocode: lat promoted to code: la , the ablative form of numeruscode: lat promoted to code: la ("number", with the ablative denotations of: "by the number, with the number"). In Romance languages, the numero sign is understood as an abbreviation of the word for "number", e.g. Italian numero, French numéro, and Portuguese and Spanish número.
