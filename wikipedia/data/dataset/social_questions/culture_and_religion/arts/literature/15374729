Class S (クラスS, Kurasu Esu), or "S kankei", abbreviated either as S or Esu (エス), is an early twentieth century Japanese wasei-eigo term specifically used to refer to strong emotional bonds between schoolgirls, and a genre of girl's fiction (少女小説, shōjo shōsetsu) which tells stories about the same, particularly a mutual crush between an upper class person and a lower class person. The S is an abbreviation that can stand for "sister", "shōjo" (少女, lit. young girl), "sex", "schön" (German: beautiful), and "escape".
