The backslash (\) is a typographical mark (glyph) used mainly in computing and is the mirror image of the common slash (/). It is sometimes called a hack, whack, escape (from C/UNIX), reverse slash, slosh, downwhack, backslant, backwhack, bash, reverse slant, and reversed virgule. In Unicode, it is encoded at U+005C \ REVERSE SOLIDUS (HTML &#92;).
