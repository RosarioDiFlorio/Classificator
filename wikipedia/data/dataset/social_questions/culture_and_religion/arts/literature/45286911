Web literacy comprises the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing and participating on the web. It has been described as "both content and activity" â€“ i.e., web users should not just learn about the web but also how to make their own website. Web literacy is closely related to digital literacy, information literacy, and network literacy, but differs in taking a more holistic approach.
