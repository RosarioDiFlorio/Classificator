Dragon Harper is a science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey and her son Todd McCaffrey, part of the Dragonriders of Pern series that she initiated in 1967. Published forty years later, it was the twenty-first in the series.
Dragon Harper and the previous novels Dragon's Kin and Dragon's Fire feature Kindan as a boy and young man, about 500 years after landing on Pern (500 AL). They were the first collaborations by mother and son.
