Stenoscript or Stenoscript ABC Shorthand is a shorthand system invented by Manuel C. Avancena (1923-1987) and first published in 1950. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, perhaps erroneously, claims the system was originally published in London in 1607. An unrelated project also called Stenoscript was written by George A.S. Oliver and published in London in 1934.
