Juggler of Worlds (2008) is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven and Edward M. Lerner, a sequel to their Fleet of Worlds .
It is set in the Known Space universe. Most of the book revisits earlier stories (the Beowulf Shaeffer stories in Crashlander from the points of view of Sigmund Ausfaller and several Pierson's Puppeteers, and "The Soft Weapon" and parts of Fleet of Worlds from the point of view of Nessus). The novel also severely revises the established knowledge of the Outsider race. The final quarter of the book returns to the setting of Fleet of Worlds.
