The Kids' Lit Quiz is an annual literature competition, in which teams of four students, aged 10 to 13, work together to answer wide-ranging literary questions. The winning team from each region competes in the national final. The winner of the national final is then invited to the World Final held annually in July or August. Since its inception in 1991, thousands of students have participated each year throughout the world.
The quiz was created by Wayne Mills, a former educator at the University of Auckland, who wears a purple and black hat while hosting this literary quiz. In 2008 Wayne Mills was given the Storylines Margaret Mahy Medal and Lecture Award to recognize his achievement in establishing the Kids' Lit Quiz. He was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's New Year's Honours in 2011 for meritorious services to education, specifically children's literature.
In 2003 the quiz was brought to the UK where up to 400 schools currently participate in the heats leading to the world final.This pattern is repeated in different countries around the world.
The Kids' Lit Quiz motivates and inspires children to read a wide range of children's literature for pleasure from the classics to the contemporary, from nursery rhymes to comics, and from folk tales to myths. It offers children rewards they may not otherwise experience in the classroom setting.
Currently the quiz takes place in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, United States of America, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Singapore was the first country in Asia to have the quiz.
