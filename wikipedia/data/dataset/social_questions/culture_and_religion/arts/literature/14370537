Theophilus Thistle is the title of a famous tongue-twister, of which there are multiple versions.
One version reads as:
Theophilus Thistle, the successful thistle sifter,
In sifting a sieve full of un-sifted thistles,
Thrust three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb.
If Theophilus Thistle, the successful thistle sifter,
Can thrust three thousand thistles through the thick of his thumb,
See that thou, in sifting a sieve full of un-sifted thistles,
Thrust not three thousand thistles through the thick of thy thumb.
While another version reads:
Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter
Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles.
A sieve of unsifted thistles
Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter sifted.
If Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter
Sifted a sieve of unsifted thistles,
Where is the sieve of un-sifted thistles
Theophilus Thistle, the Thistle Sifter sifted?
This tongue twister has been included in many tongue twister books and lessons, particularly in helping children and others with speech impediments to correctly pronounce the forward th and s sounds.
Australian dance music group Sonic Animation used a version of the tongue twister in their break-out song "Theophilus Thistler".
In the book Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit by P. G. Wodehouse, the character Bertram Wooster asked Jeeves to repeat a version of the tongue-twister in order to prove that he was not intoxicated:
...'Intoxicated?' I said. 'At ten in the morning? A laughable theory. But the matter can readily be put to the test. Jeeves, say "Theodore Oswaldtwistle, the thistle sifter, sifting a sack of thistles thrust three thorns through the thick of his thumb".'
He did so with an intonation as clear as a bell, if not clearer.
