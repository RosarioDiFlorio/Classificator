Coggle is a freeware mind-mapping web application. Like other mind-mapping software, Coggle produces hierarchically structured documents, like a branching tree. This contrasts with conventional collaborative editors, like Google Docs, which provide either linear (text document), or tabular (spreadsheet) document formats.
Its authors promise that it will be "free forever".
