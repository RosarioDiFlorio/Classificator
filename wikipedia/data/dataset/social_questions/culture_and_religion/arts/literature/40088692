A meditation (derived from the Latin meditatio, from a verb meditari, meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder") is a written work or a discourse intended to express its author's reflections, or to guide others in contemplation. Often they are an author's musings or extended thoughts on deeper philosophical or religious questions.
Examples of meditations are:
Thomas Traherne's Centuries of Meditations
T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets
Meditations a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor 161–180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy
Meditations on First Philosophy by René Descartes
