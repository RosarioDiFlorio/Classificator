The Latvian Literary Society (German: Lettisch-literärische Gesellschaft, Latvian: Latviešu literārā biedrība), also called "The Latvian Society of Friends" was founded in 1824 by German educated people, mainly pastors. The goal of the Society was to investigate the Latvian language, folklore and culture. At the time, when the Society was organized, hardly any Latvian educated in a higher education existed, and nobody researched their language or folklore.
