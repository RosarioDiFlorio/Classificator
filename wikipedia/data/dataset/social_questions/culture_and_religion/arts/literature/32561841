This is a list of books released for the UK World Book Day. In 1998 and 1999 a specially created WBD anthology priced at £1 (€1.50 in Ireland) was published. In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 books were published, covering a wider age-range. Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.
From 2009 to 2011 flip books were published containing stories by two different authors one starting at each end of the book. 2012 saw the return of single story books and the first E-books published simultaneously.
