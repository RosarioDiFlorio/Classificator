ChineseSkill is a free mobile application for learning Mandarin Chinese. Its course consists of 45 topics which focuses on learning vocabulary and grammar through context and uses a gamification mechanism similar to the language-learning platform Duolingo.
ChineseSkill was founded by Wang Zhulong, who noticed a growing trend of people learning Mandarin Chinese while he was stationed in Japan. His partner majored in Chinese language at Peking University.
As of August 2014, ChineseSkill has been available for download on both the App Store (iOS) and Google Play.
