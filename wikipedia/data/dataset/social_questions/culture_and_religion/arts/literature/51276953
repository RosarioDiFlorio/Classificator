Hardy's Well is a public house located at the end of the Curry Mile, at 257 Wilmslow Road, in Rusholme, south Manchester, near to Platt Fields Park. The 200-year-old building is named after Hardy's Brewery, and was formerly known as Birch Villa, which has existed on the site since 1837. The front of the building has a Hardy's mosaic on it.
Following from a conversation between Lemn Sissay and the landlord in 1994, it has one of the first public poems written on one of its gable walls. The poem is known as "Hardy's Well", after the name of the pub. Sissay went on to display poetry UK-wide.
It was a popular venue for University of Manchester students, and of Manchester City F.C. fans when the club was based at Maine Road.
It is owned by Enterprise Inns. It was listed as an Asset of community value in 2015 as a result of an application by the Rusholme & Fallowfield Civic Society. The pub closed in July 2016, and is at risk of being demolished.
