Self-study programs allow learning without having a teacher present, and the courses can supplement or replace classroom instruction. Universities use self-study programs for less-commonly taught languages, where having professors is not feasible. Self-study programs are available on paper, audio files, video files, computers, or any combination. This list is limited to programs which teach four or more languages. There are many others which teach one language.
This list shows the number of languages taught by each program, the name of the program, and the number of different languages used for instruction. Multiple languages of instruction may be available for some but not all courses. For example Reise Know-How uses 6 languages to teach German, but only German to teach the other languages. On the other hand Eurotalk, Pronunciator and 50Languages use all languages to teach all the other languages. Global Recordings Network teaches by having the same stories recorded in each language, so learners can learn each story's vocabulary in any of the 6,000 languages.
Alphabetical indexes of languages, showing which publishers have courses in each, are at Lang1234, Martindale, Omniglot, Rüdiger Köppe and UCLA.
