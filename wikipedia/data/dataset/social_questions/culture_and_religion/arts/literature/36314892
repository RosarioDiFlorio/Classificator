National Share-a-Story Month (NSSM) is an annual event in the United Kingdom that is used to promote reading to children.
It is used by librarians, schools, the book industry, bloggers and parents as a way to focus on storytelling in the broadest of senses. Local groups of The Federation of Children's Book Groups often hold special events to celebrate the month, such as author visits, book readings and other activities.
