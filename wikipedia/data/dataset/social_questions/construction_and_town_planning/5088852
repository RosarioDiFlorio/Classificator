The Paddington Waterside Partnership is the body coordinating regeneration of the Paddington Special Policy Area around Paddington Station in London. The project covers an area almost the size of Soho, creating about 10,000,000 square feet (930,000 m2) of space between 1998 and 2018.
It consists of 13 individual projects in the triangle of land between Praed Street, Westbourne Terrace and the A40 Westway, most notably PaddingtonCentral and Paddington Basin. In 2000, the Independent described it as "the largest central London redevelopment scheme since the Second World War".
