Urban secession is a city's secession from its surrounding region, to form a new political unit.
This new unit is usually a subdivision of the same country as its surroundings. Many cities around the world form a separate local government unit. The most common reason for this is that the population of the city is too large for the city to be subsumed into a larger local government unit.
However in a few cases, full sovereignty may be attained, in which case the unit is usually called a city-state. It is an extreme form of urban autonomy, which can be expressed in less formal terms or with ordinary legislation such as a City Charter.
