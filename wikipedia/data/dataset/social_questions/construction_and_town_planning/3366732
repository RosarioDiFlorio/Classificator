Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. (July 24, 1870 â€“ December 25, 1957) was an American landscape architect and city planner known for his wildlife conservation efforts. He had a lifetime commitment to national parks, and worked on projects in Acadia, the Everglades and Yosemite National Park. Olmsted Point in Yosemite and Olmsted Island at Great Falls of the Potomac River in Maryland are named after him. He was the son of Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., and he and his brother John C. Olmsted created Olmsted Brothers as a successor firm to their father's. Very soon after his father's death, Olmsted stopped using the suffix "Jr.," but anything attributed to Frederick Law Olmsted after about 1896 is necessarily the son's work.
