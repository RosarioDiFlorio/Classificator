The 1916 Zoning Resolution in New York City was the first citywide zoning code in the US. The zoning resolution reflected both borough and local interests, and was proposed after the development of 120 Broadway (the Equitable Building) in lower Manhattan. It was a measure adopted primarily to stop massive buildings from preventing light and air from reaching the streets below, and established limits in building massing at certain heights, usually interpreted as a series of setbacks and, while not imposing height limits, restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size. The chief authors of this resolution were George McAneny and Edward M. Bassett.
