A portable toilet or mobile toilet is a toilet that may easily be moved around. They may be toilets that can be brought on site, such as a festival or building site, to quickly provide sanitation services. Others may be toilets within mobile vehicles, such as boats or caravans. Some are re-usable and may be moved on to further sites, others are easily installed but become permanent once in place. A major characteristic is that most types do not require any pre-existing services to be provided on-site, such as sewerage disposal, but are completely self contained.
They can be used in a variety of situations, for example in urban slums of developing countries, at festivals, for camping, or on boats. One well-known type of portable toilets are chemical toilets, but other types exist as well, such as urine-diversion dehydration toilets, composting toilets, container-based toilets, bucket toilets, freezing toilets and incineration toilets.
A portable toilet is not connected to a hole in the ground (like a pit latrine), nor to a septic tank, nor is it plumbed into a municipal system leading to a sewage treatment plant; it can, by definition, be picked up and moved. Some portable toilets can be carried by one person, as in the main image, whereas others need heavy lifting equipment such as a truck and crane.
