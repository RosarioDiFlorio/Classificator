Madhavaram Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in Chennai, India, set up by the horticulture department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The garden, under construction, is expected to be opened by February 2013 and will be the largest botanical garden in the city. The garden is located at the State horticulture farm in Madhavaram Milk Colony. Encompassing an area of 28 acres, it is being built at a cost of ₹ 57.3 million. Foundation stone for the garden was laid on 15 September 2010. As of October 2012, 80 percent of the civil work has been completed and work is in progress to construct a food court, ticket counters and a compound wall. A small bridge has been built to attract birds from where visitors will get a view of the lake. The garden will have nearly 400 species of plants. A glasshouse similar to the one in the garden at Udhagamandalam will also be created, with different types of gardens, including herbal, flowers, bonsai and trellis gardens, in addition to mazes, a play area for children, cascades and many fountains. The garden will also have an open-air theatre with a capacity to seat nearly 150 people. There will also be a nursery outlet at the garden.
As part of the project, the Horticulture Training Centre in Madhavaram will also be upgraded to Horticulture Management Institute at a cost of ₹ 39 million.
