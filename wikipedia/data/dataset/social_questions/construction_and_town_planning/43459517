Planuncus tingitanus s.l. is a working title for any of the species belonging to the Planuncus tingitanus species group, of the cockroach genus Planuncus (Blattodea: Ectobiinae). As the exact status of some the species in this group can not be determined without more research, the whole species complex is referred to by the name of the oldest species in the group sensu lato (hence the "s.l.").
As such, Planuncus tingitanus s.l. refers to an adventive species, or possibly a complex of cryptic species, that has dramatically expanded its range over the southern parts of Northwestern Europe in a very short period of time during the first decades of the 21st century.
