The Niagara River Greenway Plan is a comprehensive plan focusing on the development of a greenway of interconnected parks, river access points and waterfront trails along the right bank of the Niagara River from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie. The plan was drawn up by The Niagara River Greenway Commission, first established in 2004 by then New York state Governor George Pataki.
