Located between historic Chinatown and the Central Business District, Singapore City Gallery is a three storey visitor centre which houses an enormous model replica, giving visitors a complete view of the Central Area of Singapore. It also shows the city's physical transformation past, present and future.
Formerly known as the URA Gallery, it was established in January 1999, and is currently still managed by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), a statutory board under the Ministry of National Development, whose role is to plan and facilitate Singapore's long term land use and physical development.
