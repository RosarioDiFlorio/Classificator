Meanwood Valley Urban Farm, a city farm in Meanwood, Leeds, England, is a local charity established in 1980. The farm is on Meanwood Beck and occupies 24 acres (97,000 m2). The main entrance is on Sugarwell Road. It demonstrates a variety of wildlife habitats, organic farming and sustainability to members of the public, and introduces schoolchildren to various aspects of farming and the environment. The Farm also provides educational services to disadvantaged young people and adults with learning difficulties. The animals farmed include Dexter cattle, sheep (Whitefaced Woodland Ryeland), alpacas, goats, several breeds of pig, chickens and ducks. There are also two donkeys. There is a market garden area and from time to time produce is available from the shop.
In 1999, a timber frame building, called the Epicentre, was opened as a resource for the farm and the local community, with offices, education and meeting rooms. It is an example of Walter Segal system of self-build construction which is environmentally-friendly in its use of materials and energy. It is a low-energy building using the principle of solar gain; it has a turf roof and uses a reed bed drainage treatment system.
There is a small play area, an independently run cafe and there are several walks around the farm although some have reduced accessibility.
One of the Farm's ground-breaking projects, established only a few years after the charity was registered, is the Recycled Bike Project. Farm Trainees are taught how to dismantle and re-assemble second-hand bikes donated to the Farm and the renovated bikes are sold at modest prices to raise funds for the charity.
The Farm is open to visitors every day including Christmas Day.
