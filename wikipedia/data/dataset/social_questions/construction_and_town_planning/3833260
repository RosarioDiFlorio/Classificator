A student quarter or a student ghetto is a residential area, usually in proximity to a college or university, that houses mostly students. Due to the youth and relative low income of the students, most of the housing is rented, with some cooperatives. Landlords have little incentive to properly maintain the housing stock, since they know that they can always find tenants. Non-students tend to leave the area because of the noise and raucous behavior of the students. Property crimes, sexual assaults, and noise and drug violations are more common in student quarters.
Most modern student ghettos arose from the rise in post-secondary enrollment after World War II. Many colleges and universities became unable to house all their students, while homeowners in adjacent neighborhoods fled from the influx of students. Such neighborhoods often took over from faculty and other affluent (permanent) residents, as the housing stock in these areas deteriorated. Many local governments have worked to control the spread of student ghettos and improve their appearance. Fire safety is a special concern.
