Mother Pigeon is a street performance artist in New York City. In a typical show, she arranges an art installation of hand made soft sculptures representing pigeons and other urban wildlife while she sits among them. The art is for fun and to promote animal rights for pigeons, rats in New York City, and other animals. Her exhibitions are intended to improve the reputations of animals who are "maligned" and "overlooked".
Mother Pigeon lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

Some art lovers say the pigeons seem real until examined closely.
