The Cities Alliance is a global partnership formed jointly by the World Bank and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (later known as UN-Habitat) to distribute grants, share information between local governments, and make policy recommendations "to [tackle] urban poverty in developing countries". Its stated main goals include developing "national policy frameworks to address urban development needs, developing and implementing local inclusive strategies and plans, strengthening the capacity of cities to provide improved services to the urban poor" and "developing mechanisms to engage citizens in city or urban governance".
