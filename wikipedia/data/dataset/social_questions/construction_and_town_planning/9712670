EUROCITIES is the network of major European cities, founded in 1986 by the mayors of Barcelona, Birmingham, Frankfurt, Lyon, Milan, and Rotterdam. The 1989 Barcelona conference agreed that a key task was to put the issue of cities and their economic, political and social development onto the European agenda. Indeed, the founders suggested that major European cities could benefit from forming such an association. They intended to form a political platform to act as a channel for communicating with the European institutions and to become recognised as a significant partner in the European community and each member state.
Today, EUROCITIES brings together the local governments of over 130 of Europeâ€™s major cities from 35 different countries, representing the interests and needs of 130 million citizens.
The EUROCITIES secretariat is based in Brussels, Belgium. The Brussels office carries out policy, projects, human resources, finance, administration and communications work. EUROCITIES provides a platform for its members to share knowledge and ideas, exchange experiences, analyse common problems and develop innovative solutions, through a wide range of forums, working groups, projects, activities and events. EUROCITIES is committed to working towards a common vision of a sustainable future in which all citizens can enjoy a good quality of life.
