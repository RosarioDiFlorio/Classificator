A transport corridor is a generally linear area that is defined by one or more modes of transportation like highways, railroads or public transit which share a common course. Development often occurs around transportation corridors because they carry so many people, creating linear agglomerations like the Las Vegas Strip or the linear form of many neighborhood retail areas.
