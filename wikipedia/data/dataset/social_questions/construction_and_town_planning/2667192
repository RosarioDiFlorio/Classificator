A setback, sometimes called step-back, is a step-like recession in a wall. Setbacks were initially used for structural reasons, but now are often mandated by land use codes, or are used for aesthetical reasons. In densely built-up areas, setbacks also help get more daylight and fresh air to the street level. Importantly, a setback helps lower the building's center of mass, making it more stabilized.
