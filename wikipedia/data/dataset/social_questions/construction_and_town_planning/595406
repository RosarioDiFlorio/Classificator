Paternoster Square is an urban development, owned by the Mitsubishi Estate Co., next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. The area, which takes its name from Paternoster Row, once centre of the London publishing trade, was devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz during the Second World War. It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from Threadneedle Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities Co., and of fund manager Fidelity Investments. The square itself, i.e. the plaza, is privately owned public space.
Pater noster is Latin for "Our Father", the incipit of the Lord's Prayer. The Square lies near the top of Ludgate Hill, the highest part of the City of London.
