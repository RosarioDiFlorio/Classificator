The Belfast City Park is an urban park in Belfast, Maine. Located on 17.5 acres (7.1 ha) of land overlooking Penobscot Bay, it is heavily used during the spring, summer and fall months and closed during the winter. When it was founded in 1904 by the Belfast Village Improvement Society, a local women's group, it was considered the group's biggest accomplishment.
