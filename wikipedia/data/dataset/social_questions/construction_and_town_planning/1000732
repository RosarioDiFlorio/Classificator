Brookland is a neighborhood in the Northeast quadrant of Washington, D.C., historically centered along 12th Street NE. Brookland is bounded by Michigan Avenue to the north, Rhode Island Avenue NE to the south, South Dakota Avenue to the east, and the tracks for the Red Line of the Washington Metro to the west. The western boundary originates with the establishment of the former Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1873, creating the physical barrier which continues to separate Brookland from Edgewood to the west today.
Brookland is served by the Brooklandâ€“CUA station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.
