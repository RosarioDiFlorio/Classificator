Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia 2014 SCC 44 is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which established Aboriginal land title for the Tsilhqot'in First Nation, with larger effects. As a result of the landmark decision, provinces cannot claim a right to engage in clear-cut logging on lands protected by Aboriginal title; they must gain approval for such action from the title-holder before proceeding.
