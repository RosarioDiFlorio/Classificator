The Yunnan Institute of Development (YID), based in Yunnan Province's Yuxi Prefecture, is a Sino-Danish non-governmental organization, non-formal adult education institute established in 2001 in partnership with Yuxi Teacher College. The institution provides an 11-month volunteer training program that trains students as Development Instructors for work in China, India, Africa, and other locations worldwide[1].
Students of the program work with many transnational non-governmental organizations after completion of the training program by providing rural development activities. Through outreach in local rural communities, these Development Instructors serve the needs of each community teaching a variety of programs. Programs have included offering seminars on nutrition, hygiene, health, sanitation safety, and HIV/AIDS prevention. Development Instructors support local schools and teachers with their activities in childrenâ€™s clubs, primary-school and middle-school support, curriculum development, teacher training, and early childhood development. Additional activities also include running microcredit projects and income generating activities in the whole province. Instruction takes place in both English and Mandarin.
