Provide a voice for constituent local authorities on major issues affecting the South West
Influence Government policy as it affects the region
Encourage partnership working between local authorities and other organisations and agencies in the South West on policy issues where a broader regional approach is required
Promote the sharing of good practice
Support councils through delivery of the Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership.
