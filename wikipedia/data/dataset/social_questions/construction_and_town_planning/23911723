A street clock or post clock is a clock mounted on top of a post typically installed in a streetscape or other urban or park setting.
A less common kind of street clock can be found on Maiden Lane in Manhattan, New York. In the late 19th century, William Barthman Jewelers had a clock embedded in the sidewalk. The clock remains visible and maintained As of 2014.
