Plymouth's Central Park is a large centralised park situated to the north of Plymouth city centre in south west Devon, England, stretching north from the railway station to Pounds House, Peverell and west from Ford Park Cemetery to the A386 (Outland Road and Alma Road).
Central Park is trust land, which explains why it has not been built on in the middle of the city. The trust deed dedicated the land 'for municipal use' and as such it cannot be built on or developed, except for leisure purposes open to all. It is popular among walkers and joggers as it holds views all over the city to the sea.
The park is used mainly for sport and recreation: it has many leisure facilities such as football, rugby and cricket pitches, a golf course, a bowling green, a baseball court, Central Park Leisure Pools, Mayflower Leisure Centre and Home Park Stadium, home to Plymouth Argyle Football Club. In the mid 1990s, Plymouth Argyle had wanted to build a completely new 25,000-seat stadium in the area, but these were scrapped soon afterwards in favour of redeveloping Home Park.
There is also a new playground area, which is based on the continents of the world.

As of 2007 there are plans by the council to demolish the now ageing Leisure Pools and Mayflower Leisure Centre and replace them with a new larger combined indoor sports complex (Plymouth Life Centre) with multipurpose indoor pitches, basketball court, ice rink, swimming pool and caf√©.
As of 2012 Mayflower Leisure Centre and the Central Park Leisure Pools have now been demolished, and the Plymouth Life Centre is open.
Saturday, 24 March 2012 saw the official opening of the new multimillion-pound Life Centre.
