De Neve Square Park is a quaint urban pocket park located in the neighborhood of Holmby Hills in West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California. It is located at the northern terminus of Mapleton Drive where it meets Saint Pierre Road at Beverly Glen Boulevard, where Holmby Hills borders East Gate Bel Air to the west. The trapezoidal (rather than square) park is ringed by mature sycamore trees as well as English-style street lamps from the 1920s (created exclusively for Holmby Hills). De Neve Square Park is one of two parks in Holmby Hills (the other being Holmby Park).
De Neve Square Park is dedicated to the memory of Felipe de Neve, regarded as the founder of Los Angeles in 1781.
