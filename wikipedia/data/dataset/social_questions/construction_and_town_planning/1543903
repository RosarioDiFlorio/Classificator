Ribbon development is building houses along the routes of communications radiating from a human settlement. Such development generated great concern in the United Kingdom during the 1920s and the 1930s as well as in numerous other countries.
Increasing motor car ownership meant that houses could be sold easily even if they were remote from shops and other services. It was attractive to developers because they did not have to waste money or plot space constructing roads.
The practice became seen as inefficient use of resources and a precursor to urban sprawl, so a key aim for the United Kingdom's post-war planning system was to halt ribbon development. It led to the introduction of green belt policies.
