A food desert is an area, especially one with low-income and minority residents, that has limited access to affordable and nutritious food. In contrast, an area with supermarkets is termed a food oasis. The term food desert considers the type and quality of food available to the population, in addition to the number, nature, and size of food stores that are accessible. Food deserts are characterized by a lack of supermarkets which decreases residents’ access to fruits, vegetables and other whole foods. In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 18 million Americans live in a food desert, meaning that they live more than one mile from a supermarket in urban or suburban areas, and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas. Food deserts lack whole food providers who supply fruits and vegetables, and instead provide processed, sugar, and fat laden foods in convenience stores. Processed, sugar, and fat laden foods are known contributors to the United States’ obesity epidemic. With limited access to food retailers or supermarkets that stock fresh and healthy foods, populations living in food deserts may experience high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity.
