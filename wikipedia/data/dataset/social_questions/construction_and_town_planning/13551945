SAVE Britain's Heritage was created in 1975, European Architectural Heritage Year, by a group of journalists, historians, architects, and planners to campaign publicly for endangered historic buildings. Through press releases, leaflets, reports, books and exhibitions, SAVE Britain's Heritage champions the cause of decaying country houses, redundant churches and chapels, disused mills and warehouses, blighted streets and neighbourhoods, cottages and town halls, railway stations, hospitals, military buildings and asylums.
From the start, SAVE Britain's Heritage has always placed a special emphasis on the possibilities of alternative uses for historic buildings and has, on a number of occasions, prepared its own schemes for re-use of threatened buildings. On repeated occasions, its proposals have been instrumental in giving threatened buildings a renewed lease of life.
SAVE Britain's Heritage is also very active on the broader issues of preservation policy. Many of its campaigns have altered the way conservation now protects Britain's built heritage. SAVE's attack on insensitive shop fronts contained guidelines now adopted by many local planning authorities, and SAVE Britain's Heritage was the first organisation to campaign for the introduction of the Thirty Year Rule, which now makes outstanding post-war buildings in England and Wales eligible for listing. SAVE Britain's Heritage is a registered charity governed by a board of trustees.
