The Scottish Redundant Churches Trust is a registered charity founded in 1996 which looks after Scottish churches which are of outstanding historic or architectural significance but are no longer used for regular worship. The Trust receives funding from Historic Scotland and public donations. Funding for restoration of churches in Trust ownership is received from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland, the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, the Scottish Churches Architectural Heritage Trust, and other trusts and public donations.
The Trust conserves and repairs all of the churches in its care and runs a range of projects to encourage greater public enjoyment and understanding of historic churches. Many of its buildings are used for community, arts and educational activities. All remain as places of worship and occasional services are held.
The Trust presently maintains seven properties throughout Scotland: St Peter's Church, Sandwick in Orkney (acquired 1998), Cromarty East Church in Ross-shire (acquired 1998), Pettinain Church in Lanarkshire (acquired 2000), Tibbermore Church in Perthshire (acquired 2001), Benholm Kirk, Kincardineshire (acquired 2006), Kildrummy Kirk (acquired 2009), and St Margaret's Church, Braemar (acquired 2013).
