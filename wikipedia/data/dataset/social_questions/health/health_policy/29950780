The aim of medical regulation is to ensure that medicine is only practised by qualified and suitable people. The history of regulating doctors in the UK dates back around 600 years. The earliest licensing procedures were administered by the Church, with professional associations and universities also playing a role. Modern regulation of doctors is carried out by the General Medical Council.
