The public health system in India comprises a set of state-owned health care facilities funded and controlled by the government of India. Some of these are controlled by agencies of the central government while some are controlled by the governments of the states of India. The governmental ministry which controls the central government interests in these institutions is the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Governmental spending on health care in India is exclusively this system, hence most of the treatments in these institutions are either fully or partially subsidised.
