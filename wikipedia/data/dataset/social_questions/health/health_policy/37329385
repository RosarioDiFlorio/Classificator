Choosing Wisely is a United States-based health educational campaign, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM). It seeks to improve doctorâ€“patient relationships and promote patient-centered care by informing patients and physicians about overutilization of medical resources.
The campaign addresses the problem of patients receiving unnecessary health care, reasoning that this results in poor outcomes for the patient and could create significant waste in the United States healthcare system. To conduct the campaign, a coordinator from ABIM Foundation asks medical specialty professional organizations to make five recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. Distributors then share this information with community groups nationwide, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members. The intent is that patients and doctors will discuss the recommendations in these lists, believing that if patients and doctors communicate with each other more effectively when making health decisions patients will have better outcomes and the medical system itself will benefit.
The campaign follows a history of proposals for both increasing doctor-patient communication and reducing waste in health care. Most commentators confirm the existence of avoidable waste in the health care system. Proponents of the campaign say that it is a uniquely broad and much-needed effort.
