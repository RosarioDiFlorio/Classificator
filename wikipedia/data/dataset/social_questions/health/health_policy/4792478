The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH) is an executive agency of the state which plays the role of providing information, raising health awareness and education, ensuring the accessibility of health services, and monitoring the quality of health services provided to citizens and visitors in the mainland of the People's Republic of China. In the reforms of 2013 the ministry has been dissolved and its functions integrated into the new agency called the National Health and Family Planning Commission.
The MOH is also involved in the control of illness and disease, coordinating the utilisation of resources and expertise where necessary. It also cooperates and keeps in touch with other health ministries and departments, including those of the special administrative regions, and the World Health Organization (WHO).
As part of the National Health and Family Planning Commission it is now headed by Ms. Li Bin (Simplified Chinese:李斌;Hanyu Pinyin:Lǐ Bīn). Until 2013 it was headed by the Minister for Health, a position last held by Dr Chen Zhu (陈竺) who was then the only minister in the State Council, and one of the two ministers who are not members of the Communist Party of China. He is the chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, one of the "8 democratic parties" of the PRC.
