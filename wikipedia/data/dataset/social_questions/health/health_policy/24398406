Landeros v. Flood was a 1976 court case in the state of California involving child abuse and alleged medical malpractice.
In 1971, Gita Landeros, a minor, was seen in the emergency room by Dr. Flood for injuries inflicted by her mother and the mother's common law husband. Dr. Flood failed to diagnose "battered child syndrome" and also did not report the injuries to proper civil authorities in violation of California law. The child was released to the custody of her mother and the mother's common law husband, where she experienced further injury at their hands. The parents fled the state, but were apprehended and convicted of criminal child abuse. Gita Landeros brought a civil suit in tort for damages against Dr. Flood. The trial court dismissed her case as a matter of law. The case was appealed and decided in 1976 by the California Supreme Court.
