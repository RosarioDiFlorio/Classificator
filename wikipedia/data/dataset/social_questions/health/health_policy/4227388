The Ministry of the Interior and Health (Danish: Indenrigs- og Sundhedsministeriet) is a former Danish ministry that has existed twice in the 21st century by combination of existing ministries.
The Ministry of Interior and Health was first created in 2001 under the first government of Anders Fogh Rasmussen, by combining the Ministry of the Interior (Indenrigsministeriet) and the Ministry of Health (Sundhedsministeriet). The minister was Lars Løkke Rasmussen and the permanent secretary Ib Valsborg, succeeded in 2005 by Christian Schønau. The ministry carried out a far-reaching consolidation of municipalities. After the 2007 Folketing elections, the ministry was disbanded, and its areas of responsibility divided between two newly created ministries, the Ministry of Welfare and the Ministry of Health and Prevention.
The ministry was recreated in February 2010 under Rasmussen's first government as Prime Minister, with the minister being Bertel Haarder and the permanent secretary Kristian Wendelboe. In October 2011 the Rasmussen government was succeeded by that of Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and the ministry's functions were again divided, between the Ministry of the Economy and the Interior (Økonomi- og Indenrigsministeriet) and a newly created Ministry of Health and Development (Ministeriet for Sundhed og Forebyggelse).
