The Health Center Consolidation Act of 1996 in the United States is commonly also called Section 330. The Act brings together various funding mechanisms for the country's community health facilities, such as migrant/seasonal farmworker health centers, healthcare for the homeless, health centers and health centers for residents of public housing. Previously, each of these organizations were provided grants under numerous other mechanisms.
