Persons who are disadvantaged with reduced mobility (PRM) requesting to travel by way of public transport via air, land, sea or space as potential passengers, should have equal opportunities to travel as ordinary citizens. this means no such individual can be discriminated against by companies operating as travel providers. These companies are compelled to provide and install sufficient facilities to enable PRM's to enjoy similar comforts as enjoyed by ordinary passengers (within reason).
In European union countries and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries), this is mandatory under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, with any breaches covered by compensation regulation (EC) No 261/2004.
In the United Kingdom this is backed up by Civil Aviation (Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility) Regulations 2007.
