The Student Health Action Coalition (SHAC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the oldest student-run free clinic in the United States. It is run entirely by student volunteers from the Schools of Social Work, Public Health, Physical Therapy, Pharmacy, Nursing, Medicine, and Dentistry. The students, under the supervision of UNC doctors and professors, combine their skills to hold weekly dental and health clinics, provide rapid HIV testing services, and create sustainable community health promotion programs.
