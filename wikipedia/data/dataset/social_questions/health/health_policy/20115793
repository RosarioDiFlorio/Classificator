The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice (TDI) is an organization within Dartmouth College "dedicated to improving health care through education, research, policy reform, leadership improvement, and communication with patients and the public." It was founded in 1988 by John Wennberg as the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences (CECS); a reorganization in 2007 led to TDI's current structure. Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, MD, MPH, was named Director of The Dartmouth Institute on 1 April 2013. An internationally recognized leader in health services research and health policy, Dr. Fisher is the James W. Squire Professor of Medicine and Community and Family Medicine at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. He is also the co-director of the Dartmouth Atlas for Health Care. Dr. Fisher is a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences. 
The institute provides a graduate-level education program involving elements of both Dartmouth's Graduate Arts and Sciences Programs and the Geisel School of Medicine. It grants Masters in Public Health degrees as well as Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Health Policy and Clinical Science degrees. The institute is located at One Medical Center Drive, WTRB, Level 5 on the Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital campus, Lebanon, NH. The institute's largest policy product is the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, which documents unwarranted variation in the American health care system.
