The Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established in 1867 to support the Contagious Diseases Acts that were passed by the British Parliament in 1864. The acts legalized prostitution and put the women involved under police and medical control. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.
The supporters of the acts were opposed by the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, which was led by Elizabeth Wolstenholme and Josephine Butler.
