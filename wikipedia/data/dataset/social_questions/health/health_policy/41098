Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into two types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, based on the capability of a single photon with more than 10 eV energy to ionize oxygen or break chemical bonds. Ultraviolet and higher frequencies, such as X-rays or gamma rays are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see radiation and radiation poisoning. The electric currents that flow through power sockets have associated line-frequency electromagnetic fields. By far the most common health hazard of radiation is sunburn, which causes over one million new skin cancers annually.
