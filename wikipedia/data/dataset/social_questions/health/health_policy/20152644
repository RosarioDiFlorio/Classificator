Business Disability Forum (BDF) is the UK’s national employers’ network specifically focused on the topic of disability. It was previously known as the Employers' Forum on Disability (EFD), and officially became Business Disability Forum on 1 October 2012. This was done to better reflect the role of the group as a bridge between disabled people and the world of business.
The organisation has about 350 members, including 100 multinational corporations, small and medium sized enterprises and public sector employers, employ approximately 18 per cent of the UK workforce. Members include employers from banking, education, health, broadcasting, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail sectors.
The organisation provides a wide range of products and services for business including recruitment and retention of disabled employees, services to disabled customers and development of partnerships with disabled people as stakeholders in the wider community.
Membership benefits includes a Helpline, offering expert information on all aspects of disability, a connection service helping members to resolve potential Equality Act 2010 claims, member policy audits and a wide range of events and publications.
Business Disability Forum also operate a management tool called the Disability Standard that enables organisations to accurately measure their performance on disability across the whole business and put in place an action plan to address priority areas.
