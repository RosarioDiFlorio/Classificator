Patient navigators educate and assist United States citizens in enrolling into health benefit plans stipulated in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Patient navigators are also called “insurance navigators” or “in-person assisters” who have defined roles under the ACA. Although their roles might overlap, patient navigators are not community health workers or health advocates. “Navigators” work in states with Federally-Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) or State Partnership Exchanges.
Under the ACA, a health insurance marketplace, or exchange, is required to develop and fund a patient navigator program. The patient navigator’s primary role, as defined in section 1311, is to educate the public on information about health care plans, to facilitate enrollment into health plans, and provide information for tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. The education and information provided by patient navigators must be culturally and linguistically appropriate and provided in a fair and impartial manner. Patient navigators are required to meet standards and core proficiencies established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
