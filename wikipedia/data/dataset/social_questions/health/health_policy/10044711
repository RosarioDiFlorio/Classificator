Jonathan's Law, a New York statute co-sponsored by Harvey Weisenberg signed into law in May 2007, by governor Eliot Spitzer, entitles parents and legal guardians access to all child abuse investigation files and medical history records.
The legislative measure is intended to hold residential mental health facilities accountable by requiring notification of guardians in cases of ill treatment, and requires written reports of ensuing investigations. Jonathan's Law was sponsored by Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg (D–Long Beach) and State Sen. Thomas P. Morahan (R–New City); Mike and Lisa Carey, the parents of Jonathan Carey, promoted Jonathan's Law. Jonathan Carey, who had severe autism, was abused and neglected at school and later killed by a direct care worker.
