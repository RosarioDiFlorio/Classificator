The United States Medical Licensing Examination score (USMLE score) is given to test takers as a 3-digit score. This score is commonly used by hospitals to determine eligibility for residency and fellowship. The three-digit score is based on a theoretical maximum of 300, but this has not been documented by the NBME / FSMB. Previously, a 2 digit score was also provided, but has since been eliminated. The two-digit score was normalized to the three-digit score such that a 75 was equal to the minimum passing score (currently 192) for the USMLE Step 1. Contrary to popular opinion, the two-digit score does not represent a percentile.
