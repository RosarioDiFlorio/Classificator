The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (in German: Bundesinstitut f√ºr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte - BfArM) is a medical regulatory body in Germany.
It operates under the Federal Ministry of Health. It is headquartered in Bonn.
BfArM announced that it will accept pure electronic filings (eCTD or NeeS) from mid-February 2010 (previously a full paper copy was required). Only those documents requiring signature will be required in paper.
