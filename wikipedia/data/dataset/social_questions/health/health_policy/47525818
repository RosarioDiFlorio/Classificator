Right-to-try laws are U.S. state laws that were created to let terminally ill patients try experimental therapies (drugs, biologics, devices) that have completed Phase 1 testing but have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These laws' value has been called into question on multiple grounds, including the fact that they do not require pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide the therapies that patients are seeking.
