The National Health Act 1953 is an Act of the Parliament of Australia. Its long title describes it as "relating to the provision of pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, and of medical and dental services". The Act was passed in 1953 in the Fifth Cabinet under the Prime Ministership of Robert Menzies. Its "chief architect" was the then Minister for Health, Earle Page.
As of 2014 provisions in the Act relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are still part of Australian law.
