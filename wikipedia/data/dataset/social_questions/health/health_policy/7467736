It seeks to simplify and harmonize the administrative provisions governing clinical trials in the European Community, by establishing a clear, transparent procedure.
The Member States of the European Union had to adopt and publish before 1 May 2003 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. The Member States had to apply these provisions at the latest with effect from 1 May 2004.
