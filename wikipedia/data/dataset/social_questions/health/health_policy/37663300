Cover Oregon was the health insurance marketplace for the U.S. state of Oregon, established as Oregon's implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Cover Oregon was intended to enable Oregonians and small businesses to purchase health insurance at federally subsidized rates.
While the intent was to allow registration and selection of coverage via a website, the site was plagued with problems and it was only possible to purchase insurance via paper registration. As of January 2014, almost $200 million of the $300 million allocated to develop and operate the Cover Oregon website had been spent.
As a result of the ongoing problems, in April 2014, the board of directors voted to close the state-run exchange and adopt the Federal HealthCare.gov exchange beginning in 2015. The FBI began investigating the failed development of the website in March 2014.
In March 2015, the state officially abolished Cover Oregon, permanently folding its functions into an existing state agency and the federal HealthCare.gov website.
