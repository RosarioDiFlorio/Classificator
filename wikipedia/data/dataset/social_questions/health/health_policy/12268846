First Databank, Inc. (FDB), a subsidiary of Hearst Communications, is a publisher of pharmaceutical information that is used within healthcare information systems serving hospitals, physician practices, other providers, payers, retail pharmacies, state health programs and others for the purpose of medication decision support and negotiating reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies and other providers.[1]
First Databank describes itself as "the leading provider of context-relevant, integrated drug database products." The firm creates and maintains widely used drug database products, software for drug database integration, and drug reference products. The firm has partnered with other developers of drug information systems to make drug data useful for a wide range of drug delivery system users. The firm's software supports pharmacy dispensing, formulary management, drug pricing analysis, medical insurance claims processing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR), electronic prescribing (e-Prescribing) and electronic medication administration records (EMAR).
First Databank influences the incidence of medication errors and adverse events associated with prescription drugs that affect healthcare costs and the overall quality of patient care. As it transitions away from publishing drug price databases, First Databank is poised for entry into areas such as electronic prescribing and electronic health records.
