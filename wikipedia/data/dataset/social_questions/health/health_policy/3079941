The Court of Protection in English law is a superior court of record created under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. It has jurisdiction over the property, financial affairs and personal welfare of people who lack mental capacity to make decisions for themselves.
The Court of Protection has been called the United Kingdom's "most secret court" as the cases are typically closed to the public.
