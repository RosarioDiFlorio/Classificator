The International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) is a standardized method for categorizing childhood malignancies set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO). This system bases malignancy classification on the histological traits of the tumor (type of tissue). This is opposed to the classification of adult malignancies, which are categorized according to the primary tumor site. The latest iteration of the ICCC is ICD-O-3/WHO 2008, which was updated to reflect hematopoietic codes.
The ICCC is made up of 12 categories:
Leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, and myelodysplastic diseases
Lymphomas and reticuloendothelial neoplasms
CNS and miscellaneous intracranial and intraspinal neoplasms
Neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous cell tumors
Retinoblastoma
Renal tumors
Hepatic tumors
Malignant bone tumors
Soft tissue and other extraosseous sarcomas
Germ cell tumors, trophoblastic tumors, and neoplasms of gonads
Other malignant epithelial neoplasms and malignant melanomas
Other and unspecified malignant neoplasms
