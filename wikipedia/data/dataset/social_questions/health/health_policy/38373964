The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (Urdu: پاکستان طبی و دندان سازی انجمن‎‎, abbreviated as PMDC) is a statutory regulatory authority under the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation & Coordination that maintains the official register of medical practitioners within Pakistan. Its chief function is to "establish uniform minimum standard of basic and higher qualifications in medicine and dentistry throughout Pakistan" by controlling entry to the PMDC register, and suspending or removing members when necessary. It also sets the education standards for medical schools in Pakistan along with the Higher Education Commission.
