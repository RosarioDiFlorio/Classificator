The Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC), established by an Act of Parliament in 1963, is the national certification body for the profession of pharmacy in Canada. It currently assesses the qualifications of 2 pharmacy professional candidates seeking licensure - pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, on behalf the pharmacy regulatory authorities (PRAs) of all provinces except Quebec, and the Certificate of Qualification issued by the PEBC is a requirement to license in all provinces except Quebec. In Quebec, the Ordre des pharmaciens du Quebec conducts its own assessments of qualifications of applicants seeking licensure as a pharmacist.
