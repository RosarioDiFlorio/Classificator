A sly grog shop (or shanty) is an Australian term for an unlicensed hotel or liquor-store, often with the added suggestion of selling poor-quality liquor; a place where alcoholic beverages are sold by an unlicensed vendor.
The Australian slang term 'sly-grog' combines two older English slang terms:
(1) 'on the sly', meaning "in a secret, clandestine, or covert manner, without publicity or openness".  James Hardy Vauxâ€™s Vocabulary of the Flash Language (1812) defined the term 'upon the sly': "Any business transacted, or intimation given, privately, or under the rose, is said to be done upon the sly".
(2) 'grog', a Naval term originally referring to a rum and water mixture.  In the Australian context 'grog' was used to describe diluted, adulterated and sub-standard rum.  In the early decades of the Australian colonies 'grog' was often the only alcoholic beverage available to the working classes.  Eventually in Australia the word 'grog' came to be used as a slang term for any alcoholic beverage.
The term 'sly-grog' evolved into general usage in Australia during the 1820s.  An early reference comes from the Hobart Town Gazette of 18 March 1825: "We therefore felt convinced that in the sequel they would altogether decline applying for licenses, whilst many of them would become sly grog-men to the manifest injury of Government".
