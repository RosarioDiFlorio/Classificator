Open defecation (OD) is the human practice of defecating outsideâ€”in the open. In lieu of toilets, people use fields, bushes, forests, open bodies of water or other open space. The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure is not available. About 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, practice open defecation.
The term 'open defecation' is used in literature about water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). OD can pollute the environment and cause health problems. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality, poor nutrition, poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor.
Ending OD is an indicator being used to measure progress toward the sustainable development goals. Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating OD is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty.
People may prefer open defecation based on traditional cultural practices or lack of access to toilets, or both. Even if toilets are available, behaviour change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets.
