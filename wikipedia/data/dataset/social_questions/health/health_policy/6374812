In higher education, health promotion programs work to support student success by creating healthy learning environments. Health promotion professionals practice prevention to expand protective factors and reduce personal and community health risk factors, utilizing a public health/population health model. Health promotion services often coordinate primary prevention and secondary prevention on campus, operating as a functional area of College Health or Student Affairs. Sub-specialties include education on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, sexual health, nutrition, stress management, healthy lifestyles, chronic disease prevention and peer health education.
