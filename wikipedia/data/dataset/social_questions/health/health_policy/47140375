The UK Medical Act 1876 (39 and 40 Vict, Ch. 41) was an act which repealed the previous Medical Act in the United Kingdom and allowed all British medical authorities to license all qualified applicants whatever their gender. It was introduced by Parliament member Russell Gurney. The Act obtained the queen's assent and became law despite Queen Victoria's strong private objections to women's medical training.
