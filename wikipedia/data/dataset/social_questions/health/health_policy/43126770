The Improving Trauma Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 3548; Pub.L. 113â€“152) is a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act, with respect to trauma care and research programs, to include in the definition of "trauma" an injury resulting from extrinsic agents other than mechanical force, including those that are thermal, electrical, chemical, or radioactive.
The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Similar legislation, S. 2406, was introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI).
