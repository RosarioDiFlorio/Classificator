Universal health care, (also referred to as universal health coverage, universal coverage, universal care or socialized health care) usually refers to a health care system that provides health care and financial protection to all citizens of a particular country. It is organized around providing a specified package of benefits to all members of a society with the end goal of providing financial risk protection, improved access to health services, and improved health outcomes. Universal health care is not one-size-fits-all and does not imply coverage for all people for everything. Universal health care can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered. It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship. The Director General of WHO describes universal health coverage as the “single most powerful concept that public health has to offer” since it unifies “services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way”. United Nations member states have agreed to work toward worldwide universal health coverage by 2030. One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy an attainable level of health.
