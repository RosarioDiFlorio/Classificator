The Monthly Index of Medical Specialities Ireland (MIMS Ireland) is a well-established prescribing guide delivered to medical practitioners in Ireland. It was founded by Dr John O'Connell, who came up with the concept of a small, concise medical guide that was to become MIMS. MIMS Ireland is used by the Irish Medicines Board to convey information on drug safety, and is recommended by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) as part of the premises requirements for pharmacies. It is also listed as a reference for the use of drugs in sports by the Irish Sports Council.
Reed Business Information sold MIMS Ireland to Metropolis International in 2009. MIMS Ireland celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010. Former editors include John O'Connell, Andrea Leotha, Arlene Cock and Marie-Catherine Mousseau.
