A risk panel is a body that determines whether a person's mental illness causes them to be too much of a risk to society to be released from involuntary commitment. In the United States, the members of a risk panel may consist of medical officers appointed by the warden or superintendent of an institution, the U.S. Attorney General, and the United States Public Health Service. The Food and Drug Administration also has a risk panel, a 15-member advisory panel to educate consumers about the risks and benefits of drugs, devices and vaccines.
