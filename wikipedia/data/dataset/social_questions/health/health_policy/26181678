The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes). Approximately 22,000 health care practitioners, educators, and researchers use Omaha System to improve clinical practice, structure documentation, and analyze secondary data. Omaha System users from Canada, China, The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Turkey, the United States, and Wales, have presented at Omaha System International Conferences.
The Omaha System is integrated into the National Library of Medicine's Metathesaurus, CINAHL, ABC Codes, NIDSEC, Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC), and SNOMED CT. It is registered (recognized) by Health Level Seven (HL7), and is congruent with the reference terminology model for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).The Omaha System has the ability to code the majority of the problems and interventions from the hospital record.
