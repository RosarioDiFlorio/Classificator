The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (Russian: Министерство здравоохранения Российской Федерации, in short Russian: Минздрав России Minzdrav Rossii) is an agency of the government of Russia, headquartered in Moscow. It is the successor of the former Ministry of Health and Social Development, which was split in two in 2012 under Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, with the social security departments being relegated to the newly formed Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Since then, Veronika Skvortsova has been the minister.
