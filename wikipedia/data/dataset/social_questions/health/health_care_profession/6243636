The Orgasmatron is a manually operated head massage device made of partially flexible copper wires attached to the handle. The device has been specifically designed to gently massage the head and the back of the neck.
It is made by an Australian company of the same name. The device is sold in the United States under the name Happy's Head Trip.
The Orgasmatron was designed by Dwayne Lacey, who registered the design in 1998. Since it was first brought to market, several similar devices appeared, resulting in legal action from Lacey.
According to The Guardian, the device induces "an eye-lash-fluttering state of bliss".
