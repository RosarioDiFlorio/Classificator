Assisting in activities of daily living (ADL) are skills required in nursing and other professions such as nursing assistants.
Personal assistance is waged support of 20 or more hours a week for people with impairments. A 2008 review reported that personal assistance is possibly beneficial to some older people and their informal carers. Further research is needed to assess which models of personal assistant are more efficient, as well as their relative total costs.
