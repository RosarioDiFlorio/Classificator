Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a non-profit organization operating in the United States which arranges for home visits from registered nurses to low-income first-time mothers. The visits begin during pregnancy and continue for two years following birth. NFP intervention has been associated with improvements in maternal health, child health, and economic security.
