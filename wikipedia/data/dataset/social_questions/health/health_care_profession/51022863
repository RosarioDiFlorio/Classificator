A death midwife, or death doula, is a person who assists in the dying process, much like a midwife or doula does with the birthing process. It is "a community centered response that recognizes death as a natural, accepted, and honored part of life. One might say that death midwifery is to hospice palliative care [...] as birth midwifery is to obstetrics." Practitioners "can help create death plans, some provide spiritual care, psychological and social support, and sometimes even physical care. They can help plan home vigils and home funerals, and offer guidance with respect to what your rights and responsibilities are in caring for someone who's died."
