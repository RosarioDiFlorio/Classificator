Postural restoration is a posture based integrative treatment approach to physical medicine. It includes the science of postural adaptations, the influence of the respiratory system and polyarticular chains of muscle, and asymmetrical patterns. Treatment aims to maximize neutrality in the body through manual and non-manual exercise techniques designed to reposition, retrain, and restore these asymmetrical patterned positions. It is used by some physical therapy and athletic trainers. There is little quality evidence on its usefulness in any health condition.
