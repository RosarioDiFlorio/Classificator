A bonesetter is a practitioner of joint manipulation. Before the advent of chiropractors, osteopaths, and physical therapists, bonesetters were the main providers of this type of treatment. Traditionally, they practiced without any sort of formal training in accepted medical procedures. Bonesetters would also reduce joint dislocations and "re-set" bone fractures.
