Not to be confused with Clinical ecology (sometimes also called "environmental medicine").
Environmental medicine is a multidisciplinary field involving medicine, environmental science, chemistry and others, overlapping with environmental pathology. It may be viewed as the medical branch of the broader field of environmental health. The scope of this field involves studying the interactions between environment and human health, and the role of the environment in causing or mediating disease. As a specialist field of study it is looked upon with mixed feelings by physicians and politicians alike, for the basic assumption is that health is more widely and dramatically affected by environmental toxins than previously recognized.
Environmental factors in the causation of environmental diseases can be classified into:
Physical
Chemical
Biological
Social (including Psychological and Culture variables)
Ergonomic
Safety
Any combination of the above
In the United States, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OCOEM) oversees board certification of physicians in environmental (and occupational) medicine. This board certification is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
