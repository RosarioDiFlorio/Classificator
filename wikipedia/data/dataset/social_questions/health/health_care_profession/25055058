Companion shadow is a term used in describing radiographs that denotes the appearance of a smooth, homogenous, radiodensity with a well-defined margin that runs parallel with a bony landmark. Companion shadows represent soft tissue that overlies the respective bony landmark in profile. They are not seen in every radiograph and can be misinterpreted as pathology.
