In case of a previous Caesarean section a subsequent pregnancy can be planned beforehand to be delivered by either of the following two main methods:
Vaginal birth after Caesarean section (VBAC)
Elective repeat Caesarean section (ERCS)
Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which affect the decision for planned vaginal or planned abdominal delivery. There is a slightly higher risk for uterine rupture and perinatal death of the child with VBAC than ERCS, but the absolute increased risk of these complications is small, especially with only one previous low transverse caesarean section. 60â€“80% of women planning VBAC will achieve a successful vaginal delivery, although there are more risks to the mother and baby from an unplanned caesarean section than from an ERCS. Successful VBAC also reduces the risk of complications in future pregnancies than ERCS.
