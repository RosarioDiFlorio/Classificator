G-arm medical imaging systems are based on fluoroscopic X-ray and are used for a variety of diagnostic imaging and minimally invasive surgical procedures. The name is derived from the G-shaped arm used to connect two X-ray generators and two X-ray detectors, image intensifiers or digital flat panel detectors, to one another. The main advantage of the G-arm, compared to a conventional C-arm system, is that it combines a pair of X-ray chains facilitating simultaneous views in two perpendicular planes, also called G-arm imaging.
