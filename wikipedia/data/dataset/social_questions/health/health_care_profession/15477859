Myotherapy (particularly Bonnie Prudden myotherapy) is a form of manual therapy which focuses on the assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal pain and associated pathologies. The term myotherapy was originally coined by Bonnie Prudden to describe a specific type of trigger point therapy which she developed in the 1970s based on the earlier work of Travell and Simons who researched the cause and treatment of pain arising from myofascial trigger points. While based on rational principles, there is little scientific research regarding the efficacy of this therapy, so it remains controversial within the medical and academic disciples. 

Over the ensuing 40 years, myotherapy has evolved to become an allied health discipline which is practiced in many countries across the world including UK, Australia, USA, Canada, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong.
Myotherapy incorporates trigger point therapy and a wide range of soft tissue massage and manipulation including: muscle energy technique, dry needling, and joint mobilization. Myotherapists also use stretching, nutritional advice, exercise prescription, postural advice and education, heat and cold therapy, ultrasound and TENS.
