An informal or primary caregiver is an individual in a cancer patient's life that provides unpaid assistance and cancer-related care. Due to the typically late onset of cancer, caregivers are often the spouses and/or children of patients, but may also be parents, other family members, or close friends. Informal caregivers are a major form of support for the cancer patient because they provide most care outside of the hospital environment. This support includes:
Physical support: management of side effects and late effects of treatment  and assistance with personal tasks such as bathing.
Emotional support 
Financial assistance: helping cover the expenses associated with cancer treatment 
Practical assistance: treatment monitoring, assistance with decision making and assistance with non-personal tasks such as grocery shopping
Spiritual support
