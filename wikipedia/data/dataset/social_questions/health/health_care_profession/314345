A plantar wart is a wart occurring on the bottom of the foot or toes. Their color is typically similar to that of the skin. Small black dots may occur on the surface. One or more may occur in an area. They may result in pain with pressure such that walking is difficult.
They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). A break in the skin is required for infection to occur. Risk factors include use of communal showers, having had prior warts, and poor immune function. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.
Treatment is only needed if it is causing symptoms. This may include salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or surgical removal. The skin overtop the lesion should generally be removed before treatment. In about a third to two thirds of cases they go away without specific treatment, however this may take a couple of years. Plantar warts are common. Children and young adults are most often affected.
