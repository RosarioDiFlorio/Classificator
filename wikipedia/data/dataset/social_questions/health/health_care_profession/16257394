Laboratory Unit for Computer Assisted Surgery (LUCAS) is a system used for virtual surgical planning. Starting with 1998, LUCAS was developed at the University of Regensburg, Germany, with the support of the Carl Zeiss Company. The resulting surgical planning is then reproduced onto the patient by using a navigation system. In fact, LUCAS is integrated into the same platform together with the Surgical Segment Navigator (SSN), the Surgical Tool Navigator (STN), the Surgical Microscope Navigator (SMN) and the 6DOF Manipulator (or, in German, "Mehrkoordinatenmanipulator" - MKM), also from the Carl Zeiss Company.
