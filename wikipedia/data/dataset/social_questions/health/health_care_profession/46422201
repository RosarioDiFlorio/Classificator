A racal suit (also known as racal space suit) is a protective suit with powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). It consists of a plastic suit and a battery-operated blower with HEPA filters that supplied filtered air to a positive-pressure hood (also known as racal hood). Racal suits were among the protective suits used by Aeromedical Isolation Team (AIT) to evacuate patients with highly infectious diseases for treatment.
