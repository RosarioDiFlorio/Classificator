The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists (SCP) is the professional association and trade union for registered chiropodists and podiatrists in the United Kingdom. The charitable subsidiary of the organisation is the College of Podiatry which was formed in 2012.
The union originated in 1912 as the Society of Chiropodists, the first organisation of chiropodists in Europe. In 1916, it was renamed the Incorporated Society of Chiropodists, and in 1919, it established examinations for potential new members. Several rival organisations emerged: the Northern Association of Chiropodists, the Chelsea Chiropodists Association and the British Association of Chiropodists. These merged with the Incorporated Society in 1945, the new body once more taking the name Society of Chiropodists. It was recognised as a negotiating body by the National Health Service in 1948, but did not register as a trade union until 1978. In 1993, it took its current name, recognising the membership of podiatrists, and in 1997, it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. In 1998, the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers and the Podiatry Association both merged with the society.
