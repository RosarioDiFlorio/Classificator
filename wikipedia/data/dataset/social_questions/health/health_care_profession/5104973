Advanced Emergency Medical Technician - Critical Care (EMT-CC) is an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) certification unique to New York. The curriculum for AEMT-CC's in New York is similar to that of the national standard EMT-I/99 (EMT-Intermediate - I/99) but with a broader scope of practice. EMT-CCs are fully classified as Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers within New York and are trained in advanced airway management, including intubation, IV fluid administration, cardiac monitoring, cardiac pacing, and both synchronized and unsynchronized cardioversion, and medication usage/administration in adult and pediatric patients.
In New York, AEMT-CC's are also called "Level III" providers as New York recognizes four levels of Emergency Medical providers: EMT-Basic, EMT-Advanced, AEMT-Critical Care, and EMT-Paramedic.
New York State will no longer offer new AEMT-CC certifications starting January, 2018.
