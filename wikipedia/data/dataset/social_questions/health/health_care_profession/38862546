Stan Tatkin is the founder of the PACT Training Institute and the developer of PACT—A Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy. PACT is an integration of neuroscience, arousal regulation, and attachment theory. This therapy modality centers on early attachment and its effect on the development of the brain and the nervous system. Also, PACT encourages couples to participate in secure-functioning relationships, even if the individuals themselves do not have secure attachment.
Tatkin is the author of Wired for Dating: How Understanding Neurobiology and Attachment Style Can Help You Find Your Ideal Mate, Wired for Love: How Understanding Your Partner’s Brain and Attachment Style Can Help You Defuse Conflict and Build a Secure Relationship, and Your Brain on Love: The Neurobiology of Healthy Relationships, as well as the co-author with Marion Soloman of Love and War in Intimate Relationships: Connection, Disconnection, and Mutual Regulation in Couple Therapy. He has a private practice in Calabasas, California, and works as an assistant professor at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine. Tatkin also teaches and supervises first-year family medicine residents at Kaiser Permanente, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.
