Subjective Refraction is an attempt to determine, by trial and error using the patientâ€™s cooperation, the combination of lenses that will provide the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). It is a clinical examination used by orthoptists, optometrists and ophthalmologists to determine a patient's need for refractive correction, in the form of glasses or contact lenses.
The aim is to improve current unaided vision or vision with current glasses.
