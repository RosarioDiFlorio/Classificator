The World Council of Optometry (WCO) is a membership organization for the development of optometry (eye care) internationally.
The WCO is the first and only optometric organization to have official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO). It represents 250,000 optometrists from 75 member organizations in over 40 countries. The WCO organizes the World Congress of Optometry.
In 2015, the WCO relocated to the American Optometric Association (AOA) headquarters in St Louis, Missouri, United States.
