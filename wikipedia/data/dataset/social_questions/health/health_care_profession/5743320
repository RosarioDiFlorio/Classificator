A bathroom attendant, restroom attendant, toilet attendant, or washroom attendant, is a cleaner for a public toilet. They maintain and clean the facilities, ensuring that toilet paper, soap, paper towels, and other necessary items are kept stocked. If there is a fee to use the restroom, it is collected by the attendant if there is no coin-operated turnstile or door.
Some restroom attendants also provide services to the patrons, and keep good order by preventing drug-taking and fights.
