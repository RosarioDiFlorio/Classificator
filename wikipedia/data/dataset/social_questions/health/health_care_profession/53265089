Integrated Movement Therapy (IMT) is an individual and group therapy approach that combines speech-language pathology, behavioural and mental health counseling with the practices and principles of yoga. Integrated Movement Therapy has several elements in common with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, including a focus on changing thoughts to change behaviours, and an emphasis on social learning theory, as well as with Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, which includes an exploration of Eastern contemplative traditions. However, IMT is most aligned with Integrated Psychotherapy, in which the inherent value of each person, as well as the person’s multi-dimensionality (including physical body, energy, emotions and spiritual connection), is the foundation of the therapy. IMT also uses yoga’s philosophical, physical and spiritual framework in conjunction with conventional neurophysiological perspectives to address many issues from depression and anxiety to degenerative conditions and life-threatening illness.
