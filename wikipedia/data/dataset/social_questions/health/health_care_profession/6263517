In the United Kingdom, a staff grade doctor is one who is appointed to a permanent position as a middle grade doctor. Doctors may have been appointed to this position based on experience and not all doctors will have done postgraduate examinations to reach this position. In the past Staff grades could be promoted to Associate Specialist after several years of service. They may also apply to take up specialist registrar training posts if they wish to become consultants or gain access to consultant posts through the GMC CESR Route which allows them to be registered on the specialist register after assessment of their experience. In order for a doctor to work as a staff grade must have at least 6 years' experience, their main duties are:
Ward rounds for inpatients.
Two half-day or one full-day operating list per week.
One or two outpatients clinics per week.
Supervision of some junior trainees.
On call as per rota.
Review of some emergency referrals.
Emergency operating (when on call)
These are some of the basic duties of a staff grade doctor, the duties and the reviews are always done in the name of a consultant in whom they are answerable and always should ask the consultant for help or advice for problems, cases or operations beyond their experience or particularly complicated.
The staff grade was closed to new entrants from 1 April 2008 when many in this grade moved to the new 'Specialty Doctor' grade. This move was optional and some Staff Grades remain in post.
