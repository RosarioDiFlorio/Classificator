Mass gathering medicine, also known as event medicine or crowd medicine, is a field of medicine that explores the health effects/risks of mass gatherings and the strategies that contribute positively to effective health services delivery during these events. The reason for the development of the field of medicine gives the fact that mass gatherings generate a higher incidence of injury and illness, may be the subject to a catastrophic accident or attack with large numbers of injured or dead persons.
Mass Gathering Medicine is viewed as a niche field of prehospital care in emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia.
Among factors influencing on the demand for the health care at mass gatherings  are:
the weather,
duration of the event,
if the crowd moves,
containment of the event (fenced/contained or not),
availability of alcohol/drugs,
the density of the crowd et al.,
possibility for spreading of communicable diseases 
Key purposes of Mass Gathering Medical Services at an event are:
rapid access to the injured or ill patients,
