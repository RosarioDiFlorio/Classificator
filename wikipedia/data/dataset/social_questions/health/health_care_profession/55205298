Mean glandular dose (MGD) is a quantity used to describe the absorbed dose to the breast in mammography. It is based on a measurement of air kerma and conversion factors. MGD can be calculated from measurements made with PMMA blocks. It is often used to compare typical doses to patients between different centres or internationally, and is the preferred measure of the potential risk from mammography.
