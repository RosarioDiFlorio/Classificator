Occupational medicine, especially until 1960 called industrial medicine, is the branch of medicine which deals with the maintenance of health in the workplace, including the prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries, and also promotes productivity and social adjustment.
It is thus the branch of clinical medicine most active in the field of occupational health and safety. OM specialists work to ensure that the highest standards of occupational health and safety can be achieved and maintained. While OM may involve a wide number of disciplines, it centers on preventive medicine and the management of illness, injury, and disability related to the workplace. Occupational physicians must have a wide knowledge of clinical medicine and be competent in a number of important areas. They often advise international bodies, governmental and state agencies, organizations and trade unions. There are contextual links to physical medicine and rehabilitation and to insurance medicine.
