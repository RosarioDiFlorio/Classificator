The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) is a national Emergency medical services professional association representing all EMTs and Paramedics. The NAEMT educational programs also have an international scope.
The mission statement of NAEMT (from their web site) "is to represent and serve emergency medical services personnel through advocacy, educational programs and research." Founded in 1975, the association is composed of multiple committees.
Three unique educational programs are offered by the NAEMT. These short courses consist of several lectures, as well as teaching and evaluation stations, over two days, for a total of 16 hours of training.
