A first responder is a person who is among the first people to arrive at and assist at the scene of an emergency such as an accident, natural disaster, or terrorist attack and has received training for this. First responders typically include police officers, firefighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, rescuers, deputy sheriffs and others who have joined voluntary organisations connected with this type of work. A certified first responder is one who has received certification to provide pre-hospital care in a certain jurisdiction, for example, the Certified First Responder in France. A community first responder is a person dispatched to attend medical emergencies until an ambulance arrives. A wilderness first responder is trained to provide pre-hospital care in remote settings and will therefore have skills in ad hoc patient packaging and transport by non-motorized means.
