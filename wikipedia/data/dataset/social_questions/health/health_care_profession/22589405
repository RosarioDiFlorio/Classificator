Scaption is an abbreviation for Scapular Plane Elevation. The term does not denote whether the elevation is with an internal, external or neutral rotation. The term is widely used in sports training, occupational therapy, and physical therapy.
The term was first made public in a 1991 publication of the American Journal of Sports Medicine. The origins for the word are rather practical: Marilyn Pink was asked to give a lecture at the Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons on a research project she was conducting. Due to a strict clocking of presentation time, she was forced to shorten a phrase that appeared often in her lecture: "Scapular Plane Elevation". Her colleague and friend, Jacquelin Perry, suggested she simply convert the phrase to "scaption", thus coining the word.
