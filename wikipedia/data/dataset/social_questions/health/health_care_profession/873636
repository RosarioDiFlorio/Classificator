In 1995, it opened an additional campus in Glendale, Arizona, becoming the second medical school to teach students in the state of Arizona. MWU has since expanded beyond solely providing medical education and now operates ten colleges, offering degrees in dentistry, pharmacy, optometry, podiatric medicine, and other health professions. According to U.S. News & World Report (2015), Midwestern University's Downers Grove, IL and Glendale AZ campuses had two of the top physician assistant programs (tied #20) in the country.
