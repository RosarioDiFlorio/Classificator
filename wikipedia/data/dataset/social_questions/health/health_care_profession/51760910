The Graduate Nurse (GN) is a nurse who has completed his or her academic studies but completed the requirements to become a Registered Nurse (RN). Depending on the country, state, province or similar licensing body, the graduate nurse may be granted provisional nursing licensure. A Graduate nurse has not yet passed the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) to become a Registered Nurse (RN).
In the US, the Graduate nurse can practice nursing under a Registered nurse. To practice as a Graduate nurse, he or she must have been authorized by the examination provider to sit for the licensured examination and have been provided documentation for their eligibility to take the examination. Those who have been recognized and approved by the State board of Nursing may use the "G.N." status as part of their identification. In Canada and Texas, a student who has successfully completed his or her nursing education can obtain a distinct licensure as a Graduate Nurse (GN). This designation remains until the GN successfully passes the RN examinination.
