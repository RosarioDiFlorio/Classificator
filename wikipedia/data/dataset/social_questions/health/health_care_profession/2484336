Lubberts' effect is the non-uniform response of an imaging system to x-rays that are absorbed at different depths within the input phosphor. It indicates an input phosphor depth-dependent response of the imaging system. It is named for G. Lubberts, who published a report of it in 1968 while working at Kodak. The Lubberts' effect is related to the Swank effect.
