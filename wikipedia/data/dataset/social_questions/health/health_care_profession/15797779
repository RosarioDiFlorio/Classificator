Advanced Emergency Medical Technician (AEMT) is a mid-level provider of prehospital emergency medical services in the United States; a transition to this level of training from the Emergency Medical Technician-Intermediate (EMT-I), which had somewhat less training, began in 2013 and has been implemented by most states at this point. The AEMT is not intended to deliver definitive medical care in most cases, but rather to augment prehospital critical care and provide rapid on-scene treatment. AEMTs are most usually employed in ambulance services, working in conjunction with EMTs and Paramedics, however are also commonly found in fire departments as non-transporting first responders. The AEMT is authorized to provide advanced life support, which is beyond the scope of an EMT.
