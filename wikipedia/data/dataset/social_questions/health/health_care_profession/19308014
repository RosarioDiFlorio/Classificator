The Society for Healthcare Strategy and Market Development (SHSMD) is a U.S.-based professional association and group associated with the American Hospital Association. SHSMD members represent healthcare-specific disciplines such as marketing, communications, public relations, strategic planning, business development, physician relations, sales, and government and public affairs. SHSMD has more than 4,500 members nationally from hospitals, healthcare systems/networks and consulting firms. According to its website, it was formed from the merger of The American Society for Health Care Marketing and Public Relations (founded in 1964) and the Society for Healthcare Planning and Marketing (founded in 1977) in 1996. Regional chapters criss-cross the country and are represented in every state, often with their own conferences.
