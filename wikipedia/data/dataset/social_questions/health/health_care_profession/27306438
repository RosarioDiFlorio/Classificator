Retained placenta is a condition in which all or part of the placenta or membranes remain in the uterus during the third stage of labour.  Retained placenta can be broadly divided into:
failed separation of the placenta from the uterine lining
placenta separated from the uterine lining but retained within the uterus
A retained placenta is commonly a cause of postpartum haemorrhage, both primary and secondary.
