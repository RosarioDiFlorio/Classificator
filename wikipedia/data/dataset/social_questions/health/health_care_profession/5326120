Jin Shin Do ("The Way of the Compassionate Spirit") is a therapeutic acupressure technique developed by psychotherapist Iona Marsaa Teeguarden, beginning in the 1970s.
Jin Shin Do classes teach the use of gentle yet deep finger pressure on specific acu-points and verbal Body Focusing techniques.
This clothes-on method is a unique synthesis of a traditional Japanese acupressure technique, classic Chinese acupuncture and acupressure theory, Taoist philosophy, Qigong (breathing and exercise techniques), Reichian segmental theory and principles of Ericksonian psychotherapy. Jin Shin Do is recognized as a major form of Asian Bodywork Therapy by AOBTA, NCBTMB, NCCAOM, and the U.S. Department of Education among others.
