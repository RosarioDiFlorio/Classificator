For the more current term, see Emergency medical responder

A certified first responder (Also called an Emergency Medical Responder, Emergency First Responder, Medical First Responder, or First Responder) is a person who has completed a course and received certification in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies. Certified individuals should have received much more instruction than someone who is trained in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but they are not necessarily a substitute for more advanced emergency medical care rendered by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. First responders typically provide advanced first aid level care, CPR, and automated external defibrillator (AED) usage. The term "certified first responder" is not to be confused with "first responder", which is a generic term referring to the first medically trained responder to arrive on scene (police, fire, EMS). Many police officers and firefighters must be at least certified first responders. This is the required level of training. Some police officers and firefighters obtain more training to become emergency medical technicians or paramedics.
