Emergency Medical Technician is the entry level of Emergency Medical Technician (pre-hospital emergency medical provider) in the United States.
EMTs are not trained to provide definitive medical care, but instead focus on rapid in-field treatment and transport to higher medical providers. EMTs work in conjunction with other medical providers such as paramedics, nurses, and physicians, as well as with other EMTs. When operating in the prehospital environment, their actions are governed by protocols and procedures set by their system's physician medical director.
