International Family Medicine physicians are family physicians that specialize in working with under-served populations in resource-poor environments, often in developing nations. These physicians face the challenge of diagnosing patients without advanced laboratory or imaging techniques. Because of limited access to medications and specialists, International Family Medicine physicians must have flexible treatment strategies and a broad scope of practice.
