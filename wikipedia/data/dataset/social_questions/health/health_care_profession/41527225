The Bloxsom air lock was an incubator used in the treatment of respiratory distress among newly born infants in the 1950s. The device was developed by Dr. Allan Bloxsom, a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas. At its peak, the device was utilized in more than 700 hospitals. The Bloxsom air lock produced unfavorable results in a 1956 clinical trial. By that time physicians had also become leery of the link between high-concentration oxygen and eye disease in premature babies, and the device fell out of favor. The Bloxsom air lock is sometimes cited as an example of technology that gained wide acceptance following inadequate evaluation.
