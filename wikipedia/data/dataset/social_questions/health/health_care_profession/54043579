The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS), a professional society for surgeons specializing in eye surgery, based in Fairfax, VA, was founded in 1974. It is distinct from its sister organization, the American Society of Ophthalmic Administrators (ASOA), which concerns itself with the business management, including insurance reimbursement and marketing, of ophthalmic practices in the United States. Both associations hold annual meetings or conventions as well as publishing proceedings.
ASCRS publishes a monthly Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery (JCRS), as a joint production with the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS).
