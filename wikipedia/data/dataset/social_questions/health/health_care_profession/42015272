Syndesmosis procedure is one of the more than 20 bunion surgeries currently being performed. While the majority of bunion surgeries involve the breaking and shifting of bones (osteotomy procedures), syndesmosis procedure is one of few surgical techniques that use a soft tissue or non-osteotomy (non-bone-breaking) approach to afford the same correction. More than 130 different surgical techniques have been described for correction of one single condition of the foot: the bunion deformity.
