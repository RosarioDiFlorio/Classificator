A batman is a soldier or airman assigned to a commissioned officer as a personal servant. Before the advent of motorized transport, an officer's batman was also in charge of the officer's "bat-horse" that carried the pack saddle with his officer's kit during a campaign.
The U.K. English term is derived from the obsolete bat, meaning "pack saddle" (from French b√¢t, from Old French bast, from Late Latin bastum).
