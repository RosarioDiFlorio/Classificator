A licensed practical nurse (LPN) in much of the United States, and most Canadian provinces is a nurse who cares for people who are sick, injured, convalescent, or disabled. LPNs work under the direction of registered nurses or physicians. In the United States however, California and Texas refer to them as a licensed vocational nurse (LVN).
Equivalent professions outside the United States are "registered practical nurse" (RPNs) in the Canadian province of Ontario, "enrolled nurses" (ENs) or "Division 2 nurses" in Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand, and formerly "state enrolled nurses" (SENs) in the United Kingdom.
A person can generally become an LPN with two years of training; all U.S state and territorial boards also require passage of the NCLEX-PN exam.
