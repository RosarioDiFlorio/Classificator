Irving Israel Dardik is a former vascular surgeon who taught at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and founded the Sports Medicine Council of the US Olympic Committee. Dardik is notable as being among the first medical doctors to officially recognize the value of chiropractic in sport, when he recommended in 1979 that the United States Olympic Committee include a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) as a member of its medical team at all future Olympic Games. As a result, chiropractor George Goodheart attended the XIIIth Winter Olympic Games, in Lake Placid, NY, and the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs instituted a Volunteer Doctor Program for D.C.'s.
In 1980, Dardik helped direct the inaugural Olympic Sports Medicine Conference (Feb 26 through 29) in Boston.
In the early 1970s, together with his brother Herbert, Dardik pioneered the use of umbilical veins as a source of graft tissue for bypass surgeries.
