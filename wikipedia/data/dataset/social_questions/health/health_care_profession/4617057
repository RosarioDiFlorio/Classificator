The Nurses' Health Study (NHS), is a series of prospective studies that examine epidemiology and the long-term effects of nutrition, hormones, environment, and nurses’ work-life on health and disease development. The studies are among the largest investigations into risk factors for major chronic diseases ever conducted. The NHS studies have led to many insights on health and well-being, including Cancer prevention, Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes (type 2). The studies include clinicians, epidemiologists, and statisticians at the Channing Laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and several Harvard-affiliated hospitals, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital Boston, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
