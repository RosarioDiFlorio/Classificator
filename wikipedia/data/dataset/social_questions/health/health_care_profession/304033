A negative pressure ventilator, often referred to colloquially as an iron lung, is a nearly-obsolete mechanical respirator which enabled a person to breathe on their own in a normal manner, when muscle control had been lost, or the work of breathing exceeded the person's ability, as may occur in certain diseases (e.g. poliomyelitis, botulism), and as a result of certain poisons (e.g. barbiturates, tubocurarine).
Examples of the device include both the Drinker respirator, the Emerson respirator, and the Both (or Emerson-Drinker) respirator. The negative form of pressure ventilation (decreasing surrounding pressure to induce inhalation then repressurizing to 1 bar (15 psi; 750 mmHg)) has been almost entirely superseded by positive pressure ventilation (forcing air into the lungs with a pressure greater than 1 bar then allowing the body to naturally exhale before repeating) or negative pressure cuirass ventilation.
