A cycle responder is a medically trained responder, such as a paramedic or first aider that uses a bicycle to respond to a medical emergency. They are used by professional ambulance services to respond to emergency calls and also by private and voluntary providers of medical cover at events.
Cycle responders are provided in order to provide fast, effective medical assistance to patients in areas in which a traditional road ambulance or response car would have a delayed response time, and where responders on foot may not be fast enough, or cannot provide sufficient cover over an area.
This means that they are primarily deployed in areas of high traffic congestion, such as city centres, with large cities such as London and Manchester making extensive use of them. They are also used in specialist applications such as inside large shopping precincts and airport terminals, and for covering first aid at events.
