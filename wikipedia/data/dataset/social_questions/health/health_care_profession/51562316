Intermediate Life Support (ILS) is a level of training undertaken in order to provide emergency medical care outside medical facilities. ILS is classed as mid-level emergency medical care provided by trained first responders who receive more training then Basic First Responders and First-aid providers. ILS contains skills and protocols from Advanced Life Support. In the US, the level of training is comparable with Emergency medical technician â€“ intermediate (EMT-I) or Advance Emergency Medical Technicians. Intermediate Life Support was first used in the USA in 1985, and is now used around the world. It can be run as a separate course for non-professionals, or as part of Advanced Life Support for people in the medical field. ILS is mostly used by non-professional first responders, but the training is suitable for doctors, medical students, nurses, nursing students, midwives, healthcare providers such as physiotherapists, dentist and ambulance technicians. It may also be suitable for fire service technicians, police personnel and prison officers.
It provides the knowledge and skills to:
identify the causes of cardiopulmonary arrest;
recognise and treat the deteriorating patient using the ABCDE approach;
undertake CPR and defibrillation (manual and /or AED) and simple airway manoeuvres;
utilize non-technical skills to coordinate team members
Improving the quality of fast first response is the main goal of Intermediate Life Support.
