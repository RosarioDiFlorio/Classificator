Dual X-ray Absorptiometry and Laser technique (DXL) in the area of bone density studies for osteoporosis assessment is an improvement to the DXA Technique, adding an exact laser measurement of the thickness of the region scanned. The addition of object thickness adds a third input to the two x-ray energies used by DXA, better solving the equation for bone and excluding more efficiently these soft tissues components.
