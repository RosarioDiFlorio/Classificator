Breathwork is an umbrella term for various New Age practices in which the conscious control of breathing is meant to influence a person's mental, emotional and/or physical state, with a claimed therapeutic effect. Breathwork has no proven positive health impact other than promoting relaxation and can cause distress.
There are many types of breathwork which have emerged over the last few decades, including integrative breathwork, transformational breathwork, shamanic breathwork, conscious connected breathing, radiance breathwork, Zen yoga breathwork and many others.
Older non-Western techniques such as yoga, pranayama, t'ai chi and qigong are also offered as systems where the breath is used to direct and enhance the body's energy and aid in the release of old emotions. Similarly, the many schools and teachers of mindfulness are also using breathing techniques that date back before the time of the Buddha.
