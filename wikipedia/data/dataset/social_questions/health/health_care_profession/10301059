Hallux varus, or sandal gap, is a deformity of the great toe joint where the hallux is deviated medially (towards the midline of the body) away from the first metatarsal bone. The hallux usually moves in the transverse plane. Unlike hallux valgus, also known as hallux abducto valgus or bunion, hallux varus is uncommon in the West but it is common in cultures where the population remains unshod.
