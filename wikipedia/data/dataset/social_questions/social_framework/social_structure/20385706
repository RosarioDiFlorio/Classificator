Tasa de Gamboa or Rate of Gamboa was a money tax rate applied to the indigenous peoples in the Captaincy General of Chile by the Governor Martin Ruiz de Gamboa, in place of the tribute of personal service in the encomienda system, as desired by the kings of Spain. It replaced the Tasa de Santill√°n in an effort to end the abuses of the tribute of personal service.
