The Nepalese caste system is the traditional system of social stratification of Nepal. The Nepalese caste system broadly borrows the classical Chaturvarnashram model consisting of four broad social classes or varna:Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra, and untouchables. The caste system defines social classes by a number of hierarchical endogamous groups often termed jaat. This custom was traditionally only prevalent in the Hindu societies of the Khas/Parbatiya, Madhesi, and Newars. However, since the unification of Nepal in the 18th century, Nepal's various indigenous "Adivasi/Janajati" tribes have been incorporated within the caste hierarchy, to varying degrees of success. Despite of the forceful integration among the pan-Hindu social structure, the ethnic indigenous groups do not adhere to or fall under the caste system.
