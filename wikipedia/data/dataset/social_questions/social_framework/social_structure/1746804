Westie, or Westy, is a colloquial term used in Australian and New Zealand English to stereotypically describe residents of the Greater Western Sydney, the western suburbs of Melbourne or the West Auckland city of Waitakere (New Zealand). It may also refer as a derogatory term to people who might not live in the west of a city. The alternative term "bogan" is often used instead, as it has a similar definition but does not refer to a geographical area.
