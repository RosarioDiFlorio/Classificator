Mass gatherings are events attended by a sufficient number of people to strain the planning and response resources of the host community, state/province, nation, or region where it is being held. Definitions of a mass gathering generally include the following:
Planned (long term or spontaneously planned) event
“a specified number of persons (at least >1000 persons)
at a specific location, for a specific purpose (e.g. social function, public event, sporting event) for a defined period of time”.
Requires Multi-Agency Coordination
Mass Gathering Medicine is a new field of medicine that focuses on the health risks of mass gatherings. The World Health Organization through its "Department of Global Alert and Response" supports Member States hosting mass gatherings and regularly receives a large number of requests for technical support by countries organizing large mass gatherings.
