The González-Jones House is a historic home built during the First Spanish Period (1565–1763) in Saint Augustine, Florida. It is located at 56 Marine Street, one block north of the González–Alvarez House (14 Saint Francis) and the Saint Francis Barracks (82 Marine). This neighborhood includes nine colonial structures that survive in clusters along Marine and Saint Francis Streets. These buildings are all assumed to have been built after 1702, when the city was destroyed during a British siege.
