The haciendas in the Valley of Ameca comprise a series of expansive land estates awarded to Spanish soldiers for their services in the military during the conquest of New Spain in the late 1500s. Although a great portion of these estates were built during the colonial period (1701-1821), some of them were inclusively built during the Porfirian period (1876-1910). These haciendas served as religious centers in their respective vicinities, most included capilla, or chapel, with its campanario.
These land estates were dedicated to farm labor, most in the production of mezcal, a wine made from agave plant. Other crops grown were sugar cane and rice; and livestock was also an important profit.
All located in central Jalisco, Mexico; many of the haciendas have grown into communities and are now partly damaged, in ruins, or fortunately remodeled.
A total of 21 haciendas settled in the Valley of Ameca helped the local flourishment. 13 of these haciendas belong to the Ameca, 3 to San Mart√≠n de Hidalgo, 2 to Cocula, and 3 to Tala.
