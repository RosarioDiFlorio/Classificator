Droit du seigneur (; French pronunciation: ​[dʁwa dy sɛɲœʁ]) ("lord's right"), also known as jus primae noctis (; Latin pronunciation: [ju:s ˈpri:mae̯ 'nɔktɪs]) ("right of the first night"), refers to a supposed legal right in medieval Europe, and elsewhere, allowing feudal lords to have sexual relations with subordinate women (the "wedding night" detail is specific to some variants). There is no evidence of the right being exercised in medieval Europe, and all known references to it are from later time periods. Overall, medieval jus primae noctis can be considered a historical fiction fabricated after that era.
