Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España (English: Short Account of the Conquest of New Spain) is the account of friar Francisco de Aguilar, who in his youth took part in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire as a conquistador under the command of Hernán Cortés.
According to the introduction by the author, the account was written after Aguilar had joined the Dominican Order, at a time in which he would have been more than 80 years old, between 1559 and 1571. Following the death of Francisco de Aguilar, the manuscript came into the possession of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico Pedro Moya de Contreras, who then gave it to Philip II of Spain. Since then, the Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España has been held along with other 16th century manuscripts in the library of the Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. The manuscript survived a fire in the library that occurred on 7 June 1671.
