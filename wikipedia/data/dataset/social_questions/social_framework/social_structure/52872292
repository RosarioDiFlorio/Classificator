Allofeeding is a type of food sharing observed in species of birds which cooperatively breed. The term is used to refer to food foraging by a parent or unrelated adult bird and feeding to altricial hatchlings dependent on parental care for their survival, as well as food sharing in the same manner between adults in the same species as support for a brooding partner or as a mating ritual.
