Post-Fordism is the dominant system of economic production, consumption and associated socio-economic phenomena, in most industrialized countries since the late 20th century. It is contrasted with Fordism, the system formulated in Henry Ford's automotive factories, in which workers work on a production line, performing specialized tasks repetitively. Definitions of the nature and scope of post-Fordism vary considerably and are a matter of debate among scholars.
Post-Fordism is characterized by the following attributes:
Small-batch production
Economies of scope
Specialized products and jobs
New information technologies
Emphasis on types of consumers in contrast to previous emphasis on social class
The rise of the service and the white-collar worker
The feminisation of the work force
