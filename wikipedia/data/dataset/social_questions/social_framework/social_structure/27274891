In 1967, Iran adopted a set of progressive family laws, the Family Protection Act, which granted women family rights ; these were expanded in the Family Protection Law of 1975. The act was annulled in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution when Sharia law was re-introduced, but it stands out for having been ahead of their time, particularly in a Muslim-majority country.
Today, parts of the acts have been reintroduced in Iran, while others are under consideration. For instance the 1967 bill set up Special Courts for family matter. They were dissolved after the revolution, but Special Civil Courts were re-established in 1979 to adjudicate over matter relating to family law, succession and awqaf. Similarly, some legislative changes have moved family matters in a more progressive direction in the areas of minimum age of marriage, child custody and the grounds on which women can request divorce.
