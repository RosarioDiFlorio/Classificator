An educational management information system (EMIS) is an institutional service unit producing, managing, and disseminating educational data and information, usually within national Ministry or Department of Education. An EMIS is a repository for data collection, processing, analyzing and reporting of educational information including schools, students, teachers and staff. The EMIS information is used by Ministries of Education, NGOs, researchers, donors and other education stakeholders for research; policy and planning; monitoring and evaluation; and decision making. EMIS information is specifically used to create indicators that monitor the performance of an education system and to manage the distribution and allocation of educational resources and services.
