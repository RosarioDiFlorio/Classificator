In English property law, Jure uxoris (Latin for "by right of (his) wife".) is a title of nobility held by a man because his wife holds it suo jure ("in her own right"). Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands. In England until the Married Women's Property Act 1882, married women were legally incapable of owning real estate.
Jure uxoris monarchs are not to be confused with kings consort, who were merely consorts of their wives, not co-rulers.
