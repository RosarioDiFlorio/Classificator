The bouche of court, or vulgarly budge of court, is generally free food and drink at the king's court, or specifically the king's allowance of sustenance to his knights and servants during active duty. It is in the general sense that the French say, avoir bouche à la cour, literally "to have mouth at the court."
This privilege was sometimes only extended to bread, beer, and wine. It was an ancient custom not only in the king's court, but also in the houses of noblemen.
