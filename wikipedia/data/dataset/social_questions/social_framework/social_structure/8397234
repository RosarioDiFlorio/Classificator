The caste system among Indian Christians often reflects stratification by sect, location, and the castes of their predecessors. The caste system today is beyond Hinduism (Hindu society) and it exists in all religions in India.
Caste distinctions among Indian Christians are breaking down at about the same rate as those among Indians belonging to other religions. There exists evidence to show that Christian individuals have mobility within their respective castes. But, in some cases, social inertia causes old traditions and biases against other castes to remain, causing caste segregation to persist among Indian Christians.
Christian priests, nuns, Dalits and similar groups are also found in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
There are sections of Christians in India like in Odisha, West Bengal, etc who do not belong to any caste having lost caste at conversion. Sometimes, this practise from generations has contributed to an integrated society.
