Stay in Europe, or Menoume Europi or Menoume Evropi (Μένουμε Ευρώπη in Greek) is an initiative that surged in Greece since the elections of 2015. The concerns over the Grexit activated people with different political, ideological and political positions who participated in mass demonstrations in Athens, Syntagma Square and in other major cities. The main slogan of these peaceful political protests was that Greeks want to stay in Europe, to keep the country within the European Union and the euro area.. The belief was that the minimum consensus in politics in Greece during the negotiations over the austerity measures with the Members of eurozone, should be the European perspective of the country. From there on, all other political, social and other positions stated in the programmes of political parties are acceptable.
