In Sri Lanka a caste-based social stratification system can be seen among its two major ethnic groups (the Sinhalese and the Tamils). A caste system was extensive from the ancient history of Sri Lanka to the colonial era. Although it is less extensive and important compared to the neighbouring India, some 90 percent of the population in Sri Lanka recognizes it for some purposes at least. The Sri Lankan caste system was influenced by the varnas of North India and the jƒÅti system of South India, particularly Tamil Nadu; the caste system of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka is primarily influenced by the varnas. The occupations of ancient community groups have been linked to the development of castes, although the island's indigenous Veddha community avoided the system. Three major, parallel caste systems exist in Sri Lankan society: Sinhala, Sri Lankan Tamil, and Indian Tamil
