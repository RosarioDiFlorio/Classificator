Peckerwood (or simply wood) is a Southern US slang term for woodpecker. It is used to describe poor rural whites similar to white trash. Originally an ethnic slur, the term has been embraced by a subculture related to prison gangs and outlaw motorcycle clubs. The origin of the word comes from the Southern African-American dialect version of woodpecker circa 1825â€“1935. Folklore in the 1920s used the word as a symbolic contrast to the blackbird that represented African-Americans.
