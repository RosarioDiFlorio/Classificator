Women of color (singular: woman of color, sometimes abbreviated as WOC) is a phrase used to describe female persons of color. The political term "women of color" surfaced in the violence against women movement. In the late seventies it unified all women experiencing multiple layers of marginalization with race, and ethnicity as a common issue.
