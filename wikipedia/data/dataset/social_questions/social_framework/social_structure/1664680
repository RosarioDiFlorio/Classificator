Family centres are community resources that provide services to parents, children, and spouses.
Family centres exist to provide need-based aid to families affected by a range of events, including death, physical and mental illness, divorce, unemployment, and child abuse and child neglect. They have been created by different local government departments, or by different agencies, in order to fulfill three basic functions.
Social Services
Education
Training
The Social Services initiative focuses on creating better relationships within the family, providing preventative services to children "in need" or "at risk," and providing companionship to seniors. The Education initiative focuses on improving the interaction between families and the local schools as well as providing remedial facilities to children. The Training initiative focuses on providing parenting and job training classes.
