The Superclass List is a creation of David Rothkopf which his book Superclass: The Global Power Elite and The World They Are Making (publ. March 2008) is based upon. There are four key elements of success that unite the members of the Superclass, and gives them unparalleled power over world affairs. These elements are: geography, pedigree, networking and luck.
