Rajopadhyaya (Nepali: राजोपाध्याय) is one of the five groups of Bramhan in Nepal. Witzel (1986) identifies the following five groups of Bramhans in Nepal, viz.
the Newārī-speaking Rājopādhyāya Bramhans
the Nepāli-speaking Pūrbe Bramhans
the Kumāī Bramhans,
the Newārī-Maithilī-speaking Maithil Bramhans
the Bhaṭṭa Bramhans from South India
In Sanskrit, Rajopadhyaya literally means 'the royal teacher or guru' (Sanskrit: राज = royal + उपाध्याय = guru). They were the royal guru during the Malla era and even in Licchavi period. As a Brahman group, they are placed at top in Nepalese Caste System in Kathmandu Valley of Nepal based on Hinduism. They are especially concentrated in the core city area of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur.
Rajopadhyaya are an endogamous Brahman group, which still celebrates a strong matri-linear traditions. This is perhaps due to their closest link to the female-dominant tantra tradition, which they still adhere. Currently, they debate their identity into following of the three grounds:
Newar: Many claim Rajopadhyayas are Newars first as they have been into this ethnic group for time immemorial.
Brahmin: As any other Brahmin group mentioned above, Rajopadhyaya too claim they are only Brahmin first.
Newar-Brahmin: Some claim Rajopadhyaya as Newar-Brahmin because of their Newari name as Dya (Bhaju) Brahman (alternatively: Dev Brahmin).
