Widow conservation was a type of marriage in Protestant Europe in the early modern age, when the widow of a parish vicar was married to her husband's successor to ensure her economic support. This practice was common in Scandinavia (Ã„nkekonservering/Enkekonservering) and the Protestant parts of Germany (Konservierung von Pfarrwitwen). It is related to other forms of widow inheritance, including the levirate marriage known in the Old Testament as yibbum.
At the introduction of the Protestant Reformation, priests were allowed to marry. However, as they did not own the vicarage and property attached to his profession, his spouse and issue were left without a home and means to support themselves after his death. The future support of the widows and children of vicars thereby became a concern for the various churches. The most common solution was that the successor of a vicar married the widow (or perhaps the daughter) of his predecessor, thereby "conserving" her.
