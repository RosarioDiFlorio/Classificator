Pancasila economics is an economic system that is based on five principles in Pancasila. The term "Pancasila economy" first appeared in an article by Elim Salim in 1967.
In essence, a Pancasila economy is an economic concept that tries to avoid pendulum-like swings from one extreme (a Free Market economy) to the other (socialism). In simple terms, a "Pancasila economy" can be described as a market economic system with government control or controlled market economy. A Pancasila economy can be considered an example of a mixed economy system or a third way economic system.
