A banderole (French: [bɑ̃dʁɔl] ( listen), "little banner") is a comparatively small but long flag, historically used by knights and on ships, and as a heraldic device for representing bishops.
Bannerol, in its main uses is the same as banderole, and is the term especially applied to banners about a yard square carried at the funerals of great men and placed over the tomb. Often it commemorated a particular exploit of the person bearing the coat of arms.
