The Spur Posse was a group of high school boys from Lakewood, California, who used a point system to keep track of and compare their sexual attacks and Statutory rapes, some with girls as young as 10.
The founder of the group chose the name "Spur Posse" when a favorite basketball player of theirs, David Robinson, was signed to the San Antonio Spurs.
The group came to national attention on March 18, 1993, when the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arrested a number of the members for various sexual crimes. Prosecutors later dropped all but one of the charges after being unable to prove most of the encounters were nonconsensual, although many were with underage girls, some as young as ten.
One girl who was later interrogated by police said she had been in bed late one night when a teenager appeared at her window (standard procedure for breaking entry for the Spur Posse) and demanded sex from her. She complied because of rumors that the Spurs would harm women who resisted.
Police had the opportunity to prosecute the considerably older boys for statutory rape, but declined to do so.
Members of the Spur Posse proceeded to make the rounds on the tabloid-TV talk-show circuit. The Spur Posse events are often compared to two other teen sex scandals of the era â€“ the Glen Ridge Rape, and the 1996 syphilis epidemic among teens engaging in group sex in Rockdale County, Georgia.
