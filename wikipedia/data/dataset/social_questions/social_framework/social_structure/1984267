Bartholomew "Tristan" de Clermont-Lodève (1380 – c. 1432), Count of Copertino, was a French-born knight who married Catherine del Balzo Orsini, youngest daughter of Mary of Enghien and Raimondo del Balzo Orsini, Prince of Taranto. He was the father of Isabella of Clermont, Princess of Taranto, the first consort of King Ferdinand I of Naples.
Documents and sources about Tristan, whose proper first name was Bartholomew, are scarce. Tristan de Clermont (Italian: Tristano di Chiaromonte) became Count of Cupertino by his wife's dowry.
In 1429 Tristan divided the inheritance between his children. They were:
Raymond de Clermont (Raimondello di Chiaromonte), died 2 March 1443, leaving his inheritance to his sister Sancia;
Sancia, who married Francesco del Balzo, Duke of Andria;
Margherita, who married Antonio Ventimiglia, Marquess of Geraci, Grand Admiral;
Antonia, alleged somewhere to have married Thomas Palaeologus, titular Despot of Morea, as brother of Emperor Constantin and heir presumptive to the throne of the Byzantine Empire;
Isabella, who married Ferdinand of Aragon, later King of Naples.
