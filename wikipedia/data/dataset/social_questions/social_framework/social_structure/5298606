Ryōmin (良民) and Senmin (賤民) were the two main castes of the classical Japan caste system.
When the Ritsuryō legal system was starting to be enforced in Japan at the end of the 7th century, it included, as in Tang China, a division between those two major castes. The term Ryosensei (良賤制) describes the whole system. The Senmin caste, divided into five "genres", is also called Goshiki no Sen (五色の賤), the Senmin of five genres, sometimes abbreviated to gosen (五賤).
Caste was part of the citizen registration enforced with the ritsuryō.
