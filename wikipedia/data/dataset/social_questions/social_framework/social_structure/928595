A crowd is a large group of people that are gathered or considered together. The term "the crowd" may sometimes refer to the lower orders of people in general (the mob). A crowd may be definable through a common purpose or set of emotions, such as at a political rally, a sports event, or during looting (this is known as a psychological crowd), or may simply be made up of many people going about their business in a busy area.
