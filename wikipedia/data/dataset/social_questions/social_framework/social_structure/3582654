A sexual minority is a group whose sexual identity, orientation or practices differ from the majority of the surrounding society. It can also refer to transgender, genderqueer (including third gender) or intersex individuals. The term is primarily used to refer to LGB individuals, particularly gay people. More recently, the catch-all terms GSM ("Gender and Sexual Minorities"), GSRM ("Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities"), and GSD ("Gender and Sexual Diversity") have been proposed.
