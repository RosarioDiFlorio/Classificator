Juan de(l) Junco (1503, Ribadesella, Asturias, Castile - ?, Santo Domingo) was a Spanish conquistador who participated in the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. Del Junco started his career as conquistador in the 1526 expedition lead by Sebastian Cabot exploring the Río de la Plata in present-day Argentina. In 1535, he arrived in Santa Marta at the Colombian Caribbean coast from where the strenuous expedition in search of El Dorado began in April 1536.
Del Junco played a role in the foundations of Bogotá (August 6, 1538) and Tunja (August 6, 1539) and was an honoured captain in the troops of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. Juan del Junco was named second in line of succession, after Gonzalo's brother Hernán, in case the first governor of the New Kingdom of Granada would die. Del Junco was awarded the encomienda of Cucaita, close to Tunja, for his efforts as a soldier. In 1541, Del Junco left South America for Santo Domingo, where he married and died in an unknown year.
Juan del Junco is named in the major publications of early chroniclers about the Spanish conquest of Colombia; Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada (first published in 1889), Elegías de varones ilustres de Indias (De Castellanos, 1589)., El Carnero (Freyle, 1638), and Historia general de las conquistas del Nuevo Reino de Granada (De Piedrahita, 1676).
