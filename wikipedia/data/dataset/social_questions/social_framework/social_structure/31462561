Natural History in the Spanish New World The exploration of the New World by Spanish explorers resulted in the discovery of numerous plants and animals previously unknown to European natural history. The Spanish crown created institutions to facilitate the distribution of new knowledge. The Council of the Indies and the Casa de la Contratacion functioned as repositories of knowledge and constructed methodological guidelines for empirical research. Spanish physicians working in the New World provided detailed descriptions of the plants they encountered and conducted numerous experiments to determine the efficacy of these plants in treating diseases. While the discussion of natural history in the Scientific Revolution tends to focus on the research of Italian and English scholars, Spain was also engaged in an active pursuit of new knowledge about the natural world. However, the previously unknown nature of these plants forced an emphasis on empirical data as opposed to existing textual knowledge. Furthermore, the emphasis on profitability encouraged an emphasis on the commercial applications of new plants and influenced the manner in which these plants were described.
