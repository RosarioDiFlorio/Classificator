TV TIME (formerly TVShow Time) is an online service centered exclusively on television series. It enables users to get information and comment on the shows they follow, featuring various segments of information related to them, such as new episodes release dates (which the site shows with a countdown clock), and various options based on user reaction.
In spite of the site's French origin and a large number of users from the same country, it has a considerable number of users who comment in English.
Its mobile app is available for Android and iOS, and has been downloaded more than 1,000,000 times on Google Play as of April 2016.
