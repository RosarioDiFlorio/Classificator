Matchify is an online dating service app for Android, aimed at young Indian women. Currently, it has been downloaded by over half a million users.
The app allows women users to communicate directly with other women, while men registered on the app can do so only when they get a ‘match’ to like them back. The sign up process is more detailed and requires users to log in using their Facebook accounts for authenticity.
Matchify includes verified profiles, 'secure chat' where women can initiate an interaction with men directly (unlike men who can do it until there's a mutual like), control over who can see profile and pictures, and abuse reporting and blocking. An anonymous chat feature is intended to help women initiate a chat in "Mask me" mode where the photo and complete profile details are kept anonymous. When they are comfortable, they can choose to reveal their identity. The 'React' feature is designed to let women know if the profile picture uploaded is genuine, by letting women ask men to upload instant selfies while on a chat.
The app was launched in April 2015 by Matchify Services Private Limited, which is owned by Matrimony.com.
