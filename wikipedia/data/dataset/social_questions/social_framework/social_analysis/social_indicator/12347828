FlyLady is a support and self-help group that offers advice to help people with housekeeping, founded by "The FlyLady", Marla Cilley.
The group is based upon the website FlyLady.net, as well as a Constant Contact group for its email mailing list. Members of FlyLady have stated that the group has helped them and has changed their lives. 
FlyLady's messages cover topics include clutter, the value of routines, weekly and monthly cleaning, increased self-esteem, and letting go of perfectionism. As of 2016, she had over 300,000 subscribers on her email list, and 550,000 followers on Facebook. A store on her website sells organizational tools and housewares, sent from the FlyLady Distribution Center in Brevard, NC. In 2007, sales from the store reached US$4 million.
In November 2015 Alex Elsea, Marla's nephew, launched FlyLady Premium, a paid virtual mentoring service which adds extra support to followers of the FlyLady methodology in small private online groups. FlyLady Premium released an app, FlyLadyPlus in July 2016. Later in 2016, FlyLady herself released a subscription-based iOS reminder app, FlyLady Messenger.
