Citizen Change is a political service group, founded by musician P. Diddy, and backed by Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey and 50 Cent. The stated aim was to get young people to vote. The campaign's message, promoted on t-shirts and other things, is "Vote or Die!", a phrase adapted from Join, or Die, a well-known cartoon by Benjamin Franklin. As of 2006, the Citizen Change organization has not been disbanded, though it is inactive.
