Cellufun, briefly known as Tylted, is a social gaming community accessible from any mobile device, from the latest smartphones and tablets to the smallest feature phones. Cellufun is different from most other social networks, as it is anonymous, with users creating avatars to represent themselves. This has resulted in Cellufun ranking #117 in the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing companies. By blending chat and a large catalog of social games, and as verified by comScore, Te has the highest user engagement numbers of any mobile internet site.
Cellufun partners with mobile operators, mobile device makers, and media companies such as AT&T Mobility, Verizon Wireless, MetroPCS, Virgin Mobile, RIM, AOL, and USA Today to deliver branded entertainment and marketing.
