Experience Project is a free social networking website consisting of various online communities. It operated from 2007 until 2016, when it announced it would suspend new registrations indefinitely.
Members submitted "experiences"â€”their personal, first-person stories about various life experiences they had. Users could then form or join communities based on these experiences and/or interests, and interact with other members who shared them. As of May 2016, the site had over sixty-seven million of these "experiences".
In March 2016, Experience Project announced that it would suspend operations indefinitely. The existing content of the site would remain publicly available, but members would no longer be able to post new content or access their accounts. The site was officially suspended on April 21, 2016.
