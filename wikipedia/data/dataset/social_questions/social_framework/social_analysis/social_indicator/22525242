The currency is managed by the PLENTY Currency Cooperative Corporation and is backed by Capital Bank Financial with United States dollars, 10 Plentys may be purchased for $10.00 US. PLENTYs can be traded for goods or services or exchanged for United States Dollars at businesses that accept them.
PLENTY are offered in 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1 denomination bills and feature the phrase "In Each Other We Trust". The logo and currency were designed by artist Emma Skurnick and feature illustrations of native plants and animals.

Like other local currencies, the PLENTY is legal as they don't too closely resemble United States currency. Transactions conducted with Plenties are taxed just as transactions in United States Dollars.
