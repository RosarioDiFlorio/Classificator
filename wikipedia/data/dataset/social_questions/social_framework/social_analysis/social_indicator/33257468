The Community Exchange System (CES) is an Internet-based trading network which allows participants to buy and sell goods and services without using a national currency. While the relatively new system can be used as an alternative to traditional currencies such as the dollar or Euro or South African rand, the Community Exchange System is a complementary currency in the sense that it functions alongside established currencies. It is international in scope. It does not have printed money or coins but uses computer technology to serve as an "online money and banking system" or alternative exchange system and as a marketplace. It is an advance from an arrangement in which either one good or service is exchanged for another good or service, or commonly called barter, since it uses a digital unit of value. While there are reports that the system is growing, in 2011 the system handles only a tiny fraction of international world commercial activity.
