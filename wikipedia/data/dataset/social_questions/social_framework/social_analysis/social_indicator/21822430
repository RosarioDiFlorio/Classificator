JWed.com is an online dating service aimed at Jewish singles. The website, founded in 2001 followed a predecessor called Dosidate, launched in 1997. Between 2001 and 2012 the site was called Frumster, a play on the term Frum and a joke by Rob Schneider. The site, which offers a free and premium subscription, claimed to have a membership of over 30,000 and was the largest Orthodox Jewish online dating service in 2005. Between 2001 and 2005 it claimed to have matched 1222 members and announced its 500th wedding.
In October 2012, Frumster.com changed its name to JWed.com. JWed launched in 2007 as a white-label site, and shared profile listings with Frumster.com until the name was completely changed 2012.
The site had attracted criticism in 2004 for refusing profiles from people describing themselves as Conservative Jews. The site is now open to all marriage-minded Jewish singles be they Orthodox observant or halachically Jewish singles.
By 2014, the site claimed over 2,000 members married and averaging 4 weddings a week.
