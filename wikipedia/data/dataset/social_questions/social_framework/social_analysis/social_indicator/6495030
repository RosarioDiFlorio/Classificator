WorldMadeChannel is a Dutch TV project based on user-generated content (home video and photos) sent by viewers from all over the world.
Unlike other existing channels, WorldMadeChannel does not require special translation or adaptation for any country as far as it has neither texts nor dialogues.
WorldMadeChannel has an agreement with the United Nations Organization on production and distribution of a TV program in six official UN languages (Chinese, English, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and French). The program is family-oriented, and gives the information on UN policy, ideas and projects in an easy and engaging manner.
