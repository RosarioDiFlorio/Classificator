...But Alive was a German punk rock band, which was founded in 1991 in Hamburg. Most of their lyrics were very political. When they announced their breakup in 1999, because of musical and personal differences, they consisted of the following members:
Marcus Wiebusch (Vocals and Guitar); also in Rantanplan, now in Kettcar
Frank Tirado-Rosales (drums); also now in Kettcar
Hagen van der Viren (Guitar)
Torben Mei√üner (Bass); also in Rantanplan, as well
Their 1997 album Bis Jetzt Ging Alles Gut was released in North America by the Canadian G7 Welcoming Committee Records.
After ...But Alive's demise, Marcus and Frank started a new band called Kettcar, taking a more mainstream pop music (particularly Coldplay and Snow Patrol influenced) approach. Since nobody wanted to release their debut album Marcus teamed up with some of his friend to launch the Grand Hotel Van Cleef label, which thus far has been quite a success.
