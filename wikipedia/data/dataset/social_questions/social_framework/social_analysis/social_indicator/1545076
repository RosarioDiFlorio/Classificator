Dystopia was an experimental sludge metal and crust punk band that formed in Oakland, California in 1991. Dystopia was popular in both the heavy metal and crust punk scenes, due in large part to the band's bleak, misanthropic imagery. Dystopia's lyrics often dealt with human emotions and social or political issues such as environmentalism, racial equality, substance abuse, and animal rights. Their music utilized the slow, heavy sound of sludge metal whilst including more up-beat elements drawing from crust punk, grindcore, and noise rock.
