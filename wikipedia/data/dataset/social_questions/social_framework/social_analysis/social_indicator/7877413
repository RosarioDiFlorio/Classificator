The Center for Appropriate Transport (CAT) is a non-profit community center dedicated to bicycles and alternative transport located in Eugene, Oregon, United States.
CAT holds publicly funded educational workshops for teaching youth from ages 12 to 21. Within the 8,000-square-foot (740 m2) facility there is a public bicycle repair workspace and a bike machine-shop for the design and manufacture of special-purpose bikes, particularly cargo bikes and recumbents. There is also a bike museum on site, a bike rack-building workshop, and a sewing facility. CAT formerly held the offices of Oregon Cycling magazine, which ceased publishing in 2009. CAT is also home to Pedaler's Express, a pioneering workbike-based delivery service.
