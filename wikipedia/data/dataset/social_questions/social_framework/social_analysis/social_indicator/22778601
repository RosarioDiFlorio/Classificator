Detroit Community Scrip, also called Detroit Cheers, is a local currency in Detroit, Michigan. Modeled upon the local scrip that were used during the Great Depression, it is being used to restore local economic confidence. The Cheers are backed by US currency and are fully exchangeable for an equal amount of U.S. dollars, backed by several Detroit businesses. There are currently $4,500 worth of cheers in circulation. Businesses can sign up to be issuers and print scrip after depositing a matching amount in U.S. dollars and then be entitled to print Cheers. More than 25 businesses have signed up to accept Cheers, but many others informally accept them.
