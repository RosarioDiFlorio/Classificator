Voat Inc  is a news aggregator and social networking service where registered community members can submit content such as text posts and direct links. Registered users can then vote for these submissions. After accumulating 100 of these "upvotes" on original comments posted, users can begin voting against submissions and comments. Voting is commonly called "voating" by users. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subverses."
