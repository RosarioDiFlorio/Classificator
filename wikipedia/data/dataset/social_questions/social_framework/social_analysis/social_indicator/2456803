Scott Sturgeon, also known as Stza Crack ( STIZ-ə; born March 4, 1976), is a musician who has fronted several ska-punk bands in the New York City area, the best known being Choking Victim and Leftöver Crack. The stage name Stza is a tribute to the Wu-Tang Clan, in which the members would take their stage names from the Supreme Alphabet of the Five Percent Nation, such as GZA (God ZigZagZig Allah) and RZA (Ruler ZigZagZig Allah) - Stza's name would therefore be Self Truth ZigZagZig Allah.
