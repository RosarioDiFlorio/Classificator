foodsharing.de is an online platform that saves and distributes surplus food in Germany and Austria. It is managed by the Foodsharing association (foodsharing e.V.) and was founded on December 12, 2012. On foodsharing.de individuals, retailers and producers can offer or collect food that would otherwise be thrown away. This service is completely free, and functions thanks to volunteer work. The projects' goal is to fight everyday food waste and to raise awareness about this problem in society.
