Dogster is a dog-themed social networking and forums-based website. Its sister site is Catster, a cat-oriented website with a similar format.
Users of the site create a pet page which is a customizable web page for which they can give treats or purchase virtual items using what are called zealies. This virtual currency can be given to the users after engaging in some of the website activities, using PayPal or by purchasing a Plus subscription.
Dogster won the 2005 Webby category for best community site. It was acquired by SAY Media in 2011. On January 16, 2014, SAY Media declared that all the social networking and forums would be removed from Dogster and Catster. On February 12, 2014, the company announced that it was working with a new partner, and the community features would remain on Dogster and Catster. In July 2014, Dogster and Catster were sold to I-5 Publishing. In 2015, I-5 closed Cat Fancy and Dog Fancy and replaced them with print versions of Catster and Dogster.
