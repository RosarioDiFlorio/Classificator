Varjojen Kirja (Varjojenkirja.com) is an online information and society networking site for the Finnish pagan (Paganism) community. It is a non-profit organization run by married couple Unenkulkija and Karhuntassu and has been operated since late 2004.
Originally released as an online library for herbs, charmstones, witchcraft rites and horoscopes, it soon gained popularity among Finnish pagans. Most of the site content is wiki-styled user-editable which has enabled the site to expand its content 5 to 10 times from the original content.
