The Sydney Body Art Ride is a community-driven art event which raises funds for children's cancer research while promoting healthy sustainable living. It is held annually in the middle of February in Sydney, Australia.
Volunteer participants create an ephemeral moving artwork called "The Human Rainbow." which consists of hundreds of painted cyclists riding in groups to form a rainbow that travels through the city to a beach. At the beach the riders march into the sea and wash off the (biodegradable) paint. The event was conceived and orchestrated by Sydney-based artist Jake Lloyd-Jones.
The meaning of the artwork is "Hope" which is expressed by individual riders using their personal community networks to raise funds for Children's Cancer Research. 100% of money raised is donated to the Children's Cancer Institute of Australia. The procession also expresses the communities support for the measures City of Sydney Council has undertaken to provide alternative options for the city's commuters.
Sydney Body Art Ride is a highlight of the New Mardi Gras Arts festival and attracts visitors from interstate and all over the world. The event is supported and endorsed by a large number of important Sydney identities including the Lord Mayor and other celebrities. The event is a-political and has the support of people from all sides of the political spectrum.
