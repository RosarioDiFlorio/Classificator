Faves was a social bookmarking and networking software that installs a single browser button for users to "fave" a webpage, making a link to the page part of their Faves profile. Until October 2007, Faves was called Blue Dot. As of January 2012, the service has migrated to fave.net, and later on migrated to MaxiConnect.com and is no longer active on faves.com which says "Faves is evolving to social couponing."
