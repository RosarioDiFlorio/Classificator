Emma L. Bowen was a community activist in community health care and fair media. She was an advocate for the disenfranchised and vulnerable. She was one of the co-founders of Black Citizens For Fair Media (BCFM). The Emma L. Bowen Community Service Center known as the Upper Manhattan Mental Health Center, Inc.,is a nonprofit community-based organization named for Ms. Bowen. The center building was established in 1986, but there was a forerunner established in 1975 and the original mental health program was opened in a loft in Washington Heights. The Upper Manhattan Mental Health Center was a result of federal legislation that established community mental health centers, due to grass roots organizing throughout the country that sought to make mental health programs and services available on the community level. It was established to help individuals, families to meet challenges of daily living.
