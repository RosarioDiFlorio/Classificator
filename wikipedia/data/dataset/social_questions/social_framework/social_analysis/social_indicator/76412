Freiwirtschaft (German for "free economy") is an economic idea founded by Silvio Gesell in 1916. He called it Nat√ºrliche Wirtschaftsordnung (natural economic order). In 1932, a group of Swiss businessmen used his ideas to found the WIR Bank (WIR).
Gesell is nowadays viewed as a left-wing market anarchist or libertarian socialist.
