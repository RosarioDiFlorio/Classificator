The Women of Krusha e Madhe (/ˈkruʃa e maðe/; Albanian: Gratë e Krushës së Madhe; Serbian: Жене у Великој Круши) are known as the Widowed Women of Kosovo because of the massacre that occurred in their village. Throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 of March in 1999 during the Kosovo War, most, if not all, of the men were gathered up and shot to death by forces of the Yugoslav Army. The women and children fled Krushe e Madhe and headed to the Albanian border. Once the war was over and they returned, their entire village was flat because all their houses, mosques, schools, etc. had been burned to the ground.
These women who were now the heads of households decided to change their fate and become the income generators of the village. Not only did they bring in money for their families, but also drastically developed Krusha and its economy. When they returned, they lived in extreme poverty and horrible living conditions but through opening small businesses and continuously expanding their market share, they managed to get out of it. Although this village still needs growth and improvement, Krusha has never had such high demands from consumers. Maximum dexterity has been given by the women towards trying to help their families have a better life and seeing the village’s economy thrive.
