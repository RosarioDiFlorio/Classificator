The Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation, on October 7, 2000. It is a non-profit organization that claims to promote Transcendental Meditation, education, and the construction of "buildings for peace" in the worldâ€™s major cities. The GCWP was originally conceived as "a country without borders for peace-loving people everywhere." It has issued a currency called the "Raam," and its leader is neurologist Tony Nader.
In 2002, the GCWP was incorporated in the state of Iowa, USA with its headquarters in Maharishi Vedic City. It has administrative or educational centres in the U.S., the Netherlands and Ireland. The GCWP made unsuccessful attempts to obtain sovereign land as a micronation during the years 2000 to 2002.
