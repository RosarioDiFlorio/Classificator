360voice was a website where gamers could read or subscribe via RSS to a blog about what their friends are doing every day on Xbox Live, including tracking gameplay and issuing gamerscore challenges. It is the major product of It Can Talk Systems Inc., a company founded by Trapper Markelz and Steve Sopp in 2006. For example, one may view all the games played by Xbox Live director Larry Hryb (better known as "Major Nelson") on his 360voice blog. It has been recognized as part of a new trend in technology where inanimate objects acquire the ability to blog about their owners' activities.
