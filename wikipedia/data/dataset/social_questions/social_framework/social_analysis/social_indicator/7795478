MyFreeImplants is a website based on the social networking model. The service purports to be an alternative to traditional cosmetic surgery financing methods. Models participate on the website with the main goal of raising money to fund a breast augmentation procedure through online donations.
The site has been criticised by professional organizations including the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) for tasteless marketing and trivializing a significant surgical procedure.
On 11 January 2009 a program was broadcast on the UK channel Virgin 1 called 100 Men own my breasts which predominantly featured the website.
On 28 June 2016 the business was sold to Innovative Investments Holding Group Inc.
