TeaMp0isoN was a computer security research group consisting of 3-5 core members. The group gained notoriety in 2011/2012 for their blackhat hacking activities, which included attacks on the United Nations, NASA, NATO, Facebook and several other large corporations and government entities. TeaMp0isoN disbanded in 2012 following the arrests of three of their core members, 'TriCk', MLT, and hex00010.
