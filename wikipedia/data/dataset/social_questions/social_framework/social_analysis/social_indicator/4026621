The Orange Democratic Movement is a centre-left political party in Kenya. It is the successor of a former grassroots people's movement which was formed in the 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum. The erstwhile single party which separated in August 2007 into two. The two parties are the Orange Democratic Movement Party of Kenya (usually known simply as ODM), and the Wiper Democratic Movement – Kenya (formerly Orange Democratic Movement – Kenya; known as ODM–Kenya).
The name "orange" originates from the ballot cards in the referendum, in which the banana represented a 'Yes' vote, and the orange represented a 'No' vote. Thus the parties claim successorship to those who did not support the referendum at the time. The original linchpins of the ODM were Uhuru Kenyatta's KANU party and Raila Odinga's LDP. However, KANU has since pulled out, and the two groupings are headed by Raila Odinga (ODM) and Kalonzo Musyoka (ODM–Kenya).
