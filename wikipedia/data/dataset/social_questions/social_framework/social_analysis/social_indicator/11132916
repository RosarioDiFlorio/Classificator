The Global village is a metaphoric shrinking of the world into a village through the use of telecommunications. Global village is also a term used to express the relation between economics and sociology throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian-born Marshall McLuhan, popularized in his books The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1962) and Understanding Media (1964). McLuhan described how the globe has been contracted into a village by electric technology and the instantaneous movement of information from every quarter to every point at the same time.
