The Royal Insight Forum is an online discussion forum covering topics relating to the institution of monarchy in the modern world, and offering updates on the happenings in the many royal families of the world. The forum also provides sections where users can debate and share their thoughts and resources on royal history, royal traditions and protocol, and other royalty-related topics.
The forum is part of the Royal Insight website, which used to be known as the Royal Internet Forum (RIF) and was relaunched early in 2011. The forum is divided into different categories, each covering a different aspect of the world of royalty. The categories include News where up-to-date royal news and events are posted as quick links to the content. The forum also provides a section called Non-royal forums where users can diversify the content posted away from the royal theme of the forum.
The Royal Insight Forum also through Twitter and Facebook alerts to its users about new content available on both the main Royal Insight website and its forums.
With a member base of just over 5,000, the Royal Insight forum is the largest British royal forum active on the internet, and one of the largest online communities for all things royal.
