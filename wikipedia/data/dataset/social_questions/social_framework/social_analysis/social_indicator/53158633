Sleeping Giants is a social media activism organization aiming to persuade companies to remove ads from conservative news outlets that promote "bigotry, sexism, and racism". The campaign started in November 2016, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the United States presidential election, with the launch of a Twitter account aiming to boycott Breitbart News. The first tweet targeted personal finance company SoFi. Most tweets on the account are messages to companies advertising on Breitbart - of these, most are not from the account itself, but are retweets of the messages of independent volunteers.
The organization primarily operates from its Twitter account, and also has a Facebook account. It has regional Twitter accounts for Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
As of February 2017, 820 companies have joined the campaign and stopped advertising on Breitbart News, according to statistics provided by the organization. By May 2017, thousands of advertisers have stopped advertising with Breitbart.
The list of advertisers includes AT&T, Kellogg's, BMW, Visa, Autodesk, Lenovo, HP Inc., Vimeo, Deutsche Telekom, Lyft, Allstate, Nest, and Warby Parker. The Canadian Government also stopped advertising on Breitbart News after declaring that its contents "did not align with the Governmentâ€™s Code of Value and Ethics". Sleeping Giants' strategy combines traditional approaches to pressure advertisers with direct online activism, aiming to recruit and mobilize a large population of social media users. According to Slate, Sleeping Giants' strategy is similar to the one adopted in 2014 by the Gamergate movement against Gawker Media.
Breitbart News responded to the positive response to the initiative by Kellogg's with a campaign to boycott their products.
