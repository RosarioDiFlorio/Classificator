Lawrence Dominick Wollersheim has been an active director of several specialized non-profit organizations since 2002.
He has worked with others to help to develop the concepts and practices of "Sustainable Prosperity," "the Universe Evolutionary Worldview," "Evolution Spirituality," "Progressive Evolution," the "Universe Principles of Sustainability" and "Job One for Humanity Climate Restabilization Plan." The Job One plan is a meta-systemic, long-term plan for mitigating global warming and climate destabilization. Much of his current work for these organizations is focused on how to apply the scientific principles of universe-scale evolution to our daily lives and to resolve our biggest global challenges.
Wollersheim is also a former Scientologist. He sued the Church of Scientology in 1980. The story of Xenu was made public when Church materials detailing the Operating Thetan Level 3 were used as exhibits. In Wollersheim's court case Scientology's "top secret" materials about Xenu and their beliefs in past alien invasions of Earth was filed with the LA court on his behalf and then copied from court records and published by media all over the world.
Wollersheim helped co-found Factnet.org in 1993 to help other victims of cult abuse. Currently he is still a director of Factnet.
