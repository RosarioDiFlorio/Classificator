Take on Wall Street is a coalition of American labor unions and activist groups that aims to turn public anger about the Wall Street into public pressure in future congressional races. Established in 2016, the coalition builds on Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and his criticism of rival Hillary Clinton for accepting money from Goldman Sachs to deliver speeches. Unlike Occupy Wall Street, the new coalition goals are targeted on specific issues, such as breaking up big banks and the restoration of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that was repealed in 1999 under the Presidency of Bill Clinton.
In May 2016. the coalition launched a petition asking the U.S. Congress to stand up to Wall Street, and "build a financial system that works for Main Street and working families, not just Wall Street billionaires." The petition was signed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten and Congressman Keith Ellison, amongst others.
