WikiLosRios is a Spanish-language wiki-based Web encyclopedia project about Los Ríos Region in Chile. The scope of WikiLosRios is limited to subjects related to Los Ríos Region. WikiLosRios has twice organized an article contest among secondary school students called "Construyendo Región" (Building a region). The last contest was won by a student from Panguipulli with the article "Sendero del Jabalí" (Path of the Wildboar). In 2008 Jimmy Wales met the coordinators of WikiLosRios, Joaquín Barañao and Roberto Munita. Wales reportedly showed great interest in the local character of the encyclopedia.
WikiLosRios was started in 2007 by Senator Andrés Allamand who currently is the main sponsor of the website. In the words of Andrés Allamand WikiLosRios was created to "put at disposal of all the inhabitants of the region, Chile, and why not, the world, a truthful information that is agile and collective about the process of creation of this region and its reality."
