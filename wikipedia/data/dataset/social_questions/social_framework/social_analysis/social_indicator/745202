Reality tunnel is a term, similar to the idea of representative realism, coined by Timothy Leary (1920â€“1996). It was further expanded on by Robert Anton Wilson (1932-2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book Prometheus Rising. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from his or her beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "Truth is in the eye of the beholder".
In a chapter Wilson co-wrote with Timothy Leary in Leary's 1988 book Neuropolitique (a revised edition of the 1977 book Neuropolitics), Wilson and Leary explained further:

The gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another's territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other's reality tunnel.
