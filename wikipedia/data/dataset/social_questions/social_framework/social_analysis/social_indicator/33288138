Anonplus was a social networking service developed by Anonymous. It was announced on 16 July 2011, one day after Your Anon News was banned from Google+. Anonymous defined Anonplus as a "new social network where there is no fear...of censorship...of blackout...nor of holding back." Anonplus's goal was to create a decentralized and secure social network where the privacy of the users was valued.
