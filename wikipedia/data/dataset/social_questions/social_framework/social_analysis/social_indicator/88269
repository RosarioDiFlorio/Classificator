Crucifix was an American hardcore punk band from Berkeley, California, active from 1980 to 1984. They were among the most popular acts of the San Francisco punk scene of the early 1980s. Crucifix was founded and fronted by Cambodian-born singer Sothira Pheng, whose family had fled the country when the Khmer Rouge seized power.
They were distinct among American underground bands for their strong D-beat musical characteristics and anarchist content. The band's debut 1983 full-length album "Dehumanization" on Corpus Christi Records, an offshoot of Crass Records, is often considered to be a cornerstone of political punk.
