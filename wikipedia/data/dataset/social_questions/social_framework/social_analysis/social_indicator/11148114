The Center for Community Change (CCC) is a progressive community organizing group active in the United States. It was founded in 1968 in response to civil rights concerns of the 1960s and to honor Robert F. Kennedy. The organization's stated mission is "to build the power and capacity of low-income people, especially low-income people of color, to change their communities and public policies for the better." CCC has received funding from the Democracy Alliance and the Tides Advocacy Fund.
