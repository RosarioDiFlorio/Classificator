Dese Majoo Hartaal (Devanagari: देसय्‌ मजू हरताल) in the Newar language means the "Strike that never happened in the country". This strike was kicked off in Nepal on the first of August, 2017.  An Internet strike was a new concept in Nepal, and this was the first time in the history of Nepal that an Internet Strike took place. Nepal Mandal Pucha a loose network of organized Newa youths initiated this event.
The Internet Strike was called the Save Nepa Valley Movement, which was dedicated towards working on the betterment of the Nepal Valley, the original term used for Kathmandu Valley. The first evidence of the strike was made through a personal blog by a person named Rukshana Kapali, who took the initiation in the movement. The reason for calling the Internet Strike was to warn authorities to take the voice of natives and locals seriously while making development in the valley.
