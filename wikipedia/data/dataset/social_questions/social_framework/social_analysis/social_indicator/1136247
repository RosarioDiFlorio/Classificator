TrueMajority was a progressive advocacy group in the United States. In September 2007, TrueMajority and its related organization TrueMajorityACTION merged with USAction. By 2008, the combined groups had over 700,000 members, making it, together with MoveOn, one of the two largest liberal advocacy groups in the United States.
TrueMajority was founded by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's.
TrueMajorityACTION was a separate but closely related organization, which had a different status under U.S. law so that it could campaign for specific parties and politicians. TrueMajority merged with USAction in 2007.
TrueMajority was mentioned on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, when Ben and Jerry made a guest appearance. In the episode, they offered free frisbees to Colbert viewers who visited the web site, and then they signed up each viewer who visited as a member of the advocacy group.
