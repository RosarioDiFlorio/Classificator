The Transformative Studies Institute (TSI) is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational think tank based in the United States. It “was created to provide an inclusive educational space for research and practice for social justice by academics, community organizers, activists, and political leaders”. TSI is managed and operated by fully volunteer academics, activists, and the concerned public. It has been noted by Korgen, Kathleen et al. in Sociologists in Action (2010) as a model for engaging college students with public sociology and increased civic engagement.
