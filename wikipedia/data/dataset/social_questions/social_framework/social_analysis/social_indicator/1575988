Economic activism involves using economic power for change. Both conservative and liberal groups use economic activism to boycott or "greedily" outbid companies and organizations that do not agree with their particular political, religious, or social values. Conversely, it also means purchasing from those companies and organizations that do. The idea behind the concept is two-fold. First, you will reinforce "good" behavior and allow those companies that think like you to succeed. Second, you will punish "bad" behavior and hope that those companies that do not think like you do will fail or will adopt your "correct" way of thinking.
