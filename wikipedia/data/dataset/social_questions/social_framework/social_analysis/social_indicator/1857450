Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya (10 May 1914 – 26 October 1995) was a freedom fighter, parliamentarian and popular leader of farmers in Rajasthan, India.Shri Kumbha Ram Arya was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha during 1980-84 representing Sikar Parliamentary constituency of Rajasthan. Earlier, he was a member of Rajya Sabha during 1960-64 and 1969-74. He had been a member of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly during 1952-57 and 1964–66 and also served as a Minister in the State Council of Ministers and held various portfolios. An agriculturist by profession, Shri Arya was an active social and political worker. During his long public life, he was actively involved in social, educational and agrarian activities in his home State. A prominent Kisan Leader, he worked hard for creating consciousness among the workers and peasants and authored the book titled Kisan Union Kyon. He was closely associated with various organisations working for establishment of Panchayat Raj and was founder of Rajasthan Panchayat Raj Sangh.
In princely states of Rajputana, which came into existence on 30 March 1949, the farmers were tenants of the land and their condition was deplorable under the exploitation of landlords called Jajirdars, Zamindars and Bishwedars etc. The tenant had no right over the land cultivated by him. He was only the tiller of the soil, but was under the whimsical mercy of those landlords. But the farmers as a class were awakening in Bikaner state under the leadership of Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya and there was turmoil of the tiller demanding, “Land to tiller”. This hostile state of affairs led the newly formed state government to take immediate steps to reconcile the situation. The pressure of protection of the tenants was so immense that the government had to take immediate steps and with this aim “The Rajasthan Protection of Tenants Ordinance, 1949” was promulgated to meet the burning need of the time. The Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act, 1952 was the landmark in the legal history of land reforms in Rajasthan. The pressure of farmers united under the leadership of Chaudhary Kumbharam Arya forced the state government to promulgate The Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 which became applicable to the whole of Rajasthan. The overriding effect of this Act provided relief to the existing tenants and the rights accrued to tenants accordingly. He also amended the rules of felling trees in favour of farmers. Farmers were not allowed to fell trees from his land. This caused great difficulty. It was he who pressurized the state government to amend the rules and permit the farmer to fell trees from land of his ownership for his own use.
Shri Kumbha Ram Arya died on 26 October 1995 at the age of 81 years.ARYA, SHRI KUMBHA RAM (Janata (S)— Rajasthan, Sikar, 1980] s. of Shri Bhaira Ram Chaudhary; b. at Phephana Village Nohar Tahsil, Shri Ganganagar District, June, 1914; Matriculate; m.
