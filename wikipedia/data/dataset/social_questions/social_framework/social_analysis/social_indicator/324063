Community-based economics or community economics is an economic system that encourages local substitution. It is most similar to the lifeways of those practicing voluntary simplicity, including traditional Mennonite, Amish, and modern eco-village communities. It is also a subject in urban economics, related to moral purchasing and local purchasing.
Various specific programs for community economics and local currency, e.g. Ithaca Hours, are often promoted in green politics. Notably, the Ten Key Values of the Green Party include them as fundamental parts of a green program.
Recently, the more mainstream approach of Independent Business Alliance organizing has spread across the U.S., helping independent, locally owned businesses compete effectively and countering the spread of corporate chains at the local level.
