Radio Marañón was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1976 to further the integral development of the people in northern Peru. It is headquartered in the Apostolic Vicariate of Jaén which is also administered by the Jesuits, and is named for the chief source of the Amazon River, the Marañón River, which flows through Jaén.
