Worth1000 was an image manipulation and contest website. Worth1000 opened on January 1, 2002, and hosted over 340,000 unique images made in theme contests such as "Rejected Transformers", "Invisible World", and "Stupid Protests". In mid-2003, Worth1000 began hosting similar competitions for photography, creative writing, and multimedia. The service was shut down on 1 October 2013. In June 2014 the site was acquired by Sydney based crowdsourcing website DesignCrowd from Emerge Media.
The website was designed by Avi Muchnick and Israel Derdik. Muchnick named it after the old saying "a picture is worth a thousand words".
The site had been featured in many different publications, TV shows and stations, and radio including PC Magazine, Popular Science, ABC's Good Morning America, BBC, CNN, New York Times, Weekly World News, Detroit Free Press, TechTV, USA Today, G4, Inside Edition, and many others.
Worth1000 and its members have created three books on image manipulation: When Pancakes Go Bad, I've Got a Human in My Throat, and More Than One Way to Skin a Cat.
