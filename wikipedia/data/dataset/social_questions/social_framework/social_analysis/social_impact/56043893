The Gesellschaft zur Rechtlichen und Humanitären Unterstützung (GRH) is a German historical revisionist organisation consisting of former employees of the East German secret police, the Stasi. It is led by the last Stasi chief, Wolfgang Schwanitz. In Germany the organisation is best known for its attempt to portray the Stasi in a positive light and for trivializing or denying the political repression in East Germany. It has become widely known in Germany for massively disturbing memorial ceremonies or other forms of public events relating to political repression in East Germany. It has also been accused of harrassing victims of the East German regime and journalists and politicians. GRH has been described by historian Hubertus Knabe, the Director of the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, as an "aid association for state criminals."
