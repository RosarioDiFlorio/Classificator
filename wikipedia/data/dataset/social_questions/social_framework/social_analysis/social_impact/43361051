NewsFix is an American television news program produced for CW affiliates KDAF in Dallas-Fort Worth, KIAH in Houston, Texas and WSFL-TV in Miami (all of which are owned by Tribune Broadcasting) that originally premiered on March 19, 2011 on KIAH.
The program – airing daily on the former two stations at 5:00 and 9:00 p.m. Central Time and on the latter two at 10:00 p.m. local time (Eastern Time in Miami, and Central in Houston) – utilizes a long-form format similar to a newsreel, with all stories presented primarily through video footage filmed by photojournalists employed by both stations and filed from affiliate news video services; it is targeted at a younger demographic (specifically those aged 12 to 34) that may receive news through online and other digital services rather than through television.
