A Media Contacts Database is a media database that is specific for people in the media, most commonly journalists. A Media Contacts Database consists mainly of a list of journalists (reporters, editors, publishers, contributors, freelance journalists, TV show anchors, radio show hosts, DJs etc.), and the media-type they work for.
A Media Contacts database usually contains the following information:
Full name of the media contact,
The publication or channel they work for,
Designations (past and present),
Topics they cover, or their beat,
Contact Information found in public domains,
Online Presence like blogs and other social networking sites,
Education Information, etc.
Information available may be more or less, based on the research methods of the media research company that creates the database.
