Attitude toward the ad is defined as "a predisposition to respond in a favorable or unfavorable manner to a particular advertising stimulus during a particular exposure occasion." After Mitchell and Olsen (1981) and Shimp (1981) introduced the importance of the Aad construct, research on the causal relationships among Aad and other measures of advertising effectiveness become a main study stream. In the causal relationship, Aad usually acts a moderator, and it influences on brand attitude (Ab) and intention to purchase the brand (purchase intention, PI). Based on conceptual and empirical research on Aad, four alternative models of attitude toward the ad are postulated.
