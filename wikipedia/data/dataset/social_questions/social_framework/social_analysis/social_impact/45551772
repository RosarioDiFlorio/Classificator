Dialogue is defined as “any negotiated exchange of ideas and opinions” (Kent & Taylor, 1998, p. 325). Public relations can facilitate dialogue by establishing channels and procedures for dialogic communication (Kent & Taylor, 2002). Dialogic theory argues that organizations should be willing to interact with publics in honest and ethical ways in order to create effective organization-public communication channels (Kent, Taylor, & White, 2003).
