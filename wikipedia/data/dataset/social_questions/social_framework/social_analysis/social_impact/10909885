The International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) is a global network of communications professionals.
Each summer, IABC hosts World Conference, a three-day event with professional development seminars and activities, as well as talks by industry leaders.
Decisions within the organization are made by a two-thirds vote of the executive board, which is elected by members. IABC members agree to follow a professional code of ethics, which encourages members to do what is legal, ethical and in good taste.
