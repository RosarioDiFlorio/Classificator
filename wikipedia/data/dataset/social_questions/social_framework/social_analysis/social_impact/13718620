In advertising, the effective frequency is the number of times a person must be exposed to an advertising message before a response is made and before exposure is considered wasteful.
The subject on effective frequency is quite controversial. Many people have their own definition on what this word means. There are also numerous studies with their own theories or models as to what the correct number is for effective frequency.
