AK Trolls (Turkish: AK Troller, Aktroller) are state-sponsored anonymous Internet political commentators and trolls recruited by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey. They are similar to the infamous "Kremlinbots". In 2015 it was confirmed that AK Trolls are directly funded by the state, with most of the state-sponsored Internet trolls being people aged 20-25. The youth wing of the Justice and Development Party (AK Gen√ßlik) is presumed responsible for heading the web brigade.
