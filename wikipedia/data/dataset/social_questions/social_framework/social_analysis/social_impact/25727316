Glenn Hema Inwood (born 1968) is a New Zealand public relations specialist and the founder of Omeka Public Relations. His duties with the Wellington-based Omeka include acting as the speaker for the Institute of Cetacean Research, the Japanese organisation that lobbies on behalf of the whaling industry. A Japanese Government audit in 2012 found Japan spent funds intended for reconstruction after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami on other projects including the whaling industry. He has been dubbed "Ginza Glenn" by anti-whaling activists. Glenn also operates Wellington based media company "Spin It Wide" which distributes press releases from Imperial Tobacco.
