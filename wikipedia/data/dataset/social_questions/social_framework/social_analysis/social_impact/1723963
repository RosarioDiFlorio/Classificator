Roger Jason Stone Jr. (born August 27, 1952) is an American political consultant, lobbyist, and strategist, noted for his use of opposition research usually for candidates of the Republican Party.
In 1980, he co-founded the Washington, DC-based lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone with principals Paul Manafort and Charles R. Black Jr.. They recruited Peter G. Kelly and the firm was renamed Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly in 1984. During the 1980s, BMSK leveraged its "White House connections" to attract "high-paying clients" including "U.S. corporations", "trade associations", and foreign governments. By 1990, it was "one of the leading lobbyists for American companies and foreign organizations".
Stone has variously been referred to in media as a "political dirty trickster," a "renowned infighter," a "seasoned practitioner of hard-edged politics," and a "veteran Republican strategist." Over the course of his political career, Stone has been widely regarded as promoting a number of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Stone is the subject of a Netflix documentary film, titled Get Me Roger Stone.
