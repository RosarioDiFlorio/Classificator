The prerogative to respect diversity, often said to "begin with biodiversity" of non-human life, is basic to some 20th-century studies, such as cultural ecology, Queer studies, and anthropological linguistics.
In various forms it is promoted by many political movements, most notably feminism, gay rights, green politics , animal rights and the anti-globalization movement. However it means somewhat different things in each of these. To some, diversity means bio-diversity and the existence of several distinct races and cultures. To others, diversity means the mixing and reunification of races and cultures into one, as per the melting pot idea.
Prescriptions to respect (non-biological) diversity are common in:
community-based economics, i.e. no one policy for all regions, especially all ecoregions
diversity training that is designed to encourage people to be aware of how different people perceive the world and how an awareness of this can enhance efficiency of an organisation
consensus decision making support
