Cyberwarfare by Russia includes denial of service attacks, hacker attacks, dissemination of disinformation and propaganda, participation of state-sponsored teams in political blogs, internet surveillance using SORM technology, persecution of cyber-dissidents and other active measures. According to investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, some of these activities have been coordinated by the Russian signals intelligence, which is part of the FSB and was formerly a part of the 16th KGB department, An analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2017 outlines Russia's view of "Information Confrontation" or IPb (informatsionnoye protivoborstvo) as "strategically decisive and critically important to control its domestic populace and influence adversary states", delineating the term 'Information Confrontation' into two categories of "Informational-Technical" and "Informational-Psychological" Effects. The former encompasses network operations relating to defense, attack, and exploitation with the latter relating to "attempts to change people's behavior or beliefs in favor of Russian governmental objectives."
