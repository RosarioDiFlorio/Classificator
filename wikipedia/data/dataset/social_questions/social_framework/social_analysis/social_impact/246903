Apologetics (from Greek ἀπολογία, "speaking in defense") is the religious discipline of defending or attempting to prove the truth of religious doctrines through systematic argumentation and discourse. Early Christian writers (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against critics and recommended their faith to outsiders were called Christian apologists. In 21st century usage, 'apologetics' is often identified with debates over religion and theology.
