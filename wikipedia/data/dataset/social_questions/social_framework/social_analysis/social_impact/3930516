Star Trek is one of the most culturally-influential television shows, and is often regarded as the most influential science fiction TV series in history.
The original series, which aired in the late 1960s, has since spawned six successor series and thirteen movies as of December 2017, a plethora of merchandise, and a multibillion-dollar industry collectively known as the Star Trek franchise. The franchise is owned by CBS Television Studios, which now owns television properties previously held by Paramount Pictures, the studio that produced Star Trek for many decades; CBS Paramount continues to hold DVD rights to the TV series, and the rights to produce feature films.
Two films, Galaxy Quest and Free Enterprise, and a television series, The Orville, have been inspired by the cultural influence of Star Trek.
