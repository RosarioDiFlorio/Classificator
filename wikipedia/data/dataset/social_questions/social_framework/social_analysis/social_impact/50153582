Mind shaping or mindshaping in the context of social cognition means socializing individuals in ways that make human populations more homogeneous. It relies on man's capacities and dispositions to imitate, to be natural learners, and to conform to and enforce social norms.
In derived usage, mindshaping is a euphemistic term frequently used in marketing and management context for the active and on-purpose shaping of consumer's minds through any of the following, often for long-term influencing of customer behaviour for the mind shaper's profit:
experiential and social marketing
customer relationship management
indoctrination
persuasion
persuasion techniques

subliminal suggestion
brainwashing
Instead of active influence through others, there are also a number of self-help techniques that are marketed and sold with the promise to help the customer alter his or her mindset towards a better (more relaxed, ambitious, etc.) attitude through meditation, self-suggestion, etc.
