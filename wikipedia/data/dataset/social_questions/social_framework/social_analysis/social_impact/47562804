The conspiracy-effect  describes the finding that mere exposure to popular conspiracy theories can have a negative impact on pro-social decision-making and acceptance of established scientific principles. The term "conspiracy-effect" was coined by Sander van der Linden, a social-psychologist at Cambridge University. The conspiracy-effect refers to the idea that conspiracy theories are "sticky" and that even brief exposure to conspiratorial thinking may be sufficient to decrease civic engagement and cooperation in real-life social dilemmas, such as charitable giving, childhood vaccinations, support for actions that help reduce global warming and intentions to vote.
