The Bible and Its Influence is a textbook first published in 2005 to facilitate teaching about the Bible in American public high schools. Its publishers, the Bible Literacy Project, say the textbook allows schools to study the Bible academically while fully respecting the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is designed for teaching either a semester course or a full-year course on the literary and historical influence of the Bible.
The development took over five years, at a cost of $2 million, with contributions from 40 evangelical, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish and secular experts.
