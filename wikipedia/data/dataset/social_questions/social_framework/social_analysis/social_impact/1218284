Biopolitics is an intersectional field between biology and politics.
The term was coined by Rudolf Kjell√©n, who also coined the term geopolitics, in his 1905 two-volume work The Great Powers. In contemporary US political science studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a poststructuralist group using the meaning assigned by Michel Foucault (denoting social and political power over life) and another group who uses it to denote studies relating biology and political science.
