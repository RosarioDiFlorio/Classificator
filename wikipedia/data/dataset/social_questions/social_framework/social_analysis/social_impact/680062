Miguel Serrano (10 September 1917 â€“ 28 February 2009) was a Chilean diplomat, journalist and author of poetry, books on spiritual questing and Esoteric Hitlerism. From the 1950s up to 1970, when he was dismissed by Salvador Allende, he served as ambassador to India, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Austria.
Serrano's anti-modernist neo-Gnostic philosophy claims to elucidate the otherworldly origin of the Hyperborean-descended Aryan race, image-bearers of the Godhead, and postulates a global conspiracy against them by an evil inferior godlet: The Demiurge, worshipped by the Jewish people, lord of planet Earth, spawner of the primitive hominid stocks, and author of all base materiality. Serrano foremostly synthesized the Hindu-Vedic and Nordic-Germanic religious traditions, both of which he considered to be of ancient Aryan-Hyperborean provenance, in addition to particularly esoteric and racialist interpretations of Buddhism, Christianity (or "Kristianism"), Luciferianism (not to be confused with Satanism), and Gnosticism. He was especially indebted to the Jungian theory of collective racial archetypes, borrowed heavily from Julius Evola in supporting a spiritual consideration of race, as opposed to a solely biological one, and followed Savitri Devi in regarding Adolf Hitler as an avatar (a divine incarnation) who battled against the demonic materialistic hosts of the Kali Yuga.
