Reeducation in Romanian communist prisons was a series of processes initiated after the installment of the communist regime at the end of the second world war, that targeted the people who were considered hostile to the party, the political prisoners, both from the established prisons and labor camps. The purpose of the process was the indoctrination of the hostile elements with the Marxist–Leninist ideology, that would lead to the failure of any active or passive resistance movement. Reeducation was either non-violent – e.g. via communist propaganda – or violent, as it was done in the Pitești and Gherla prisons.
