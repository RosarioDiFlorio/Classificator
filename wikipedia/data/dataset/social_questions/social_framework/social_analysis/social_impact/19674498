Delegitimisation (also spelled delegitimation) is literally the withdrawal of legitimacy, usually from some institution such as a state, cultural practice, etc. which may have acquired it explicitly or implicitly, by statute or accepted practice.
A sociopsychological process which undermines or marginalises an entity by presenting facts and/or value judgments which are construed to withdraw legitimacy is generally observed.
A necessary process for the advancement of human culture, it can in some cases be a self-justifying mechanism, with the ultimate goal of justifying harm of an outgroup.
The concept applies to a wide spectrum of social contexts ranging from disputes about political entities to chronic illnesses.
