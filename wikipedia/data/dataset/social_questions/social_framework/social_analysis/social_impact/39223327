Safety-valve organization or safety-valve institution is a term used in sociology to describe organizations which serve to allow discontented individuals to act out their opposition to other elements, as it were "to let off steam". Safety-valve organizations reduce tensions in society and in the structural-functionalist perspective can be said to have a tension-reducing latent function. Safety-valve organizations are outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, and such organizations prevent tensions from accumulating; thus tolerance of some deviant behavior in various safety-valve organizations prevents more serious problems. Therefore, one of the primary functions of the deviance itself is to act as a safety-valve. Without safety-valve organizations, interactions between certain groups would become much more limited, and conflict much more severe.
