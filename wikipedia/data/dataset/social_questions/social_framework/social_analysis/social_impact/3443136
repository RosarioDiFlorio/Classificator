A non-apology apology, sometimes called a nonpology or fauxpology, is a statement that has the form of an apology but does not express remorse. It is common in both politics and public relations.
An example of a non-apology apology would be saying "I'm sorry that you feel that way" to someone who has been offended by a statement. This apology does not admit that there was anything wrong with the remarks made, and additionally, it may imply that the person taking offense was hypersensitive or irrational in taking offense. Another form of non-apology is one which does not apologize directly to the person who was injured or insulted, but instead offers a generic apology "to anyone who might have been offended".
Statements that use the word "sorry" but do not express responsibility for wrongdoing may be meaningful expressions of regret, but such statements can also be used to elicit forgiveness without acknowledging fault.
