The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (PEIC or PACEI), also called the Voter Fraud Commission, is a temporary commission established in May 2017 by United States President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13799 (E.O. 13799, 82 FR 22389) on May 11, 2017. The Trump administration has said the commission would review claims of voter fraud, improper registration, and voter suppression. The establishment of the commission followed through on previous unsubstantiated claims by Trump that millions of illegal immigrants had voted in the 2016 United States presidential election. Vice President Mike Pence serves as Chair of the Commission, with Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, serving as Vice Chair.
On June 28, 2017 Kobach wrote a letter in conjunction with the Department of Justice requesting personal voter information from every state. The request was met with significant bipartisan backlash.
Trump's creation of the commission has been criticized by voting rights advocates, scholars and experts, and newspaper editorial boards as a pretext for, and prelude to, voter suppression.
