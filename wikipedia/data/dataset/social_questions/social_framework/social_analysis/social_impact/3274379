A recruitment tool is an advertising method that aids in creating interest in and getting people for a typically political organization. Historically recruitment tools have often taken the form of posters or films, though in modern times recruitment tools have taken the form of advergame video games. Other tools include things like sponsorships of sporting events, or ads on TV.
