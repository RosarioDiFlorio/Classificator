People-first language is a type of linguistic prescription in English to avoid perceived and subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with with a health issue or disabilities. It is a type of disability etiquette but can be applied to any group which is defined by a condition rather than as a people. Rather than using a label or an adjective to define individuals, People-first language puts the person before the diagnosis and describes what the person has, not what the person is, for example, "those that are homeless" rather than "the homeless"as "being diagnosed with an illness or disorder". Critics point out that separating the "person" from the "trait" implies that the trait is inherently bad or "less than", and thus dehumanizes people with disabilities.
