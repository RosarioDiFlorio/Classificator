Harry Elmer Barnes (June 15, 1889 â€“ August 25, 1968) was an American historian who, in his later years, was known for his historical revisionism and Holocaust denial. Barnes taught history at Columbia University from 1918 to 1929. Afterwards, he worked as a freelance writer and occasional adjunct professor at smaller schools. Through his position at Columbia and his prodigious scholarly output, Barnes was once highly regarded as a historian. However, by the end of the 1950s, he had lost credibility because of the major role he played in the inception of the Holocaust denial movement.
Barnes was a writer who used his wide reading to summarize vast quantities of information and present histories that would be "usable" to his readers. He published more than 30 books, 100 essays, and 600 articles and book reviews, making him one of the most prolific writers in the social sciences.
