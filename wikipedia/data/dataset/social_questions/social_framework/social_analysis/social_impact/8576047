Restaurant media is an emerging form of retail media advertising used in cafeterias, fast food and family restaurants and diners and that reaches consumers while they dine.
For decades most fast food restaurant chains employed various in-store advertising media such as billboards, posters and paper tray covers and these media are rapidly being replaced by digital signage. The concept of delivering multimedia content to customers of fast food restaurants and food courts emerged in the early 1990s and became increasingly popular in recent years. Burger King and Tim Hortons were among the first fast food restaurant chains to deploy digital signage projects involving plasma displays, LCD panels, self-service interactive kiosks in their restaurants
