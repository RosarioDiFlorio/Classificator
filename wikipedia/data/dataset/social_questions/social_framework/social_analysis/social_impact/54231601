The subject material originated from the National Security Agency (NSA). On June 3, 2017, while employed by military contractor Pluribus International Corporation, Winner was arrested on suspicion of leaking an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections to the news website The Intercept. The report suggested that Russian hackers attacked a U.S. voting software supplier. Twice denied the setting of bail, Winner is being held at the Lincoln County Jail in Lincolnton, Georgia.
