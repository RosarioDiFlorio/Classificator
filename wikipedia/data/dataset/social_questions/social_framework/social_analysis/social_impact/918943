Denis Sefton Delmer (24 May 1904 – 4 September 1979) was a British journalist of Australian heritage and propagandist for the British government. Fluent in German, he became friendly with Ernst Röhm who arranged for him to interview Adolf Hitler in 1931. During the Second World War he led a black propaganda campaign against Hitler by radio from England, so successful that he was named in the Nazis' Black Book for immediate arrest after their invasion of England.
