The amity-enmity complex was a term introduced by Sir Arthur Keith. His work, A New Theory of Human Evolution (1948), posited that humans evolved as differing races, tribes, and cultures, exhibiting patriotism, morality, leadership and nationalism. Those who belong are part of the in-group, and tolerated; all others are classed as out-group, and subject to hostility; 'The code of enmity is a necessary part of the machinery of evolution. He who feels generous towards his enemy...has given up his place in the turmoil of evolutionary competition.' Conscience in humans evolved a duality; to protect and save friends, and also to hate and fight enemies.  Keith's work summarized earlier opinions on human tribalism by Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Herbert Spencer.
