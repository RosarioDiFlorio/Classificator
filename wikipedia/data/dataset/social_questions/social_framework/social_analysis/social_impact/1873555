A satellite media tour (SMT) is a technique used by corporations (primarily) to provide an "expert" of their choosing to local television news broadcasts for often-live interaction, with the goal of getting out a specific message. Satellite media tours are related to, and often used in conjunction with, Video News Releases. For example, a special version of a satellite media tour interview is often edited and distributed as a video news release, with the broadcaster adding in its own additional voice-over. Radio interviews are often booked during the satellite window to create a combo SMT/RMT. Co-op Satellite media tours, a common form, use one expert to make recommendations funded by more than one client, all under one category (e.g. "Four Great Ideas for Cleaning Your Bathroom").
