Devin Gerald Nunes GOIH () (born October 1, 1973) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. Representative for California's 22nd congressional district since 2003. A Republican, he serves as chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and served as a member of President Trump's transition team. Nunes's district, numbered as the 21st from 2003 to 2013, is in the San Joaquin Valley and includes most of western Tulare County and much of eastern Fresno County.
In early 2017, he was criticized for his alleged bias in a Congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On April 6, 2017, he temporarily stepped aside from leading that investigation while the Office of Congressional Ethics investigates charges that he improperly disclosed classified information to the public, but he remains committee chairman for other purposes. Nunes has denied the allegations. The Office of Congressional Ethics later cleared Nunes of allegations that he disclosed classified information to the public.
