Developed by the Canadian Mining Human Resources Council (MiHR), Mining for Diversity is a mining employer's guide to attract, recruit, and retain a diverse workforce. The guide was generated based on the research conducted by MiHR and the Conference Board of Canada which identified successful attraction, recruitment, and retention initiatives underway in the Canadian mining industry.
In the development of this guide, more than 27 Canadian mining companies, representing an array of mine types, commodities and regions, participated in the research and shared what worked for them in attracting, recruiting and retaining employees. This tool highlights several mining companies that share their "HR best practices" focusing on engaging, youth, mature workers, new Canadians, and women in the mining industry.
