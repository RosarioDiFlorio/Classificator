Sexual jihad (Arabic: جهاد النكاح‎, jihad al-nikah) refers to the purported practice in which Sunni women sympathetic to the Salafi jihadism travel to the battlefields and are voluntarily offering themselves to rebels fighting the Bashar al Assad government in Syria to be "married" repeatedly in a temporary marriage, serving sexual comfort roles to help boost the fighters' morale.
Publicity first arose in 2013, and the veracity of the practice became the subject of greater debate in September 2013 after the Interior Minister of the 98% Muslim nation of Tunisia made a public statement identifying it as a significant issue. Critics dismissed claims of "sexual jihad" as unfounded and political propaganda, aforementioned denial of this "real phenomenon" has been rejected by several media outlets as cover up and sexual jihad was declared as valid part of Wahhabi ideology by several religious clerics in their interviews to media.
