On August 31, 2015, 381 sockpuppet accounts on the English Wikipedia were discovered operating a secret paid editing ring. Its participants extorted money from mid-sized businesses who had articles about themselves rejected. Nicknamed "Orangemoody" after the first account uncovered, it was Wikipedia's biggest conflict-of-interest scandal at the time, exceeding the scope of the Wiki-PR editing of Wikipedia incident in which approximately 250 sockpuppets were found and blocked in 2013.
The story was reported by hundreds of English and non-English language news sources, including Komsomolskaya Pravda, Le Monde and Die Zeit. The editing was described by various media as "black hat" editors (Tech Crunch), "dishonest editing" (PC World), "extortion" (Wired), a "blackmail scam" (The Independent), and an "extensive cybercrime syndicate" (ThinkProgress).
