The generalized entropy index has been proposed as a measure of income inequality in a population. It is derived from information theory as a measure of redundancy in data. In information theory a measure of redundancy can be interpreted as non-randomness or data compression; thus this interpretation also applies to this index. In additional interpretation of the index is as biodiversity as entropy has also been proposed as a measure of diversity.
