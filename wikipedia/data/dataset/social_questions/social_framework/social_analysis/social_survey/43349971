The proletariat ( from Latin proletarius) is the class of wage-earners in a capitalist society whose only possession of significant material value is their labour-power (their ability to work). A member of such a class is a proletarian. In Marxist theory, a dictatorship of proletarians is for the proletariat, through the proletariat and by the proletariat. This, in Marxist theory, will lead to proletarian self abolition and, thus, communism.
