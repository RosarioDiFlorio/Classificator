The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) was established in August 1993 to investigate the impact and progression of HIV disease in women. The WIHS enrolls both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The core portion of the study includes a detailed and structured interview, physical and gynecologic examination, and laboratory testing. The WIHS participants are also asked to enroll in various sub-studies, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and neurocognition. New proposals for WIHS sub-studies are submitted for approval by various scientific investigators from around the world.
