The principle governing alternative energy indexes, apart from a regional or global focus, is that some focus on clean energy technologies while others focus on the broader alternative energy transition. Other factors which differentiate the indices are whether they:
focus on pure play companies – that is on companies which are principally engaged in the field of alternative energy and excludes those companies for which alternative energy is peripheral to their main business.
use a rule-based approach – that is a clearly defined rules-based methodology, usually overseen by an impartial Index Committee, employing a pre-defined screening methodology ensures that the process is consistent and transparent.
are inclusive – that is strives to include all companies that are principally engaged in the field of alternative energy within a given market, a given region, or globally. Some indexes set a liquidity or market capitalization filter while others track just a predetermined number of companies (i.e. the top 15 or the top 20).
