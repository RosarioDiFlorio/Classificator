Net capital outflow (NCO) is the net flow of funds being invested abroad by a country during a certain period of time (usually a year). A positive NCO means that the country invests outside more than the world invests in it and vice versa. NCO is one of two major ways of characterizing the nature of a country's financial and economic interaction with the other parts of the world (the other being the balance of trade).
