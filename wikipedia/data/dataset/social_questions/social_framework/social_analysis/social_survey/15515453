The equity ratio is a financial ratio indicating the relative proportion of equity used to finance a company's assets. The two components are often taken from the firm's balance sheet or statement of financial position (so-called book value), but the ratio may also be calculated using market values for both, if the company's equities are publicly traded.
The equity ratio is a very common financial ratio, especially in Central Europe and Japan, while in the US the debt to equity ratio is more often used in financial (research) reports.
The formula for calculating D/E ratios can be represented in the following way: Debt - Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity The result may often be expressed as a number or as a percentage. This form of D/E may often be referred to as risk or gearing.
