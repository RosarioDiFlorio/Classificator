Sustainable return on investment (S-ROI) is a methodology for identifying and quantifying environmental, societal, and economic impacts of investment in projects and initiatives (e.g., factories, new product development, civil infrastructure, efficiency and recycling programs, etc.).
The goal of S-ROI is to make risk-opportunity assessments more robust by providing new visibility into intangible internal costs and benefits, and externalities - social, economic, and environmental effects that are typically not considered in traditional cash-oriented project planning.
Because it includes environmental impacts, S-ROI is distinct from the similarly named methodology of Social Return on Investment (SROI).
