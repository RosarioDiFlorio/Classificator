Days in inventory (also known as 'Inventory Days of Supply(DoS)', 'Days Inventory Outstanding' or 'the Inventory Period') is an efficiency ratio that measures the average number of days the company holds its inventory before selling it. The ratio measures the number of days funds are tied up in inventory. Inventory levels (measured at cost) are divided by sales per day (also measured at cost rather than selling price.)
The formula for DII is:

    {\displaystyle DII={\dfrac {average~inventory}{COGS/Days}}}
  
where the average inventory is the average of inventory levels at the beginning and end of an accounting period, and COGS/day is calculated by dividing the total cost of goods sold per year by 365 days.
This is equivalent to the 'average days to sell the inventory' which is calculated as:

  
    
      
        
          Average days to sell the inventory
        
        =
        
          
            365 days
            Inventory Turnover Ratio
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{Average days to sell the inventory}}={\frac {\mbox{365 days}}{\mbox{Inventory Turnover Ratio}}}}
