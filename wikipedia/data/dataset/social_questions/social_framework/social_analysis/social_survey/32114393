Cash return on cash invested (CROCI), or cash return on capital invested, is an advanced valuation multiple. This ratio compares a post-tax, pre-interest operating cash flow to gross cash invested by all security-holders and is a useful measure of a companyâ€™s ability to generate cash returns on its investments.
The ratio is similar to ROE ratio, but CROCI is calculated on a cash basis and on an EV-basis, taking into account all the company's security-holders.
