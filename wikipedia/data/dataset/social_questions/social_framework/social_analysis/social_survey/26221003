Advertising elasticity of demand (or simply advertising elasticity, often shortened to AED) is an elasticity measuring the effect of an increase or decrease in advertising on a market. Although traditionally considered as being positively related, demand for the good that is subject of the advertising campaign can be inversely related to the amount spent if the advertising is negative.
