The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) is a holistic measure of the production characteristics of large economic systems, usually whole countries. As most of the measurements used in complexity economics, the goal of this index is to explain an economic system as a whole rather than the sum of its parts. The ECI looks to explain the knowledge accumulated in a country's population (the networks that people form) and that is expressed in the country's industrial composition. To achieve this goal, the ECI combines metrics of the diversity of countries and the ubiquity of products to create measures of the relative complexity of a country's exports. The product equivalent of the Economic Complexity Index is the Product Complexity Index of PCI.
