The V2 ratio (V2R) is a measure of excess return per unit of exposure to loss of an investment asset, portfolio or strategy, compared to a given benchmark.
The goal of the V2 ratio is to improve on existing and popular measures of risk-adjusted return, such as the Sharpe ratio, information ratio or Sterling ratio by taking into account the psychological impact of investment performances. The V2 ratio over-penalizes investments for which the investors had to go through bad returns comparatively to the market.
The V2R is calculated as:
