Labor intensity is the relative proportion of labor (compared to capital) used in a process. Its inverse is capital intensity.
Labour intensity has been declining since the onset of the industrial revolution in late 1700s, while its inverse, capital intensity, has increased near exponentially since the latter half of the 20th century.
