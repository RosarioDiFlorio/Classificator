Import ratio, in economics and government finance, is the ratio of total imports of a country to that countryâ€™s total foreign exchange (FX) reserves. The ratio can be inverted and is referred to as the reserves to imports ratio. This ratio divides a country's average foreign exchange reserve by a country's average monthly level of imports.
