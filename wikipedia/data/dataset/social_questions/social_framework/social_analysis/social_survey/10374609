The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) is a multidisciplinary and cross-national panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status as well as social and family networks of more than 45,000 individuals aged 50 or over. As such, it responds to a Communication by the European Commission calling to "examine the possibility of establishing, in co-operation with Member States, a European Longitudinal Ageing Survey". By now SHARE has become a major pillar of the European Research Area and in 2008 was selected as one of the projects to be implemented in the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).
