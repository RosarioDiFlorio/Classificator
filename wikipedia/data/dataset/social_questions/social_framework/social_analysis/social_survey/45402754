The Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) is a statistical survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on behalf of the Central Bank of Ireland as part of the European Central Bank (ECB) Household Finance and Consumption Network (HFCN).
The HFCS is designed to collect household-level data on householdsâ€™ finances and consumption, and is required by all Eurozone countries to facilitate comparable data analysis for the Euro area as a whole.
