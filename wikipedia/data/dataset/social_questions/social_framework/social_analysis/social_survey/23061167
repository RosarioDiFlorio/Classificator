The Scottish index of multiple deprivation is a tool used by local authorities, the Scottish government, the NHS and other government bodies in Scotland.
The 2016 release, known as SIMD16, was issued in August of that year and replaced the 2012 dataset.
The Scottish index of multiple deprivation measures across seven domains: current income, employment, health, education, skills and training, housing, geographic access and crime.
The principle behind the index is to target government action in the areas which need it most.
