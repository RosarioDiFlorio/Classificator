Constant elasticity of substitution (CES), in economics, is a property of some production functions and utility functions.
Specifically, it arises in a particular type of aggregator function which combines two or more types of consumption goods, or two or more types of production inputs into an aggregate quantity. This aggregator function exhibits constant elasticity of substitution.
