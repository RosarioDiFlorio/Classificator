The World Poverty Clock is a tool to monitor progress against poverty globally, and regionally. It provides real-time poverty data across countries. It was launched in Berlin at the re:publica conference in 2017,  and is funded by Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The clock seeks to address a gap in development data around social progress indicators, starting with poverty numbers, and tries to align them with economic and demographic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population clocks and forecasts respectively, which already have real-time and forward looking estimates.
