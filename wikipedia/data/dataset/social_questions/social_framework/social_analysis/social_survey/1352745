The efficiency ratio indicates the expenses as a percentage of revenue (expenses / revenue), with a few variations â€“ it is essentially how much a corporation or individual spends to make a dollar; entities are supposed to attempt minimizing efficiency ratios (reducing expenses and increasing earnings). The concept typically applies to banks. It relates to operating leverage, which measures the ratio between fixed costs and variable costs.
