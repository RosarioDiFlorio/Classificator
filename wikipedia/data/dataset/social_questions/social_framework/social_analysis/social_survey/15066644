Times interest earned (TIE) or interest coverage ratio is a measure of a company's ability to honor its debt payments. It may be calculated as either EBIT or EBITDA divided by the total interest payable.

            EBIT or EBITDA
            Interest Charges
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{Times-Interest-Earned}}={\frac {\mbox{EBIT or EBITDA}}{\mbox{Interest Charges}}}}
  
Interest Charges = Traditionally "charges" refers to interest expense found on the income statement.
When the interest coverage ratio is smaller than one, the company is not generating enough cash from its operations EBIT to meet its interest obligations. The Company would then have to either use cash on hand to make up the difference or borrow funds. Typically, it is a warning sign when interest coverage falls below 2.5x.
