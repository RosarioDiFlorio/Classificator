Consumer confidence is a key driver of economic growth and is widely considered a leading economic indicator of household spending on consumption. Consumers tend to increase consumption when they feel confident about the current and future economic situation of the country and their own financial conditions. In economies such as India and the US, where personal consumption accounts for more than 60% and 70% of GDP respectively, consumer confidence has a particularly significant impact on the economy. Measuring it can provide critical insight into the economy's growth prospects. Consumer sentiment indices are essential tools used by global investors and will be an immense aid to individual and institutional investors in India.
