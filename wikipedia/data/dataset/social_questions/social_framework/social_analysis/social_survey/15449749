Dividend payout ratio is the fraction of net income a firm pays to its stockholders in dividends:

  
    
      
        
          Dividend payout ratio
        
        =
        
          
            Dividends
            Net Income for the same period
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{Dividend payout ratio}}={\frac {\mbox{Dividends}}{\mbox{Net Income for the same period}}}}
  
The part of the earnings not paid to investors is left for investment to provide for future earnings growth. Investors seeking high current income and limited capital growth prefer companies with high Dividend payout ratio. However investors seeking capital growth may prefer lower payout ratio because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. High growth firms in early life generally have low or zero payout ratios. As they mature, they tend to return more of the earnings back to investors. Note that dividend payout ratio is calculated as DPS/EPS.
According to Financial Accounting by Walter T. Harrison, the calculation for the payout ratio is as follows:
Payout Ratio = (Dividends - Preferred Stock Dividends)/Net Income
The dividend yield is given by earnings yield times DPR:

Conversely, the P/E ratio is the Price/Dividend ratio times the DPR.
