The Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index (USDOLLAR) is an index (or measure) of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of four currencies: the Euro, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, and the Australian Dollar.
On its inception, January 1, 2011, USDOLLAR began with a value of 10,000. The index rises when the US dollar gains value against the other four currencies. The Index falls when the US Dollar loses value against the other currencies.
USDOLLAR is updated 24 hours a day from Sunday evening Eastern Time (early Monday morning Asia time) to late Friday afternoon Eastern Time. The index is calculated every 15 seconds, which allows the index to be used to benchmark U.S. dollar performance throughout the day.
