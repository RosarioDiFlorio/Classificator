The social earnings ratio, sometimes abbreviated to S/E, is a single-number metric, used to measure the social impact of various organisations. The non-financial metric is similar to the price earnings ratio, but instead focuses on valuation against social impact, rather than projected earnings.
The ratio was founded in 2011 by Olinga Ta'eed and a team of financial experts, in order to find a way of measuring financial investment against real social impact. It began as a university collaboration in the United Kingdom, before becoming an internationally recognized form of measurement, when the CCEG was founded.
In 2013, it was identified in a news article as "the most rapidly adopted metric in the world".
