This article lists Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product (GDP). As of 2015, Canada has a total GDP of USD$1.55 trillion, ranking 11th worldwide.
While Canadaâ€™s ten provinces and three territories exhibit high GDPs, there is wide variation among them. Ontario, the country's most populous province, is a manufacturing and trade locus with extensive linkages to the northeastern and midwestern United States; if compared to countries, Ontario's GDP would rank 20th largest (as of 2011) in the world. Conversely, territorial GDPs are comparable to those of smaller island nations and, in turn, smaller than many Canadian cities. The economies of the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland rely heavily on natural resources and these produce the highest per-capita GDP values in the country.
In the face of these long-term regional disparities, the Government of Canada redistributes some of its revenues through unconditional equalization payments and finances the delivery of comparable levels of government services through the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer.
