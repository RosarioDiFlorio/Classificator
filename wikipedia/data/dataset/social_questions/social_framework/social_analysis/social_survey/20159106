The Work Number is a user-paid verification of employment database created by TALX Corporation. TALX was acquired by Equifax Inc. in February 2007.
The Work Number allows requestors to receive immediate confirmation of an individual's employment and salary for verification purposes. The fee for this information is revealed only after the requester answers several personal questions.
It is used by over 50,000 organizations to verify employment data.
Some organizations that use the Work Number include Fannie Mae, Hilton Hotels, Rent-A-Center, the United States Postal Service, Domino's Pizza, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Missouri System. Founded in 1995, The Work Number has over 225 million employment records.
The Work Number is an example of outsourcing of a Human Resources department function.
Additionally, the adoption of The Work Number causes a change in the financial responsibility for verification of employment. In typical organizations, the cost of a verification of employment is borne completely by the employer and the actual cost of service is absorbed into the human resource department budget. In organizations using The Work Number, the cost is borne by the requestor of verification, who purchases either a single verification or a package of multiple verifications from TALX.
