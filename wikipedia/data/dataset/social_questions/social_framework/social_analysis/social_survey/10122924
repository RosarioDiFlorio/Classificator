The Rotterdam Study is a prospective, population-based cohort study. The aim of the Rotterdam Study is to investigate factors that determine the occurrence of cardiovascular, neurological, ophthalmological, endocrinological, and psychiatric diseases in elderly people.
The study was established in 1990 by professor Albert Hofman of the department Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. 
Inhabitants of Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam, were invited to participate on a regular basis.
