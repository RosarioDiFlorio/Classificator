Shadowstats.com is a website that analyzes and offers alternatives to government economic statistics for the United States. Shadowstats primarily focuses on inflation, but also keeps track of the money supply, unemployment and GDP by utilizing methodologies abandoned by previous administrations from the Clinton era to the Great Depression.
The site is authored by consulting economist Walter J. Williams, who holds a BA in Economics and an MBA from Dartmouth College. He is popularly known as "John Williams."
