The Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI) is a measure of poverty developed by Grameen Foundation in collaboration with the Ford Foundation, and managed by the Innovations for Poverty Action. The first PPI was released in 2006 and has since then been customised for 45 countries.
The PPI is based on questioner with 10 questions about a householdâ€™s characteristics and asset ownership are scored to compute the likelihood that the household is living below the poverty line. As of 2015, over 400 organizations have used PPI as part of their research. PPI is supported by an alliance of organizations including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Catholic Relief Services, International Finance Corporation, World Vision International and Acumen.
