The economics of open data refers to the production, or loss, of wealth related to the use of open data. The cost of open data is a primary concern that can deter governments any companies from the opening up of data. While open data may theoretically have a low production cost, the cost of creating the original data set as well as maintaining that data once it is produced can be expensive. Though the creation of data may be expensive governments around the world such as France, the United States, and Japan, are anticipating substantial economic growth.
