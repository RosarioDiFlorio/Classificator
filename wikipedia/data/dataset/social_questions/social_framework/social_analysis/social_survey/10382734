This is a comparison between U.S. states and countries by Gross Domestic Product (PPP). Many of the states of the United States have large Gross Domestic Product (called gross state product) which would rank highly on a list of countries world GDP. All data is for the year 2013.
These figures are based on the IMF list on List of countries by GDP (PPP) for world GDP, and the List of U.S. states by GDP figures.
Note: New England is not a state but a group of states which are oftentimes classified as such.
Note2: As the PPP is calculated in U.S. dollars for all countries there is no difference for the US economy in Nominal or in PPP terms as both are the same value for the U.S.
