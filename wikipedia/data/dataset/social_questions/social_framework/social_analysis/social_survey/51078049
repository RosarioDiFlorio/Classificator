The KFC Index is an informal guide to measure Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) comparing exchange rates in African countries. Similar to and inspired by the Big Mac Index, the key difference between the two indices is the KFC Index is focused solely on Africa, where the Big Mac Index coverage is limited in Africa as there is little presence of McDonald's in Africa, as opposed to KFC chains which operate in almost 20 countries across the continent.
