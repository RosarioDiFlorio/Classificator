Short-term business statistics (STS) are economic statistics published by Eurostat, the European Commission's statistical office. They cover each of the member states of the European Union, and provide aggregated results for the euro area and the EU. Short-term business statistics provide information on the economic development of four major domains: industry, construction, retail trade, and other services. These domains are defined in relation to a classification of economic activities, the NACE Rev.2 (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, second revision).
For the four domains the following variables are reported (most on a monthly, some on a quarterly basis):
Industry: Production, turnover (domestic and non-domestic), new orders (domestic and non-domestic), number of persons employed, hours worked, gross wages and salaries, output prices (domestic and non-domestic), import prices.
Construction: Production (total, of buildings and of civil engineering), number of persons employed, hours worked, gross wages and salaries, construction costs (material costs, wage costs), construction permits.
Retail trade and repair: Turnover, retail trade volume, number of persons employed.
Other services: Turnover, number of persons employed, output prices.
The legal authority for the European short-term business statistics is Regulation EC No 1165/98, as amended by Regulation EC No 1158/2005, and further implementing and amending regulations.
