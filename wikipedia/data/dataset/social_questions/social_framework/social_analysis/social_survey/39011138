The UK Data Service is a national data service that provides research access to a range of social and economic data collections including UK census data and government funded surveys as well as qualitative and business data.
It was established in October 2012 with funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The service incorporates several previous services also established by the ESRC, including the Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), Secure Data Service, and elements of the Census Programme including Census.ac.uk.
In October 2013, the UK Data Service received additional funding to coordinate the Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN), designed to streamline research access to data routinely collected by UK government departments and other agencies. The ADRN is phase one of the ESRC Big Data Network. 
UK Data Service is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories re3data.org.
