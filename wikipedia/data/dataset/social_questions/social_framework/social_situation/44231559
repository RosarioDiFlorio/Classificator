Child's Slave (Chinese: 孩奴 háinú) is used to describe some parents in China, especially those born in the 1980s, who are under pressure when raising their children. The pressures can be in form of financial, physical, or mental pressure. The parents who are "Child's Slave" lose their self-value and the purpose of life because they live and work only for their children. Also, their children are usually spoiled because of the indulgence of parents.
Similarly, there are also "House's Slave" and "Car's Slave", which means the people who are under living pressure of buying houses and cars.
