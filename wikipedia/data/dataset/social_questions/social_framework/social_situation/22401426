The Kamień Pomorski homeless hostel fire occurred in north-western Poland at 00:30 local time (23:30 UTC) on 13 April 2009. The fire occurred during the night at a three-story homeless hostel in Kamień Pomorski (West Pomeranian Voivodeship), a town with a population of 10,000 situated approximately 60 kilometres or 37 miles from the German border. 23 people, including 13 children [1] were pronounced dead, with a further 20 sustaining an injury of some sort. The hostel was completely destroyed and the corpses of many people were charred beyond recognition in a fire that the BBC called "one of the deadliest in living memory". It was Poland's deadliest fire since a fire destroyed a home for the mentally ill in Górna Grupa in 1980 claiming the lives of 55 victims.
