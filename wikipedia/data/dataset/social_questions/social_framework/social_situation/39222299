País do Desejo is a 2012 Brazilian-Portuguese drama film directed by Paulo Caldas. The film premiered at the 35th São Paulo International Film Festival.
The film is based in the case of a girl from Alagoinha, in Pernambuco. In 2009, the girl became pregnant after years of sexual abuse committed by the stepfather. As the pregnancy was the result of a rape and represented a risk to the life of the girl, she did an abortion, as is provided for in the Brazilian legislation.
The story is told from the center of the crisis of a Catholic priest that is positioned against the decision of the Archbishop of the Church to excommunicate the mother, the girl and the doctors involved in the abortion.
