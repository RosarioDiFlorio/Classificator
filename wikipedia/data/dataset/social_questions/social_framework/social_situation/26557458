Lack of physical education is the inadequacy of the provision and effectiveness of exercise and physical activity within modern education.
When physical education fails to meet its goals of providing students with the knowledge base, life habits, and mindset necessary to be physically active throughout their lifetime, it can lead children to adopt a sedentary lifestyle. According a 2010 study by the WHO, 81% of children aged 11â€“17 worldwide did not meet the minimum recommended exercise guidelines of 60 minutes daily.

Albeit more prevalent in countries of high income, physical inactivity is an international issue that is correlated with an obesity epidemic and negative physical, psychological, and academic consequences  in children.
