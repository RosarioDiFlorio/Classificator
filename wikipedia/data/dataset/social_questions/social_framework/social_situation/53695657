Hogar de Cristo, Guayaquil, "Home of Christ" â€“ HC, was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1971 in response to a critical shortage of housing in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and in accord with the preferential option for the poor which spread in the Catholic church after the Second Vatican Council of Bishops in the 1960s.
While HC continues to prefabricate homes in its complex of nine buildings for factory and storage, its activities have extended to supplying community facilities, education and worker training, health care, microcredit, and special services for abused women and children.
