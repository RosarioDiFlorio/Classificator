The Suitcase Clinic is a humanitarian student organization that has offered free services and supplies to the uninsured, homeless and low-income communities of Berkeley, California and the San Francisco Bay Area since 1989. The organization strives to promote the health and overall well-being of underserved individuals through service provision, cooperative learning, empowerment, and collective action among community and professional volunteers, students, and participants. Its three clinics operate at the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, the St. Mark's Episcopal Church, and the Dwight Way Women's Shelter.
Students of the organization plan, manage, and carry out all clinic operations. Its student-centered model has inspired the formation of other student-run free clinics such as the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project and the UCLA Mobile Clinic.
