Anarchism and nationalism both emerged in Europe following the French Revolution of 1789, and have a long and durable relationship going back at least to Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) and his involvement with the Pan-Slavic movement prior to his conversion to anarchism. There has been a long history of anarchist involvement with nationalism all over the world, as well as with internationalism.
Nevertheless, anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during the early 20th century of anationalism as well as of the Esperanto language. After the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, Francoist Spain persecuted anarchists and Catalan nationalists, among whom the use of Esperanto was extensive.
