The Tacoma riot of 1885, also known as the 1885 Chinese Expulsion of Tacoma or the Tacoma Method, involved the forceful expulsion of the Chinese population in Tacoma, Washington Territory on November 3, 1885. City leaders had earlier proposed a November 1 deadline for the Chinese population to leave the city. On November 3, 1885, a mob that consisted of prominent businessmen, law enforcement, and political leaders descended on the Chinese community. The mob marched Chinese residents to a railroad station and forced them to board a train to Portland. In the following days, the structures that remained in the Chinese community were razed. The event was the result of growing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence throughout the American West.
This organized action became known as "The Tacoma Method," and despite national and international outcry, it was used as an example of how to forcibly remove Chinese residents from cities and towns throughout the American West. The anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma and Washington Territory more broadly made it so that those involved did not face repercussions for their actions.
This impacted Chinese immigration to Tacoma for decades. In 1992, the Chinese Citizens Reconciliation Committee was created. In 1993, the Tacoma City Council issued a statement on the expulsion saying that it was "a most reprehensible occurrence." In 2005, Chinese Reconciliation Park broke ground on the Tacoma waterfront to commemorate the event.
