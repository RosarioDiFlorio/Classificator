Shanti Community Animation Movement was founded in 1977 by Jesuit Fr. Michael Catalano. His work began among shanty dwellers along the canals in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and extended to refugees from the 29-year civil war. The work depends largely on the contributed labor of volunteers and includes educational and building projects, while fostering peace, reconciliation, and human development among the diverse peoples of Sri Lanka.
