Bernard "Ben" Hana, a.k.a. "Blanket Man", (8 February 1957 – 15 January 2012) was a homeless man who wandered the inner city streets of Wellington, New Zealand. He was a local fixture and something of a celebrity, and was typically found on the footpath in the precincts of Cuba Street and Courtenay Place.
Hana was a self-proclaimed devotee of the Māori sun god Tama-nui-te-rā, and claimed that he should wear as few items of clothing as possible, as an act of religious observance. As a result, he would sometimes remove all his clothing, which resulted in the consequent attendance of police officers.
His name of "Blanket Man" was a reference to his usual mode of dress, which was a single blanket, long dreadlocks and either a loin cloth or briefs. His activities and presence provoked a degree of public debate within Wellington.
It's believed Hana chose to live on the streets after killing a friend in a drink-driving accident as a form of self-penance.
