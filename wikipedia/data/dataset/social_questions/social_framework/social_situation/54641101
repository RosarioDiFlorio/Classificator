Hogar de San José Foundation (St. Joseph Home Foundation) was founded in 1942 by the Society of Jesus in Gijón, Spain, to assist where families are unable to properly care for their children. It began with a school, and now runs three residential facilities and additional programs to train and accompany youth until they have achieved steady employment, also working with young immigrants. Another program assists parents or guardians in successful parenting.
