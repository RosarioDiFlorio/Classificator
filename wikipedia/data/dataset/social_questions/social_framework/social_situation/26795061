István Cs. Bartos (Hungarian: Bartos Cs. István, pronounced [ˈbɒrtoʃ ˈt͡ʃeː ˈiʃtvaːn]; AKA Bartos the Great Human Muck Pit) is a Hungarian performance artist and spoken word performer mostly known for his acts in which he eats dirt, garbage, raw meat, animal cadavers, excrement and drinks his own urine representing the decay of human condition. He lives voluntarily homeless and as a constantly travelling vagabond. His artistic viewpoint can be referenced to the ones of Antonin Artaud, Alejandro Jodorowsky, William S. Burroughs, Joseph Beuys or Hermann Nitsch. Considered himself as a "philosophical cannibal" and a tramp poet. His lifestyle is a regional form of freeganism. Bartos has some devoted cult following in Hungary. Often credited by his fans as the "peasant Marquis de Sade" or the "Charles Manson of Hungary". Bartos is a strong supporter of such contemporary ideas as degrowth and psychical nomadism.
