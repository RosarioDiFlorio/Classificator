Out of the Cold is a volunteer driven program run in many Canadian cities during the cold winter months serving homeless and poor community members. Various faith and community organizations such as Churches, Synagogues and Mosques in a city take turn providing food, hospitality and medical services. The program runs from about mid November to early April.
Those receiving the services are called guests. Guests are treated with care, respect and without judgment. Unlike other shelter programs, Out of the Cold does not generally require detailed registration.
