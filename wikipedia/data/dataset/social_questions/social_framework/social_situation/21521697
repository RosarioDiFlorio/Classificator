FareShare is a charity aimed at relieving food poverty and reducing food waste in the UK. It does this by rescuing good quality surplus food that would otherwise have gone to waste and sending it to over 2000 charity and community groups across the United Kingdom.
FareShare only redistributes food inside its best before and use by date; in 2015/16 they rescued 9,070 tonnes of food which would have otherwise gone to waste or landfill. FareShare works with all sectors of the supply chain; producers, manufacturers and retailers. All of the major UK food retailers have encouraged their suppliers to work with FareShare to minimise food waste. FareShare has also run two successful food drives with both Sainsbury's and Tesco.
FareShare contributed towards more than 18.3 million meals in 2015/16, which equates to feeding 211,565 people a week. This food is delivered to a broad range of grass root organisations all across the UK including homeless shelters, day centres, womenâ€™s refuge centres and children's breakfast clubs.
