Women and families represent the fastest growing groups of the homeless population in the United States. Approximately half of the homeless population are families with children. Among homeless families, 90 percent are female-headed. However, at least 85% of all homeless are men and homeless families are rare. A young single-mother responsible for raising her child or children without familial support and material resources typically heads a homeless family.
Some of the major factors of homelessness among American women include domestic violence, of which women are the overwhelming victims, poverty, healthcare and family planning, and the role of women as the primary caregivers of children and the income and housing implications which ensue, divorce, decline of the welfare state, and the lack of affordable housing. Additionally, the poor mental health of women is both a precursor and consequence of homelessness among the female population that should be addressed.
