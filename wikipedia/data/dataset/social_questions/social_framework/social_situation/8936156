The Western Regional Advocacy Project (WRAP) is a US West Coast alliance of grassroots homeless people's organizations that advocates for changes to Federal housing policy, and for an end to local and state policies that it considers to violate the civil rights of homeless people.
Its member organizations are:
Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency (BOSS) (Berkeley, California) (formerly Berkeley Oakland Support Services, the current name being a backronym)
Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco (San Francisco, California)
Los Angeles Community Action Network (Los Angeles, California)
Sisters Of The Road (Portland, Oregon)
Street Roots (Portland, Oregon)
Street Spirit (Oakland and Berkeley, California)
Denver Homeless Out Loud (Denver, Colorado)
WRAP is best recognized for its publication Without Housing: Decades of Federal Housing Cutbacks, Massive Homelessness, and Policy Failures, which details Federal housing policy immediately prior to, and in the decades since, the advent of modern mass homelessness. The report was initially published in 2006, with an update in 2010.
