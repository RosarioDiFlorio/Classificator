Dan Hibiki (火引 弾, Hibiki Dan) is a player character from Capcom's Street Fighter fighting game franchise. He was created to parody Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, the two lead characters of SNK's Art of Fighting series, as Capcom saw Ryo as a ripoff of Street Fighter characters Ryu and Ken. Since then, Dan has become a fan favorite due to his humorous design, signature moves, and mannerisms.
Introduced in Street Fighter Alpha, Dan is consistently portrayed as an overconfident, arrogant, and utterly feeble character. In the series' storyline, Dan is a self-taught martial artist whose goal is to defeat Sagat, who killed Go, Dan's father, in a brutal fight that resulted in the loss of Sagat's right eye. After defeating Sagat, Dan opens an unsuccessful school for his fighting style, Saikyo-ryu ("Strongest style").
