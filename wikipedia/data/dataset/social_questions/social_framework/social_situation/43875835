The subject of mental health in association football has been described as a "stigma" in the sport, although other professional sports are also affected. Professional footballers suffer more from symptoms of depression and anxiety than the general public.
former professional players Robert Enke and Gary Speed have committed suicide; both suffered from depression. Enke threw himself in front of a train. Speed hanged himself. Five years after Enke's death his wife stated that she believed depression in sport was no longer a taboo subject.
Clarke Carlisle stated that he contemplated suicide after becoming injured early in his career, and in December 2014 attempted suicide due to the severe depression he was suffering from.
Sebastian Deisler was hospitalized after being unable to cope with the pressures of professional football, eventually retiring from the sport at the age of 27.
Ex-player Mickey Bennett set up an organization called Unique Sports Counselling to help footballers deal with mental health issues.
In February 2016 Steve Harper spoke out about his mental health problems while in between clubs. The PFA had to apologise after initially criticising his comments.
