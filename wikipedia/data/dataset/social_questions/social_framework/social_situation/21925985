Street News was a street newspaper sold by homeless people in New York City, New York, the USA. Established in 1989, it is the earliest modern street paper still extant and the beginning of the American street newspaper movement. It aimed to provide a way of self-sufficiency to the many homeless and unemployed people in New York.
The creation of Street News quickly inspired the founding of many other street newspapers, including Chicago's StreetWise and Britain's The Big Issue; the paper has been called a "pioneer" for the street paper movement. Street News and The Big Issue have become prototypes of street papers worldwide.
As of 2002 the editor was John Levi "Indio" Washington Jr. Street News prints 3,000 copies of six issues per year, sold by 15 people getting 75 cents out of the $1.25 price.
As of current time, Street News is no longer an active publication and New York City has no official street paper.
