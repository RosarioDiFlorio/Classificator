A methadone clinic is a clinic which has been established for the dispensing of methadone (Dolophine), a schedule II opioid analgesic, to those who abuse heroin and other opioids. The focus of these clinics is the elimination or reduction of opioid usage by putting the patient on methadone which is a long acting opioid. Some clinics also offer short- or long-term detoxification services to their patients using methadone. A common term for the type of treatment at a methadone clinic is "replacement therapy". While generally considered successful as a treatment method, the use of this maintenance treatment is often viewed as controversial.
