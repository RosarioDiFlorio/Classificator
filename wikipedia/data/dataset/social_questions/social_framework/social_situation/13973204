Józef Stawinoga (15 December 1920 – 28 October 2007), also known as Fred and incorrectly reported as Josef, was a homeless Polish man who lived in a tent on the Wolverhampton Ring Road in the West Midlands, England for nearly 40 years. Little is known about the recluse, but he is thought to have been involved in the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, before emigrating to the UK in the 1940s.
