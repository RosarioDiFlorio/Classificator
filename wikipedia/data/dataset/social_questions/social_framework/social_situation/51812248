Homelessness in Spain is a significant social issue, affecting some 40,000 people. Migrants are disproportionately represented among the homeless population. Young people are also highly represented among the homeless, some studies estimating that 30% of Spain's homeless are aged 18-29. Some researchers maintain that street children are increasingly common as well.
Mental illness among homeless is thought to occur less frequently than the US, this may be attributed to Spain's universal healthcare system. One study found high levels of substance-related disorders, but these rates were comparatively lower than US and UK samples. Other researchers note that such comparative studies run the challenge of lack of prepared official definition of homelessness, as well as few well-controlled studies.
in 2015, a former minister and leader of the conservative Popular Party stated that homeless people sleeping in the streets are “scaring off” tourists from Madrid.
