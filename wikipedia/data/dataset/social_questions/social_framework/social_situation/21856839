HomelessNation.org is a not-for profit organization based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In order to bridge the digital divide, documentary filmmaker Daniel Cross created www.HomelessNation.org in 2003. A website by and for the homeless, www.homelessnation.org gives people on the street the opportunity to control their own voice and engage the public in a safe and supportive forum. HomelessNation.org outreach workers teach computer and media skills to facilitate self-expression and community involvement. Improved knowledge and self-esteem help individuals make healthier life choices and transition off the street. The project has directly impacted thousands of individuals across Canada and is now gaining ground internationally. The project has won 4 major ICT awards, including a prestigious World Summit Award.
