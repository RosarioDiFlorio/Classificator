An ecological crisis occurs when changes to the environment of a species or population destabilizes its continued survival. A few possible causes include:
Degradation of an abiotic ecological factor (for example, increase of temperature, less significant rainfalls)
Increased pressures from predation
Rise in the number of individuals (overpopulation)
The evolutionary theory of punctuated equilibrium sees infrequent ecological crises as a potential driver of rapid evolution.
