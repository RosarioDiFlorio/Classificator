The 100,000 Homes Campaign was an initiative of Community Solutions designed to "help communities around the country place 100,000 chronically homeless people homeless in 186 communities in the United States into permanent supportive housing."  Due to the cost of emergency room treatment, the program aims to provide housing for the homeless, as it is cheaper in the long run. In 2014, the program was featured on 60 Minutes, focusing on the homeless population in Nashville, Tennessee. Becky Kanis Margiotta was the campaign director. By July 2014, the 100,000 Homes Campaign had reached its goal and housed 105,580 of the most vulnerable homeless inidivdulas.
