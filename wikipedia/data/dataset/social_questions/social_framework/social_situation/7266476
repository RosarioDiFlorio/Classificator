Stereotypes of Central and Western Asians in the United States are oversimplified generalizations against people from or with ancestry in Central Asia (including Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan) and Western Asia (including Palestine, Iraq, Qatar, Lebanon, Yemen, Kuwait, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Iran, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia). Stereotypes of Western Asians have a long history in the United States, although this had generally been limited to Jews up until the second half of the 20th century. In recent years, stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims have become more prevalent in Western countries, especially after 9/11. There have been hate crimes against people of Arab origin, who are mostly Muslims, in the United States. Many people with Muslim names have been pulled out for questioning and searches due to passenger profiling at American airports, while hate crimes against Jews have remained common.
