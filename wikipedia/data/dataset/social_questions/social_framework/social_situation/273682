"American-born Chinese" or "ABC" describes a person born in the United States of Chinese ethnic descent, a category of Chinese American. Many are second-generation (meaning that they have at least one parent born outside the United States) and were born after the U.S. Immigration Act of 1965, which liberalized pre-existing limits on immigration from East Asia.
Note that in Australia, this abbreviation may also be used to refer to an Australian-born Chinese person.
