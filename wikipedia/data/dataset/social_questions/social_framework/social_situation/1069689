The Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience (informally, The Wing) is a history museum located in Seattle, Washington's Chinatown-International District. A Smithsonian Institution affiliate, the Wing is dedicated to engaging the public to explore issues related to the culture, art and history of Asian Pacific Americans. It is the only pan-Asian Pacific American community-based museum in America, highlighting the issues and life-experiences of one of the fastest-growing racial groups in the United States. In February 2013 it gained recognition as one of two dozen "affiliated areas" of the U.S. National Park Service.
