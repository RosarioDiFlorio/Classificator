Right 2 Dream Too (known to locals as R2D2) is a nonprofit organization based in Portland, Oregon. The organization, known for establishing a homeless camp on private property in October, 2011 in downtown Portland (Northwest Fourth Avenue and West Burnside; adjacent to the paifang of Old Town Chinatown), is supported by Right 2 Survive, another Portland-based organization that "works to empower and inform the homeless population". The organization has received praise from Portland's former mayor, Charlie Hales, who stated in October, 2013, "This unique community is doing valid work in a special way that no government agency ever thought of."
