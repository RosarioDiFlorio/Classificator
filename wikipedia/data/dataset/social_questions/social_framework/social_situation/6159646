Assertive community treatment (ACT) is an intensive and highly integrated approach for community mental health service delivery. ACT programs serve outpatients whose symptoms of mental illness lead to serious functioning difficulties in several major areas of life, often including work, social relationships, residential independence, money management, and physical health and wellness.
