The Goldilocks process is a process of initiating and sustaining systemic change.
Systemic change within an organization or community is often initiated by individuals using various methods, but it is often hard to determine which methods are most, or at all, effective. The Goldilocks process relies on varying methods used in the systemic change process, some which may be strident and emotive, and others which may rely on pure statistical research. The overall effect is to produce conditions that are 'just right' for systemic behavioral change in an organization or system.
