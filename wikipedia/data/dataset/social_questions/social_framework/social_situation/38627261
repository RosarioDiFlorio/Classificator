K-Mix 2 is a high energy food, used for the treatment of severe malnutrition. It was developed by UNICEF in response to the Biafran crisis, and was widely used in later famines in India and Africa.
It is a dry mix of
3 parts by weight Calcium caseinate
5 parts Dried Skimmed Milk
10 parts sugar
When made up, the 100g K-Mix-2 is combined with 60g of oil and 1 litre of water
Although extremely effective in the treatment of children too weak to feed themselves, its high cost precludes it from being used in any but the most extreme cases, and after the acute malnutrition has been treated, other foods are used instead
