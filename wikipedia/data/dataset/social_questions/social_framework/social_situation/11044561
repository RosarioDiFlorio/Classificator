Indatraline (Lu 19-005) is a non-selective monoamine transporter inhibitor that has been shown to block the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin with effects similar to those of cocaine. However, the effects have been shown to have slower onset and longer duration than cocaine, suggesting that the compound may, along with similar compounds, be used for treatment of cocaine addiction. Apparently, Lu 19-005 can be used to block the action of methamphetamine and MDMA.
Compare Indatraline with tametraline since they are directly homologous. There are some differences though. Superposition should make it possible to see that there is at least a relationship between the pharmacophore of indatraline and various phenyltropanes. More recently, additional work has been done also.
