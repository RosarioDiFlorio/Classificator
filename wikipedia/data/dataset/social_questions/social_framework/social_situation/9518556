Personal Identifiers (PID) are a subset of personally identifiable information (PII) data elements, which identify a unique individual and can permit another person to “assume” that individual’s identity without their knowledge or consent.
This can occur when PID data elements are used in any of these ways:
Alone
Combined with a person’s name
Combined with other PID data elements
Combined with other PII
