Homelessness in Denmark is thought to be a significant social issue in the country; between 10,000 and 15,000 people are homeless. However, when compared to other countries, such as the United States, the rate of Denmark's homeless in shelters is significantly lower. The population is also not as varied as the US; Denmark's homeless have higher rates of mental health issues, as countries with weaker welfare systems tend to have higher homeless rates but the homeless will more likely to include from a wide range of groups. The rate of women homeless has risen since the 1980s.
The government of Denmark's approach to homelessness include commissioning national surveys on homelessness during the last decade that allow for direct comparison between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The three countries have very similar definitions of homelessness, with minor variations.
