Rosanne Haggerty (born 1961) is an American housing and community development leader, and founder of Common Ground Community and later of Community Solutions. Haggerty redeveloped the Times Square Hotel, a building on the National Register of Historic Places, reducing homelessness by 87 percent in the 20-block neighborhood around it.
Haggerty graduated from Amherst College in 1982 and went on to study at both Columbia University (M.A. Arch.) and New York University. She was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence in Adelaide, Australia. South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Social Inclusion Commissioner David Cappo backed Haggerty's recommendations with a multimillion-dollar investment in inner-city apartment buildings tailor made for homeless people, establishing Common Ground Adelaide and Street to Home.
