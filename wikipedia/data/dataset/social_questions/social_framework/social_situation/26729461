Queer anarchism (or anarcha-queer) is an anarchist school of thought that advocates anarchism and social revolution as a means of queer liberation and abolition of homophobia, lesbophobia, transmisogyny, biphobia, transphobia, heteronormativity, heterosexism, patriarchy, and the gender binary. LGBT anarchists who campaigned for LGBT rights both outside and inside the anarchist and LGBT movements include John Henry Mackay, Adolf Brand, and Daniel Guerin. Individualist anarchist Adolf Brand published Der Eigene, which was the first publication dedicated to gay issues in the world, published from 1896 to 1932 in Berlin.
