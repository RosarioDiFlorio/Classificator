Asian fetish (also known as yellow fever) is an interest, obsession, or preference for Asian people, culture, or things of Asian origin by those of non-Asian descent. Most commonly the term refers to a sexual obsession with Asian women experienced by some non-Asian men. It is a slang term that stems from sexual fetishism.
A fetish is something that is desired so heavily that it becomes an abnormal obsession. Objects, body parts, clothing and people are all things that can be fetishized.
An Asian fetish is distinct from an interracial partnership. Interracial relationships may occur for reasons distinct from race. Asian fetishes have been criticised for treating the fetishized person as an object rather than an equal partner. The term Asiaphile is sometimes used to describe the same phenomenon, as is "yellow fever" for East Asians (not to be confused with the disease yellow fever).
