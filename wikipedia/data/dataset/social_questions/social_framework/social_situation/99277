Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening reaction that occasionally occurs in response to neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication. Symptoms include high fever, confusion, rigid muscles, variable blood pressure, sweating, and fast heart rate. Complications may include rhabdomyolysis, high blood potassium, kidney failure, or seizures.
Any medications within the family of neuroleptics can cause the condition, though typical antipsychotics appear to have a higher risk than atypicals. Onset is often within a few weeks of starting the medication but can occur at any time. Risk factors include dehydration, agitation, and catatonia. Rapidly decreasing the use of levodopa may also trigger the condition. The underlying mechanism involves blockage of dopamine receptors. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.
Management includes stopping the offending medication, rapid cooling, and starting other medications. Medications used include dantrolene, bromocriptine, and diazepam. The risk of death among those affected is about 10%. Many people can eventually be restarted on a lower dose of antipsychotic.
Among those in psychiatric hospitals on neuroleptics about 15 per 100,000 are affected per year. Males appear to be more often affected than females. In the second half of the 20th century rates were higher at about 2% of people in hospital per year. The condition was first described in 1956.
