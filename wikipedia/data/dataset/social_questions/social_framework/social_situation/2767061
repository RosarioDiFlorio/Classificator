Zbigniew Marian Wilczek Alba or Zaggy the Dankman as he is known, is a man who chooses to be homeless and can be found in the inner Brisbane suburb of Toowong. Ziggy objects to being labelled as "homeless" as he does not ask for food, money or clothing and actually enjoys his current living conditions, despite being without a home of his own and living in a public park. More recently he has gained much media attention, becoming a controversial issue in two consecutive local elections.
