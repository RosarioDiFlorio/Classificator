Jewish House is an Australian-Jewish non-profit organisation assisting homeless people. It is based in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. The organisation was founded in 1986 by local businessmen Roger and Anthony Clifford. The Clifford brothers established the crisis centre to respond to the needs of those community members struggling with substance abuse issues.
