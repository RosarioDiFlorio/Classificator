informally, a global issue describes any social, economic, political or environmental problem that affects the global community, possibly in a catastrophic way.
Solution to global issues requires cooperation among nations.
In their book Global Issues, Hite and Seitz emphasize that global issues are qualitatively different from international affairs and that the former arise from growing international interdependencies which makes the issues themselves interdependent.
