The Angel Makers of Nagyrév were a group of women living in the village of Nagyrév, Hungary who between 1914 and 1929 poisoned to death an estimated 300 people (however, Béla Bodó puts the number of victims at 45–50). They were supplied arsenic and encouraged to use it for the purpose by a midwife or "wise woman" named Susanna Fazekas, wife of Julius Fazekas, née Susi Oláh (Fazekas Gyuláné Oláh Zsuzsanna). Their story is the subject of the documentary film The Angelmakers and the movie Hukkle.
