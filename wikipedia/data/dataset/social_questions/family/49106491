The Shadamarshana Gothra, popularly known as "Swayamacharyas", is a gotra, or clan of people in Hindu society who all claim descent from Ramanuja Charya. Some people believe Ramanuja was born into the Harita Gothra, but many point to the writings of one of his own descendants, and to the writings of the Maharishi (greatest of saints) which demonstrate that Ramanuja Charya was born into the Shadamarshana Gothra.
Korukonda, srimath tirumala venkata are some of the first names of shatamarshana gothras.
Brahmins and srivaishnavas both are borned from Sri bhrahmadeva.
