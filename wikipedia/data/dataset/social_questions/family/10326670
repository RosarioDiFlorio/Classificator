Nelson Hart (born 1968) is a Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada resident who was convicted on 28 March 2007 of murdering his three-year-old twin daughters in 2002. He successfully appealed the conviction in 2007 and ultimately, in 2014 his confession to police was found to be inadmissible as evidence causing the Crown to dismiss the murder charges for lack of evidence.
