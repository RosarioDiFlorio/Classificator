Marital rape generally refers to non-consensual sexual intercourse between married spouses. In Singapore, there is a partial immunity for marital rape because it is not a criminal offence except when the wife is below 13 years of age or when any of the specific circumstances provided under section 375(4) of the Singapore Penal Code are satisfied.
Marital rape has been identified by the United Nations General Assembly to be a form of violence against women in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW). The DEVAW is said to complement and strengthen the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Singapore ratified on 5 October 1995.
There are no documented statistics on the prevalence of marital rape in Singapore. There has only been one reported case of marital rape in the Singapore courts. Nevertheless, it is believed that many victims of marital rape suffer in silence because of the knowledge of a lack of effective legal remedies as well as the social stigma attached to the issue.
