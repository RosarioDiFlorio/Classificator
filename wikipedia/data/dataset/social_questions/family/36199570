Child displacement is the removal or separation of children from their parents and immediate family or settings in which they have initially been reared. Displaced children includes varying categories of children who experience separation from their families and social settings due to several varied reasons. These populations include children separated from their parents, refugees, children sent to boarding schools, Internally displaced persons or IDPs, and asylum seekers. Thus child displacement refers to a broad range of factors due to which children are removed from their parents and social setting. This include persecution, war, armed conflict and disruption and separation for varied reasons.
According to UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) as of (2002) there were approximately 22 million displaced children in the world. Several of whom are displaced for a very long time spanning years. Children in worst affected areas in armed conflict or disruption face an average of 6 to 7 years of displacement.
The internationally accepted and acknowledged definition of a "child" is anyone who is under the age of 18 regardless of any context.
