The Nancy Kissel murder case (officially called the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region v Nancy Ann Kissel) was a highly publicised criminal trial held in the High Court of Hong Kong, where Nancy Kissel (n√©e Keeshin) was convicted of the murder of her husband, investment banker Robert, in their apartment on 2 November 2003.
The case was known as the "milkshake murder" because Kissel was alleged to have incapacitated her husband by serving him a strawberry milkshake full of sedatives before bludgeoning him to death. It was possibly the highest profile murder of an expatriate in Hong Kong's history, together with the Braemar Hill murders and the trial was closely covered in the media. Kissel was convicted of murder in 2005 and received a mandatory life sentence. The Court of Final Appeal overturned the conviction in February 2010, citing legal errors, and ordered a retrial. The retrial began on 12 January 2011 and, on 25 March 2011, she was again found guilty of her husband's murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Kissel is serving her sentence at Tai Lam Centre for Women.
Robert Kissel's brother Andrew, a former American real estate developer, was found murdered on 3 April 2006 in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA.
