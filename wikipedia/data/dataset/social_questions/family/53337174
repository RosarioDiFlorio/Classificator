This Country is a mockumentary sitcom, first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC iPlayer on 8 February 2017. Created by, written by and starring siblings Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper, the programme is about the day-to-day lives of two young people living in a small village in the Cotswolds. The show centres on themes of social clumsiness, the trivialities of human behaviour, the eccentricities of living in rural England, and the boredom and social isolation of young people in small communities. Following rave reviews and over four million IPlayer requests, on the 18th July 2017 the BBC renewed the show for a second season. 
The Coopers play the central characters, cousins Kerry and Lee "Kurtan" Mucklowe. Their father, Paul Cooper, plays Kerry's father Martin Mucklowe, while their uncle, Trevor Cooper, plays local man and antagonist Len Clifton. Although credited to "Ivy Woodcock", the voice of Sue Mucklowe—Kerry's mother, never seen on screen—is provided by Daisy Cooper.
