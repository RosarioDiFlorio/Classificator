The legal aspects of surrogacy in any particular jurisdiction tend to hinge on a few central questions:
Are surrogacy agreements enforceable, void, or prohibited? Does it make a difference whether the surrogate mother is paid (commercial) or simply reimbursed for expenses (altruistic)?
What, if any, difference does it make whether the surrogacy is traditional or gestational?
Is there an alternative to post-birth adoption for the recognition of the intended parents as the legal parents, either before or after the birth?
Laws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another.
