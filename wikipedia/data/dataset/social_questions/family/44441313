BPDFamily.com is an online support group for the family members of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The group, established in 1998, was one of the first "cyber" support groups to be recognized by the medical providers and receive professional referrals.
BPDFamily.com provides articles and message boards for family members to learn and share their experiences. The articles explain borderline personality disorder in understandable terms, and the discussion groups help to normalize the experiences of family members. The site appeals to family members who care about someone with borderline personality disorder, but are frustrated with the relationship demands and conflict.
Funding has come from benefactors and member donations.
