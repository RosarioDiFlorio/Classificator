A children's den is a shelter or hideout built by children, often involving spare wooden boards, nets and sticks. It is often built in a bush or tree. A classic den uses a panel of wood for the roof, wooden boards for the floor and a net with leaves on it as camouflage. It is often used as a hangout for children and children can design and decorate it however they like.
