Adrianna Elaine Hutto (September 16, 1999 - August 8, 2007) was a 7-year-old American girl that lived in Esto, Florida. On August 8, 2007 Adrianna's mother Amanda E. Lewis made a 911 call stating that she had found her daughter in the family's pool and was not breathing. Emergency personnel rushed Adrianna to the nearby hospital Bay Medical, where she was pronounced dead about an hour after arrival. The death was initially treated as an accident until Adrianna's half-brother A.J., then 6 years old, told police that he had witnessed his mother "dunk" Adrianna in the pool as a form of corporal punishment.
