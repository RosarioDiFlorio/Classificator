Netherlands v Sweden [1958] ICJ 8 (also known as the Boll case) was heard before the International Court of Justice in 1958. It remains the only case in which a Convention drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law was the principal subject of interpretation by a court with worldwide jurisdiction.
