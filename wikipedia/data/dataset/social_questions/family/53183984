Saint Mary the Younger (Greek: Μαρία ή Νέα, to distinguish her from Saint Mary of Egypt; 875 – 16 February 902) is a Byzantine saint of Armenian origin, the daughter of an Armenian noble. Some details of her life, including her following after the mid-10th century, are not known for certain; the text documenting some of her most noteworthy accomplishments was most likely written after 1025.
