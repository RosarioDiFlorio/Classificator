Johanna Maria Magdalena "Magda" Goebbels (née Ritschel; 11 November 1901 – 1 May 1945) was the wife of Nazi Germany's Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. A prominent member of the Nazi Party, she was a close ally, companion and political supporter of Adolf Hitler. Some historians refer to her as the unofficial "First Lady" of Nazi Germany, while others give that "title" to Emmy Göring.
As Berlin was being overrun by the Red Army at the end of World War II in Europe, she and her husband fatally poisoned their six children before they committed suicide. Harald Quandt, her son from a previous marriage, survived her.
