The Hoju scheme is a family register system in North Korea and formerly in South Korea. Hoju (Hangul: 호주, Hanja: 戶主) means the 'head of the family', Hojuje (호주제, 戶主制) is the 'head of the family' system, and Hojeok (alternate romanization: Hojok; 호적, 戶籍) is the 'family register'. In South Korea, it was formally introduced in 1953.
It is similar to the Japanese koseki, the Chinese hukou and the Vietnamese Hộ khẩu.
Opponents of the hoju system believed it to be innately patriarchal and representing a 'violation of the right to gender equality'. In South Korea, it was opposed by both feminists and by representatives of other religious traditions including Buddhism and Christianity. South Korea abolished hoju on 1 January 2008 after the Constitutional Court found it incompatible with the constitution in 2005.
