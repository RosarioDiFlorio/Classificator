A long-distance relationship (LDR) (or long-distance romantic relationship (LDRR) is an intimate relationship between partners who are geographically isolated from one another. Partners in LDRs face geographic separation and lack of face-to-face contact. LDRs are particularly prevalent among college students- constituting 25% to 50% of all LDRs. Even though scholars have reported a significant number of LDRs in undergraduate populations, long-distance relationships continue to be an â€˜understudied' phenomenon.
