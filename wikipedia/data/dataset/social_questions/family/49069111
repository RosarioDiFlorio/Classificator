The Van Breda murders were the killing of three family members and serious injuring of another on January 27, 2015, at a golf estate in Stellenbosch, South Africa. After a year and a half of investigations by the South African police, the chief suspect and youngest son Henri van Breda handed himself over to police in June 2016 and was released on bail the next day. The case has polarized the country's media and gained significant attention since Henri's surrender.
