The Saint Martyrs of Tlaxcala were three Mexican Roman Catholic children from the state of Tlaxcala: Cristobal (1514/5 – 1527) and the two companions Antonio (1516/7 – 1529) and Juan (1516/7 – 1529). The three children were converts from the pagan traditions of their families to the Roman Catholic faith and received their educations from the Order of Friars Minor who baptized them and evangelized in the area. Their activism and evangelical zeal led to their brutal deaths at the hands of those who detested their newfound faith and perceived them as dangers to their tribal values and rituals.
The children were beatified in Mexico in mid-1990 by Pope John Paul II. Pope Francis – on 23 March 2017 – issued a decree that the three children will be canonized without having a miracle attributed to their intercession as is the norm. The children were canonized as saints on 15 October 2017.
