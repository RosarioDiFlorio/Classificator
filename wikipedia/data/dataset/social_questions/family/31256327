Accidental incest is sexual activity or marriage between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered incestuous. When two related people meet as adults and become sexually attracted, it is known as genetic sexual attraction.
The laws of many jurisdictions void incestuous marriages, even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, DNA testing may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.
