Keli Lane (born 21 March 1975), a former Australian water polo player, was convicted of the 1996 murder of her newborn baby Tegan, and three counts of lying under oath. Lane is currently serving an 18-year prison sentence and will be eligible for parole on 12 May 2023, after serving a period of 13 years and five months in custody. On 18 April 2011, Lane's lawyers lodged an appeal against her conviction at the same time as a Sydney taxi driver made claim he allegedly saw Lane dispose of the child. Her final application for appeal was rejected by the High Court in August 2014.
