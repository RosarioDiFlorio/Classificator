The film is directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Green and Scott Frank, from a story by David James Kelly and Mangold.

Grant, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Dafne Keen, Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal and Elizabeth Rodriguez are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography began in Louisiana on May 2, 2016 and ended on August 19th, 2016 in New Mexico. The locations used for Logan were mainly in Louisiana, New Mexico, and Mississippi.
Logan premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival on February 17, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 3, 2017, in IMAX and standard formats. The film became one of the best-reviewed films in the X-Men series, with some critics considering it one of the best superhero films of all time, and was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017. It grossed over $616 million worldwide against its $97 million budget, making it the second highest-grossing R-rated film of 2017 (after It).
