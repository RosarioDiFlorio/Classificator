Aqsa "Axa" Parvez (April 22, 1991 â€“ December 10, 2007) was the victim of a murder in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. During the murder trial, Superior Court Justice Bruce Durno acknowledged the slaying as an honour killing, stating, that he found it "profoundly disturbing that a 16-year-old could be murdered by a father and brother for the purpose of saving family pride, for saving them from what they perceived as family embarrassment". Aqsa's brother, Waqas, had strangled her to death when she chose to not wear a hijab covering. Parvez's death was reported internationally and sparked a debate about the status of women in Islam.
