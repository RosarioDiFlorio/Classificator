Marianna Dolińska (1891 – 1928 in Tworki) was a Romani woman from Antoniówka, Radom County, Poland. On the night of 11 December 1923, she murdered her four children and hung them on a tree. A photograph of the bodies of the children was falsely used to represent victims of the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.
