Rachel Capra Craig is a Canadian woman who was accused of the murder of her fourteen-year-old daughter, Chelsea Craig, but, on 20 February 2002, was found not criminally responsible because of a mental disorder.
Chelsea Craig had Rett syndrome, which rendered her unable to speak, breathe normally, feed herself or use the toilet. Rachel Capra Craig decided to kill herself and Chelsea with an overdose of prescription drugs. She told psychiatrists she killed Chelsea to protect her from being sexually abused by her father. (Experts determined that the accusations of sexual abuse were false.) Psychiatrists concluded that Capra Craig was suffering from paranoid delusional disorder.
