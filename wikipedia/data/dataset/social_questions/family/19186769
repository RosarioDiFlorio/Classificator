Opposite day is a game usually observed by children, but frequently referred to as Backwards Day by children and their other siblings. It starts by declaration and rarely lasts an entire day. The game involves, that players assume, that statements mean the opposite of what they usually mean. Every action is modified, so that meaning is negated.
Sometimes, opposite day is declared retroactively to indicate, that what was just asserted had the opposite meaning of what was originally intended (similar to the practice of crossed fingers to automatically nullify promises). However, the declaration, that it is opposite day, is negated as well, implying that it is not opposite day.
The play has also been compared to a children's "philosophy course".
