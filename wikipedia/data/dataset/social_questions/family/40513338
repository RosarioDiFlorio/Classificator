Rape is one of the most common crimes in Egypt. Marital rape is not illegal in the country. By 2008, U.N. quoted Egypt's Interior Ministry's figure that 20,000 rapes take place every year, although according to the activist Engy Ghozlan (ECWR), rapes are 10 times higher than the stats given by Interior Ministry, making it 200,000 per year. Mona Eltahawy has also noted the same figure (200,000), and added that it was before the revolution, today the number is actually higher.
Rapes have been carried out during festivals and the Egyptian protests, it includes the public rapes carried on women, and the female journalists.
