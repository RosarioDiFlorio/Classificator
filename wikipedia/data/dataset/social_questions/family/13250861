The Novgorod Case is the conventional term used in the Russian blogosphere and mass media for the controversial criminal case against Mrs. Antonina Martynova (formerly Fyodorova, n√©e Stepanova). She is facing charges of attempted murder of her daughter Alisa, then two years and seven months old, based solely on an 11-year-old boy's eyewitness account. Antonina is being prosecuted under Articles 30.3 ("Preparations for a Crime, and Attempted Crimes") and 105.2 ("Murder") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (CC-RF henceforth; these links and other Code(s) links below are for the English translation(s) of the latest versions of the Code(s), those currently in force in Russia).
The case has been the subject of broad-ranging public debate in Russian media, online communities and blogs. The discussion began in April 2007 with a post in the (Russian-language) blog of Antonina's husband (her domestic partner at the time), Mr. Kirill Martynov, aka LiveJournal user Novgorod case at LiveJournal.
