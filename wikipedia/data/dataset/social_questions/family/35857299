Raynella Dossett Leath, from Knoxville, Tennessee, USA, is a woman who was released from serving a life sentence at the Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville for the murder of her husband David Leath in 2003; after the judge, in the 3rd trial, directed a verdict in favor of the defendant on May 10, 2017. Prosecutors alleged that she shot her husband in the head, and then attempted to stage his murder as a suicide. “The record taken as a whole does not support a finding of sufficient evidence," Judge Summers said. "The state has failed to meet its burden.”
