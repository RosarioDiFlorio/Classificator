ET3 Global Alliance is an American open consortium of licensees dedicated to global implementation of Evacuated Tube Transport (ETT). It was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system utilizing car sized passenger capsules traveling in 1.5 m (5 ft) diameter tubes on frictionless maglev.
Oster claims that the ET3 system will be able to provide 50 times the amount of transportation per kilowatt-hour compared with electric cars and electric trains, costing only 20 cents worth of electrical energy to get up to 350 mph. ET3 claims that initial systems would travel at the speed of 600 km/h (370 mph) for in state trips, and later will be developed to 6,500 km/h (4,000 mph, hypersonic speed) for international travel that will allow passenger or cargo travel from New York to Beijing in 2 hours. The initial proof of concept system could be built in as little 3 years for operational transport.
