The United States government established planning organizations to provide for the coordination of land use, transportation and infrastructure. These Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) may exist as a separate, independent organization or they may be administered by a city, county, regional planning organization, highway commission or other government organization. Each MPO has its own structure and governance. A list of the current federally designated MPOs is listed here.
