Daktylios (Greek: Δακτύλιος, meaning ring) is the name given to the road space rationing or alternate-day travel developed for Athens during the 1990s. Unlike congestion pricing systems, it does not operate on the basis of drivers paying fees for entering the city centre. Instead, it depends on the parity of the date and of the vehicle's registration plate, the vehicle type as well as the time of the week/month. There are three Daktylios areas.
