A weyala (Amharic: ወያላ) is a conductor who receives fares on minibus share taxis in Ethiopia. He also has the duty of informing potential passengers of the destination they are heading and the price they need to pay, informing the taxi driver to stop when a passenger wants to disembark. They also collect the appropriate price from the passenger as the taxi is moving and generally keeping the law on board the minibus taxi. Weyalas can be from various age groups, and in recent times, even women have been known to work as weyalas.
