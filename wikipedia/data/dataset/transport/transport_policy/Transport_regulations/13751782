VillageTech Solutions    began with EcoSystems (Nepal) in 1996, to improve living standards for rural people by creating affordable energy and transport products. VTS creates inexpensive technology by focusing creative talent on problems ignored by commercial investors because the solutions are intentionally easily copied, and the markets are distorted by conflicting cultures, governments, subsidies and real conflict.
The VTS mission is to apply simple, locally appropriate technology to problems in education, transportation, health and economic development.
VTS is the American non-profit offshoot of EcoSystems Pvt Ltd in Nepal, founded by David and Haydi Sowerwine in 1996 to provide ‘energy and transport solutions’ in Nepal where they lived for 14 years. In that time EcoSystems built 38 “WireBridges” across Himalayan rivers to connect villagers with medical care, schools and trade. Since 1998 the bridges have moved an estimated 3.5 million passengers without harm.
In 2009 the Sowerwines launched a successor wirebridge builder in Kathmandu, the locally owned and operated: VillageSolutions Pvt. Ltd.
VTS won the esteemed Tech Museum Award in 2003.
