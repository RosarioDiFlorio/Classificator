A wind atlas contains data on the wind speed and wind direction in a region. These data include maps, but also time series or frequency distributions. A climatological wind atlas covers hourly averages at a standard height (10 meter) over even longer periods (30 years). But depending on the application there are variations in averaging time, height and period.
