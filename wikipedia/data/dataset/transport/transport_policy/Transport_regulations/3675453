Trailer tracking is tracking the position of an articulated vehicleâ€™s trailer unit through a tracking device fitted to the trailer. A communication network or satellite network is then used to transfer this positional data to a centralised collection point. Trailer tracking is used to increase productivity by optimising the use of trailer fleets.
