Market urbanism is an urban policy theory which advocates for the liberalization of urban planning and transportation policy. Market urbanists espouse a wide array of views, but generally they support ideas and programs such as loosening urban land use and zoning regulations, implementing congestion pricing on public roads, and applying classical liberal thought to urban policy issues. The term was coined by Adam Hengels, founder of the Market Urbanism blog.
In July of 2017, Scott Beyer, a roving urban affairs journalist who writes for Forbes, started a media company called The Market Urbanism Report. The website is designed to advance Market Urbanism policy ideas in U.S. cities.
