Waiter.com, also formerly known as World Wide Waiter, is an online restaurant delivery service that went online in early December 1995. It was founded by two Stanford University Business School graduates Craig Cohen and Michael Adelberg. Although Waiter.com does service delivery for residential areas, its main focus is delivering for business mealtime orders and catered meals. Waiter.com primarily operates in California in the Bay Area.
