In 1854, Hackney and Sons was organized by Willis N. Hackney, as a carriage shop in Wilson, North Carolina. In 1877, the company became known as Hackney Brothers, one of the largest manufacturers of buggies and wagons in the South. The present name, Hackney Brothers Body Company, was adopted in 1914, and formally incorporated in 1920. It was in these early years that the company pioneered the manufacture of school bus bodies and refrigerated bodies. The company was sold in 1996. Today, the company is based in Washington, North Carolina (sold to Hackney & Sons) and then in 1997 sold to TTI and merged with Kidiron. Hackney now focuses on specialized truck bodies (aluminum beverage truck bodies, trailers and emergency vehicles).
When the Hackney Brothers Body Company was dissolved in 1996, the company's records were given to Barton College, which is located in Wilson, North Carolina. Company presidents Thomas J. Hackney, Sr., and Thomas J. Hackney, Jr., were both chairmen of the Board of Trustees at Barton College during their various presidensies at Hackney Brothers Body Company.
