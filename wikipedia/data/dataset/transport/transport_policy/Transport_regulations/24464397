Public transport security refers to measures taken by a mass transit system to keep its passengers and employees safe, to protect the carrier's equipment, and to make sure other violations do not occur. This includes the enforcement of various rules and regulations, human and video surveillance, the deployment of a transit police force, and other techniques.
Public transport security has become a major issue around the world since the September 11 attacks, and especially the 2004 Madrid train bombings.
In the United States, the FBI at times has put the nation's mass transit systems on high alert, and the U.S. Congress has reconsidered cuts in funding following attacks in other parts of the world.. Grants have been given in order to improve security to mass transit systems in the United States, while in the United Kingdom, public transport, due to its "open nature", is considered a major potential target for terrorists.
