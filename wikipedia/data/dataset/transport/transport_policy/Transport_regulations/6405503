Access management, when used in traffic and traffic engineering circles, generally refers to the regulation of interchanges, intersections, driveways and median openings to a roadway. Its objectives are to enable access to land uses while maintaining roadway safety and mobility through controlling access location, design, spacing and operation. This is particularly important for major roadways intended to provide efficient service to through-traffic movements.
Access management is most evident on freeways (UK term motorways) where access is grade separated and all movements are via dedicated ramps. It is very important on arterial roads where at-grade intersections and private driveways greatly increase the number of conflicts involving vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. It is also important on minor roadways for safety considerations such as driver sight distance.
Planners, engineers, architects, developers, elected officials, citizens and attorneys all play a significant role in access management. Businesses frequently view any attempt to limit access to their land uses as economically detrimental. This can make implementation controversial. However, there is evidence showing that access management can have the positive effect of increasing market area through reducing travel times on major roadways, and that minor increases in circuity do not cause customers to stop patronizing businesses.
The most authoritative North American reference on the subject is the Access Management Manual produced in 2003 by the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences.
Colorado was the first state to enact legislation in 1979 and to adopt an associated code of practice and regulatory framework. Since that time, transportation agency interest in access management has grown significantly.
