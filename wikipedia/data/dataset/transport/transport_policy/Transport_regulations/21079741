An electric vehicle network is an infrastructure system of publicly accessible charging stations and possibly battery swap stations to recharge electric vehicles. Government, car manufacturers, and charging infrastructure providers have entered into many agreements to create such networks. As of December 2016, Estonia is the only country to have completed the deployment of an electric car charging network with nationwide coverage.
