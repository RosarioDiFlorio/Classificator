A royal barge is a ceremonial barge that is used by a monarch for processions and transport on a body of water.
Royal barges are currently used in monarchies such as the United Kingdom, Sweden and Thailand.
Traditionally the use of royal barges was of high importance in southeast Asian monarchies such as Siam, Burma, Brunei, Riau and Cambodia.
