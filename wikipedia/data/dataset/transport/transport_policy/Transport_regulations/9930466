The term controlled aerodynamic instability phenomena was first used by Cristiano Augusto Trein in the Nineteenth KKCNN Symposium on Civil Engineering  held in Kyoto – Japan in 2006. The concept is based on the idea that aerodynamic instability phenomena, such as Kármán vortex street, flutter, galloping and buffeting, can be driven into a controlled motion and be used to extract energy from the flow, becoming an alternative approach for wind power generation systems.
