A personal transporter (also personal light electric vehicle, personal mobility device, electric rideable ) is a class of compact, portable, electrically powered electric vehicle for transporting an individual at speeds that don't normally exceed 25 kilometres per hour (16 mph), which includes electric skateboards, electric kick scooters, self-balancing unicycles and Segways. Made possible by recent advances in vehicle battery and motor-control technologies, legislators are in the process of determining how these devices should be classified, regulated and accommodated during a period of rapid innovation.
Excluded from this legal category are electric bicycles (that are considered to be a type of bicycle), electric motorbikes and scooters (that are treated as a type of scooter) and powered mobility aids with 3 or 4 wheels on which the rider sits (which fall within regulations covering powered mobility scooters).
