The Gillig Phantom School Bus is the school bus variant of the Gillig Phantom mass-transit bus that was produced by Gillig Corporation in Hayward, California. Introduced in 1986, production of the Phantom school bus ended after 1993.
In a fashion similar to its long-running predecessor, the Gillig Transit Coach School Bus, the Phantom School Bus was available on a national basis, though marketed primarily for West Coast operators. Although initially well-received, sales of the vehicle dropped off at the end of the 1980s. After no school buses were sold in either 1991 or 1992, a short run of 1993 models marked the end of 71 years of Gillig as a school bus manufacturer.
