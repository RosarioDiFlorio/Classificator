Spaceworthiness, or aerospaceworthiness, is a property, or ability of a spacecraft to perform to its design objectives and navigate successfully through both the space environment and the atmosphere as a part of a journey to or from space.
As in airworthiness, the spaceworthiness of a spacecraft depends on at least three basic components:
design of the spacecraft, which covers activities of engineering evaluation, simulations, laboratory and prototype tests, and experimental flights;
production, which seeks to ensure that the spacecraft has been assembled in conformity with the design specification;
maintenance of the spacecraft, after production, before and during each flight mission.
Spaceworthiness is typically maintained through a maintenance program and / or a system of analysis, diagnosis and management of health and reliability of the spacecraft.
