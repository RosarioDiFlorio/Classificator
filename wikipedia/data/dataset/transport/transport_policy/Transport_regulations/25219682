A school bus is a bus that has been designed primarily for the role of student transport. In the United States and Canada, safety regulations have influenced the design of school buses to an extent that they have evolved into separate vehicles from transit buses, and that an industry has been created to manufacture them. In other parts of the world, vehicles used as school buses are outwardly similar to transit buses.
