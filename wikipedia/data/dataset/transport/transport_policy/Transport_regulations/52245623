The Ganz MFAV (Hungarian pronunciation: [ɡɒnz ˈɛmfɒv]), known in official BKV records as Mfav., and alternatively known as FAV, or MillFAV, is a type of metro car which was manufactured by Hungarian companies Ganz-MÁVAG Mozdony-, Vagon- és Gépgyár ("Ganz-MÁVAG Locomotive, Carriage and Machine Factory") and Ganz Villamossági Gyár ("Ganz Electric Factory"). The MFAV metro cars are articulated, 8-axle rail motor coaches with an unusual 2'Bo'Bo'2'tr axle arrangement. They are not capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured in Budapest between 1971 and 1973 and in 1987, and including the two prototype cars, in overall 23 units were made.
The MFAV designation resolves to Millenniumi Földalatti Vasút ("Millennial Underground Railway"), FAV and MillFAV refers to the same phrase, as the cars were specifically designed to replace the original, turn-of-century Schlick–Siemens & Halske rolling stock of Budapest's M1 metro line, a tunnel system which requires low-height vehicles. MFAV metro cars are still in active service, although their retirement has been called for. The first car entered passenger service in 1973, thus the type is now in continuous service for 43–44 years. The series carries the distinction of being an early example of fully low-floor urban rail vehicles, and also of having an overhead wire system instead of a third rail for current collection despite being designated as metro vehicles.
