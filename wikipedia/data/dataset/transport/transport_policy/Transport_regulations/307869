The Transatlantic crossings are passages of passengers and cargo across the Atlantic Ocean between the Americas and Europe or Africa. The majority of passenger traffic is across the North Atlantic between North America and Western Europe. Centuries after the dwindling of sporadic Viking trade with Markland, a regular and lasting transatlantic trade route was established in 1566 with the Spanish West Indies fleets, following the Voyages of Christopher Columbus.
