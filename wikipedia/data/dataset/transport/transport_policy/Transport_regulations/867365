The Ford E-Series (also known as the Ford Econoline and Ford Club Wagon throughout various stages of its production) is a range of full-size vans produced by Ford Motor Company. Introduced for the 1961 model year as the replacement for the Ford F-Series panel van, four generations of the model line have been produced. In addition to cargo van and passenger van body styles, the Ford E-Series has been produced as a cutaway van chassis and stripped chassis (a chassis without bodywork).
With a 56-year production run, the Ford E-Series is the second longest-produced nameplate by Ford worldwide; only the Ford F-Series (1948-present) has been produced longer. For the 2015 model year, the Ford E-Series cargo/passenger vans were replaced in North America by the Ford Transit introduced worldwide in 2013. As of the 2017 model year, only cutaway and stripped chassis configurations of the E-Series are produced.
Since 2006, the E-Series has been assembled at the Ford Motor Company Ohio Assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. From 1961 to 2005, the Ford E-Series was assembled at Lorain Assembly in Lorain, Ohio.
Prior to its discontinuation, the Ford E-Series cargo/passenger van was the best-selling full-size van in the United States since 1980; in 2007, the model held a 79.6% share of the full-size van segment. Commercial or fleet users represented 95% of sales, with cargo vans accounting for nearly half of production.
