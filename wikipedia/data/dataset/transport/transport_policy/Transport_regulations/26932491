The Freightliner FS-65 is a Type C conventional bus chassis that was manufactured by Freightliner from 1997 to 2007. Used primarily as a cowled chassis for school bus applications, the FS-65 was developed from the Freightliner FL-Series medium-duty conventional.
While developed before the sale of the Ford heavy-truck line to Freightliner at the end of 1996, due to the ties of the two companies, the Freightliner FS-65 would serve as an indirect successor of the Ford B-Series bus chassis. After the shutdown of Ford medium-duty truck production in 1998, the Freightliner school bus chassis would take over much of the market share owned by Ford.
The FS-65 chassis was assembled in Gaffney, South Carolina by the Freightliner Custom Chassis subsidiary of Freightliner; as an incomplete vehicle, the chassis was shipped to body manufacturers for final assembly of a bus. After a total of 62,764 units were produced, the final Freightliner FS-65 chassis rolled off the assembly line in December 2006.
