The majority of the New York City Subway system was built before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect. As a side effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be accessible to people with disabilities. Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA, with most grade-level stations requiring little modification to meet ADA standards. In addition, the MTA identified "key stations," high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated.
As of January 2017, out of 472 total stations in the system, 117 are accessible to some extent; many of them have AutoGate access. If station complexes are counted as one, then 93 out of the system's 425 stations are accessible to some extent. Five stations on the Staten Island Railway are also accessible. Additionally, there are 16 more non-ADA-accessible stations with cross-platform interchanges, as well as other same-platform transfers, designed to handle wheelchair transfers.
