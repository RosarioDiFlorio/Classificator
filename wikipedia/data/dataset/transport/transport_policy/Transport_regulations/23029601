Aimsun Live is a simulation-based traffic forecasting solution, developed and marketed by Aimsun.
Traffic control centres use Aimsun Live (formerly Aimsun Online) to make real-time decisions about the management of a road network. It is used to dynamically forecast future traffic conditions based on the current state of the network and to evaluate incident response or traffic management strategies.
Aimsun Live slots right into the traffic control centre and continuously processes live field data, simulating vehicle movement inside a road network of any size, from a single highway corridor to an entire major world city. By combining these live traffic data feeds and high-speed simulations with emulation of congestion mitigation strategies, Aimsun Live can accurately forecast the future network flow patterns that will result from a particular traffic management or information provision strategy.
Aimsun Live was launched in 2008 and is now fully deployed in Interstate 15 in San Diego, Grand Lyon in France and other locations worldwide.
