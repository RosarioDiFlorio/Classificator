In the context of European Union law, a public service obligation or PSO means an obligation imposed on an organisation by legislation or contract to provide a service of general interest within the European Union territories. PSOs may operate in any field of public service, but postal services, social services, energy, transport and banking are identified as specific sectors where the concept is relevant.
