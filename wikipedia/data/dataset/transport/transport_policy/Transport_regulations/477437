A ducted fan is a propulsion arrangement whereby a mechanical fan, which is a type of propeller, is mounted within a cylindrical shroud or duct. The duct reduces losses in thrust from the tips of the props, and varying the cross-section of the duct allows the designer to advantageously affect the velocity and pressure of the airflow according to Bernoulli's Principle. Ducted fan propulsion is used in aircraft, airships, airboats, hovercraft and fan packs.
Ducted fans normally have more and shorter blades than propellers and thus can operate at higher rotational speeds.
