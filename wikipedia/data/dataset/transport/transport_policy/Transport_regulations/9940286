The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) (IAST: Pradhān Mantrī Grām Saḍak Yōjanā) (Hindi: प्रधानमंत्री ग्राम सड़क योजना, English: Prime Minister's Rural Roads Scheme) is a nationwide plan in India to provide good all-weather road connectivity to unconnected villages.
This Centrally Sponsored Scheme was introduced in 2000 by the then-prime minister of India Atal Behari Vajpayee. The Assam Tribune has reported that the scheme has started to change the lifestyle of many villagers as it has resulted in new roads and upgrade of certain inter-village routes in Manipur.
