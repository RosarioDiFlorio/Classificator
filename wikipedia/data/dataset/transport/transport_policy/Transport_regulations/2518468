The motive power depot (MPD, or railway depot) is the place where locomotives are usually housed, repaired and maintained when not being used. They were originally known as "running sheds", "engine sheds", or, for short, just sheds. Facilities are provided for refueling and replenishing water, lubricating oil and grease and, for steam engines, disposal of the ash. There are often workshops for day to day repairs and maintenance, although locomotive building and major overhauls are usually carried out in the locomotive works.
MPDs in Britain are now often known as traction maintenance depots.
