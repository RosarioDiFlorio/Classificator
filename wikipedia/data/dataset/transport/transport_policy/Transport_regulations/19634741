Out of position (OOP), in crash testing and car accident medical literature, indicates a passenger position which is not the normal upright and forward-facing position. For example, a common case observed in crashes is the position of an occupant when reaching for the car radio, or panic braking in unbelted passengers. The concept is of interest because small changes in a passenger's position can have profound effects on the actual kinematic response, especially in rear impacts, as shown both in practical testing and theoretical models.
