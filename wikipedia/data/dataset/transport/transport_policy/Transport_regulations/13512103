The International DuraStar, originally introduced as the International 4000 Series, is a medium-duty truck produced by Navistar International. First produced in 2002, it is the successor to the 4000 Series of the 1990s.
It is available in three variants, which are built on the same chassis. They differ in engines, drivetrains, brakes, and cargo capacity. It is a popular commercial platform used in a wide variety of applications, such as emergency services, towing, flatbed truck and as a cargo box truck. Variants of the Durastar are commonly used as a platform for both school buses and commercial buses. The DuraStar cab is much higher off the frame than the 4400 series cab to accommodate larger radiator and engine combinations and is branded DuraStar on the doors, where the 4400 / 4300 series is marked as the 4400 or 4300, respectively. The WorkStar and DuraStar share a very similar layout, although the WorkStar is strictly a Vocational chassis. The WorkStar and DuraStar are in the class 5 / 6 (4300 / 4400) and Heavy 7 / Baby 8 (7600 series) categories from yesteryear. Although this designation is no longer used in the truck manufacturing business. The 4400 designation is still used on the 2014 class 5 / 6 trucks. The 4400 is available with the Cummins ISB6.7 and Maxxforce 7 and the Maxxforce9 is available. The WorkStar is available with the DT466 through Maxxforce 13.
