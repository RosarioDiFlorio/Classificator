Courier software is typically used by companies that deliver packages by drivers or messengers.
Courier companies need a program to track customers that request a delivery, details about the package, and who will be delivering the package to the recipient. The central person responsible for a smooth transaction is the operations manager or dispatcher. In the 'old days', this was done on a chalk board or white board. Now shipments show up on a single screen, making it easier to follow up on the deliveries.
Each shipment typically is assigned a waybill number. Often multiple waybills (packages) are consolidated and shipped by a common carrier (truck, airline, ocean vessel). These waybills travel under one Master Waybill Number. A delivery agent is responsible for breaking apart the consolidation and getting each packages delivered. The software program should simplify the consolidation of these shipments.
Modern courier software allows customers to place and track orders from the Courier's web site. 'Track and trace' is the term for getting status information on a delivery. The proof of delivery (POD) is sent in the main office by the messenger, driver, or delivery agent either by phone, fax, or electronically.
