The Low Carbon Vehicle Event (LCV), is United Kingdom's premier low carbon vehicle event. It is held annually since 2008 at Millbrook Proving Ground at the beginning of September. The show consists of a technological exhibition, seminars sessions and Ride & Drive (of latest research and development and commercial available low emission vehicles) activities. LCV is a business-to-business free-to-attend event organised by Cenex and whose main aim is promoting the UK supply chain of the low carbon vehicle industry.
