A white fleet is the non-combat specific vehicles of armed forces. Such vehicles include vans, minibuses, coach buses, touring recruitment vehicles, and staff cars for high-ranking officers.
The term white fleet is used in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, and UK with reference to fleet management of the defence vehicular assets to distinguish from fighting vehicles and green fleet vehicles.
