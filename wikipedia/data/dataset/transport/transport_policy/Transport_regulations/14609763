In aerodynamics, the normal shock tables are a series of tabulated data listing the various properties before and after the occurrence of a normal shock wave. With a given upstream Mach number, the post-shock Mach number can be calculated along with the pressure, density, temperature, and stagnation pressure ratios. Such tables are useful since the equations used to calculate the properties after a normal shock are cumbersome.
The tables below have been calculated using a heat capacity ratio, 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  , equal to 1.4. The upstream Mach number, 
  
    
      
        
          M
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle M_{1}}
  , begins at 1 and ends at 5. Although the tables could be extended over any range of Mach numbers, stopping at Mach 5 is typical since assuming 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   to be 1.4 over the entire Mach number range leads to errors over 10% beyond Mach 5.
