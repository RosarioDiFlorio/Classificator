As railroads around the world haul larger quantities of freight efficiently, the title of world's largest locomotive has often been passed to new generations of rolling stock. Currently, with what information is published, the most powerful articulated and single unit locomotive is the HXD1, the strongest-pulling is the IORE, and the heaviest is the Union Pacific Coal GTEL. It should be noted that information is incomplete on some locomotives (for example, the 4E5K), thus, the current leaders listed in each category may not be the actual leaders.
