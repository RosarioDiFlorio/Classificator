The Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study is a transportation study initiated by the United Kingdom's Government Office for the South West and Bath and North East Somerset Council in southwest England. It was undertaken by WSP Group as a result of the de-trunking in 1999 of the A36/A46 trunk road network from Bath to Southampton. The final study reports were published in 2004.
