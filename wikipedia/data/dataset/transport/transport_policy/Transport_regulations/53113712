Four Four West Village, or Forty-Four West Village (sometimes partly transliterated as SiSi West Village due to its vernacular name is Chinese: 四四西村; pinyin: sì sì xi cūn) was a resident area in Taipei for the military personnel of the 44th Arsenal of Combined Logistics Command (Chinese: 聯勤第四十四兵工廠; pinyin: lián qín dì sì shí sì bīng gōng chǎng) and their dependents, completed in June 1949. Originally, it is said to have housed three-hundred households.
The government built the village along with Four Four East Village, after more troops were transferred to Taiwan and the capacity of Four Four South Village thus became to small. During the year of turmoil 1949, in total, more than six hundred thousand troops and two million "dependents" retreated from China to Taiwan. The majority of military residents in Four Four West Village had a rather high position in the army, as lieutenants or as field grade officers, whereas the general soldiers lived in Four Four East Village and craftsmen and civilians lived in Four Four South Village. The resident environment was considered premium and the descendants usually enjoyed a better education. Every house had a garden and a yard.
Along with the other military dependents' villages which were built to accommodate the immigrants (which consisted mostly of soldiers and their dependents) during the immigration wave across the Taiwan Strait following the failure of the Nationalist government during the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, the villages were named 竹籬笆 (pinyin: zhú lí ba; literally: "bamboo fences").
