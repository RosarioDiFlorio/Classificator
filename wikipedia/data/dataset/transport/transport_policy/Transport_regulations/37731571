HeyRide is a platform and app that offers free or discounted rides to restaurants. HeyRide was developed at Startupbootcamp Berlin in the fall of 2015. 
HeyRide also refers to the Austin, Texas ridesharing platform. The service was facilitated using a mobile app that connected travelers with available drivers, and automatically manages payments. It gained over 500 participants after launching in October 2012.
The City of Austin opposed Heyride as a violation of the City Code. On Feb 14 2013 Ride-sharing startup SideCar LLC acquired Heyride.
