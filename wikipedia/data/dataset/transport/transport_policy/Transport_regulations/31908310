Source London is a network of electric vehicle charging points in London. It is owned by IER.
Charging points are located in residential streets, public car parks, at supermarkets, shopping centres and similar places. Use of a Source London branded charging point requires registration with the network's website and the payment of an annual fee of £48 per vehicle. Users are required to pay the annual subscription (also payable in monthly instalments of £4/month) along with 3.6p/min for each charging session on their modern chargers. Registered members are issued with a card that is swiped on the charging point's card reader to permit charging an unlimited number of times.
