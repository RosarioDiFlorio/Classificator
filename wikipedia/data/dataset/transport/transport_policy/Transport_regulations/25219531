A Transport management system is a way of figuring out the best way to manage the efficiency of a particular transport. It is about figuring out the following decisions:
Is using 3000 cc vehicle or 5000 cc vehicle better to load and unload the orders for my customers in the long run?
Should younger drivers be put on morning shift and older drivers be put on night shift so every driver is optimized to work effectively?
Should I lease my vehicle or buy my vehicle?
How do I plan the delivery jobs and allocate them to my drivers?
