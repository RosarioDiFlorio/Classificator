The Nano-particle field extraction thruster or NanoFET is an experimental high-speed spacecraft engine under development by the University of Michigan. It provides thrust by emitting charged particles. These particles are cylindrical carbon nanotubes which can either be contained in tanks or manufactured in-flight. By varying the size of these particles, the nanoFET can vary its fuel efficiency (specific impulse), and consequently the amount of thrust output, while maintaining high power efficiency. This adjustability gives the nanoFET the performance characteristics of all the electric thrusters in one. Like other electric propulsion systems, the nanoFET is not intended for operation inside earth's atmosphere but for operations in orbit and deep space.
