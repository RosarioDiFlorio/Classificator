The Transport Legislation Review was a policy and legislation review project conducted by the Department of Transport in the State of Victoria, Australia between 2004 and 2010. The aim of the project was review of transport policy and laws and generation of new policy and legislation as a platform for better transport across the State.
The Review was the most extensive project of its kind in transport in Victoria and touched all areas of transport including land and water based transport activities. Proposals were developed by the Review for consideration by the Victorian Government and proceeded initially as policy ideas. Proposals were progressively refined over time using modules and sub projects sometimes in response to stakeholder input. Outputs from Review often proceeded as new State regulatory schemes and laws, commonly in the form of Bills considered by the Victorian Parliament.
The new laws which arose from the Review had regulatory and de-regulatory effects in particular areas. The Review was notable for pursuing principle-based initiatives, introducing performance-based concepts into transport law often in the form of safety duties owed by industry participants to persons using transport services and to other industry participants and suites of new administrative and court sanctions targeted at non compliance. The project also had significant impacts on organisational arrangements in Victorian transport.
The Review commenced in early 2004 and concluded in late 2010. The former Victorian Government Ministers who oversaw the work of the project at times were Peter Batchelor, Lynne Kosky, Tim Pallas and Martin Pakula.
