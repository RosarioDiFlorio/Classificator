The Armoured Multi Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a well-protected light armoured 4x4 vehicle that has been developed as a joint venture between Germany’s Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV) and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW). It was developed for the German Army’s Protected Command and Function (GFF) Group 2 requirement.
The overall design of the AMPV has moved forward from the Cold War thinking of previous generation wheeled armoured vehicles, and throughout it has been optimised for current asymmetric conflict operations. According to the manufacturer, right from the outset, purely military requirements dictated AMPV’s design. In the process, the development team took systematic account of experience gained during the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and other operations worldwide. As a result, the AMPV is now the best-protected vehicle in its class anywhere.
