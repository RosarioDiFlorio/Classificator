A road switcher is a type of railroad locomotive which is employed for hauling railcars in mainline service, as well as shunting cars as is commonly done in a railroad yard. Both type and term are North American in origin, although similar types have been used elsewhere. Since the road switcher must work some distance away from a yard, it must be able to operate at road speeds, it must also have high-visibility while it is switching, and it must have the ability to run in both directions. Additionally, a road switcher must have the power rating and cooling capacity of a traditional road engine, and a road switcher must have high-speed (i.e., road) trucks, not low-speed (i.e., switcher) trucks. Modern road trucks are always equipped with (frictionless) roller bearings; switcher trucks were almost always equipped with (friction) plain bearings, until such bearings were outlawed in interchange service on railcars and locomotives.
