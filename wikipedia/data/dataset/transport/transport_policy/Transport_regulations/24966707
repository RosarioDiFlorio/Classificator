Telega (Russian: теле́га, IPA: [tʲɪˈlʲɛgə]) is a type of four-wheel horse-drawn vehicle, whose primary purpose is to carry loads, similar to a wain, known in Russia and other countries. It has been defined as "a special type commonly used in the southern and south-western provinces for the carriage of grain, hay and other agricultural products".
It is described and spelled telga in Jules Verne's novel Michael Strogoff.
