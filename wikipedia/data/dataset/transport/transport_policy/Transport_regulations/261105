Roadkill refers to an animal or animals that have been struck and killed by motor vehicles on highways. It is important because of the animal suffering, loss of wild animals, road safety, and the economic impact on both drivers and road management. For this reason it has increasingly become the topic of academic research to understand the causes, and how it can be mitigated. Some roadkill can also be eaten.
