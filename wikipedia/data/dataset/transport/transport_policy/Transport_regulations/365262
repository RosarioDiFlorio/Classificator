Parasitic drag is drag that results when an object is moved through a fluid medium. In the case of aerodynamic drag, the fluid medium is the atmosphere. Parasitic drag is a combination of form drag, skin friction drag and interference drag. The other components of total drag, induced drag, wave drag, and ram drag (see Ram pressure), are separate types of drag, and are not components of parasitic drag. Parasitic drag does not result from the induction of lift on the body, hence it is considered parasitic.
