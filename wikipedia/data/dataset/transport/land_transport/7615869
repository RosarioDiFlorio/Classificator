The Nissan Rogue is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan. It made its debut in October 2007 for the 2008 model year. The current model, the second generation launched in 2013, is the North American version of the Nissan X-Trail. It is currently Nissan's best-selling vehicle in the United States.
The Rogue is powered by a 170 hp (127 kW; 172 PS), 2.5 L four-cylinder QR25DE engine mated to a standard continuously variable transmission, and comes standard with front-wheel-drive. The Rogue costs less than Nissan's Murano crossover SUV, but at 105.8 cu ft (3.00 m3) vs. 108.1 cu ft (3.06 m3) offers only slightly less passenger volume than its V6-powered sibling, and a nearly equal cargo area of 39.3 cu ft (1,110 L) vs. 39.6 cu ft (1,120 L).
The first generation Rogue remained in production for the 2013â€“2015 model years as the Rogue Select.
The Rogue is manufactured at the Nissan Smyrna assembly plant.
