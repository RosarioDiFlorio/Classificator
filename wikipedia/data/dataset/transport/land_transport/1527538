The BMW X3 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured by German automaker BMW since 2003. Based on the BMW 3 Series platform, and now in its third generation, BMW markets the crossover as a Sports Activity Vehicle, the company's proprietary descriptor for its X-line of vehicles. The first generation X3 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz, Austriaâ€”who also manufactured all X3s under contract to BMW. BMW manufactures the second generation X3 at their Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, United States.
When specifications are taken into account, the X3 competes with the Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class (formerly Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class), Audi Q5, Porsche Macan, Jaguar F-Pace, and the Range Rover Evoque, thus putting it into the compact luxury crossover segment of the automobile industry.
