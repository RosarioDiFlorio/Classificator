The Fiat Tempra (Type 159) is a small family car produced by the Italian automaker Fiat from 1990 to 1996. The Tempra was intended as a replacement for the Fiat Regata. The original project was called Tipo 3, being a mid size car between the Fiat Tipo (project Tipo 2) and the bigger Fiat Croma (project Tipo 4). The Tempra shares its Type Three platform with the Lancia Dedra and Alfa Romeo 155.
The Tempra was named the 1991 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.
