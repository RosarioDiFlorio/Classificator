VEPR (Ukrainian: Автомобіль Високо-Ефективної ПРохідності (Avtomobil Vysoko-Efektyvnoyi PRokhidnosti) is a Ukrainian multi-purpose off-road vehicle designed and assembled by the Kremenchuk Automobile Assembly Plant. (The name is a pun:Ukrainian: Вепр, wild boar.)
The designers' goal was to create an SUV-type vehicle which would have the same terrain ability traditionally reserved for larger cargo vehicles, such as the KrAZ and Ural. The patent has been received for the passenger-cargo vehicle.
The per-unit price of the VEPR is estimated to be between $50,000 and $250,000.
