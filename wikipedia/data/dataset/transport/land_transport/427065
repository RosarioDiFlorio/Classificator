The Nissan Navara is the name for the D22 and D40 generations of Nissan light comercials sold in Asia and Europe; and the name for all generations of the vehicles in Australia. In North, Central and South America it is sold as the Nissan Frontier. The D22 line began in 1997, replacing the D21 Nissan Navara truck. As of 2002, the D22 series pickup is no longer sold in Japan; the D22's primary market being North America. It is currently built at the Nissan factory in Canton, Mississippi, United States. The Nissan Navara ST-X 550 is available with or without leather and GPS navigation.
For the Australian market, the D22 ran as a series 1 from the end of the D21 until 2003, when a series 2 was released with a new ZD30 Diesel engine and updated front end. The ZD30 powered D22's were exceptionally reliable unlike the Patrol counterparts, but were replaced in 2008 with an upgraded Common Rail 2.5L Diesel engine. The D22 Navara was run in parallel with the larger D40 until 2015. Both were replaced by the D23 Navara - locally known as the NP300 Navara as of 2015. This is not the same NP300 as the rest of the world, confusingly. This D23 is the basis of the upcoming X series Mercedes-Benz utility vehicle.
Nissan was the pioneer of the "Hardbody" or "Nissan Frontier" since 1986. The first was the D21, considered to be a small pick up. After more than 10 years with the D21, the second generation Navara was manufactured from 1997 and went until 2004 which was classed as a compact sized pick up. It was replaced with the bigger, taller, longer D40, which Nissan now considers to be a mid-size pick up truck.
The Navara gets its name from the Navarre region of northern Spain, and the European version is built at the Nissan factory in Barcelona. In many European markets it is sold as the Nissan NP300.
