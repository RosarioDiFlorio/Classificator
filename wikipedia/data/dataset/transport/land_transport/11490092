The Sand Cat (Hebrew: פלסן קרקל‎, also Plasan Caracal) is a composite armored vehicle designed by Plasan of Israel. It is based on a commercial Ford F-Series chassis shortened to a 2.84 m (112 in) wheelbase by Manning Equipment of Louisville, Kentucky, United States. Originally designed as a potential replacement for the AIL Storm jeeps of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), they have since developed numerous versions of the vehicle from 4 to 6 tons to transport up to 8 soldiers. Examples have undergone trials by the IDF in Israel and the U.S. Army at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
A heavily armored version of the Sand Cat featuring ceramic body parts was presented to the U.S. military at the Platform System Demonstrator event in August 2006. At the 2008 Eurosatory, the Sand Cat was shown branded as an Oshkosh Corporation product.
The new Sand Cat Stormer featuring more ballistic resistance and new advanced technologies will be produced by IBN Industrias Militares/ IBN Military Industries (INBRA USA INC) in 2016.
