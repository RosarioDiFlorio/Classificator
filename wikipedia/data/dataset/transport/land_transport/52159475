The Mercedes-Benz X-Class is a luxury pickup truck produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a division of German company Daimler AG. Unveiled at a world premiere in Cape Town in July 2017, the new Mercedes-Benz pickup takes its chassis and some body panels from the Nissan Navara and employs many Mercedes-specific features and technologies. It is expected to go on sale in late 2017.
