Carwalking is the act of stepping onto and walking across a stationary car. Depending on the technique and equipment used, carwalking can lead to damage of private property. Carwalking is a protest against the negative impacts of high motorization rates in urban areas. It often is a response to cars being parked illegally in areas exclusively allocated to pedestrians. As a form of public protest it asserts the superiority (literally) of humans "over" cars.
