The Mitsubishi Cordia was a compact hatchback-coupé manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors between 1982 and 1990. Alongside the Tredia and Starion, the Cordia was one of the first cars imported and sold in the United States by Mitsubishi without the help of Chrysler Corporation during the period of the DaimlerChrysler–Mitsubishi alliance. The Cordia XP was the model sold at the Japanese Car Plaza retail chain and the Cordia XG was sold at the Galant Shop chain. The Cordia XG model had a somewhat smaller front grill.
The Cordia was one of the first mass-market cars to offer an optional electronic instrument cluster.
