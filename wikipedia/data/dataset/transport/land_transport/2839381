The Citroën C-Crosser is a compact SUV (J), launched in July 2007, designed for the French manufacturer Citroën, and produced by Mitsubishi on the basis of the Outlander. The equivalent Peugeot badge engineered version was the 4007.
It was expected that the car would be named the C7, but in October 2006, it was announced that it would be called the C-Crosser. The C-Crosser took its name from the four wheel drive concept car that Citroën first displayed in the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show. The C-Crosser was shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2007.
Together, the 4007 and C-Crosser were the first Japanese produced cars sold under any French brand. They had been planned to be assembled, for Europe, in the factory that was built in the 1960s to assemble DAFs, now Mitsubishi's Nedcar plant in Born, Netherlands, but this was postponed indefinitely, due to slow sales of the models.
From 2011, they were assembled at the Russian PSA Peugeot Citroën/Mitsubishi joint venture factory in Kaluga. In 2012, production of the C-Crosser ended, and it was replaced by the C4 Aircross. By the end of production, only 2,050 units had been sold.
