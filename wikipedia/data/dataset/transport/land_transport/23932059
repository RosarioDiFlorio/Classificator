The Cadillac ATS is a four-door, five-passenger compact luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by Cadillac and developed at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cadillac assembles the ATS at the Lansing Grand River Assembly plant in Lansing, Michigan.
The ATS is based on General Motors' Alpha platform and is offered in either rear- or all-wheel drive configurations. The ATS base engine had been a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter I-4 gasoline engine that produces 202 horsepower (151 kW), until the 2016 model year. Optional engines include a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 gasoline engine that produces 272 horsepower (203 kW) and a naturally aspirated 3.6-liter V6 gasoline engine that produces 321 horsepower (239 kW). The 2.0-liter engine replaced the 2.5-liter engine as the base engine for the 2017 model year. A diesel engine had been planned to be available in the future. All versions were equipped with a 6-speed GM 6L45 Hydra-Matic automatic transmission as standard until the 2015 model year. An 8-speed automatic transmission was introduced for the 2016 model year. The 2.0-liter turbocharged, rear-wheel drive version can be mated to an optional 6-speed Tremec M3L TR3160 manual transmission.
Cadillac debuted the ATS to the press in the United States in January 2012, placed the ATS into production in July 2012 and began selling the ATS in the United States in August 2012 as a 2013 model. GM began selling the ATS in China in November 2013. Cadillac currently sells the ATS in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and South Korea.
