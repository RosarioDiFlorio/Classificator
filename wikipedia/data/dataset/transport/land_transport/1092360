A hydrocopter is an amphibious propeller-driven catamaran with a boat-like hull, small wheels and pontoon skis (as in a seaplane). An aircraft engine with a propeller and air rudder powers this lightweight vehicle over water, ice, snow and land.
Used in arctic coastal regions during "rasputitsa" or great spring thaw, when ice hinders boats and cannot support ground vehicles, it is a low cost alternative to hovercraft and helicopters and capable of rescue operations in weather conditions well beyond the safety limits of other vehicles.
