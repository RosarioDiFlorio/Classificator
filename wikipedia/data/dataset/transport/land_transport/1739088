The Isuzu Bighorn is a mid-size SUV that was produced by the Japanese automaker Isuzu between 1981 and 2002 and exported internationally as the Isuzu Trooper, Isuzu Trooper II, Caribe 442, Acura SLX, Chevrolet Trooper, Subaru Bighorn, SsangYong Korando Family, Honda Horizon, Opel/Vauxhall Monterey, Holden Jackaroo/Monterey and HSV Jackaroo.
In total, there were two generations of this vehicle: the first, produced between 1981 and 1991; and the second (UBS) produced between 1991 and 2002, with a substantial refresh in 1998. Production ended in 2002.
The Bighorn began as a rather basic and somewhat underpowered on- and off-road vehicle, offered only with four-cylinder motor, four-speed manual transmission, and part-time four-wheel drive. The first generation evolved to add both amenities and luxuries, including optional air-conditioning, power windows, and a more powerful V6 engine. The second generation was even more refined and available in two-wheel drive as well as four-wheel drive.
