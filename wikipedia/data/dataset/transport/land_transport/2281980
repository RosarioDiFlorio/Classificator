4motion is a registered trademark of Volkswagen AG, used exclusively on Volkswagen-branded automobiles with four-wheel drive (4WD) systems. Volkswagen has previously used the term "Syncro" for its 4WD models.
Of the Volkswagen Group's other marques, the "quattro" nomenclature is used for 4WD Audi cars. Sister companies Å koda simply uses the nomenclature "4x4" after the model name, whereas Porsche merely uses "4".
None of the above trademarks are specific to any particular 4WD system or technology being employed. Generally, Volkswagen would use Haldex Traction clutch system on their "4motion" transverse engined cars. For longitudinal engined cars, they would use a Torsen differential-based 4WD system or lockable centre differential instead.
