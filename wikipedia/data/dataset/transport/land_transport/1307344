For the Ford Bronco of 1966 to 1996, see Ford Bronco.
The Ford Bronco II is a two-door compact-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was manufactured by Ford from 1985 to 1990. The original Bronco was based on its own chassis, the Bronco II used a shortened Ford Ranger platform, allowing for mechanical and structural commonality. Following the shift of the Bronco to the full-sized F-Series truck platform in 1978, the Bronco II was marketed as a compact SUV.
The Bronco II was assembled in the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, alongside the Ford Ranger. In 1990, the Bronco II was replaced by the Ford Explorer; while still based on the Ranger, the Explorer was enlarged into the mid-size SUV segment. Following the discontinuation of the Bronco II, the next compact SUV produced by Ford in North America was the 2001 Ford Escape.
