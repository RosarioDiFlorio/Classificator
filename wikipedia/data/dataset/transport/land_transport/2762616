The Ford Fusion is a four-door, five passenger mid-size sedan manufactured and marketed by Ford across three generations in gasoline, gas/electric hybrid, and full electric variants. Introduced for model year 2006, the Fusion is manufactured at Ford's Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly plant along with its rebadged variant the Lincoln MKZ — and formerly with its now discontinued rebadged variant, the Mercury Milan, all sharing the CD3 platform.
Production on the first Fusions began on August 1, 2005. The Fusion replaced the Mondeo for the Latin American markets—except in Argentina (where the current European Mondeo is available) and in the United States and Canada (where it superseded the then mid-size Taurus and the compact Contour). The Fusion is positioned between the compact Ford Focus and full-size Ford Taurus. In the Middle East, this model is sold alongside the Mondeo. Versions sold there are available only with the 2.5-liter engine. Unlike in the United States, Canada and Latin America, no V6 engine is available in that region. The same is true in South Korea, where only the 2.5-liter engines (including those for the hybrid model) are available as of the 2012 model year.
The third generation line-up includes a gasoline engine option, an EcoBoost engine option, a next-generation hybrid model, and a plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi, making the Ford Fusion the first production sedan to offer these four options. Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid versions began in the U.S. in October 2012 under the 2013 model. Sales in Europe and Asia, as Ford Mondeo, are expected to begin in 2015, along with South Africa, where the Fusion name will be used. Deliveries of the Fusion Energi began in the U.S. in February 2013. The entire 2013 Ford Fusion line-up was awarded with the 2013 Green Car of the Year at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show.
