The sixth generation of the Ford F-Series is a line of pickup trucks and medium-duty commercial trucks that were produced by Ford from 1972 to 1979. This generation was launched in December 1972 for the 1973 model year. These were the last generation of trucks to use the F-Series chassis introduced in 1965. After a decade as a compact SUV, the Bronco was redesigned as a shortened version of the F-Series. This generation also marks the introduction of the F-150, which today is the most popular model.
This generation is noted for the body panels' durability as Ford used extensive amounts of galvanized sheet metal to fight corrosion. In 1976, the F-Series became the best-selling trucks in America, a position it has continued to hold ever since.
