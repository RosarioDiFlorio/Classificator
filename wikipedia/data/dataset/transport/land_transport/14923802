The Shuanghuan SCEO is an off-road vehicle manufactured by the Chinese auto maker Shijiazhuang Shuanghuan Automobile Co based in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Following a court case in Germany brought by BMW, the car was banned from sale in Germany. It is sold in Italy and central Europe, following BMW losing its court case in Italy.
The company has copied the looks of the Toyota Land Cruiser inside and at the front end, the BMW X5 at the rear end, the BMW X3 at the sides. Its badge is very similar to SsangYong's. Its design was the cause of many disputes when the company wanted to show it at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2007.
