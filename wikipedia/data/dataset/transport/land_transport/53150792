The second generation of the Chrysler minivans are a series of minivans produced and marketed by Chrysler Corporation in North America and Europe from the 1991 to 1995 model years. Sold as both passenger and cargo vans, this is the second of six generations of Chrysler minivans.
Launched in late 1990 for the 1991 model year, the second-generation vehicles introduced several features to the minivan series. In response to similar versions produced by Ford and General Motors, Chrysler introduced all-wheel drive as an optional powertrain. The second-generation vans would become the first American-market minivans produced with driver-side (1991) and dual airbags (1994); in 1993, integrated child seats became an option for the second-row bench seat. Conversely, this generation is the final version sold with a manual transmission.
Mechanically, the second-generation minivans utilize the same S-platform chassis as the first-generation minivans, though many revisions to steering, suspension, and body structure would leave to the AS-platform designation. Alongside the Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager and Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, Chrysler sold the Town & Country and Chrysler Voyager (the latter for European export).
As with its predecessor, Chrysler assembled second-generation minivans at Windsor Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, with additional production sourced from Saint Louis (North) Assembly in Fenton, Missouri from 1990 to 1994. In 1992, to supplement exports from the United States, the Chrysler Voyager began production in Graz, Austria (in the Eurostar joint venture factory between Chrysler and Steyr-Daimler-Puch).
