The Hummer H3 is a sport utility vehicle/off-road vehicle from Hummer that was produced from 2005 to 2010. Introduced for the 2006 model year, it was based on a highly modified GMT355 underpinning the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon compact pickup trucks that were also built at GM's Shreveport Operations in Shreveport, Louisiana and the Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa. The H3 was the smallest among the Hummer models, and the only one to be built by General Motors. It was available either as a traditional midsize SUV or as a midsize pickup known as the H3T.
