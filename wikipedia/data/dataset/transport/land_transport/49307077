The KTM 200 consists of a series of two-stroke off-road enduro motorcycles made by KTM, the European, road legal 200 EXC, and the 200 XC-W for the US market being the last versions. The 200 attempts to combine the agility of a 125 cc class motorcycle with the power of a 250 cc. As a small bore enduro bike it is equipped with a wide-ratio gear box. Starting in 2013 all 200's came with electric start.
