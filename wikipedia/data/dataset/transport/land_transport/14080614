The Nike ONE is a playable vehicle in Gran Turismo 4 for the Sony PlayStation 2. The design was developed by the athletic wear company Nike and Polyphony Digital in order to place the brand "Nike" within the gaming product.
In the video game, this vehicle resembles a "Sci-Fi" buggy with a maximum speed of 230 miles per hour (370 km/h) and an eight-gear automatic transmission. However, the top speed of 230 miles per hour can only be achieved by drivers in their physical peak (those who exercise between 60 minutes and 120 minutes per day). The fictional timeline of this vehicle would see its origins in the year 2022 with the invention of a wearable generator by the Nike Sport Research Lab.
In the Gran Turismo 4 game, no fuel bar is shown when the player is driving the Nike ONE vehicle.
