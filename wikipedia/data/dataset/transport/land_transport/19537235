OKA Australia was an Australian company that manufactured all terrain vehicles, particularly four wheel drive trucks and tour buses. OKA is currently owned by the holding company Reymer Pty Ltd.
The OKA factory was in Bibra Lake, Western Australia. OKA manufactured three consecutive models: the XT, LT and NT. These models were available in a variety of body styles including cab-chassis, single cab, dual cab, multi cab and bus. While fewer than 500 OKA vehicles were built, elements of the company's designs and technology have been integrated into the vehicles of other manufacturers.
