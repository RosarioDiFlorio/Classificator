The sixth generation of the Ford Taurus is a full-size car manufactured by Ford. Produced since June 2009, it is the current version of the Ford Taurus in markets outside of China. Sharing its underpinnings with its 2008-2009 predecessor, the sixth generation features a completely redesigned exterior and interior, marking the introduction of Kinetic Design for the Taurus.
As the longest and heaviest Ford-brand sedan currently sold by the company worldwide, the sixth-generation Ford Taurus serves as the flagship sedan for the Ford brand in North America. Although never announced as the official replacement for the Ford Crown Victoria (which ended retail sale after 2007) and Mercury Grand Marquis (sold through the 2011 model year), the sixth-generation Ford Taurus is marketed in the full-size segment against many similar vehicles as the preceding sedans. Coinciding with the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand, the 2010 Taurus was designed without a Mercury Sable counterpart (for the first time); the Lincoln counterpart of the sixth-generation Ford Taurus is the 2009-2016 Lincoln MKS (functionally replacing the Lincoln Town Car).
Alongside the standard Ford Taurus, two variants of this generation are produced: the Ford Taurus SHO (introduced in 2010, after an 11-year hiatus) and the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan (introduced in 2013, replacing the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The 3.5L V6 of the 2010 Ford Taurus SHO marks the first use of the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost engine family in North America.
The Taurus, Taurus SHO, and Police Interceptor Sedan are assembled in Chicago, Illinois at Chicago Assembly (Torrence Ave. Assembly) alongside the fifth-generation (2011-present) Ford Explorer and its Ford Police Interceptor Utility variant. During its production, the Lincoln MKS was assembled alongside the sixth-generation Ford Taurus.
