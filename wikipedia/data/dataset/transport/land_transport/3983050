The Mazda CX-9 is a mid-size crossover SUV manufactured since 2006 by Mazda in Japan at its Ujina 1 plant in Hiroshima Prefecture.
Despite being built in Japan, the CX-9 is not sold in Japan's domestic market, as it exceeds Japanese government dimension regulations and the engine displacement obligates a large annual road tax bill. Instead, the closely related Mazda CX-8 is sold in the Japanese market.
