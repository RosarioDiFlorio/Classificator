The Yamabuggy is a side-by-side dune buggy. It made its international debut in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the SEMA Convention. It is designed to be a quick and agile competitor to vehicles such as the Yamaha Rhino.
The buggy is powered by a 400 cc Yamaha engine, capable of speeds in excess of 55 mph (89 km/h).

The buggy has been featured in magazines such as "Dirt Wheels", "ATV Sport", and "Sand Sport".
Although the vehicle can be classified as a small dune buggy, it has also been known to traverse other terrains, such as dirt/desert trails, forest areas, mud, and snow. Kyle Purdue is the principal of Yama Buggy Sales & Distribution.
