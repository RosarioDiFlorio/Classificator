The Mitsubishi Town Box is a kei car produced for the domestic market by Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors. It was initially available with the alloy-headed 4A30 657 cc straight-4 engine, but switched to the 3G83 659 cc straight-3 engine in 2002. At the same time, a slightly larger version of the same vehicle powered by a 4A31 1.1 L straight-4, the Mitsubishi Town Box Wide, was discontinued. The Town Box was discontinued in November 2011, ending the twelve-year production run
It is also sold in Japan as the Nissan Clipper Rio, while the Town Box Wide was also produced under licence in Malaysia as the Proton Juara.
