The Autobianchi Y10 is a 'designer' city car and economy car manufactured from 1985 to 1995 and marketed under the Lancia brand in most export markets (as Lancia Y10). The car was manufactured at FiatÂ´s Autobianchi plant in Desio, Milan until 1992 and after that in Arese, near Alfa Romeo's plants. It offered a very high level of trim for its market segment. The Y10 featured a new rear rigid axle suspension design (called Omega axle) that was subsequently fitted to the facelifted Fiat Panda. Despite its short length, the Y10 boasted a drag coefficient of just 0.31.
It sold rather well, for its unique style, luxurious trim and the continuously variable transmission that equipped certain versions. Its excellent aerodynamics, characterized by very clean lines and a Kammback, also provided great fuel economy. The model could be seen as a forerunner to premium superminis such as the Fiat 500 and Citroen DS3. Sales in the United Kingdom were not very strong, and it was withdrawn from sale there in late 1991. This was more than two years before Lancia withdrew from Britain, and all other RHD markets.
