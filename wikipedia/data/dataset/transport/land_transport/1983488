The Mitsubishi Pajero (; Spanish: [paˈxeɾo]; Japanese パジェロ [pad͡ʑeɾo]) is a sport utility vehicle manufactured by Mitsubishi. It was named after Leopardus pajeros, the Pampas cat, which is native to the Patagonia plateau region of southern Argentina. But pajero in Spanish is also a common term of abuse, usually translated as "wanker" or "tosser", thus perhaps why alternative names have been used for many markets. It is known as the Mitsubishi Montero (meaning "mountain hunter") in the Americas (except Brazil and Jamaica), and Spain, while in the United Kingdom it is known as the Mitsubishi Shogun.
In Japan, the Pajero was sold at a specific retail chain called "Car Plaza". Discontinued in the United States in 2006, the vehicle continues to be sold in the rest of the world in its fourth-generation iteration.
Thanks to their success, the Pajero, Montero and Shogun names were also applied to other, mechanically unrelated models, such as the Pajero Mini kei car, the Pajero Junior and Pajero iO/Pinin mini SUVs, and the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero/Shogun Sport.
Main rivals are the Land Rover Discovery, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado SWB/LWB and the Nissan Patrol Y61.
