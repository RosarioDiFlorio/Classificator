The Landships Committee was a small British committee formed during the First World War to develop armoured fighting vehicles for use on the Western Front. The eventual outcome was the creation of what is now called the tank. Established in February 1915 by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, the Landships Committee was composed mainly of naval officers, politicians and engineers.
The committee was chaired by Eustace Tennyson dâ€™Eyncourt, Director of Naval Construction at the Admiralty.
