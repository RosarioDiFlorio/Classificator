The Type 95 was a Japanese scout car built by Tokyu Kurogane Industries (東急くろがね工業, Tōkyū Kurogane Kōgyō), and was used during the war with China and World War II in the East. Between 1936 and 1944 approximately 4,700 were built. It was the only completely Japanese designed reconnaissance car ever used by the Imperial Japanese Army, which tended to use civilian cars.
It is the world's first four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle placed into mass production before the Willys MB (Jeep), which was introduced in 1941, the Daimler Dingo in 1940, the Volkswagen Schwimmwagen introduced in 1942, and the GAZ-61 in 1938. Its nickname is the "Yonki" (よんき) which in Japanese means "all-wheel drive". In the field, soldiers often called it the "daruma".
Only four examples remain: one built in 1941 displayed at the Motorcar Museum of Japan, one at the Retro Auto Museum in Moscow, Russia, one at the Redball Military Transport Club in Pennsylvania, USA, and one discovered in 2013 in a repair shop in Kyoto. The latter one was built in 1939, so it is a verified example of the earliest four-wheel drive passenger car. It was extensively restored at the request of Masahiko Kobayashi, at a cost of ¥13.24 million (approximately USD $116,000) which was crowd-funded, and was added to a Japanese military museum. The unveiling of the restored car with running engine is shown on video at the NHK World website.
