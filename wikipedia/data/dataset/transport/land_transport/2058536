The Honda Logo series GA3 - GA5 is a supermini produced by the Japanese automaker Honda between 1996 and 2001. The Logo was available as a three-door and five-door hatchback. It was a platform mate to the Honda Capa and replaced the Series GA1 and GA2 Honda City. The Logo was larger than the kei sized Honda Life, but was smaller than the subcompact Honda Civic. The Logo was eventually replaced by the Honda Fit on an all-new Global Car Platform introduced by Honda.
It was sold in Japan at Honda Clio, while the Capa was sold at Honda Primo. The Honda HR-V was sold at Honda Verno. It was sold in the United Kingdom from 2000 until 2001.
The appearance of the Logo reflected a determination on behalf of Honda to duplicate the sales success it experienced with the first generation Civic to increase sales as the Nation of Japan was beginning to feel the effects of what is called Japan's Lost Decade, the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, as the exterior dimensions and engine size almost match the first Civic. The name "logo" was chosen to focus on Honda's establishment of practical and economical vehicles, and Honda's "H" was proudly emblazoned on both the front and back of the car to declare this intent to return to what made Honda a market leader.
