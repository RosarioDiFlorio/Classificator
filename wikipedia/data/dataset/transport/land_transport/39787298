Rear-Eject Haul Truck Bodies are an alternative haul truck body style developed for quarry, road-building, steel mill, landfill and underground mining applications. Instead of lifting the bed vertically, the hydraulic cylinder pushes a ram-face horizontally through the body to eject the hauled load.
