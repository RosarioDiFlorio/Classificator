The KTM 300 is a series of 2-stroke enduro off-road motorcycles made by KTM. They are the Penton-inspired 1984 300 GS, the 300 DMX, the dirt only 300 MXC, European road legal 300 EXC and their current US counterparts the 300 XC (close-ratio) and 300 XC-W (wide-ratio gear box) respectively. The KTM 300 is designed for difficult off-road conditions. The 300 EXC and the 300 XC-W have a small headlight, speedometer, tail-light and somewhat softer linkless PDS suspension. Starting in 2009 all 300's came with electric start.
