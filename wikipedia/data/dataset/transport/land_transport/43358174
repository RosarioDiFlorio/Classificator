The Buick Envision is a compact luxury crossover SUV built by Buick.
The car was first introduced publicly in China on July 1, 2014, with a photo of the car under a cover and placed between a Buick Encore and a Buick Enclave. On July 21, some specifications and the first official photos, as well as its Chinese name “Ang Ke Wei” (昂科威), were made public. The car is produced in China by Shanghai GM and went on sale in late 2014.
As of October 2016, it is available in China, the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In addition to the larger engines offered in North America, Chinese buyers can also have a turbocharged 1.5-liter unit.
On December 4, 2015, Buick confirmed that the Envision will go on sale in the United States starting in the summer of 2016, making it the first Chinese-built GM vehicle to be sold in America. It will only be offered as an all-wheel drive, but would add a front wheel drive option after the 2017 model year. The Envision made its American debut at the North American International Auto Show on January 11, 2016, as a compact CUV, sharing the segment with a second generation GMC Terrain and a future Chevrolet equivalent that is being planned for 2017.
The North American version of the Envision will feature two powertrains: a 2.5L LCV four-cylinder with 197 hp (147 kW) and 192 lb·ft (260 N·m) and a turbo-charged 2.0L LTG four-cylinder engine SAE certified at 252 hp (188 kW) and 260 lb·ft (353 N·m), paired with a third-generation six-speed transmission, seven active safety technologies, and On-Star/Intellilink connectivity. For the 2016 model year it will only be available in the premium level trim but with two options. The trims will expand to five for the 2017 model year, when Buick sets the MSRP for the Envision at $34,990 (USD) for the base trim.
