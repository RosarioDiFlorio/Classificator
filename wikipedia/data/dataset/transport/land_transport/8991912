The Kawasaki KX250 is a 2-stroke motocross motorcycle that was introduced in 1974. The 2-stroke KX-250 was discontinued in October 2007 in the USA and September 2008 in Australia due to the rise of the four-stroke KX250F. The Kawasaki KX250F introduced in 2004 and KX450F was introduced in 2006 and both utilize a 4-stroke DOHC engine. Many factors came into play with the demise of the 2 stroke market, however 2 strokes are once again becoming popular due to the costs associated with maintenance of the very complex workings of the 4 stroke design.
This bike has been ridden to several AMA Motocross Championship wins, including a number of titles, in the hands of Jeff Ward, Jeff Emig, and Ricky Carmichael.
