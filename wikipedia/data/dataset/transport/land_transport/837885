The Alfa Romeo 156 (Tipo 932) is a compact executive car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Alfa Romeo. This range of vehicles were manufactured between 1996 and 2007 while the 156 saloon was discontinued in Europe late in 2005, leaving the Q4 Crosswagon to continue in production until the end of 2007.
Introduced at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Alfa Romeo 155 the 156 was well accepted and in the following year went on to win the 1998 European Car of the Year award
Cars were assembled at the Fiat Group factory in Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy and at a General Motors facility in Rayong, Thailand. Production in Thailand began in March 2002 and ran for only a couple of years and vehicles produced there were targeted for the Asia Pacific markets). Between 1997 and 2005, approximately 680,000 vehicles designated 156s were produced.
The 156 was available in saloon, Sportwagon estate and Crosswagon crossover bodystyles with seven engine configurations; it went through two facelifts, first in 2002 and then in 2003. The Sportwagon advertising campaign was made with actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.
In 2007 the 159 became the replacement for the 156. This replacement vehicle went on to also spawn the Brera, the two door coupe that replaces the Alfa Romeo GTV along with its convertible sister the new Spider.
