Sudden Impact is a monster truck currently racing in the USHRA Monster Jam series. The truck was originally driven by John Seasock and has been to four World Finals under his command. It is the first monster truck to implement a driveline blanket, made of Kevlar, which goes around the outside of the drive shaft loop to make sure that if the driveshaft breaks, the parts will not fly off the truck, possibly causing injury to fans and officials. In 2010 the truck was driven by a new driver Ben Winslow. He used to be George Balhan's crew chief. Another new thing is that it is now called Ground Pounder. The truck is currently driven by Mike Dufrene and Steven Hill and is the teammate to Amsoil Shock Therapy, driven by Jeremy Brady and Dave Radzierez. In the past, it has been driven by Dufrene, Hill, Winslow, Seasock, Carl Van Horn, Jon Zimmer, Sean Duhon, David Brown, Chris Lagana, Kevin Kosala, Chris Ryan, John Killinger, David Fray, and Casey Ladelle.
