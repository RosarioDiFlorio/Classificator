The Ford Explorer Sport Trac, sometimes referred to as simply the Ford Sport Trac, is a mid-size pickup truck sold mostly in North America produced by Ford from 2000 through 2010. The Sport Trac was based on the Ford Explorer SUV – not the compact Ford Ranger – because it was introduced when the Explorer and Ranger platforms diverged (the Explorer's chassis was a heavy duty variant of the Ranger's). The Sport Trac fell between the Ranger and F-Series in Ford's truck lineup, based on capability and price. It competed with other mid-size trucks and SUVs, such as the mid-size Honda Ridgeline and even the larger full-size Chevrolet Avalanche. During its first year on sale in the U.S., there was a waiting list of over 3 months. The Sport Trac was a Class 2 vehicle with a GVWR of 6250 lbs. and a maximum GCWR of 12,000 lbs. This made it one of the more and the then most capable mid-size pickups, having a greater GVWR and GCWR than the Dodge Dakota, GM's GMC Canyon/Chevrolet Colorado pickups and Toyota Tacoma.
The Sport Trac was discontinued in October 2010, even though it was announced in earlier press releases that production would end in 2011, since the 2011 unibody-Ford Explorer was introduced in December 2010. The Sport Trac was sold through the 2011 calendar year as a 2010 model.
