A trackless train — or tram (U.S. English), road train, land train, parking lot tram, Dotto train or Choo-Choo train — is a road-going articulated vehicle used for the transport of passengers, comprising a driving vehicle pulling one or more carriages connected by drawbar couplings, in the manner of a road-going railway train. Similar vehicles may be used for transport of freight or baggage for short distances, such as at a factory or airport.
