Audi S and RS models are a range of high performance versions of certain car models of the German automotive company AUDI AG. These cars primarily focus on enhanced "sport" performance. Production of Audi "S" cars began in 1990 with the S2 Coupé, whilst the first "RS" car appeared four years later with the Audi RS 2 Avant.
Today's S and RS models are based on the A/TT/Q models with the same number (e.g S4/RS 4 is based on the A4 or the TT RS based on the TT), but the "Ur-S4" from 1991 — 1994 was based on the Audi 100/200 later named A6 and the first S2/RS2 generation from 1990 — 1995 was based on the Audi 80/90 platform later replaced by the A4.
