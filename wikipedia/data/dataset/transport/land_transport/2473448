GAZ Vodnik, Russian: Водник, (Automotive number GAZ-3937 and its modified version GAZ-39371) is a Russian high-mobility multipurpose military vehicle manufactured by GAZ. It is a "heavy modification" of the civil GAZ-2330 "Tigr". Its name comes from the Russian "водник" – a person employed in water transport, but is also used to refer to some person or object simply related to water. A better translation would be water bearer as in the astrological sign Aquarius.
The Vodnik was not adopted by the Russian Armed Forces.
