Last Man Standing is a motorcycle race held annually in Bulcher, Texas, US. The race consists of 300 of the world’s top enduro riders from around the world and they all converge on Bulcher for the Red Bull’s Last Man Standing Enduro event. The race takes place on the Red River Motorcycle Trails course straddling the Texas/Oklahoma border.
Located northwest of Dallas/Fort Worth along the Texas-Oklahoma border, the Red River Motorcycle Trails have some of the most challenging terrain in North America for racing Enduro Motorcycles. The event is a carved out 40-mile loop that features steep rocky climbs, descents, boulders the size of cars and forests with trees that one can barely walk through. The race also presents its riders with the 100 mph straight-aways of hard packed, loamy dirt and sand.
