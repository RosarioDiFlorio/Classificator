The Red Bull Frozen Rush is an off-road match race on snowy alpine skiing slopes. The event debuted in 2014 featuring eight short-course and desert off-road racing drivers. Road & Track magazine said "The unique action provided a mix between the traditional stadium-style off-road racing and the crossover jumping from Global Rallycross."
