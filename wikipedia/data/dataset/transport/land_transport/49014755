The Tuff Truck Challenge is an offroad 4x4 rock crawling event held since 2001. The event has always been held at a private property/farming land in Milbrodale in the Hunter Valley of NSW, Australia.
The event runs for 3 days with spectators camping near or on the Easter break annually.
Over the weekend teams, made up of a driver and navigator, must attempt to compete a number of courses marked out though rocks, trees and soil. Teams gain points the further they progress though the course, but lose points for a variety of errors (such as, using reverse gear, winching, touching the bunting or cones, etc.). Each course has a time limit but often vehicles breakdown, rollover or get stuck midway before they are able to complete the course. While there is a set time limit to complete the course, there is no points advantage for finishing the course in a quicker time - it's not a race and making it so would change the categorisation of the event requiring a different safety protections for the competitors, staff and spectators. As the event is about low-speed technical crawling, spectators can get relatively close to the course with a high degree of safety.
