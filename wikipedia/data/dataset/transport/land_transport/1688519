A private road is a road owned and maintained by a private individual, organization, or company rather than by a government.

Consequently, unauthorized use of the road may be considered trespassing, and some of the usual rules of the road may not apply â€” however, in some cases the owner of the road may permit the general public to use the road at their own risk. The most common types of private road are residential roads maintained by a homeowners association, housing co-op, or other group of individual homeowners, and industrial roads maintained by a corporation for access to an industrial facility.
