The Dodge Warlock, originally a concept vehicle and part of Dodge's late 1970s "adult toys" line, is a wheelbase truck that was produced in limited production in 1976 and regular production from 1977 to 1979. They were available in 4x2 and 4x4 models. The 4X4 models were named Power Wagons. The 1978 models were offered only in black. There were utiline trucks available in any color. The warlock only came in black. Its main draw was that it was a factory customizable truck, also known as a "trick truck", and was designed to appeal to young 4x4 buyers. The Warlock featured custom wheels, wide tires, bucket seats, a Utiline bed, and oak racks for the bed. Optional equipment included five-spoke wheels, bucket seats, tinted glass, bright rear bumper, and power steering. All had black interiors accented by gold tape on the dash and the doors, and a "tuff" steering wheel. Like the standard pickups, it had front disc brakes, and a standard slant six or a V-8. The exterior was accented by gold pinstriping around the wheel wells and the body lines. the pinstriping continued inside onto the doors, dashboard, and instrument panel. Warlock was printed in gold on the tailgate. The 1979 model however is different in that it has "Warlock II" printed on the tailgate. It appears that all normal engine options were available. It could have come with the standard Slant six, the 318 with either the 2 barrel or 4 barrel carburetor, the 360, the 400, or the 440. The 318 appears to be the most common engine selected.
