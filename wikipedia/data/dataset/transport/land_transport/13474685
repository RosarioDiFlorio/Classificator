A ground-effect vehicle (GEV) is a vehicle that is designed to attain sustained flight over a level surface (usually over the sea) by making use of ground effect, the aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the surface. Among the best known are the Soviet ekranoplans, but names like wing-in-ground-effect (WIG), flarecraft, sea skimmer or wing-in-surface-effect ship (WISE) are also used.
In recent years a large number of different GEV types have been developed for both civilian and military use. However, these craft have yet to enter widespread use. The German Tandem Airfoil Flairboats or Skimmerfoils constructed by Gunther JÃ¶rg differ in their use of self-stabilising wings.
Although they may look and have related technical characteristics similar to seaplanes, ground-effect vehicles are generally not designed to fly out of ground effect. They are also dissimilar from hovercraft or hydrofoils, as they do not have any contact with the surface of the water. Ground-effect vehicles constitute a completely unique class of transportation.
