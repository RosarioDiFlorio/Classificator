The Dodge Durango is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by Dodge. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the Dodge Dakota, both featured a body-on-frame construction and both were produced at the Newark Assembly plant in Newark, Delaware. However, they did differ in that the first generation was classified as a mid-sized SUV, while the second generation was classified as a full-sized SUV.
The third-generation Durango is built on the same platform as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, features unibody construction, and has been assembled at the Jefferson North Assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan, since mid-2010. It continues as a full-sized SUV.
