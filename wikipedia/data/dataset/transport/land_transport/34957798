The seventh generation of the Ford F-Series is a line of pickup trucks and medium-duty commercial trucks that was produced by Ford from 1979 to 1986. For the first time since 1965, the pickup trucks were based upon a completely new chassis and body. Distinguished by its squarer look, sharper lines and flatter panels, the trucks were designed with improved fuel efficiency in mind; to this end, Ford added its new AOD automatic overdrive (four-speed) transmission as an option on light-duty models. The 4-speed manual and 3-speed C6 automatic transmission were retained from previous years. To increase longevity, Ford increased the use of galvanized body panels to fight corrosion. Pickup trucks were available in three body styles: regular cab, SuperCab extended cab or crew cab with two bed lengths. The crew cab trucks were very large, stretching nearly 20 feet long with an eight-foot bed. These trucks are considered amongst enthusiasts to be the last generation of great trucks built by Ford and are now beginning to become popular amongst restorers as the models have just reached classic car status. They are typically considered to be the last of the "classic" Ford trucks, due to the fact it had features such as glass "eyed" headlights that made the truck appearing to have a set of two eyes.
Along with the body and chassis upgrades, Ford made several changes to the branding of the F-Series over this generation. In 1981, the upscale Ranger trim was discontinued to create the nameplate for the company's all-new compact pickup that replaced the Mazda-built Courier. Largely superseded by the F-150, the F-100 was discontinued after the 1983 model year, but the F-100 nameplate remained in Argentina. In Mexico, there is an "F-200" which was introduced in 1976; this variant remained until 1991.
