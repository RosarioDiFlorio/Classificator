ARO 10 was an off-road vehicle produced by ARO and manufactured in Romania. The ARO 24 Series got a "little brother" in 1980, the ARO 10 Series. While the ARO-24 can be classified as mid-size SUVs, the ARO 10 is about the size of a Jeep Wrangler. It was produced in many body trims, equipped with seven different engines (both gas and Diesel), and came in both 4x2 and 4x4 versions. The ARO 10 was sold as the Dacia Duster in some international markets and as ACM Enduro x4 in Italy (assembled by ARO-Ciemme - 1987-1989). A model derived from ARO 10, named ARO Spartana, was also produced starting 1997. The last evolution of ARO 10, produced from 1999, was called ARO 10 Super, had a slight design revamp and was built on ARO 24 Series chassis.
