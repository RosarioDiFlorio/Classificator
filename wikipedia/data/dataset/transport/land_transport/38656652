The Jeep Cherokee (KL) is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by Jeep. It was introduced for the 2014 model year at the 2013 New York International Auto Show and the sales started in November 2013. The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to be built on the Fiat Compact/Compact U.S. Wide platform, co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat. The Jeep Cherokee is built at Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois.
The Cherokee was first previewed by Jeep in February 2013, shortly after the brand released three newly designed versions of its popular vehicles, the Jeep Compass, Jeep Patriot, and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Jeep announced that the all-new vehicle would be dubbed the Cherokee, and also that the new vehicle would make its official debut at the New York International Auto Show in March 2013. The Cherokee's official debut was made on Wednesday, March 27, 2013.
Jeep has also adopted the Cherokee name worldwide. The North American market saw the Cherokee nameplate for the first time since the 2001 departure of the Jeep Cherokee (XJ). Other markets retained the Cherokee name with the introduction of the Jeep Liberty in the North American markets.
The all-new Cherokee's wheelbase is 106 inches (2,692 mm), 1.1 inches (28 mm) longer than the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 5.1 inches (130 mm) longer than its predecessor, the Jeep Cherokee XJ, and 2.7 inches (69 mm) shorter than the original Jeep Cherokee (SJ).
