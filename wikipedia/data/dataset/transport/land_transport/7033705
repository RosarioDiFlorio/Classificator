The Willys Jeep Station Wagon is an automobile which was produced by Willys in the United States from 1946 to 1965 with production in Argentina continuing until 1981 as the IKA Estanciera. It was the first mass-market all-steel station wagon designed and built as a passenger vehicle.
With over 300,000 wagons and its variants built in the U.S., it was one of Willys' most successful post-World War II models. Its production coincided with consumers moving to the suburbs.
The Jeep Wagon was assembled in several international markets under various forms of joint ventures, licenses, or knock-down kits.
