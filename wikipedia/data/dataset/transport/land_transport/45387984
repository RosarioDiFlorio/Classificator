GEWI was founded in 1992 by Hagen Geppert and Dr. Karl Will. The “GEWI” name is derived from the first two letters of the two founders’ last names. GEWI began as a specialist developer of programmable hardware for global television manufacturers, with customers such as Sony and Grundig. In 1997, GEWI produced one of the world’s first FM receivers to collect RDS-TMC data to display on video monitors at airports.
With the ability to inform travelers, GEWI’s customer identified a new requirement, to be able to display more traffic information than was available. One of the problems at the time was lack of sources of accurate digitized traffic information. GEWI analyzed customer requirements and offered to develop software that would collect, view, create, store, and distribute traffic information to the RDS-TMC receivers. This became GEWI’s first generation of the TIC product, named “TMC Office”.
