The Kawasaki KDX200 is an intermediate enduro motorcycle intended predominantly for off-road use. It was introduced in 1983 after revisions to the preceding KDX175. It has been a long-standing model in Kawasaki's lineup, having been introduced in the early 1980s, seeing several revisions along the way up to the end of its production in 2006. The KDX200 had Kawasaki's KIPS (Kawasaki Integrated Powervalve System), assisting to maximize mid-range to top end power.
