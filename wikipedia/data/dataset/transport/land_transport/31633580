Buff Strength is a design term used in the certification of passenger railroad cars. It refers to the required resistance to deformation or permanent damage due to loads applied at the car's ends, either from push-or-pull loads on the buffer, Janney coupler or when rolling at slow speed into a fixed barrier such as a buffer stop.
