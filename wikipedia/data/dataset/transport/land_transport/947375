The Chevrolet Suburban is a full-size, extended-length sport utility vehicle from Chevrolet. It is the longest continuous use automobile nameplate in production, starting in 1935 for the 1935 U.S. model year, and has traditionally been one of General Motors' most profitable vehicles. The Suburban has been produced under the Chevrolet, Holden, Plymouth and GMC marques until the GMC version was rebranded as the GMC Yukon XL. For most of its recent history, the Suburban has been a station wagon-bodied version of the Chevrolet pickup truck, including the Chevrolet C/K and Silverado series of truck-based vehicles. Cadillac offers a version called the Escalade ESV.
The Suburban is sold in the United States (including the insular territories), Canada, Mexico, Chile, the Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel) as a left-hand drive vehicle, while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (United States and Canada) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).
