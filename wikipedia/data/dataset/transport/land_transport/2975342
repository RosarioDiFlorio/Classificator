Trucks! is an American television program that airs weekends as a part of Spike TV's Powerblock. It is hosted by Kevin Neils Tetz and Ryan Shand. The program focuses on automotive mechanics involving trucks and SUVs, ranging from improvement, to customizing, to creative works.
The show is involved with racing and/or customizing trucks, and in the past has included segments called "How It Works" where the host would visit with various technical instructors at Wyotech to discuss automotive related topics such as how a particular mechanical device operated or to review the specialized equipment it takes to diagnose or repair a vehicle.
The show was originally hosted by Stacey David and Mel Fair, who was also the program's director, writer, and producer. Fair left the show at the end of the first season to pursue an acting career leaving David as the show's only host. In 2005, David left the show to pursue another automotive show concept entitled "Stacey David's GearZ" which debuted on ESPN2 in March 2007.
After David's departure, Paul Vinson and Kevin Tetz took over as co-hosts for the 2006 season, although Vinson was rarely seen during the latter part of the season while Tetz began sharing the camera with Ryan Shand. Shand officially replaced Vinson as co-host beginning with the 2007 season, although no official statement or press release provided any explanation behind the change. Some online reports however have stated that Vinson may have been suffering from kidney failure and awaiting a transplant during the shows filming.
