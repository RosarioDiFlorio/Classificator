Guerrilla crosswalks are created by modifying existing pedestrian crossing or painting new crosswalk lines. This is done without jurisdictional approval and with the intent of improving pedestrian and other non-automobile safety. These interventions are a common strategy within tactical urbanism, a term used to describe any low-cost, often temporary change to the built environment intended to improve local livability. Guerilla crosswalks have been noted in news articles since at least 2009 and have become more well known as an urban strategy in recent years.
