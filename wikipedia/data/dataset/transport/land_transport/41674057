The all-new third generation Grand Cherokee (WK) was unveiled at the 2004 New York International Auto Show by Jeep for the 2005 model year. New features for Jeep included Quadra-Drive II four-wheel drive, rear-seat DVD player, and optional 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine. The 3.7 L V6 engine replaced the 4.0 L Straight-6 engine.
The design still emphasized power and luxury, with significant work done on reducing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). However, for the first time, Jeep also emphasized on-road performance to a similar extent as the cornerstone of its brand, off-road capability.
This new emphasis on on-road refinement led Jeep to replace the XJ-era live-axle with leading-arms front suspension (found in the ZJ and WJ) with a new design: an independent double-wishbone setup like that which debuted in the 2002 Liberty. The new Jeep changed its philosophy due to what it perceived as increasing demand in the SUV marketplace for on-road performance and decreasing demand for off-road capability.
The 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee made its European debut at the Euro Camp Jeep held in Ardèche, France.
The Grand Cherokee received a minor facelift for 2008. The bottom part of the headlights became rounded and High Intensity Discharge (HID) Headlamps with auto leveling were added and the lower portion of the front bumper became removable to increase the approach angle for off-road use. The 4.7 L was refined, now producing 305 hp (227 kW; 309 PS), and 334 lb⋅ft (453 N⋅m).
The 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee is available with an improved 5.7 L Hemi engine rated at 360 hp (268 kW; 365 PS) and 390 lb⋅ft (530 N⋅m) of torque. The engine uses variable valve timing to increase fuel economy.
