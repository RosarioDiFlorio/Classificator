The Bicutan AGT is an automated guideway transit (AGT) system under construction and development as of 2011 within the City of Taguig the Philippines. It will serve as test track for the second mass transit system to be built and developed in the country by local engineers.
Despite some media reports calling it a monorail, the system uses two parallel concrete beams to form a track.
