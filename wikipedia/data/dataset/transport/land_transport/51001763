The Luka EV is an electric vehicle designed and produced by MW motors of the Czech Republic. The Luka EV is unusual in having four wheel hub motors instead of a central electric motor. The body is based on the Tatra JK 2500 prototype and is made from fibreglass on an aluminium chassis.
Charging the battery takes 9 hours from a domestic single phase 220 VAC socket or 2 hours with a 3-phase rapid charger.
The MRK I and II prototypes were hand built as open source projects on Hackaday. The final production MRK III follows the previous cars closely but the details are closed source.
The MRK I prototype was nominated, together with five other vehicles, for the eCarTec Award 2015 in the Electric Vehicle category.
