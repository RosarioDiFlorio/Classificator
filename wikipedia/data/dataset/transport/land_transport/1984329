The Scat Tracker is a small offroad trike made by Penney's in the 70s. It has a rear-engine configuration, which gives it a very low center of gravity, making it fairly difficult to flip. They were powered by a 5 horsepower (3.7 kW) Briggs and Stratton gokart engine, through a Torque Converter and differential. The design is similar to the rear of a go-kart welded to the front of a minibike
