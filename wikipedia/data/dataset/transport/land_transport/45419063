Strollology or Promenadology is the science of strolling (German: Spaziergangswissenschaft) as a method in the field of aesthetics and cultural studies with the aim of becoming aware of the conditions of perception of the environment and enhancement of environmental perception itself.
Based on traditional methods in cultural studies as well as experimental practices like taking reflective walks and aesthetically interventions.
The term and special field of studies was created in the 1980s by the Swiss sociologist Lucius Burckhardt, who, at that time, was a professor at the University of Kassel, as an alternative to the technocratic centrally planned economy.
