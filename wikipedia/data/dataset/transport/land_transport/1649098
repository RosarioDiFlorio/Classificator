An Ibex is a specialist off-road vehicle, ready-built or supplied as a kit to build with donor parts from a Land Rover Defender on a monocoque chassis. The Ibex can be delivered with different wheel bases and body type.
Among other features, the Ibex can be built or delivered with Foer's patented Vector winching system. A winch is mounted centrally in the vehicle, and the cable runs to fairleads front and rear. This allows the vehicle to pull in either direction, or pull out the cable and secure it both ways, so that the vehicle can pull along the cable like a cable car. [1]
There has been four generations of ibex from the mk1 in 1988 to the current "IBEX F8"
Ibex are manufactured in the Hexham, Northumberland, England, by Foers Engineering Ltd.
