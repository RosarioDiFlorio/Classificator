Chevrolet Blazer (and GMC Jimmy) can refer to one of several Truck models from General Motors:
The full-size Chevrolet K5 Blazer, based on the C/K pickup chassis and built from 1969 to 1999 (renamed to Tahoe in 1995 for the 2-door model)
The compact and mid-size Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, based on the S-10 pickup and built from 1983 to 2005
The Chevrolet TrailBlazer, originally a trim package on the S-10 Blazer until 2002, when it became its own, larger model
The Chevrolet Tahoe, sold in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela under the Grand Blazer name from 1990 to 2000
The Chevy K5 blazer never came with a soft top option.
