The Rayton-Fissore Magnum is an Italian-designed and built luxury off-roader, in small scale production between 1985 and 2003. The American V8 powered versions were marketed as Laforza.
The Magnum began life intended for military and police use, but the Tom Tjaarda designed car, fitted with Italian leather interior and a range of 4, 6 and 8-cylinder engines was marketed as a "luxury 4x4" competing with the Range Rover. European-market Magnums received a range of more fuel-efficient smaller engines, to reflect European market conditions, including turbodiesels.
The vehicle was refreshed in 1998 with a facelifted design to include more modern amenities, but still used the same basic body and drivetrain.
