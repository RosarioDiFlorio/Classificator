The Foton Tunland is a budget compact pickup sold by the Chinese manufacturer Foton Motor in Australasia, Colombia and emerging markets.
The Tunland line bears brand marks of premium component manufacturers due to joint venture agreements signed between Foton and established brands including, for example, Cummins diesel engines, Getrag transmission, a Borg Warner transfer case and Dana axles and differentials in the 4x4 (the 2 Wheel drive has a Tangshan 5 speed transmission), and Bosch electronics and ABS.
