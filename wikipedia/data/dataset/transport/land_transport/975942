The Nissan Cefiro is a luxury car that was produced by the Japanese automobile manufacture Nissan Motors. Introduced to Japan in 1988 as the A31 series four-door sedan, and exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called Nissan Satio Store, the Cefiro initially shared its basic rear-wheel drive chassis with the Nissan Laurel (C33), Nissan Leopard (F31), and the Nissan Skyline (R32). After production of the A31 stopped, the Cefiro dropped its sporting pretensions and essentially saw the standalone Cefiro model deleted from the lineup. This came with the introduction of the A32 and A33 Maxima, which took on the Cefiro nameplace in the Japanese domestic market although it bore no mechanical relation to the A31. The A32 and A33 closely follow the lineage of the J30 Maxima which was produced at the same time as the A31 Cefiro. The second generation (A32) and third (A33) generation Cefiro saw the switching to the front-wheel drive layout with a V6 engine. In Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand and Australia, the A32 and A33 series models were sold new as the Nissan Maxima. It is also badge engineered as the Renault Samsung SM5.
In North America, the Middle East, and Africa, Nissan retailed the A32 and A33 series Cefiro sedans through the Infiniti brand as the Infiniti I30 and later as the Infiniti I35. While the styling of the Infiniti versions was essentially identical to the Cefiro sold in other markets, the same car with revised front- and rear-styling was also sold in North America as the Nissan Maxima as cheaper, lower-specification model.
The word "cefiro" is Spanish for "breeze".
