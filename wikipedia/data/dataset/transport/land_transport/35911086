The Alfa Romeo Stelvio (Tipo 949) is a front-engine, all wheel drive, five-door mid-size luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by the Alfa Romeo subdivision of FCA since debuting at 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show and entering production at the Cassino Plant at the end of 2016.
Sharing the platform of the mid-size Giulia sedan, the Stelvio uses FCA's Giorgio platform, ultimately to be shared with Maserati, Dodge and Jeep.
The name Stelvio derives from the Stelvio Pass, Italy's highest mountain pass, noted for its 48 circuitous switchbacks.
