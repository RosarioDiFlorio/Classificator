The Lincoln Aviator is a mid-size luxury sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that was sold by the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company from model years 2003 to 2005 in North America. A rebadged variant of the Mercury Mountaineer and Ford Explorer four-door SUVs, the Aviator was the shortest Lincoln vehicle ever sold (at its debut).
Due to lower than expected sales, the Lincoln Aviator was discontinued following the 2005 model year, with many of its features integrated into 2006 redesign of the Mercury Mountaineer (and later the Ford Explorer). In the Lincoln model lineup, two crossover SUVs were introduced in the later 2000s: the five-passenger Lincoln MKX (initially intended to wear the Aviator nameplate) and the six/seven-passenger Lincoln MKT (slotted slightly below the Lincoln Navigator in size).
Along with the Blackwood and Mark LT pickup trucks, the Aviator is one of the shortest-produced Lincoln vehicles. For its entire production, the Lincoln Aviator was assembled at St. Louis Assembly in Hazelwood, Missouri, alongside the Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer.
