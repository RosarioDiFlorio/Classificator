The Infiniti QX60 body code L50 (formerly called the Infiniti JX until 2013) is a seven-passenger mid-size luxury crossover SUV introduced by the Infiniti division of Japanese automaker Nissan in April 2012 in the United States as a 2013 model. A concept version debuted at the 2011 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance event, while the production model was unveiled at the 2011 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is underpinned by an elongated Nissan Murano platform.
The QX60 is also the first three-row crossover to be released by Infiniti. Design work was done through 2009, by Naoyuki Ohkoshi under Shiro Nakamura. In 2012 Nissan announced that its mid-size SUV Pathfinder will also have the same platform as the QX60 for the 2013 model year. In keeping with Infiniti's new naming scheme for 2014, in which cars begin with Q and SUV's begin with QX, the JX was renamed "QX60." While the number previously denoted engine displacement (for example, 35=3.5L engine), the new number, 60, is largely to do with its place in the product lineup, with larger numbers usually corresponding to more expensive vehicles.
