The Kia Carens is a compact MPV launched in 1999 by the Korean manufacturer Kia, now in its third generation, and marketed worldwide under various nameplates — prominently as the Kia Rondo.
In 2006, Kia presented a second generation Carens for model year 2007. The Carens/Rondo followed Kia's introduction at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show of the Multi-S, essentially the Carens/Rondo in concept form — the S standing for Sporty, Spacious and Smart. The Multi-S differed significantly from the production model, only its inclusion of a dual panel sunroof running the length of the roof.
The origin of the name Carens is unclear, but no investigations of any negative connotations would seem to have taken place before launch, as it means lacking or being without in Latin. Carens is the present participle of the verb careo. The name Rondo derives from the musical term Rondo.
