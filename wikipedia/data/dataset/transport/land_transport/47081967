Hyundai Creta (Korean: 현대 크레타), also known as Hyundai ix25 and, in the Dominican Republic, Hyundai Cantus, is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Beijing Hyundai, a joint venture by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai and China's Beijing Group from 2014. It was first seen as a thinly veiled "concept" at Auto China (in Beijing), April 2014. The production model had its premier at Chengdu, in August 2014, and it went on sale in China two months later.
In India, the car has three engine variants including the 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol engines along with 1.6 litre diesel engine with five models for the Creta – Base, S, S+, SX, SX+, SX(O). Each model has a specific set of features which distinguishes it from the others and comes in seven colours. Trinidad & Tobago imports the Indian made Hyundai Creta in three variants, Basic, Advanced and Fully Loaded. They all have 1.6 petrol engines, with automatic transmissions.
