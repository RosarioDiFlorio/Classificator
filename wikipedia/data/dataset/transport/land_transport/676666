The RG-32 Scout is a family of mine-resistant 4×4 light armoured vehicles made by BAE Systems Land Systems South Africa (formerly Land Systems OMC) in South Africa. It is based on the RG-31, which is already deployed worldwide with peace-keeping, security and combat forces. The combat weight of the vehicle is about 7,300 kg and it has the capacity to carry a crew of 5 to 7. The vehicle crew is protected against 5.56×45mm NATO ball ammunition, grenades, firebombs, anti-personnel mines and side blasts. The five-seat version also offers protection against anti-tank mines and side blasts. Up to two RG-32Ms can be transported in a C-130 cargo aircraft.
The latest development of this vehicle is the RG-32M Galten. The RG-32M has undergone "winterisation" modifications in Sweden; the RG-32M has been used in environments ranging from 49 °C (120 °F) in the desert of Africa and the Middle East as well as at −35 °C (-31 °F) in parts of Sweden.
