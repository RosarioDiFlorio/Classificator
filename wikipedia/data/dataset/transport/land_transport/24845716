Momo Car-Sharing is an Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) project intended to promote a sustainable mobility culture supporting various transport options aside from car ownership. It has a total budget of €2,693,644, 50% co-financed by the European Union. The project acronym momo stands for more options for energy efficient mobility through Car-Sharing.
The project started 1 October 2008 and includes 14 partners (listed below) from various EU countries. The International Association of Public Transport (UITP) and the German association for CarSharing (Bundesverband CarSharing bcs) also actively support the project.
The City of Bremen – project coordinator – was selected with its Car-Sharing system as "Urban Best Practice" to be permanently presented on the World Exposition EXPO 2010 in Shanghai. The momo-project was presented in workshops on the EXPO and served as a reference for the inauguration of Car-Sharing in Shanghai.
The Bremen Car-Sharing Action Plan has also received the Travel Planning Award 2010 of the German Town Planner's Association SRL.
