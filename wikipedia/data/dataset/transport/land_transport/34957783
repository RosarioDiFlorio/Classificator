The fifth generation of the Ford F-Series is a line of pickup trucks and commercial trucks that were produced by Ford from 1966 to 1972. Built on the same platform as the fourth generation F-series trucks, the fifth generation had sharper styling lines, a larger cab and greenhouse, and expanded engine options.
Three trim levels were available during the production of the fifth generation F-series, though the names were changed in 1970. The "Base" trim became the "Custom" and the "Custom Cab" became the "Sport Custom" joining "Ranger" as optional levels of equipment and trim. Late in production the Ranger trim level was upgraded with the additional "Ranger XLT" option.
