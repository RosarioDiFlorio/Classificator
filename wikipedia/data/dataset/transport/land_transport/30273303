The HP2 Enduro is a motorcycle manufactured by BMW Motorrad from 2005 to 2008. It is a "High Performance" (HP) dirt bike based on the engine and electronics from the R1200GS adventure-touring model. The use of a trellis tube frame, a conventional fork rather than Telelever, and other modifications, make it 53 lb (24 kg) lighter than the corresponding R1200GS.
The HP2 Enduro was discontinued in 2008.
