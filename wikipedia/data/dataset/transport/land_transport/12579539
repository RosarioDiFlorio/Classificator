All Wheel Control (AWC) is the brand name of a four-wheel drive (4WD) system developed by Mitsubishi Motors. The system was first incorporated in the 2001 Lancer Evolution VII. Subsequent developments have led to S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control), developed specifically for the new 2007 Lancer Evolution. The system is referred by the company as its unique 4-wheel drive technology umbrella, cultivated through its motor sports activities and long history in rally racing spanning almost half a century.
According to Mitsubishi, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is AWD, "the AWC is a four-wheel dynamic control philosophy for maximally exploiting the capability of all four tires of a vehicle in a balanced manner to realize predictable handling and high marginal performance." The core of the AWC philosophy is the integration of Mitsubishi's various proprietary technologies, such as 4WD drivetrains, suspension technologies, braking systems, stability/traction control systems, and various differentials. Although initially developed for high performance Lancer Evolution full-time four-wheel drive models, the system is now incorporated in Mitsubishi's other 4WD vehicles, each having its own distinct configuration.
