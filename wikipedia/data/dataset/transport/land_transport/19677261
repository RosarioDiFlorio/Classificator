A Basic Utility Vehicle (BUV) is a simple rugged vehicle designed for use in the developing world. A slew of such vehicles were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s; most only reached limited production and market penetration as used Western vehicles often proved cheaper. In Southeast Asia, these are often referred to as "AUVs", or "Asian Utility Vehicles". They have also been called "Basic Transportation Vehicles" (BTV). The Institute for Affordable Transportation (IAT) currently holds annual competitions aimed at developing new such vehicles.
