The Jeep Liberty (KK), or Jeep Cherokee (KK) outside North America, is a compact SUV that was produced by Jeep. Introduced for the 2008 model year as a successor for the first generation Liberty. The Liberty featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. In 2010 estimates by Jeep were that 70% of Liberty buyers were new to the marque. The second generation Liberty ceased production on August 16, 2012. For its followup, the name of Liberty was retired; the next generation restored the name of "Cherokee". The model remains on sale in Venezuela as of early 2016 having yet to be replaced by FCA Venezuela with the KL model Cherokee.
