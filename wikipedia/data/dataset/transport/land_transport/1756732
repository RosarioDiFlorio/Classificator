The Chrysler Pacifica is a mid-size crossover produced by Chrysler from 2003 to 2007, for the model years 2004 to 2008.
The Pacifica was the first jointly engineered product of the 1998 DaimlerChrysler "merger of equals."  Chrysler developed the vehicle in 30 months at a cost below $1 billion. The CUV was inspired by the 1999 Chrysler Pacifica and 2000 Chrysler Citadel concept cars. The production model was first introduced at the 2002 New York International Auto Show. Chrysler marketed the Pacifica as a "sports-tourer," building the vehicle at the Windsor Assembly Plant, alongside the long-wheelbase minivans from early 2003  through November 2007. The "Pacifica" name was briefly used as a trim package on the Dodge Daytona for 1987-1988 after the Chrysler Laser was discontinued.
In January 2016, the Pacifica name was revived for a 2017 model year minivan, which debuted at the North American International Auto Show as a replacement for the Chrysler Town & Country.
