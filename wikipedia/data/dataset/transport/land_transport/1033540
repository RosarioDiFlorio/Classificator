The Nissan Patrol (Japanese: 日産・パトロール Nissan Patorōru) is a series of large four-wheel drive vehicles manufactured by Nissan in Japan and sold throughout the world.
The Patrol has been available as either a short-wheelbase (SWB) three-door or a long-wheelbase (LWB) five-door chassis since 1951. The LWB version has been offered in pickup truck and cab chassis variants. Between 1988 and 1994, Ford Australia marketed the Patrol as the Ford Maverick. In some European countries the Patrol was marketed by Ebro as the Ebro Patrol. In 1980 in Japan it became known as the Nissan Safari.
The Patrol is available in Australia, Central and South America, South Africa, parts of Southeast Asia and Western Europe as well as Iran and the Middle East, excluding North America where as of 2016, a modified version has been sold as the Nissan Armada. For the 2011 model year, it was made available in North America as the upscale Infiniti QX56.
The Y61 platform is manufactured as a military vehicle in countries of Asia and the Middle East. Various versions of the Patrol are widely used by United Nations agencies. Y61 models are produced alongside the current Y62. The fourth and fifth generations are the main troop transport vehicles used by the Irish Army.
