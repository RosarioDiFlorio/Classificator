Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE) is a proposed Spanish space probe that would splash-down in Ligeia Mare, the second largest lake on Saturn's moon Titan. TALISE would navigate across the lake for six months to one year.
If this mission is approved, it will analyze the liquid hydrocarbons sea and take scientific measurements while it navigates to the coast in the northern region of Titan. It is also planned in the mission to study the surrounding terrain of Ligeia Mare. This mission proposal was a joined project between Centro de Astrobiolog√≠a and SENER.
