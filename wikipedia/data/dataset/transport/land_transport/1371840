The ARO 240 is a two-door 4x4 off-road vehicle, which was manufactured by ARO from 1972 to 2006. It was the first of the ARO 24 series, which eventually included many other models: the four-door 244, the 242 pick-up, the three-door 243, the 320 pick-up, and many other body trims. Last special military versions were called ARO Dragon.
It is equipped with many different engines (both gas and Diesel), and comes in both 4x2 and 4x4 versions. Notable improvements over the years were the introduction of Romanian Diesel engines, units equipped with Toyota engines, and units equipped with Romanian-built turbo Diesel engines. The ARO-24s are no longer in production, as ARO was shut down.
Plans to market the ARO 244 in the United States as the Cross Lander 244X in 2005 were eventually cancelled. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s the original Romanian ARO 4X4 Series were also produced under alternative names often with modified running gear depending on the export market. In Portugal they were assembled in Lisbon and locally known as the PORTARO 4X4 and in Spain they were called HISPARO 4X4 with a reshaped bodyshell and better equipped.
