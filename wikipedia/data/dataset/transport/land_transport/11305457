Bear Foot is a monster truck currently owned by Paul Shafer. It was originally built by Jack Wilman and Fred Shafer (no relation to Paul) and, along with Bigfoot and USA-1 was one of the first monster trucks. It won the 1990, 1992, and 1993 USHRA Camel Mud and Monsters championships. Originally a Chevrolet, it became a Dodge in 1992 as a result of a factory sponsorship which lasted until 1997. Shortly thereafter, the truck was sold and Fred retired from the sport at the age of 50.
The truck was, for a long time, the primary rival of Bigfoot, and their meetings were heavily promoted. Today, the truck runs largely for Paul Shafer's own promotion.
In April 2008, Fred Shafer was inducted into the Official Monster Truck Hall of Fame.[1]
In 1985, the truck appeared in the music video for ZZ Top's single "Sleeping Bag", as well as appearing along with the smaller "Lil' Bear Foot" on an episode of Knight Rider.
