Métisse Motorcycles is a British low-volume manufacturer of specialist motorcycles and motorcycle frames, based in Carswell near Faringdon, Oxfordshire.
Since 1982 Métisse has produced motorcycle frame kits for British bike engines. Owner Pat French bought the tooling originally used by the Rickman brothers to produce lightweight, strong frames and rolling chassis for competitive motocross use. Métisse have focussed on using high quality plated steel for their distinctive frames. Pat French produced Mk IV frames and then MkIII for retro-scrambles until the mid 1990s when demand waned. A partnership was formed with Gerry Lisi to continue manufacture, which continued until French's retirement. Métisse now manufacture complete motorcycles, Métisse now manufacture complete motorcycles, usually using bought-in cycle parts and engines, although the recent Mk5 is fitted with Métisse's own engine.
