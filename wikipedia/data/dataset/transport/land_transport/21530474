The Lexus LS (XF40) is the fourth generation of the Lexus LS line of flagship sedans. Lexus debuted the model line at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, with variants including the standard wheelbase LS 460 (USF40) and long wheelbase LS 460 L (USF41); the chassis codes (USF40/USF41) are derived from the fourth generation XF40 platform code and UR series engine designation. In development from 2001, the final design was selected for the V8 models in late 2003, with the hybrid variant's design finalized in 2004. Introduced at the 2006 New York International Auto Show, all-wheel drive hybrid models, the standard wheelbase LS 600h (UVF45) and long wheelbase LS 600h L (UVF46), joined the lineup in the 2008 model year. The LS 460 and LS 460 L models feature a 4.6 L UR series V8 and an 8-speed automatic transmission, while hybrid models are powered by a 5.0 L UR series V8 engine equipped with electric motors, with a continuously variable transmission and all-wheel drive. All-wheel drive versions of the non-hybrid LS 460 (USF45) and LS 460 L (USF46) models were introduced at the 2008 Moscow International Automobile Salon. The XF40 received updates for the 2010 and 2013 model years.
Since its introduction, multiple fourth generation Lexus LS models have been sold worldwide, including standard, long wheelbase, hybrid, and all-wheel-drive versions. At its introduction, the LS 600h L became the most expensive sedan produced in Japan, with a sticker price of approximately US$125,000.
