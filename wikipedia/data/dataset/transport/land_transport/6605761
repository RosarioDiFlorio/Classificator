The Daihatsu Rugger is an off-road vehicle built by Daihatsu between 1984 and 2002. The Rugger was also called the Daihatsu Rocky in most export markets, and Daihatsu Fourtrak in the UK. It has also received a series of different names elsewhere, which is why it is often referred to by its chassis code (F70) to distinguish it from its various siblings.
