Samur or SYHK (short for Seyyar Yüzücü Hücum Köprüsü) is a Turkish amphibious armoured vehicle-launched bridge. Samur is the Turkish word for weasel.
The equipment was developed and produced for the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) by the Turkish company FNSS Defence Systems. After six years of development work, four units were delivered on September 14, 2011 in Ankara. The SYHK will improve the capability of the Turkish Army during river crossing operations.
