Raminator Rammunition and Hotsy Raminator are monster trucks that race on the Special Events, Monster Nationals, and Monster Jam tours. They are primarily driven by Mark Hall and Mat Dishman. The team is sponsored by RAM. Until recently, the team was, along with Team Bigfoot, one of the most high profile teams to not run in the USHRA, although they competed in several Monster Jam events, as well.
