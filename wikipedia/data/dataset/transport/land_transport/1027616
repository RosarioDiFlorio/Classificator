The Lincoln Mark LT is a luxury pickup truck that was sold by Lincoln. It first went on sale in January 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Mark LT is essentially a rebadged version of the popular Ford F-150 truck with a more luxury-oriented cabin. The Mark LT is a successor to the failed 2002-only Lincoln Blackwood (which was never sold in Canada), Lincoln's only other pickup truck, which was a rear-wheel drive vehicle. The Mark LT was built at Ford's River Rouge Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and at the Ford Cuautitlan plant in Cuautitl√°n, Mexico, on the same lines as the closely related Ford F-150. The Mark LT also had optional all-wheel drive.
The Mark LT is based on the Ford F-150 pickup truck. It uses the same 330-cubic-inch, 300 hp (220 kW) 5.4 L Triton V8 and has four doors.
Lincoln had hoped to sell 13,000 Mark LTs annually in the United States. The Mark LT was more successful than the Blackwood in its first year of sales with 10,274 sold in the first calendar year of sales; February 2005 through February 2006. The 2006 Mark LT outsold the Cadillac Escalade EXT, but the 2007 EXT gained on the Mark LT's sales consistently.
