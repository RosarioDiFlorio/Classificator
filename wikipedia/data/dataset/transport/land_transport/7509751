The Dispatcher Jeep, or DJ, was a two-wheel-drive variant of the CJ series. Production started in 1955 by Willys which was renamed Kaiser Jeep in 1963. In 1970, American Motors (AMC) purchased Kaiserâ€™s money-losing Jeep operations establishing AM General, a wholly owned subsidiary, that built this model through 1983. It was also the final light duty automobile to have front drum brakes.
