The Tomcar is a type of commercial off-road utility vehicle.
The Tomcar is made in two and four seat models, powered initially by either unleaded petrol or diesel engines and later also in electric. It uses a CVT transmission system and a chain driven final drive system, giving the vehicles a ground clearance of 38 cm (15").
The Tomcar's chain-driven swingarm system allows the vehicle an above average ground clearance and suspension articulation, and also create "anti-squat" or lift.
