Four-wheel drive, also called 4Ã—4 ("four by four") or 4WD refers to type of a vehicle, specifically one with its drivetrain capable of providing torque to all wheel ends of a two-axled vehicle simultaneously. It may be full-time, or on-demand, and is typically linked via a transfer case which provides an additional output drive-shaft, along with additional gear ranges.
When a four-wheeled vehicle has torque supplied to both axles, this is described as "all-wheel drive" (AWD). However, "four-wheel drive" typically refers to a set of specific components and functions, and/or intended offroad application, which generally complies with modern use of the terminology.
