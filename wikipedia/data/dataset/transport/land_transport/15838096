The Dozor-B (Ukrainian: Дозор-Б) is a four-wheeled Ukrainian armored car.
The Dozor-B is also used by special units of the armed forces (quick reaction forces and military police) to carry out reconnaissance, patrolling, and peace-keeping operations, as well as being used as the main transportation vehicle under combat conditions (including NBC environment). In April 2016 Ukraine cancelled the procurement of all Dozor-B vehicles due to constant delays, manufacturing failures, and budget overruns.
