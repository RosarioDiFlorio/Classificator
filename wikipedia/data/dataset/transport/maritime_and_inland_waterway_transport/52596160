Michael Jebsen (27 September 1835 – 30 September 1899) was a ship's captain and ship owner. He is seen by the company as a progenitor of what became the Jebsen Group, a trading and manufacturing company co-founded in Hong Kong on 1 March 1895 by his son Jacob Jebsen (1870–1941). During the early 1870s, with his own business interests increasingly centred on Europe, he returned to the town of his birth which was by now in Germany. In his final years he turned to politics, becoming a local senator in 1883 and a member of the national parliament ("Reichstag") in 1890.
