The Association of Waterways Cruising clubs is a waterway society and umbrella organisation in England, UK. It was founded in the early 1960s by the St Pancras, Dunstable, Uxbridge and Lee and Stort boat clubs as an inter-club scheme for an emergency service for boaters, and for safe overnight moorings.
The Association grew quickly from the original four clubs to eighteen, and it published its first handbook giving club locations and phone numbers. In the late Seventies, there were eighty clubs, and a regional structure was adopted.
Today, the AWCC represents over twenty thousand affiliated boat owners, through their membership of more than a hundred cruising clubs. The association enters consultations and negotiations with British Waterways, the Environment Agency and other bodies, and it is an Associate Member of the Parliamentary Waterways Group.
