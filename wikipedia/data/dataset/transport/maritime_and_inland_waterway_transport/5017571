The City of Poros was a Greek cruise ship that made day-cruises for Cycladic Cruises to Hydra, Aegina and Poros from Flisvos Marina, a port in the Athens suburbs. The Cycladic Cruises' ship was roughly 200 feet (60 m) long, and ran the regular 16 mile (26 km) trip between the two harbours every day, with a carrying capacity of 500 passengers. Preceding the attack on the ship, a car bomb explosion at a pier killed two people. On the evening of 11 July 1988, the ship was attacked by a Palestinian gunman, who killed eight tourists before dying himself in a subsequent explosion. At the time of the attack, there were 471 people on board the ship.
