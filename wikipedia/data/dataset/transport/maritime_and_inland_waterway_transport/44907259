The GPS2SMS term describes the transfer of co-ordinates of an object or person by means of SMS text messaging. For this, the following applications are suitable:
Anti-theft system for vehicles and vessels (sound the alarm if it is transported)
tracking and tracing (tracking of an object, such as a shipping container)
geofencing (sound the alarm if someone enters a prohibited area)
digital breadcrumb trail making a route followed

SMS messages can be sent from any device that has a GSM modem or phone and a GPS receiver. There are commercial handheld devices in the market, built-in systems for vehicles, software for computers or mobile devices, as well as some homebuilding projects, such as a small device that connects a mobile phone with a GPS.
For the detection of theft of a vehicle, a device may be used which sends an SMS alert to the monitor coordinates of the object, as soon as it leaves a particular area.
