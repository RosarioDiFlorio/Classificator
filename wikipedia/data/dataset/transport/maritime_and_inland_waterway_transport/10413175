Silversea Cruises is a privately owned luxury cruise line with its headquarters in Monaco. Founded in 1994, it pioneered all-inclusive cruising with its first ship, Silver Cloud.
Silversea's co-founders, owners and operators are the Lefebvre family of Rome, Italy. As of early 2014, the company had eight boutique cruise ships, each of which carries only 100 to 540 passengers. In spring 2017, Silversea added the slightly larger (596 passenger) Silver Muse, for a total of nine all-suite ships.
