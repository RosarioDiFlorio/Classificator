Floating armouries are vessels used to store military grade weapons. Being in possession of military-grade weapons in most jurisdictions is prohibited or highly controlled. In the early twenty-first century piracy in international waters is a serious problem. In response, services that supply weapons on the high seas, often referred to as floating armouries, were implemented. These armouries provide transfer services to private military and security companies (PMSCs); the controlled weapons are available in international waters, but never enter waters under the jurisdiction of a state where they would be illegalâ€”they are delivered by an armoury to a client vessel, and returned, in international waters.
