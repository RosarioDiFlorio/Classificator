In navies and the maritime industry, damage control is the emergency control of situations that may cause the sinking of a watercraft.
Examples are:
rupture of a pipe or hull especially below the waterline and
damage from grounding (running aground) or hard berthing against a wharf.
temporary fixing of bomb or explosive damage.
