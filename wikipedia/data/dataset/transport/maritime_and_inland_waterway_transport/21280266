A Banjo Pier is a pier in the shape of a banjo.
The most notable example is probably the Banjo Pier in Looe, Cornwall, England (50.3510°N 4.4512°W﻿ / 50.3510; -4.4512﻿ (Banjo Pier, Looe, Cornwall)), as it was the first and thus the prototype for many others around the world. It was designed by Joseph Thomas and built by Daniel Taylor.
