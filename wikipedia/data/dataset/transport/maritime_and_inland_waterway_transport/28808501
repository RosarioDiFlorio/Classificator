IMPA Marine stores coding is used in the marine industry.[1] The system, of British origin, consists of a 6-digit code for marine products. This aims to bridge the language barrier and offer worldwide shipping companies an easy way to order goods. Related products are grouped in product classes.
This system has been used for over 40 years, growing from a small item list to an 40,000+ unique items list. It is the leading reference guide for maritime purchasing and supply.
