Bernard "Bernie" Goldstein (February 5, 1929 â€“ July 5, 2009) was an American attorney and entrepreneur. He was the founder and chairman of Isle of Capri Casinos and is sometimes called the "father of modern riverboat gambling" because he was the first person to run riverboat casinos in the Midwest and South after they became legal in the 1990s.
