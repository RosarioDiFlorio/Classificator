The United Arab Emirates Coast Guard is the official coast guard agency of the United Arab Emirates and is primarily responsible for the protection of the UAE's coastline through regulation of maritime laws, maintenance of seamarks, border control, anti-smuggling operations and other services. The UAE Coast Guard is an affiliated branch of the United Arab Emirates Union Defence Force and works in close coordination with the United Arab Emirates Navy.
In 2010, the coast guard awarded the Abu Dhabi Ship Building Co (ADSB) a contract to build 12 patrol boats branded as the "Al-Saber" class. The agency was under attention in August 2010 when UAE Coast Guard officials foiled a terrorist attack on a Japanese oil tanker which was damaged in the Strait of Hormuz.
