The Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors (SAMS) is an organization of professional marine surveyors who have come together to promote the good image and general well being of their chosen profession. Accredited Marine Surveyor (AMS) members are surveyors who have accumulated time in the profession, and have proven the technical skills necessary for designation as AMS. There is, through the Surveyor Associate program, the opportunity for less experienced members to participate in SAMS and hone their skills under the tutelage of Accredited Marine Surveyors in their local area. Affiliate members, who benefit from the association with the Society's members, are professionals, corporations, and organizations active in the marine field.
