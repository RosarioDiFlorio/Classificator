Among the laws of ancient Rome, the lex Gabinia (Gabinian Law) was an emergency measure in 67 BC which granted Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") proconsular powers in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean Sea without holding a properly elected magistracy, with the purpose of combating piracy. The law was proposed and passed by the tribune Aulus Gabinius and it was also known as lex de uno imperatore contra praedones instituendo or lex de piratis persequendis.
