DP World (Arabic: موانئ دبي العالمية‎) operates multiple related businesses – from marine and inland terminals, maritime services, logistics and ancillary services to technology-driven trade solutions.
DP World has a portfolio of 77 operating marine and inland terminals supported by over 50 related businesses in 40 countries across six continents with a significant presence in both high-growth and mature markets.
Container handling is the company's core business and generates more than three quarters of its revenue. In 2015, DP World handled 61.7 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units).
The company was founded in 2005 by merging Dubai Ports Authority and Dubai Ports International (which had been founded in 1999). It purchased P&O Group of the United Kingdom in 2006 for £3.9 billion ($7 billion), which was at the time the world's fourth largest ports operator. Shares representing 20% of the company were floated on the NASDAQ Dubai stock exchange in 2007. The company does not currently operate in the United States where its purchase of a number of U.S. ports led to high-level controversy.
