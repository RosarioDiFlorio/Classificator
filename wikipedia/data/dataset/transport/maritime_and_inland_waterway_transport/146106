This is a list of waterways, defined as navigable rivers, canals, estuaries or firths. In practice, and depending on the language, the term 'waterway' covers maritime or inland transport routes, as suggested by 'way'. Wherever a free-flowing river cannot bear load-carrying vessels, the correct term is 'watercourse', with no connotation of use for transport. To be of practical use, the list distinguishes international maritime waterways (including ship canals), international inland waterways, then inland waterways including canals.
