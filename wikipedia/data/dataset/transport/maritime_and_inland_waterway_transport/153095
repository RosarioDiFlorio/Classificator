Radio navigation or radionavigation is the application of radio frequencies to determine a position of an object on the Earth. Like radiolocation, it is a type of radiodetermination.
The basic principles are measurements from/to electric beacons, especially
directions, e.g. by bearing, radio phases or interferometry,
distances, e.g. ranging by measurement of travel times,
partly also velocity, e.g. by means of radio Doppler shift.
