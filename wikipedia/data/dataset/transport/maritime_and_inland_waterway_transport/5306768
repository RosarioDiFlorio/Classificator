The Alcyone is a ship operated by the Cousteau Society. It was created as an expedition ship and to test the operation of a new kind of marine propulsion system, the turbosail. The Alcyone's two turbosails are used to augment its diesel engines. Since the accidental sinking of the Calypso, the Alcyone has been the Cousteau Society's expedition vessel.
