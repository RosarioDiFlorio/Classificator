The bridge of a ship is the room or platform from which the ship can be commanded. When a ship is underway the bridge is manned by an OOW (officer of the watch) aided usually by an AB (able seaman) acting as lookout. During critical maneuvers the captain will be on the bridge supported, perhaps, by an OOW as an extra set of hands, an AB on the wheel and sometimes a pilot if required.
Wheelhouses are the small enclosed parts of a bridge that historically held the ship's wheel. Today, ship's bridges do not have a separate wheelhouse; the term wheelhouse or pilothouse is used nowadays to refer to the smaller bridges of small vessels, such as tugs.
