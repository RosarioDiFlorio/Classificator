Vassilis P. "Basil" Goulandris (1913 â€“ 27 April 1994) was a Greek shipowner, and the founder of Greece's first Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art Andros. He and his wife died childless and left an art collection worth $3 billion, which has been the subject of long-running litigation since she died in 2000.
