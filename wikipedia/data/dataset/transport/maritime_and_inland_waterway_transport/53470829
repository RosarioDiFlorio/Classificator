The law of carriage of goods by sea is a body of law that governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and consignees of marine cargo. It is an aspect of international commercial law and of maritime law.
Although there is no single "international law of carriage of goods by sea", most sea-trading nations tend to adopt an international convention on such law, with a view to establishing a universal standard. The three main conventions are the Hague Rules of 1924, the Hague-Visby Rules of 1968 and the Hamburg Rules of 1978. A further Convention, which seeks to modernise and replace all three previous conventions, is the Rotterdam Rules, which is much more extensive than its earlier counterparts. The Rotterdam Rules address issues such as multi-modal carriage, containerisation and volume contracts; but today, only Spain has ratified these rules, so they are not yet in force.
In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties. Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop the English common law principles by providing a basic set of standards to be met by the carrier; but in practice the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability (such as "Act of God", "Perils of the Sea" and "negligence in navigation or management of the ship").
China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules, and the USA (which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on its homespun legislation) has a law which is a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules.
