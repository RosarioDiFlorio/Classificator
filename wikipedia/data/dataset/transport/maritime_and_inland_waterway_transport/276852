Windward (pronounced ) is the direction upwind (toward where the wind is coming from) from the point of reference. Leeward (pronounced  or /ˈluːɜ(ɹ)d/) is the direction downwind (or downward) from the point of reference.The leeward region of mountains generally remains dry as compared to the windward. The side of a ship that is towards the leeward is its lee side. If the vessel is heeling under the pressure of the wind, this will be the "lower side". During the age of sail, the term weather was used as a synonym for windward in some contexts, as in the weather gage.
