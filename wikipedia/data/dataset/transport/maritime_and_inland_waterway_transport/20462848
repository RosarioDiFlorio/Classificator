Auburn Tunnel was a 19th-century canal tunnel built for the Schuylkill Canal, near Auburn, Pennsylvania. Auburn Tunnel was the first transportation tunnel built in the United States.
The tunnel was deliberately added to the canal to be a novelty, as the hill it was bored though could have easily been bypassed. The tunnel succeeded in becoming a major attraction, with people traveling over 97 miles (156 km) upriver from Philadelphia just to see it. The tunnel was periodically shortened and in 1857 was daylighted to become just an open-cut.
