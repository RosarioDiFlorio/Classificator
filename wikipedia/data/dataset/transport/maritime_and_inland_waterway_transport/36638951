MY Vava II is the 97-metre superyacht commissioned by Swiss entrepreneur Ernesto Bertarelli. Built by Devonport Yachts at Plymouth, England, the hull was built by sister shipyard Appledore Shipbuilders then taken to Devonport for the accommodation section to be lifted to ship and then launched in 2009. When constructed she was claimed to be the largest British-built superyacht. She was the last yacht built by Devonport Yachts following its acquisition by Pendennis Shipyard.
The yacht's designers were Hampshire-based firm Redman Whitely Dixon (exterior) and the French interior designer Remi Tessier.
Vava II is powered by four MTU engines, two of 12cyl of 2610 bhp each, and two of 16cyl of 3351 bhp each. They are geared to twin screws and produce a service speed of 18.5 knots.
The Bertarellis' previous yacht was Vava, a 47-metre motor yacht built by Royal Van Lent/Feadship, Netherlands in 1996.
