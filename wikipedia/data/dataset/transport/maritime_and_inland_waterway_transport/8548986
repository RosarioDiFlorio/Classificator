The Church of Sweden Abroad, (Swedish: Svenska kyrkan i utlandet), is an institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden. The Church of Sweden Abroad (SKUT) has more than 40 parishes throughout the world, concentrated in Western Europe. Another 80 cities are served by visiting clergy.
In administration and practice SKUT forms a single body, originally under the direction of a committee of the General Synod, but since 1 January 2012 organised by a newly formed Council, giving SKUT many of the features of a diocese, though without that legal status, and without a bishop of its own. Instead, it is placed under the episcopal oversight of the Bishop of Visby. Under the new 2012 organisation SKUT has gained constituent seats on the General Synod of the Church of Sweden, like the 13 mainland dioceses.
