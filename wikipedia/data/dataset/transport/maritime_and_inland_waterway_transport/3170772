The Woolwich Steam Packet Company (later London Steamboat Company), operated between 1834 and 1888 and offered steamer services from central London to Woolwich and later to Kent, Essex and Suffolk. One of its ships, the Princess Alice sank after a collision near Woolwich with the loss of almost 700 lives in the greatest disaster in the history of British coastal cruising.
