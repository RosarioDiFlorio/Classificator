Velocity made good, or "VMG", in sailing and specifically yacht racing, is the speed of a sailboat in the direction of its destination. This is less than the speed over ground(SOG) unless the boat is sailing directly towards it's destination. The concept is useful because a sailboat often cannot, or should not, sail directly to a mark to reach it as quickly as possible. Sailboats cannot sail directly upwind. It is usually less than optimal and can be dangerous to sail directly downwind. Instead of sailing toward the mark, the helmsman chooses a point of sail that optimizes Velocity Made Good (either towards the destination - or towards better winds).
