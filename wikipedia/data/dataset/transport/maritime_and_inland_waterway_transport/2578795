A full-line vending business sets up several types of vending machines that sell a wide range of products, such as soft drinks and snacks. Soda is usually sold in 12 fl. oz. (355 ml) and 20 oz. (591 ml) in the United States and some times Australia, or 330ml and 500ml in Europe, Canada, and other areas. Snacks, bags of chips and similar edibles are usually about 1-3 oz.
