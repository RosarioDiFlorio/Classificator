A shiploader is a large machine used for loading bulk solid materials like iron ore, coal, fertilizers, grains and/or material in bags into ships. Shiploaders are commonly used in ports and jetties from where bulk materials are exported.
It mainly consist of an extendable arm or boom, a belt conveyor, a tripper to elevate and transfer product from a source conveyor or feeder, and a mobile structure to support the boom. It is usually mounted on rails and sometimes on tyres and can move in order to be able to reach the whole length of the ship. The boom also can move front and back, up and down by separate drives so that it can fill the whole breadth of the hold and adapt to the ships increasing draught while it is loaded. At the discharge, a special telescoping chute, with rotating, pivoting spoon, facilitates even and complete filling of the holds.
Shiploaders are built in capacities from 1,000 to 15,000 TPH (tonnes per hour). The height of a shiploader can be in excess of 20 meters and the boom can extend to a length of more than 60 meters.
