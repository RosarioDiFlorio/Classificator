All Cargo vessels where MARPOL Convention is applicable must have an Oil record book where the chief engineer will record all oil or sludge transfers and discharges within the vessel. This is necessary in order for authorities to be able to monitor if a vessel's crew has properly disposed of their oil discharges at sea.
Each oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above, ship of 400 gross tons and above other than an oil tanker, and manned fixed or floating drilling rig or other platform shall maintain an Oil Record Book Part I (Machinery Space Operations). An oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above or a non oil tanker that carries 200 meters or more of oil in bulk, shall also maintain an Oil Record Book II (Cargo/Ballast Operation).
