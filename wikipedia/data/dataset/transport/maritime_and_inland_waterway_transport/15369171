AIDA Cruises is an American/British owned German cruise line based in Rostock, Germany. The company was founded as Deutsche Seereederei with a ship called VÃ¶lkerfreundschaft ("Friendship Between Peoples"), and entered the cruise industry in the 1960s.
The company was acquired by P&O Princess Cruises in 2000. In 2003, P&O Princess merged with Carnival Corporation, to form Carnival Corporation & plc, the worlds largest cruise holiday company. Following the merger, executive control of AIDA Cruises transferred to Costa Cruises Group, one of the main operating companies of the Carnival Group, with responsibility for the group's European brands.
AIDA Cruises is now one of ten brands owned by Carnival Corp, based at Miami, Florida, accounting for 6.5% of its share of revenue and has its own executive team, led by company President Felix Eichhorn. AIDA ships cater to the German-speaking market. As seagoing "club resorts", AIDA ships have on-board amenities and facilities designed to attract younger, more active vacationers.
