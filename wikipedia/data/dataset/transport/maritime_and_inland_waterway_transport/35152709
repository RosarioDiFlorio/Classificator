Commercial Vehicle Inspection (CVI), is the enforcement of safety regulations of commercial vehicles. Some U.S. state departments of transportation refer to it as CVE (Commercial Vehicle Enforcement). CVI enforcement can be done roadside by state troopers or at specific stations, sometimes called "weigh stations."
Some of the violations that are examined include:
inadequate tires
brake linings that are oil soaked
cracked brake linings
brake linings with inadequate (worn) thickness
cracked frames
fuel leaks
disqualified drivers
