A Yachtmaster qualification is a certificate of competence of the ability to handle either a sailing boat or motor boat (as endorsed) in certain prescribed conditions. Three different titles are specified; Yachtmaster Coastal (previously - and in some countries still - called Coastal Skipper), Yachtmaster Offshore, and Yachtmaster Ocean which specify the level of competence required and the area of operation certified.
Certification may be sought for commercial recognition or as a confirmation of attainment of skills.
The original training scheme and certification was established and is maintained by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) in the UK and training to this scheme is carried out in many countries. Other countries such as Australia, have modified the scheme in partnership with the RYA so that it can be locally administered and operated by Yachting Australia.
