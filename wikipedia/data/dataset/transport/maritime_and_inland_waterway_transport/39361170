A parcel is a package bearing the name and address of the recipient in order to be routed through the services of a postal service or by express package delivery service to the recipient.
The size can range from a standard mail package to a box large enough to protect what is sent, up to a size that can be transported in a wheelbarrow. Nowadays parcels often bear a barcode so they can be tracked all the stages until the reception by the final recipient.
