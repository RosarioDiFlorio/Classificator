A boat livery is a boathouse or dock on a lake or other body of water, where boats are let out for hire (rental), usually on an hourly, daily or weekly basis. Boats may be powered or sail craft or human powered like rowboats, paddleboats (pedalos) or inflatable boats. The primary use of the boats is recreational.
