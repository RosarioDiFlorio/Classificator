The trickle-up effect or fountain effect is an economic theory used to describe the overall ability of middle class people to drive and support the economy. The theory was founded by John Maynard Keynes (1883â€“1946). It is sometimes referred as Keynesian economics in which economic growth is enhanced when the government lowers taxes on the middle class and increases government spending.
