Quality bias in price indices occurs when an index ignores changes in the quality of the goods it measures. An example would be enhanced performance of personal computers. Generally speaking, greater and greater speeds and features have become available, without substantial increases in price. Quality bias can cause a consumer price index (CPI) to be overestimated, since a CPI may not completely reflect quality improvements.
