Inflationary bias is the outcome of discretionary government policy that, under perfect foresight in the labor market, leads to a higher than optimal level of inflation and no transitory income increase. The term may also refer to the practice of a public debt-ridden nation enacting policies which encourage inflation in the medium/long term.
