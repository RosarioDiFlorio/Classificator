The 2015â€“16 stock market selloff, instigated by global financial events, began in the United States on August 18, 2015, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33 points and gathered downward momentum over several days, which became a steep selloff on August 21, 2015, falling 531 points (3.12%) on that day.
Wall Street suffered a major starting loss on Monday, August 24, as the Dow opened 1,000 points down. However, the index gained back some of what it had lost to close down 588 points for the day. The Dow opened higher on Tuesday, August 25 but plunged again in the last hour of trading, leaving the Dow another 204 points off from the level at the start of the opening bell. U.S. markets recovered 4% the next day.
Volatility continued into 2016 due to more fears about China's economy and the result of the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum to determine if it would be leaving the European Union.
