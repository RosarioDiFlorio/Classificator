In political science and international relations theory, a rentier state is a state which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients. This theory was first postulated by Hossein Mahdavy in 1970. It was also in this article that the concept of external rent was first introduced.
Mahdavy's usage of the term is in stark contrast to how the term was originally used by Marxists. Lenin wrote in 1916: For that reason the term “rentier state” (Rentnerstaat), or usurer state, is coming into common use in the economic literature that deals with imperialism. The world has become divided into a handful of usurer states and a vast majority of debtor states. (...) According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, a rentier state enriches itself by exporting capital to other states, primarily those that are economically underdeveloped and dependent.  This is better known in English as Rentier capitalism.
