Brazil is experiencing an economic crisis, which started in early 2015 and continues into 2017. The economic crisis is coupled with a political crisis in Brazil that resulted in the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff and in widespread dissatisfaction with the political system.
In 2015, Brazil's GDP fell by 3.9% due to a drop in salary levels, restrictions on credit and a rise in the basic interest rate. In 2016, Brazil's GDP fell by 3.6% with reductions across all sectors of the economy. It was the first time since 1931 that the GDP fell in two consecutive years.
