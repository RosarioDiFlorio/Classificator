The Year-on-Year Inflation-Indexed Swap (YYIIS) ia a standard derivative product over Inflation rate. The underlying asset is a single Consumer price index (CPI).
It is called Swap because each year there is a swap of a fixed amount against a floating amount. But in reality only a one way payment is made (fixed amount - floating amount).
