Inktomi Corporation was a California-based company that provided software for Internet service providers. Inktomi's software was incorporated into the widely-used HotBot search engine, which displaced AltaVista as the leading web-crawler-based search engine, itself to be displaced later by Google.
The company developed Traffic Server, a proxy server web cache for world wide web traffic and on-demand streaming media. Traffic Server was deployed by several large service providers including AOL. It transcoded images down to a smaller size for users of AOL dial-up Internet access, leading many websites to provide special non-cacheable pages with the phrase "AOL Users Click Here" to navigate to these pages.
After the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Inktomi was acquired by Yahoo! in early 2003 for $241 million.
The company's name, pronounced 'INK-tuh-me', was derived from a legend of the Lakota people about a trickster spider character, Iktomi which was known for his ability to defeat larger adversaries through wit and cunning. The tri-color nested cube logo was created by Tom Lamar in 1996.
