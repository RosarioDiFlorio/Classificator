Excite (stylized as excite) is a collection of web sites and services, launched in December 1995. Excite is an online service offering a variety of content, including an Internet portal showing news and weather etc. (outside United States only), a metasearch engine, a web-based email, instant messaging, stock quotes, and a customizable user homepage. The content is collated from over 100 different sources.
Excite's portal and services are owned by Excite Networks, but in the United States, Excite is a personal portal, called My Excite, which is operated by Mindspark and owned by IAC Search and Media.
In the 1990s, Excite was one of the most recognized brands on the Internet, before its decline in the early 2000s.
Excite search formerly fetched results from several other popular search engines, but now, just like Yahoo!, it just a search engine powered by Bing (although the site never mention anything about that).
