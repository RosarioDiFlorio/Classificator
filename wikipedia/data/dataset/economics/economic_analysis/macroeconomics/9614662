The London Economic Conference was a meeting of representatives of 66 nations from June 12 to July 27, 1933, at the Geological Museum in London. Its purpose was to win agreement on measures to fight global depression, revive international trade, and stabilize currency exchange rates.
The Conference was "torpedoed" by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt in early July, when Roosevelt denounced currency stabilization.
