Freeloading (or being a "freeloader") in everyday speech refers to the use by an individual or entity of resources that do not belong to them in private and personal spheres, e.g. an uninvited guest's abuse of friends' and family's hospitality. A freeloader may also be called a "mooch" or a schnorrer. When unpaid overuse of public resources occurs in the public sphere, it raises a free rider problem.
