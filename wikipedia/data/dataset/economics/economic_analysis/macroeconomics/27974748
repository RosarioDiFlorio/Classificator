In economics, hysteresis (derived from the Greek verb ύστερέω, meaning "that which comes later") refers to effects that persist after the initial causes giving rise to the effects are removed. Two of the main areas in economics where hysteresis effects are invoked to explain economic phenomena are unemployment and international trade.
For instance, in labor economics hysteresis refers to the possibility that periods of high unemployment tend to increase the rate-of-unemployment-below-which-inflation-begins-to-accelerate, commonly referred to as the natural rate of unemployment or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).
