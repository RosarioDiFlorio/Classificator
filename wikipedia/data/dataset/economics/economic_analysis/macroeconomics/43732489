The purple economy is that part of the economy which contributes to sustainable development by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.
"The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services." These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory's cultural vitality.
