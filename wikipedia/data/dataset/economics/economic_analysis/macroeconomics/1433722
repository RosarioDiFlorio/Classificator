Gross National Happiness (also known by the acronym: GNH) is a developing philosophy as well as an "index" which is used to measure the collective happiness in any specific nation.
The concept was first mentioned in the Constitution of Bhutan, which was enacted on 18 July 2008.
However, the term itself, 'Gross National Happiness', was previously coined in 1979 during an interview at Bombay airport when the then king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, said "We do not believe in Gross National Product. Gross National Happiness is more important."
