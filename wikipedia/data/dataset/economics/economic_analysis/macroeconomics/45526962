The Balances Mechanics (German: Saldenmechanik) (from balances of bookkeeping respectively the credit system and mechanics to characterize the strict universal identities) is a work and mean of economics, comparable with Stock-Flow Consistent Modelling. Statements of Balances Mechanics are not based on assumptions and preconditions of a model but are of trivial arithmetric nature, usually shaped as equation and universal without restrictions. Balances Mechanics were developed by Wolfgang St√ºtzel and published in his books Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft (Paradoxes of Competition-Based Monetary Economies) and Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik (Balances Mechanics of Economics).
