Li Keqiang index or Keqiang index (Chinese: 克强指数), created by The Economist to measure China's economy using three indicators, as reportedly preferred by Li Keqiang, currently the Premier of the People's Republic of China, as better economic indicator than official numbers of GDP.
According to a State Department memo (released by WikiLeaks), Li Keqiang (then the Party Committee Secretary of Liaoning) told a US ambassador in 2007 that the GDP figures in Liaoning were unreliable and that he himself used three other indicators: the railway cargo volume, electricity consumption and loans disbursed by banks.
The ‘Keqiang index’ is also used by Haitong Securities released in 2013, suggesting decelerating China’s economic growth since the beginning of 2013.
