Self-fulfilling crisis refers to a situation that a financial crisis is not directly caused by the unhealthy economic fundamental conditions or improper government policies, but a consequence of pessimistic expectations of investors. In other words, investorsâ€™ fear of the crisis makes the crisis inevitable, which justified their initial expectations.
