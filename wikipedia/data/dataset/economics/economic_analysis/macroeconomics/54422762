The Great Trade Collapse is a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis and happened between the third quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009. While the world GDP has dropped by 1%, the world trade has dropped by 10%. This global trade collapse is very uncommon as the drop was synchronized over almost all the countries in the world. The main reasons given by the researchers are a sudden drop in demand, in supply, credit constraint and global chain values.
