Go.com (also known as The Go Network) is a landing page for Disney content, created as a joint venture between Infoseek and Disney Interactive. It is currently operated by Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media, a Division of The Walt Disney Company. It began as a web portal launched by Jeff Gold. Go.com includes content from ABC News which is associated with Disney and is hosted under a .go.com name. Along with Time Warner's Pathfinder.com, Go.com proved to be an expensive failure for its parent company, as web users preferred to use search engines to access content directly, rather than start at a top-level corporate portal. In 2013, the site was transitioned from a portal to a simple landing page.
