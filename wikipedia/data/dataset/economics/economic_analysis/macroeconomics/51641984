The 2016 Southeastern United States gasoline shortage is an phenomenon caused by the 2016 Colonial Pipeline Leak and the resulting panic buying in which many gas stations across six states have entirely run out of petrol, or gasoline fuel, causing price hikes, halts of services, and several declarations of states of emergency.
On Monday, September 12, 2016, a leak occurred in Shelby County, Alabama, spilling an estimated 350,000 US gallons of summer-grade gasoline, requiring a partial shutdown of the pipeline, and causing petrol gas shortages in much of the Southeastern United States. Six states are affected (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia), with Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia declaring states of emergency. These declarations have eliminated certain size and weight restrictions on vehicles carrying gasoline, and the hours which they are allowed to deliver.
Many gas stations in the affected regions have entirely run out of gas. Panic buying greatly contributed to this.
