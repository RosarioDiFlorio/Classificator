Energy Supply Crisis in Nigeria
Electricity is pivotal to the development of nations. Its use is directly correlated with healthy economic growth (Kaseke & Hosking, 2013). Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa but only about 40% of the people are connected to the energy grid. The people who actually have power experience difficulties around 60% of the time (Aliy, Ramli & Saleh, 2013). The pink lines on the map show the routes the power grid takes and explains why much of Nigeria does not have access to electricity (Global Energy Network Institute, 2014).
Aliyu, Ramli and Saleh, (2013) claim that these blackouts cripple the industrial sector. For example, outages in this area of the world also have implications for the mining industry. When power fails, workers may be trapped in the mines, so as soon as there is a risk of failure the operations are shut down, which leads to economic difficulties (Kaseke & Hosking, 2013). Lack of electricity also causes problems for agriculture. Most irrigation lines are run by electricity, so when the power is cut out then the crop yield decreases, (Kaseke & Hosking, 2013). Nigeria’s energy grid is arguably in crisis due to lack of development. The key to making a more reliable energy sector is to find and use a renewable energy resources, rather than simply relying on the country’s non-renewable resources. The crisis of energy is a complex problem stemming from a variety of issues. This paper will cover role of the government in the electricity problem, the environmental impacts of the current system, the effect on the people who live in Nigeria and the potential solutions to the crisis.
