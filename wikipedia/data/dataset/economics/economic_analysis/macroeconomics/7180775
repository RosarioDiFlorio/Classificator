Macroeconomic policy instruments refer to macroeconomic quantities that can be directly controlled by an economic policy maker. Instruments can be divided into two subsets: a) Monetary policy instruments and b) Fiscal policy instruments. Monetary policy is conducted by the Federal Reserve or the central bank of a country or supranational region (Euro zone). Fiscal policy is conducted by the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Government and deals with managing a nationâ€™s Budget.
