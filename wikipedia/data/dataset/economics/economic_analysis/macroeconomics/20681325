Constant purchasing power accounting (CPPA) is an accounting model approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as an alternative to traditional historical cost accounting under hyper-inflationary environments. Under this system, financial capital maintenance is measured in units of constant purchasing power (CPP) in terms of a CPI (consumer price index) during low inflation. During high inflation and hyperinflation it can also be measured in a monetized daily indexed unit of account (e.g. the Unidad de Fomento in Chile) and in terms of a daily relatively stable foreign currency parallel rate or daily index.
