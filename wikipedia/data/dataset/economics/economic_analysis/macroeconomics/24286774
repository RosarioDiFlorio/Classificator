The steel crisis was a recession in the global steel market during the 1973–75 recession, following the post–World War II economic expansion and the 1973 oil crisis.
Steel prices dropped significantly as the market became saturated with steel from previous demand, and many steel mills in the Western world were driven out of business. Some areas affected by the steel crisis were the Rust belt in North America, the English Midlands in the United Kingdom, the Ruhr area in West Germany and Bergslagen in Sweden.
