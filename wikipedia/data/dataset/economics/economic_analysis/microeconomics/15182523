The Stone–Geary utility function takes the form

  
    
      
        U
        =
        
          ∏
          
            i
          
        
        (
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          γ
          
            i
          
        
        
          )
          
            
              β
              
                i
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U=\prod _{i}(q_{i}-\gamma _{i})^{\beta _{i}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   is utility, 
  
    
      
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q_{i}}
   is consumption of good 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  , and 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   and 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   are parameters.
For 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            i
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma _{i}=0}
  , the Stone–Geary function reduces to the generalised Cobb–Douglas function.
The Stone–Geary utility function gives rise to the Linear Expenditure System, in which the demand function equals

  
    
      
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          γ
          
            i
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              β
              
                i
              
            
            
              p
              
                i
              
            
          
        
        (
        y
        −
        
          ∑
          
            j
          
        
        
          γ

          p
          
            j
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle q_{i}=\gamma _{i}+{\frac {\beta _{i}}{p_{i}}}(y-\sum _{j}\gamma _{j}p_{j})}
  
where 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   is total expenditure, and 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}}
   is the price of good 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  .
The Stone–Geary utility function was first derived by Roy C. Geary, in a comment on earlier work by Lawrence Klein and Herman Rubin. Richard Stone was the first to estimate the Linear Expenditure System.
