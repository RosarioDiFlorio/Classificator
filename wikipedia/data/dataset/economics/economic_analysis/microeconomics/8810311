The ludic fallacy, identified by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book The Black Swan, is "the misuse of games to model real-life situations." Taleb explains the fallacy as "basing studies of chance on the narrow world of games and dice." The adjective ludic originates from the Latin noun ludus, meaning "play, game, sport, pastime."
