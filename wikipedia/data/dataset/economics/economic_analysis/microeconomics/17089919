Linear Production Game (LP Game) is a N-person game in which the value of a coalition can be obtained by solving a Linear Programming problem. It is widely used in the context of resource allocation and payoff distribution. Mathematically, there are m types of resources and n products can be produced out of them. Product j requires 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            k
          
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{k}^{j}}
   amount of the kth resource. The products can be sold at a given market price 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              c
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {c}}}
   while the resources themselves can not. Each of the N players is given a vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                b
                
                  i
                
              
              →
            
          
        
        =
        (
        
          b
          
            1

            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {b^{i}}}=(b_{1}^{i},...,b_{m}^{i})}
   of resources. The value of a coalition S is the maximum profit it can achieve with all the resources possessed by its members. It can be obtained by solving a corresponding Linear Programming problem 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(S)}
   as follows.
