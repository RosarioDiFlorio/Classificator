Accentuation effect occurs when something (be it a person, place or thing) is placed into a category, and aspects of it which match the stereotypes of that category are emphasized and perceived to be greater than they are, i.e. the similarities of an individual to the group are accentuated. Memory of anything that can be categorized is subject to an accentuation effect in which the memory is distorted toward typical examples.
In the case of people, the accentuation effect is similar to stereotyping and social categorization in that when classified as part of a group, people's features seem to more closely match their classification rather than any individual differences they have.
