The opposite-colored bishops endgame is a chess endgame in which each side has a single bishop, but the bishops reside on opposite-colored squares on the chessboard, thus cannot attack or block each other. Without other pieces (but with pawns) these endings are notorious for their tendency to result in a draw. These are the most difficult endings in which to convert a small material advantage to a win. With additional pieces, the stronger side has more chances to win, but not as many as if the bishops were on the same color.
Many players in a poor position have saved themselves from a loss by trading down to such an endgame. They are often drawn even when one side has an advantage of two or even three pawns, since the weaker side can create a blockade on the squares on which his bishop operates.
