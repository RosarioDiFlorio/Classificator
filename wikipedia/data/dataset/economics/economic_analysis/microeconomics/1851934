The Philidor position (or Philidor's position) usually refers to an important chess endgame which illustrates a drawing technique when the defender has a king and rook versus a king, rook, and a pawn. It is also known as the third rank defense, because of the importance of the rook on the third rank cutting off the opposing king. It was analyzed by François-André Danican Philidor in 1777. (Also see rook and pawn versus rook endgame.) Many rook and pawn versus rook endgames reach either the Philidor position or the Lucena position. If played accurately the defending side tries to reach the Philidor position; the other side tries to reach the winning Lucena position. Jesús de la Villa said "[The Philidor position] is perhaps the most important position in endgame theory" (de la Villa 2008:125).
Philidor analyzed many positions, some of which have his name associated with them (see the subsequent sections).
