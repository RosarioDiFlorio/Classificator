Causal decision theory is a mathematical theory intended to determine the set of rational choices in a given situation. In informal terms, it maintains that the rational choice is that with the best expected causal consequences. This theory is often contrasted with evidential decision theory, which recommends those actions that provide the best expected outcome conditional on oneâ€™s best evidence about the world.
