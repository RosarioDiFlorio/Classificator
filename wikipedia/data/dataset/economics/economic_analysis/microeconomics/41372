In combinatorial game theory, the Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a nimber. The Grundy value or nim-value of an impartial game is then defined as the unique nimber that the game is equivalent to. In the case of a game whose positions (or summands of positions) are indexed by the natural numbers (for example the possible heap sizes in nim-like games), the sequence of nimbers for successive heap sizes is called the nim-sequence of the game.
The theorem and its proof encapsulate the main results of a theory discovered independently by R. P. Sprague (1935) and P. M. Grundy (1939).[1]
