The group attribution error refers to people's tendency to believe either (1) that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole, or (2) that a group's decision outcome must reflect the preferences of individual group members, even when external information is available suggesting otherwise.
The group attribution error shares an attribution bias analogous to the fundamental attribution error. Rather than focusing individual's behavior, it relies on group outcomes and and attitudes as its main for conclusions.
