In probability theory Wald's martingale, named after Abraham Wald and more commonly known as the geometric Brownian motion, is a stochastic process of the form

  
    
      
        
          {
          exp
          ⁡
          
            (
            λ
            
              W
              
                t
              
            
            −
            
              
                1
                2
              
            
            
              λ

            t
            )
          
          ,
          t
          ≥
          0
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{\exp \left(\lambda W_{t}-{\frac {1}{2}}\lambda ^{2}t\right),t\geq 0\right\}}
  

for any real value λ where Wt is a Wiener process. The process is a martingale.
