In shogi, brinkmate or hisshi (必至 "desperation, inevitability" or 必死 "sure kill") is the situation in which an unavoidable 詰め tsume checkmate sequence will be created by the player's next move.
Hisshi differs from the situation in which a checkmate sequence is only being threatened to be created in the next move but is still avoidable if the opponent defends correctly. This situation is known as threatmate or 詰めろ tsumero ("threatened mate"). Thus, hisshi is an indefensible tsumero.
The only way to prevent a loss from a brinkmate is for a player to not give their opponent a chance to actually create the tsume checkmate sequence and instead initiate their own tsume (with constant checks) before their opponent's move. (Thus, a good exemplification of the saying the best defense is a good offense.)
Although the terms brinkmate and threatmate were coined to translate the Japanese terms, the concepts can equally be applied to western chess and other chess-like games. (See: §Western chess below.)
