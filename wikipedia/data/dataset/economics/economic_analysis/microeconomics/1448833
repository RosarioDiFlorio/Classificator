In economics, a cardinal utility function or scale is a utility index that preserves preference orderings uniquely up to positive affine transformations. Two utility indices are related by an affine transformation if for the value 
  
    
      
        u
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u(x_{i})}
   of one index u, occurring at any quantity 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   of the goods bundle being evaluated, the corresponding value 
  
    
      
        v
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle v(x_{i})}
   of the other index v satisfies a relationship of the form

  
    
      
        v
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
        =
        a
        u
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
        +
        b
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v(x_{i})=au(x_{i})+b\!}
  ,
for fixed constants a and b. Thus the utility functions themselves are related by

  
    
      
        v
        (
        x
        )
        =
        a
        u
        (
        x
        )
        +
        b
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle v(x)=au(x)+b.}
  
The two indices differ only with respect to scale and origin. Thus if one is concave, so is the other, in which case there is often said to be diminishing marginal utility.
Thus the use of cardinal utility imposes the assumption that levels of absolute satisfaction exist, so that the magnitudes of increments to satisfaction can be compared across different situations.
The idea of cardinal utility is considered outdated except for specific contexts such as decision making under risk, utilitarian welfare evaluations, and discounted utilities for intertemporal evaluations where it is still applied. Elsewhere, such as in general consumer theory, ordinal utility with its weaker assumptions is preferred because results that are just as strong can be derived.
