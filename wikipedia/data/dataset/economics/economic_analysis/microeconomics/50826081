The competitive facility location game is a kind of competitive game in which service-providers select locations to place their facilities in order to maximize their profits. The game has the following components:
There are several consumers who need a certain service, e.g, electricity connection.
There are several producers that can supply this service, e.g, electricity companies.
Each producer can build its facility (e.g, a power station) in one of several locations.
For every pair of consumer (C) and location (L), there is a fixed cost of serving C from L (e.g, depending on the distance between the power station and the consumer's house). This cost is denoted Cost[C,L].
The game is a sequential game with three steps:
Each producer selects a location for placing its facility.
Each producer set a price for each user (price discrimination is allowed, since there is a different cost for serving different consumers).
Each consumer selects a facility to connect to.
Each consumer has a certain private value for accepting the service.
For each consumer-producer pair:
The gain of the consumer for connecting to the producer's facility is his value minus the price;
The gain of the producer is the price minus the cost of serving the consumer;
The social welfare of this pair is the sum of the gains, i.e, the consumer's value minus the service cost.
