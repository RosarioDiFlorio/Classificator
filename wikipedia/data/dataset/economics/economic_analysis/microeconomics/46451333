Negging is an act of emotional manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate backhanded compliment or otherwise flirtatious remark to another person to undermine their confidence and increase their need of the manipulator's approval. Although some believe that it builds attraction, it results in poor quality relationships. Over time, the less confident person becomes resentful. Negging is often misunderstood as straightforward insult rather than as a pick-up line. The term was coined and prescribed by the pickup artist community. The term has been popularized in social media and mainstream media. The opposite is pozzing, whereby one pays a person a compliment in order to gain their affection.
