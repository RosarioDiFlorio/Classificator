Many basic tactics (手筋 tesuji, also translated as 'clever move') of shogi are similar to those of chess tactics, involving forks, pins, removing the defender and other techniques, all of which are considered very strong when used effectively.
However, other tactics, particularly ones involving dropped pieces, have no parallel in western chess.
In general, shogi tactics are classified into two categories: (i) piece-related tesujis and (ii) opening/position-related tesujis.
