In microeconomics, the expenditure function gives the minimum amount of money an individual needs to spend to achieve some level of utility, given a utility function and the prices of the available goods.
Formally, if there is a utility function 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   that describes preferences over n commodities, the expenditure function

  
    
      
        e
        (
        p
        ,
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
        )
        :
        
          
            
              R
            
          
          
            +
          
          
            n
          
        
        ×
        
          
            R
          
        
        →
        
          
            R
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e(p,u^{*}):{\textbf {R}}_{+}^{n}\times {\textbf {R}}\rightarrow {\textbf {R}}}
  
says what amount of money is needed to achieve a utility 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u^{*}}
   if the n prices are given by the price vector 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
  . This function is defined by

  
    
      
        e
        (
        p
        ,
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
        )
        =
        
          min
          
            x
            ∈≥
            (
            
              u
              
                ∗
              
            
            )
          
        
        p
        ⋅
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle e(p,u^{*})=\min _{x\in \geq (u^{*})}p\cdot x}
  
where

  
    
      
        ≥
        (
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
        )
        =
        {
        x
        ∈
        
          
            
              R
            
          
          
            +

        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \geq (u^{*})=\{x\in {\textbf {R}}_{+}^{n}:u(x)\geq u^{*}\}}
  
is the set of all bundles that give utility at least as good as 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u^{*}}
  .
Expressed equivalently, the individual minimizes expenditure

        +
        ⋯
        +
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        
          p
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{1}p_{1}+\dots +x_{n}p_{n}}
   subject to the minimal utility constraint that 
  
    
      
        u
        (
        
          x
          
            1

        ≥
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})\geq u^{*},}
   giving optimal quantities to consume of the various goods as

    {\displaystyle x_{1}^{*},\dots x_{n}^{*}}
   as functions of 
  
    
      
        
          u
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u^{*}}
   and the prices; then the expenditure function is

  
    
      
        e
        (

        =

    {\displaystyle e(p_{1},\dots ,p_{n};u^{*})=p_{1}x_{1}^{*}+\dots +p_{n}x_{n}^{*}.}
