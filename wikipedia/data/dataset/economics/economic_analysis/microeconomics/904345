The International Computer Games Association (ICGA) was founded as the International Computer Chess Association (ICCA) in 1977 by computer chess programmers to organise championship events for computer programs and to facilitate the sharing of technical knowledge via the ICCA Journal.
Renamed the 'ICGA' in 2002, the association now more broadly fosters the computer games and game artificial intelligence community by organizing the Computer Olympiad, the World Computer Chess Championship, and the International Conference on Computers and Games. The ICGA also publishes a quarterly journal, the ICGA Journal, and maintains relationships with Computer Science, Commercial, and Game organisations throughout the world. The ICGA is led by David Levy.
