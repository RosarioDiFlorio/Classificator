Knuckle Bash (ナックルバッシュ) is a 1993 side-scrolling beat 'em up arcade game developed and published by Toaplan in Japan, later released in North America and Europe by Atari.
It was designed by Junya Inoue, who among other things would join the Toaplan successor Gazelle and designed another arcade beat 'em up, that one based on the Sailor Moon property.
