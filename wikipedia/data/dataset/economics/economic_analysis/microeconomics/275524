Preference-rank translation is a mathematical technique used by marketers to convert stated preferences into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour. It takes survey data on consumersâ€™ preferences and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.
A survey might ask a question using a ranking scale such as :
A marketing researcher will re-specify the numerical values during codification. 1 will become 5, 2 will become 4, 4 will become 2, 5 will become 1, and 3 will remain the same. In this way greater values will correspond with greater preference.
Next, the researcher uses a data reduction technique like factor analysis to obtain aggregate scores. To convert these aggregate rankings into purchase probabilities, each category (in this case, each product) will be weighted with a translation coefficient. These weights are predefined.
A typical weighting scheme is:
The weighting schemes vary depending on the variables being measured.
The following chart illustrates the procedure:
Other purchase intention/rating translations include logit analysis and the intent scale translation.
