The evolution of cooperation can refer to:
the study of how cooperation can emerge and persist (also known as cooperation theory) as elucidated by application of game theory,
a 1981 paper by political scientist Robert Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton (Axelrod & Hamilton 1981) in the scientific literature, or
a 1984 book by Axelrod (Axelrod 1984) that expanded on the paper and popularized the study.
This article is an introduction to how game theory and computer modeling are illuminating certain aspects of moral and political philosophy, particularly the role of individuals in groups, the "biology of selfishness and altruism", and how cooperation can be evolutionarily advantageous.
