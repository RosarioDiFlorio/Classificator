The Barnum effect, also called the Forer effect, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them but that are, in fact, vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, graphology, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.
The Barnum effect occurs when characterizations made about an interlocutor that the individual finds true, even though the statements are generalizations that could apply to anyone. These characterizations are used by practitioners to convince customers that they are endowed with a paranormal gift. The effect is found when assessment statements are vague and people are able to interpret their own meaning into the statements they receive, thus the statement becomes "personal" to them. Also, individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the person presenting the assessment as a high-status professional.
The name "Barnum effect" was coined in 1956 by psychologist Paul Meehl in reference to the American circus entertainer P. T. Barnum, who is said to have stated that "we have something for everybody."
