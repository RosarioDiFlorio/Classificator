In mathematics Kazamaki's condition gives a sufficient criterion ensuring that the Dol√©ans-Dade exponential of a local martingale is a true martingale. This is particularly important if Girsanov's theorem is to be applied to perform a change of measure. Kazamaki's condition is more general than Novikov's condition.
