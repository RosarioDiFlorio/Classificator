In mathematics, Doob's martingale inequality is a result in the study of stochastic processes. It gives a bound on the probability that a stochastic process exceeds any given value over a given interval of time. As the name suggests, the result is usually given in the case that the process is a non-negative martingale, but the result is also valid for non-negative submartingales.
The inequality is due to the American mathematician Joseph L. Doob.
