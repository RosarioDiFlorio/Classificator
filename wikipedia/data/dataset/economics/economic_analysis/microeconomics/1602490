An extensive-form game is a specification of a game in game theory, allowing (as the name suggests) explicit representation of a number of important aspects, like the sequencing of players' possible moves, their choices at every decision point, the (possibly imperfect) information each player has about the other player's moves when he makes a decision, and his payoffs for all possible game outcomes. Extensive-form games also allow representation of incomplete information in the form of chance events encoded as "moves by nature".
