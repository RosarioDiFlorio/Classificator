The halo effect is a form of cognitive bias in which the brain allows specific positive traits to positively influence the overall evaluation of a person.
The Halo Effect can also be explained as the behavior (usually unconscious) of using evaluations based on things unrelated, to make judgments about something or someone. The Halo Effect specifically refers to when this behavior has a positive correlation, such as viewing someone who is attractive is more likely to be seen as successful and more popular. When this judgement has a negative connotation, such as someone unattractive being charged more firmly for a crime than someone attractive, it is referred to as the Horn Effect.
Another example of this is a study done where two people of the same age, sex, attire, and educational background, were put standing next to a mailbox at separate times. The person who looked older and was taller was seen as more likely to have had a better career and higher salary by those tested. There is a tendency to attribute positive traits to people that are attractive.
