In economics, a price mechanism is the manner in which the prices of goods or services affect the supply and demand of goods and services, principally by the price elasticity of demand. A price mechanism affects both buyers and sellers who negotiate prices.

An example of a price mechanism uses announced bid and ask prices. Generally speaking, when two parties wish to engage in trade, the purchaser will announce a price he is willing to pay (the bid price) and seller will announce a price he is willing to accept (the ask price).
The primary advantage of such a method is that conditions are laid out in advance and transactions can proceed with no further permission or authorization from any participant. When any bid and ask pair are compatible, a transaction occurs, in most cases automatically. price mechanism is a mechanism where price plays a key role in directing the activities of consumers, producers and resource suppliers
