BlackStartup was a crowdfunding platform that allows entrepreneurs to market their business or project and solicit backers for funding. BlackStartup is the first crowdfunding site focused on entrepreneurship in the African-American community.
The site was founded in 2013 by a group of Morehouse College graduates who are also members of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
As of August 2017, the site is offline and up for sale.
