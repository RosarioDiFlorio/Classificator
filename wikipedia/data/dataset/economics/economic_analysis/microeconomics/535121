Market penetration refers to the successful selling of a product or service in a specific market, and it is measured by the amount of sales volume of an existing good or service compared to the total target market for that product or service. Market penetration is the key performance metric for a business growth strategy stemming from the Ansoff Matrix (Richardson, M., & Evans, C. (2007). H. Igor Ansoff first devised and published The Ansoff Matrix in the Harvard Business Review in 1957, within an article titled "Strategies for Diversification". The grid/matrix is utilized across businesses to help evaluate and determine the next stages the company must take in order to grow, and the risks associated with the chosen strategy. With numerous options available, this matrix helps narrow down the best fit for an organization.
This strategy involves selling current products or services into the existing market in order to obtain a higher market share. This could involve persuading current customers to buy more and new customers to start buying or even converting customers from their competitors. This could be implemented using methods such as competitive pricing, increase in marketing communications or utilizing reward systems such as loyalty points/discounts. New Strategies involve utilizing pathways and finding new ways to improve profits, increase sales and productivity, in order to stay relevant and competitive in the long run.
