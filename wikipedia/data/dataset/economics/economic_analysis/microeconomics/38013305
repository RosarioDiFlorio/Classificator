Legal plunder, is the act of appropriating, under the laws, the property of others. This was coined by Frédéric Bastiat, most famously in his 1850 book The Law. It has since become a concept in libertarian thought,, and has been used similarly by others, including Daniel Lord Smail.
Today it is the appropriation of the assets of another person by power groups through rules of public law that violate the principle of equality and the Constitution.
Throughout history there are many examples of legal plunder as the political and economic regimes that have followed: partial legal plunder are the result of tyranny and protectionism or universal legal plunder the result of socialism or communism.
