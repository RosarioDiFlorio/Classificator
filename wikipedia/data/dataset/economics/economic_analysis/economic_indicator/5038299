Hysan Development Company Limited (SEHK: 0014) is a property investment, management and development company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company's roots in Hong Kong date back to 1923, when Lee Hysan acquired plots of land in East Point, now known as Causeway Bay. On 30 April 1928, Lee Hysan was assassinated due to a growing public resentment of his opium business, which people believed had caused great harm to the Chinese society. Today, Hysan is the largest commercial landlord in Causeway Bay.
