In accounting the term Debtor Collection Period indicates the average time taken to collect trade debts. In other words, a reducing period of time is an indicator of increasing efficiency. It enables the enterprise to compare the real collection period with the granted/theoretical credit period.
Debtor Collection Period = (Average Debtors / Credit Sales) x 365 ( = No. of days) (average debtors = debtors at the beginning of the year + debtors at the end of the year, divided by 2 or Debtors + Bills Receivables)
Credit Sales are all sales made on credit (i.e. excluding cash sales) A long debtors collection period is an indication of slow or late payments by debtors.
The multiplier may be changed to 12 (for months) or 52 (for weeks) if appropriate.
