Franco-Nevada Corporation is a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based company that owns royalties and streams in gold mining and other commodity and natural resource investments. It is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.
The 'Old Franco-Nevada' was a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange from 1983 to 2002. In 1986, Old Franco-Nevada made its first royalty acquisition, and acquired or created additional royalties and resource investments from 1986 to 2002. Following several royalty acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, Old Franco-Nevada sold its only mining property to Normandy Mining in exchange for 19.9% of the company's shares.
In 2002, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco-Nevada as part of a three-way combination of Newmont, Normandy and Old Franco-Nevada. Newmont maintained Franco-Nevada as a royalty holding division, transferring numerous other royalties to it over the five-year period following the acquisition, building its portfolio of royalties to include investments in almost 300 royalies (two-thirds in bases and precious metal miners, and one-third in oil and natural gas). In 2007 Newmont spun off Franco-Nevada in an Initial Public Offering.
