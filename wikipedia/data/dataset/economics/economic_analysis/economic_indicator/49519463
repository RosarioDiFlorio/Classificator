Wintrust is a financial holding company in the United States that operates 15 chartered community banks in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin. It trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market with stock symbol WTFC. Wintrust is the second largest local banking company in Chicago.
The company provides traditional retail and commercial banking services, as well as wealth management services, commercial insurance premium financing, life insurance premium financing, and certain treasury management services such as data processing of payrolls and billings. In 2015 Wintrust began to expand into equipment financing, both directly through its banking subsidiaries and indirectly through dealers.
The company is the official banking partner of the Chicago Cubs and also partners with the Chicago White Sox. It is best known for the giant sign atop the JumboTron at Wrigley Field;  the "W" in "Wintrust" flashes after every Cubs win.
Wintrust was among the recipients of capital from the United States government through the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. The bank used the 2008 financial crisis to acquire small troubled banks in the Chicago area, backed by its pre-crisis capital supplemented by TARP funds. This positioned it to become one of the area's largest retail banks by eliminating costs and deepening its geographical footprint in the area.
Wintrust Financial continues to expand within the area.
