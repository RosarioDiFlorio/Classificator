China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (Chinese: 蒙牛; SEHK: 2319) is a manufacturing and distribution company of dairy products and ice cream in the People's Republic of China. The company is based in Inner Mongolia and manufactures dairy products under the Mengniu brand.
In July 2009, Mengniu sold a 20% stake to a consortium led by state-owned China National Oils, Foodstuffs and Cereals Corp, China's largest importer and exporter of food. That sale made the state the single largest shareholder.
Mengniu's main competitor in China is Yili Group.
