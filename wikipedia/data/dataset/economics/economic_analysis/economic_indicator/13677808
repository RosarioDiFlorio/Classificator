The Commitment to Development Index (CDI), published annually by the Center for Global Development, ranks the worldâ€™s richest countries on their dedication to policies that benefit the five billion people living in poorer nations. Rich and poor countries are linked in many ways; thus the Index looks beyond standard comparisons of foreign aid flows. It measures "development-friendliness" of 27 of the world's richest countries, all member nations of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. The CDI assesses national effort in seven policy areas: aid, trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology. It is considered to be a numerical targeting indicator for Goal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals. It shows that aid is about more than quantity - quality also matters - and that development policy is about more than aid. The Index penalizes countries that give with one hand, for instance through aid or investment, but take away with the other, through trade barriers or pollution.
In 2016, the CDI ranked Finland number one in the world, followed by Denmark, Sweden, France and Portugal. Poland, Japan and Switzerland finished at the bottom, partly because of high trade barriers.
