Groupe PSA (informally PSA; PSA Group in English; formerly known as PSA Peugeot Citroën from 1991 to 2016) is a French multinational manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles sold under the Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands. Opel (together with its Vauxhall subsidiary) is the largest PSA brand in Europe. PSA is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange and is again a constituent of the CAC 40 index (2015) after having been removed in 2012.
Beginning in 2016, PSA began to outline a strategy which entailed the rapid expansion of the company, through both geographic expansion and acquisitions of other car companies. PSA has announced plans to enter the Indian, American, Canadian, ASEAN, and other markets in the coming years.
Headquartered in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, PSA, with sales of 3.146 million units, was in 2016 the third-largest Europe-based automaker. After the completion of the agreed acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors, Groupe PSA is ranked as Europe's second largest automaker.
