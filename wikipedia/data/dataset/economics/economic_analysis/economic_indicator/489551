East West Bank (traditional Chinese: 華美銀行; simplified Chinese: 华美银行; pinyin: Huáměi Yínháng), the primary subsidiary of East West Bancorp, Inc., is a bank based in Pasadena, California. It was founded in 1973 to serve the Chinese American community and has over 130 branch locations in the U.S and Greater China, including branches in northern and southern California, Georgia, Nevada, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Washington. In Greater China, East West’s presence includes 5 full service branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shantou and Shenzhen, and representative offices in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Taipei and Xiamen.
The Chinese name is not a direct translation of east and west, rather it is two characters, which depend on context. 華 can mean magnificent or splendid, but is often used in conjunction with other characters to refer to China and Chinese overseas. Likewise 美 can mean 'pretty' or 'USA, American'.
