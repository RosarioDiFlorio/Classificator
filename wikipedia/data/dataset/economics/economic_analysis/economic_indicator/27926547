MTY Food Group is a Canadian franchisor and operator of numerous quick service restaurants operating under 48 brand names, some of them through wholly owned subsidiaries. They include Thaï Express, Country Style, Groupe Valentine, Vanelli's, Extreme Pita, Cultures, La Cremiere, Sushi Shop, Veggirama, Caferama, O'burger, Tiki Ming, Vie & Nam, Au Vieux Duluth Express, FranxSupreme, ChicknChick, Croissant Plus, Koya Japan, Kim Chi, Panini, Tandori, Tutti Frutti, Villa Madina Mediterranean Cuisine, Sukiyaki, Taco Time, Yogen Früz and the Canadian branch of TCBY.
The number of restaurant locations using those brand names more than doubled between 2007 and 2010. Since opening the first Tiki Ming restaurant in 1984, MTY launched ten brands and acquired sixteen others. Four of the restaurant chains—Vanelli's, Caferama, Sukiyaki, and La Cremiere—also operate in the Middle East. There used to be a computer and technology division named Gold Tech Computer Systems Ltd., but it was spun off in 2003, renaming itself MTY Food Group Inc.
Most of its restaurants are located in shopping mall and cinema food courts while others are in convenience stores. The company owes much of its growth to corporate takeovers (in 2013 80% of the company's revenue growth was attributable to acquisitions). It operates in Canada, United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Morocco and in 2009 revenue from franchise fees increased 75%. It joined the Toronto Stock Exchange as a debt-free company in June 2010. Prior to this it traded on the TSX Venture Exchange for 15 years under four different names.
