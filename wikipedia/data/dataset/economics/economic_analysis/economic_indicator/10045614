Mapfre (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈmafɾe], officially typeset MAPFRE) is a Spanish insurance company, based in Majadahonda, Madrid. The name comes from the old mutual origin of the company (Mutualidad de la Agrupación de Propietarios de Fincas Rústicas de España), but the company now only refers to itself as Mapfre. It is the leading insurance company in Spain and the largest non-life insurance company in Latin America.
The company purchased Webster, Massachusetts-based Commerce Insurance Group, a major provider of vehicle insurance, for over €1.5 billion in October 2007. Mapfre was listed in the Fortune Global 500 list on its 2008 edition. Rafael Nadal is officially sponsored by the company.
In October 2010, Mapfre acquired British travel insurance provider InsureandGo for an undisclosed sum.
In March 2012, Antonio Huertas took over as Mapfre's chairman from José Manuel Martínez, who had held the role since 2001.
