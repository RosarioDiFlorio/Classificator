Électricité de France S.A. (EDF; Electricity of France) is a French electric utility company, largely owned by the French state. Headquartered in Paris, with €65.2 billion in revenues in 2010, EDF operates a diverse portfolio of 120+ gigawatts of generation capacity in Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
In 2009, EDF was the world's largest producer of electricity. In 2011, it produced 22% of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power:
nuclear: 64.3%;
renewable energy: 12.3% (includes 4.6% hydroelectricity);
gas: 8.6%;
coal: 14.5%;
other: 0.3%.
Its 58 active nuclear reactors (in France) are spread out over 20 sites (nuclear power plants). They comprise 34 reactors of 900 MWe, 20 reactors of 1300 MWe, and 4 reactors of 1450 MWe, all PWRs.
In 2017 EDF will take over the majority of the reactor business of Areva, in a French government sponsored restructuring following financial and technical problems at Areva. In July 2017, France's Environmental Minister Nicolas Hulot stated that up to 17 of France's nuclear power reactors — all of which are operated by EDF — could be shuttered by 2025 to meet legislative targets for reducing dependence on the power source.
