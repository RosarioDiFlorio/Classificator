For most economies in the world, their leading export and import trading partner in terms of value is either the European Union, or to a lesser degree, the United States. Other countries like China, Japan, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa are emerging as significant markets or source countries in different parts of the world.
Individually for each European Union member trade with all other European Union members collectively is greater than any other trading partner. Both the European Union and the United States have China as their largest origin of imports. China's own largest source of imports is European Union. In other parts of the world the European Union or the United States is the largest trading partner, however other leading trading countries may be the most prominent in certain countries. Brazil, Russia and South Africa are becoming increasingly dominant in their respective regional areas.
Some isolated countries depend on a larger neighbour to be their largest trading partner â€“ Venezuela is Cuba's key export market, while doubly-landlocked Uzbekistan exports chiefly to Tajikistan and Afghanistan, its singly-landlocked neighbours.
