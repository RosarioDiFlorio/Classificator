The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (第一生命保険株式会社, Dai-ichi Seimei Hoken Kabushiki-kaisha), or Dai-ichi Life for short, is the third-largest life insurer in Japan by revenue, behind Japan Post Insurance and Nippon Life.
Founded on September 15, 1902, Dai-Ichi was one of the oldest mutual insurance companies in Japan until a motion to demutualise was passed in 2009 and, on April 1, 2010, it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising 1.01 trillion yen. As of March 2013, it had the most assets of any listed company in Japan with a total of 33 trillion yen on its stand-alone balance sheet, more than twice the total assets of #2-ranked Tokyo Electric Power Company.
It was announced in October 2014 that Dai-ichi would raise US$1 billion by issuing US-dollar-denominated subordinated bonds in overseas markets.
