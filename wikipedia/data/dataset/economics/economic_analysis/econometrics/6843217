In statistics and information theory, the expected formation matrix of a likelihood function 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(\theta )}
   is the matrix inverse of the Fisher information matrix of 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(\theta )}
  , while the observed formation matrix of 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(\theta )}
   is the inverse of the observed information matrix of 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(\theta )}
  .
Currently, no notation for dealing with formation matrices is widely used, but in books and articles by Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen and Peter McCullagh, the symbol 
  
    
      
        
          j
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle j^{ij}}
   is used to denote the element of the i-th line and j-th column of the observed formation matrix. The geometric interpretation of the Fisher information matrix (metric) leads to a notation of 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{ij}}
   following the notation of the (contravariant) metric tensor in differential geometry. The Fisher information metric is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{ij}}
   so that using Einstein notation we have 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            i
            k
          
        
        
          g
          
            k
            j
          
        
        =
        
          δ
          
            i
          
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g_{ik}g^{kj}=\delta _{i}^{j}}
  .
These matrices appear naturally in the asymptotic expansion of the distribution of many statistics related to the likelihood ratio.
