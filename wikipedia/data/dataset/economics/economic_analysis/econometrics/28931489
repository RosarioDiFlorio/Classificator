A consistent pricing process (CPP) is any representation of (frictionless) "prices" of assets in a market. It is a stochastic process in a filtered probability space 
  
    
      
        (
        Ω
        ,
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
        {
        
          
            
              F
            
          
          
            t
          
        
        
          }
          
            t
            =
            0
          
          
            T
          
        
        ,
        P
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},\{{\mathcal {F}}_{t}\}_{t=0}^{T},P)}
   such that at time 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   the 
  
    
      
        
          i
          
            t
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i^{th}}
   component can be thought of as a price for the 
  
    
      
        
          i
          
            t
            h
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i^{th}}
   asset.
Mathematically, a CPP 
  
    
      
        Z
        =
        (
        
          Z
          
            t
          
        
        
          )
          
            t
            =
            0
          
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z=(Z_{t})_{t=0}^{T}}
   in a market with d-assets is an adapted process in 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
   if Z is a martingale with respect to the physical probability measure 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  , and if 
  
    
      
        
          Z
          
            t
          
        
        ∈
        
          K
          
            t
          
          
            +
          
        
        ∖
        {
        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z_{t}\in K_{t}^{+}\backslash \{0\}}
   at all times 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          K
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle K_{t}}
   is the solvency cone for the market at time 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  .
The CPP plays the role of an equivalent martingale measure in markets with transaction costs. In particular, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the CPP 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
   and the EMM 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  .
