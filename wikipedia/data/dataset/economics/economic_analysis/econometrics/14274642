The Journal of Applied Econometrics is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering econometrics, published by John Wiley & Sons. It focuses on applications rather than theoretical issues. It was established in 1986 and is published seven times per year. Its editor-in-chief is Barbara Rossi. Since 1994 it has required its authors to deposit a complete set of data (provided they are non-confidential) into the journal's Data Archive, in order to enable the replication of empirical results published in the journal.
