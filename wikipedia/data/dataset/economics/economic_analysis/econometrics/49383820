Ta-Chung Liu (Chinese: 劉大中; October 27, 1914 – August 14, 1975) was a Chinese American economist and econometrician. He was a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and Cornell University.
Born in Peking, he earned a degree in civil engineering from the Chiao Tung University (Chinese: 交通大学) in 1936. Influenced by Fritz Machlup, he switched to economics as he began graduate studies at Cornell University. Liu earned a PhD in 1940 under Donald English.
In the 1950s and 60s, Liu criticized the "Cowles Commission method" of structural equation modelling and advocated reduced form estimation instead, foreshadowing Christopher Sims' VAR method of 1980.
