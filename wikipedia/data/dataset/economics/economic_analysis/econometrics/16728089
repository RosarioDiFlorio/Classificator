The Heckman correction (the two-stage method, Heckman's lambda or the Heckit method) is any of a number of related statistical methods developed by James Heckman at the University of Chicago in 1976 to 1979 which allow the researcher to correct for selection bias. Selection bias problems are endemic to applied econometric problems, which make Heckmanâ€™s original technique, and subsequent refinements by both himself and others, indispensable to applied econometricians. Heckman received the Economics Nobel Prize in 2000 for this achievement.
