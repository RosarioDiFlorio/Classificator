Robert Dorfman (27 October 1916 – 24 June 2002) was emeritus professor of political economy at Harvard University. Dorfman made great contributions to the fields of economics, group testing and in the process of coding theory.
His paper—'The Detection of Defective Members of Large Populations' (1943) is a landmark in the sphere of Combinatorial Group Testing. To quote collaborator and Nobel laureate Robert M. Solow—"After starting his career as a statistician—his paper 'The Detection of Defective Members of Large Populations' (1943) is still a landmark—he turned to economics at the moment when linear models of production and allocation captured the profession's imagination." Dorfman co-authored "Linear Programming and Economic Analysis" with Solow and economist Paul A. Samuelson.
