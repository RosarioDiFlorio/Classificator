Carl Assar Eugén Lindbeck (born January 26, 1930) is a professor of economics still active at Stockholm University and at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN).
Lindbeck is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. and previously chaired the Academy's prize committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. He was the first Swede to be appointed a foreign Honorary Member of the American Economic Association, and one of only three Swedes ever.
Lindbeck has done research on unemployment (e.g. the insider-outsider theory of employment), the welfare state (including the effect of changing social norms), and China's reformed economy. Lindbeck received a Ph.D. from Stockholm University in 1963 with the doctoral thesis A study in monetary analysis.
Assar Lindbeck also has a theory on self-destructive welfare state dynamics, in which the welfare system erodes norms relating to work and responsibility: change in the work ethic is related to a rising dependence on welfare state institutions. It was on the basis of this viewpoint that he promoted the economic theories of conservative American theorist James McGill Buchanan. Indeed, it is said that it was through Lindbeck's influence at the Swedish Academy that Buchanan was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize for Economics, a decision which was later felt to have contributed to undermining the credibility of the award.
Lindbeck previously headed the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, Sweden. In 1992–1993 he headed the so-called "Lindbeck Commission", which was appointed by the Government of Sweden to propose reforms in light of the then-ongoing economic crisis.
