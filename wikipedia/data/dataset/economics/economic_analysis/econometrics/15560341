AREMOS was a data management and econometrics software package released by Global Insight. Although it is still sold, it was most popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, when it was used by leading economists. Developed as a DOS application by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates - WEFA now IHS Markit, it has gone through many iterations. Thomsons' Datastream macroeconomic databases which were accessible with AREMOS, were a key selling point. Today its use is largely legacy and has been superseded by newer econometric packages such as EViews, developed by WEFA successor company, IHS Markit.
It is rumored that sales of AREMOS has already been ended and access shut down in late 2015.
