Michio Morishima (森嶋 通夫, Morishima Michio, July 18, 1923 – July 13, 2004) was a Japanese economist, mathematician and econometrician, who was a faculty member at the London School of Economics from 1970–88 as the Sir John Hicks Professor of Economics. He was also emeritus professor of Osaka University and a member of the British Academy.
In 1976 he was a recipient of the Order of Culture (文化勲章, Bunka-kunshō), a lifetime award that is Japan's equivalent of a Nobel Prize.
He studied economics and sociology under Yasuma Takada. In 1946 he graduated Kyoto University and taught at Kyoto University and Osaka University. And he established Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) of Osaka University with Yasuma Takada. In 1968, he went to Britain and taught at University of Essex, LSE.
In 1960 he established with Nobel-laureate Lawrence R. Klein from the Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania the International Economic Review (today published by Penn), which grew to become one of the leading journals in economics in the world. In 1965, he became the first Japanese president of the Econometric Society. It is said that the most enthusiastic supporter of Morishima was John Hicks.
He was the originator of the project that resulted in the establishment of the Suntory-Toyota Foundation and the Suntory and Toyota International Centres for Economic and Related Disciplines (STICERD) at LSE. He was STICERD's first chairman. In 1991 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the LSE.
