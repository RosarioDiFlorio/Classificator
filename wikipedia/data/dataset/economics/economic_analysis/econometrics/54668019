Anna Mikusheva (born April 29, 1976) is an Associate Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was the 2012 recipient of the Elaine Bennett Research Prize, and is co-editor of the journal Econometric Theory.
Mikusheva grew up in Orenburg, Russia, and competed in the Math Olympiad, which brought her to the attention of scouts from a boarding school in Moscow. She continued her studies of mathematics at Moscow State University, where she earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1998 and a PhD in probability theory in 2001, while simultaneously earning an MA at the New Economic School. She then completed a PhD in economics at Harvard University in 2007, specializing in time series econometrics, and joined the faculty of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Her research focuses on developing tools to address the estimation of sophisticated macroeconomic models—such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models—with the limited amounts of economic data available. Her methods show where estimation of such models is more and less reliable.
