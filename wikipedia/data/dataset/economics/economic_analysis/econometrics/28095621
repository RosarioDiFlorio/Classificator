The methodology of econometrics is the study of the range of differing approaches to undertaking econometric analysis.
Commonly distinguished differing approaches that have been identified and studied include:
the Cowles Commission approach
the vector autoregression approach
the LSE approach to econometrics - originated with Denis Sargan now associated with David Hendry (and his general-to-specific modeling). Also associated this approach is the work on integrated and cointegrated systems originating on the work of Engle and Granger and Johansen and Juselius(Juselius 1999)
the use of calibration - Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott
the experimentalist or difference in differences approach - Joshua Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke.
In addition to these more clearly defined approaches, Hoover identifies a range of heterogeneous or textbook approaches that those less, or even un-, concerned with methodology, tend to follow.
