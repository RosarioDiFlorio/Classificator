Prolapsed uterus occurs in cows when the uterus is pushed out of the cow's vulva within the 24 hours following calving. The prolapsed uterus hangs down behind the cow; this can be fatal if not promptly treated, as rupture of major blood vessels may occur.
Veterinary assistance is required to replace the uterus. Prior to the arrival of the veterinarian, the uterus should be wrapped in a clean, moist, warm cloth or towel to protect it, while keeping the cow calm and restrained. The veterinarian will give the cow an epidural anesthetic, or a sedative, prior to replacement of the uterus. In order to prevent recurrence, the uterus must be completely replaced, and turned back the right way all the way to the ends of each horn. The prognosis is generally favorable if the cow survives having the uterus replaced, and most cows survive into the long term.
