The Currarino syndrome (also Currarino triad) is an inherited congenital disorder where either the sacrum (the fused vertebrae forming the back of the pelvis) is not formed properly, or there is a mass in the presacral space in front of the sacrum, and (3) there are malformations of the anus or rectum. It can also cause an anterior meningocele or a presacral teratoma.
Presacral teratoma usually is considered to be a variant of sacrococcygeal teratoma. However, the presacral teratoma that is characteristic of the Currarino syndrome may be a distinct kind.
