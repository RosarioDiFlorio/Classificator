The jeep problem, desert crossing problem or exploration problem is a mathematics problem in which a jeep must maximise the distance it can travel into a desert with a given quantity of fuel. The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert.
The problem was solved by N. J. Fine in 1947.
