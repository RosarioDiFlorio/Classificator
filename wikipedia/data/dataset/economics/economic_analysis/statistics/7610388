A masters degree in quantitative finance concerns the application of mathematical methods to the solution of problems in financial economics. There are several like-titled degrees which may further focus on financial engineering, financial risk management, computational finance and/or mathematical finance.
In general, these degrees aim to prepare students for roles as "quants" (quantitative analysts), including analysis, structuring, trading, and investing; in particular, these degrees emphasize derivatives and fixed income, and the hedging and management of the resultant market and credit risk.
Formal masters-level training in quantitative finance has existed only since 1990.
