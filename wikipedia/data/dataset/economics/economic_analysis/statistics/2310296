The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) is an analysis agency of the United States Army. TRAC conducts research on potential military operations worldwide to inform decisions about the most challenging issues facing the Army and the Department of Defense (DoD). TRAC relies upon the intellectual capital of a highly skilled workforce of military and civilian personnel to execute its mission.
TRAC conducts operations research (OR) on a wide range of military topics, some contemporary but most often set 5 to 15 years in the future. How should Army units be organized? What new systems should be procured? How should soldiers and commanders be trained? What are the costs and benefits of competing options? What are the potential risks and rewards of a planned military course of action? TRAC directly supports the mission of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), to develop future concepts and requirements while also serving the decision needs of many military clients.
