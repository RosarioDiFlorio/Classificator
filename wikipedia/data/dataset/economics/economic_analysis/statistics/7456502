The lateral periodontal cyst is a non-inflammatory developmental cyst that arises from the epithelial post-functional dental lamina, which is a remnant from odontogenesis. It is more common in middle-aged males. Usually asymptomatic, it presents as a regular well-corticated radiolucency on the side of a mandibular canine or premolar root. Histologically, the cyst appears similar to the gingival cyst of the adult, having a non-keratinized squamous epithelial lining. The involved tooth is usually vital and has no indication for root canal treatment unless the signs of non-vital or necrotic pulpal tissue were confirmed. The cysts arise from epithelial rest cells in the periodontal ligament, although it is unknown whether from the cell rests of Malassez, reduced enamel epithelium or dental lamina remnants, and are generally treated by surgical enucleation.
