A choice set is one scenario, also known as a treatment, provided for evaluation by respondents in a choice experiment. Responses are collected and used to create a choice model. Respondents are usually provided with a series of differing choice sets for evaluation.
The choice set is generated from an experimental design and usually involves two or more alternatives being presented together.
