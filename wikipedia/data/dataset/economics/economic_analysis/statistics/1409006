Common knowledge is a special kind of knowledge for a group of agents. There is common knowledge of p in a group of agents G when all the agents in G know p, they all know that they know p, they all know that they all know that they know p, and so on ad infinitum.
The concept was first introduced in the philosophical literature by David Kellogg Lewis in his study Convention (1969). The sociologist Morris Friedell defined common knowledge in a 1969 paper. It was first given a mathematical formulation in a set-theoretical framework by Robert Aumann (1976). Computer scientists grew an interest in the subject of epistemic logic in general – and of common knowledge in particular – starting in the 1980s.[1] There are numerous puzzles based upon the concept which have been extensively investigated by mathematicians such as John Conway.
The philosopher Stephen Schiffer, in his book Meaning, independently developed a notion he called "mutual knowledge" which functions quite similarly to Lewis's "common knowledge".
