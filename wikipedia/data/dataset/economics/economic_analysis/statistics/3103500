The deviance information criterion (DIC) is a hierarchical modeling generalization of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). It is particularly useful in Bayesian model selection problems where the posterior distributions of the models have been obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Like AIC and BIC, DIC is an asymptotic approximation as the sample size becomes large. It is only valid when the posterior distribution is approximately multivariate normal.
