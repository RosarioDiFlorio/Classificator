Simultaneous equation models are a type of statistical model in the form of a set of linear simultaneous equations. They are often used in econometrics. In Simultaneous Equations Models (SEM), one can estimate equation by equation, however estimation methods that exploit the system of equations, such as General Method of Moments (GMM) and Instrumental variables estimation (IV) tends to be more efficient.
