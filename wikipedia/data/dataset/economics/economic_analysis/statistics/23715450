Finite difference methods for option pricing are numerical methods used in mathematical finance for the valuation of options. Finite difference methods were first applied to option pricing by Eduardo Schwartz in 1977.
In general, finite difference methods are used to price options by approximating the (continuous-time) differential equation that describes how an option price evolves over time by a set of (discrete-time) difference equations. The discrete difference equations may then be solved iteratively to calculate a price for the option. The approach arises since the evolution of the option value can be modelled via a partial differential equation (PDE), as a function of (at least) time and price of underlying; see for example Blackâ€“Scholes PDE. Once in this form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained.
The approach can be used to solve derivative pricing problems that have, in general, the same level of complexity as those problems solved by tree approaches.
