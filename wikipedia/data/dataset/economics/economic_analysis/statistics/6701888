Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome (also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, MPS VI, or polydystrophic dwarfism) is a form of mucopolysaccharidosis caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase B (ARSB). It is named after Pierre Maroteaux (1926–) and his mentor Maurice Emil Joseph Lamy (1895–1975), both French physicians.
