Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), originally called persistent sexual arousal syndrome (PSAS), Weiss Disease, and also known as restless genital syndrome (ReGS or RGS), results in a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable genital arousal, with or without orgasm or genital engorgement, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. It was only recently characterized as a distinct syndrome in medical literature with a comparable counterpart increasingly reported by men. It was studied as far back as 1986 and in the 90s was researched by the Dutch.
Some physicians use the term persistent sexual arousal syndrome to refer to the condition in women; others consider the syndrome of priapism in men to be the same disorder. Priapism was a recognized, diagnosable medical condition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, whereas PGAD was not. With the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, PGAD was again not included as a listed condition. 
In particular, it is not related to hypersexuality, sometimes known as nymphomania or satyriasis. (Hypersexuality, nymphomania, and satyriasis are also not recognized diagnosable medical conditions by the DSM-IV).
