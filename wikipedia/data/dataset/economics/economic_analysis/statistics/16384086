Job shop scheduling or the job-shop problem (JSP) is an optimization problem in computer science and operations research in which ideal jobs are assigned to resources at particular times. The most basic version is as follows: We are given n jobs J1, J2, ..., Jn of varying processing times, which need to be scheduled on m machines with varying processing power, while trying to minimize the makespan. The makespan is the total length of the schedule (that is, when all the jobs have finished processing). In most practical settings, the problem is presented as an online problem (dynamic scheduling), that is, the decision of scheduling a job can only be made online, when the job is presented to the algorithm.
This problem is one of the best known combinatorial optimization problems, and was the first problem for which competitive analysis was presented, by Graham in 1966. Best problem instances for basic model with makespan objective are due to Taillard.
Applying machine learning to job scheduling is an emerging approach. In this approach, artificial intelligence determines optimizations without the need for human programmers to create an algorithm for them or to fully understand the complex causation that drives them.
The name originally came from the scheduling of jobs in a job shop, but the theme has wide applications beyond that type of instance.
