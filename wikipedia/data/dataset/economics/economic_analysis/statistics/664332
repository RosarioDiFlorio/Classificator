Econophysics is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes and nonlinear dynamics. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed statistical finance referring to its roots in statistical physics. In fact, the phenomenology of a phase transition has been shown to occur in economics at a very elementary level  (a toy manufacturing model only requiring first-semester calculus).
