Environmental enteropathy (EE) (also known as tropical enteropathy or environmental enteric dysfunction) is a disorder of chronic intestinal inflammation. EE can occur in all ages, but predominantly affects children living in low-resource settings. Acute symptoms are typically minimal or absent. Long-term EE may cause malnutrition (by way of both malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies), anemia (both iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic inflammation), linear growth stunting, impaired neurodevelopment or cognition, and impaired response to oral vaccinations.
The cause EE is multifactorial, but predominantly associated with long-term exposure to unhygienic or contaminated food and water sources, leading to a generalized state of intestinal inflammation. Environmental enteropathy results in a number of changes in the intestines including: smaller villi, larger crypts (called crypt hyperplasia), increased permeability, and inflammatory cell build-up within the intestines. These changes result in poor absorption of food, vitamins and minerals. Standardized, clinically practical diagnostic criteria do not exist. Currently, the gold-standard diagnostic test for the identification of EE is intestinal biopsy, which is invasive and unnecessary for most patients.
Prevention and treatment of EE are often discussed together, as prevention is currently considered the strongest and most reliable option for preventing EE and its sequelae.
