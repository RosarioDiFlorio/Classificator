Liebenberg Syndrome is a rare autosomal genetic disease that involves a deletion mutation upstream of the PITX1 gene, which is one that's responsible for the body's organization, specifically in forming lower limbs. In animal studies, when this deletion was introduced to developing birds, their wing buds were noted to take on limb-like structures.
The condition was first described by Dr. F. Liebenberg in 1973 while he followed multiple generations of a South African family, but it has since been noticed in other family lineages across the world.
