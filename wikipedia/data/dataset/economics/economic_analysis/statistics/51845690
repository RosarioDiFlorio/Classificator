Alcohol intolerance is due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that metabolises ingested alcohol. It can also be an effect or side effect associated with certain drugs such as disulfiram, metronidazole, or nilutamide. It is characterized as intolerance of and unpleasant symptoms upon the ingestion of alcohol, causing hangover symptoms similar to the "disulfiram-like reaction" of aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency or chronic fatigue syndrome.
If people are intolerant, some nearly non-alcoholic beverages may be a problem, similar to alcohol-containing medications, vinegar, inhalation of alcohol or the vapour of alcohol-containing cleaning agents.
Drinking alcohol first or afterwards together with Calcium cyanamide, an inorganic compound used as a fertilizer, can cause permanent or long lasting intolerance (nitrolime disease), contributing together with other substances to the accumulation of harmful Acetaldehyde by inhibiting the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.
