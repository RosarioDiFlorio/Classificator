The calcifying odotogenic cyst or the Gorlin cyst, now known in the WHO Classification of Tumours as the calcifying cystic odontogenic tumor, is a benign odontogenic tumor of cystic type most likely to affect the anterior areas of the jaws. It is most common in people in their second to third decades but can be seen at almost any age. On radiographs, the calcifying odontogenic cyst appears as a unilocular radiolucency (dark area). In one-third of cases, an impacted tooth is involved. Microscopically, there are many cells that are described as "ghost cells", enlarged eosinophilic epithelial cells without nuclei.
