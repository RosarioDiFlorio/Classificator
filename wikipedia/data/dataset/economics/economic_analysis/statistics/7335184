Perineodynia means perineal pain and includes vulvodynia and proctalgia fugax. Pudendal neuralgia is one of the main causes of perineodynia.
A study suggests that pudendal nerve decompression (PND) treats perineodynia. However, researchers mention that there is need for further studies to confirm the results.
