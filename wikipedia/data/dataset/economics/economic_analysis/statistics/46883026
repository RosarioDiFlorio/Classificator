Reverse logistics is for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is "the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal. Remanufacturing and refurbishing activities also may be included in the definition of reverse logistics."
In order to modelling reverse logistics network from an economics point of view, the following simplified reverse logistics system has to be set.
In this model the products are gathered from the consumers and transferred back to the producers, hence the direction of the flow in the distribution supply chain is reversed and the model is expanded with the recovery center. First of all the used products are collected from the consumers and moved to the recovery center, where the condition of the products are examined according to their end of life cycle. If there is still recapture value, then the product is disassembled as preparation for further reprocessing, which means physical transformation to new customer. Otherwise the used product is disposed and transferred to the landfill site. According to the introduced model the main differences between forward and reverse logistics can be identified:
Uncertainty on the quantity, quality and timing
Complex system due to more participants and more interactions
Mismatch between demand and supply occurs
Unexplored market opportunities but the low value of return flow means a limit
