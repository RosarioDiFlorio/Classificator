In statistics, a semiparametric model is a statistical model that has parametric and nonparametric components.
A statistical model is a collection of distributions: 
  
    
      
        {
        
          P
          
            θ
          
        
        :
        θ
        ∈
        Θ
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{P_{\theta }:\theta \in \Theta \}}
   indexed by a parameter 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  .
A parametric model is one in which the indexing parameter is a finite-dimensional vector (in 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -dimensional Euclidean space for some integer 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  ); i.e. the set of possible values for 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is a subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}}
  , or 
  
    
      
        Θ
        ⊂
        
          
            R
          
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta \subset \mathbb {R} ^{k}}
  . In this case we say that 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is finite-dimensional.
In nonparametric models, the set of possible values of the parameter 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is a subset of some space, not necessarily finite-dimensional. For example, we might consider the set of all distributions with mean 0. Such spaces are vector spaces with topological structure, but may not be finite-dimensional as vector spaces. Thus, 
  
    
      
        Θ
        ⊂
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta \subset \mathbb {F} }
   for some possibly infinite-dimensional space 
  
    
      
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} }
  .
In semiparametric models, the parameter has both a finite-dimensional component and an infinite-dimensional component (often a real-valued function defined on the real line). Thus the parameter space 
  
    
      
        Θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta }
   in a semiparametric model satisfies 
  
    
      
        Θ
        ⊂
        
          
            R
          
          
            k
          
        
        ×
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta \subset \mathbb {R} ^{k}\times \mathbb {F} }
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {F} }
   is an infinite-dimensional space.
It may appear at first that semiparametric models include nonparametric models, since they have an infinite-dimensional as well as a finite-dimensional component. However, a semiparametric model is considered to be "smaller" than a completely nonparametric model because we are often interested only in the finite-dimensional component of 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  . That is, we are not interested in estimating the infinite-dimensional component. In nonparametric models, by contrast, the primary interest is in estimating the infinite-dimensional parameter. Thus the estimation task is statistically harder in nonparametric models.
These models often use smoothing or kernels.
