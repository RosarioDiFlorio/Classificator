Microphthalmia–dermal aplasia–sclerocornea syndrome (also known as "MIDAS syndrome") is a condition characterized by linear skin lesions.
MLS is a rare X-linked dominant male-lethal disease characterized by unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia and linear skin defects in affected females, and in utero lethality for affected males. It can be associated with HCCS, but mutations in the MCCS gene cause Microphthalmia with Linear Skin Defects Syndrome.
