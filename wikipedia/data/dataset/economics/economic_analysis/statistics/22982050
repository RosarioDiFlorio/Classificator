In the study of zero sum games, Glicksberg's theorem (also Glicksberg's existence theorem) is a result that shows certain games have a minimax value .
If A and B are compact sets, and K is an upper semicontinuous or lower semicontinuous function on 
  
    
      
        A
        ×
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\times B}
  , then

  
    
      
        
          sup
          
            f
          
        
        
          inf
          
            g
          
        
        ∬
        K
        
        d
        f
        
        d
        g
        =
        
          inf
          
            g
          
        
        
          sup
          
            f
          
        
        ∬
        K
        
        d
        f
        
        d
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sup _{f}\inf _{g}\iint K\,df\,dg=\inf _{g}\sup _{f}\iint K\,df\,dg}
  
where f and g run over Borel probability measures on A and B.
The theorem is useful if f and g are interpreted as mixed strategies of two players in the context of a continuous game. If the payoff function K is upper semicontinuous, then the game has a value.
The continuity condition may not be dropped: see example of a game with no value.
