In probability theory, the minimal-entropy martingale measure (MEMM) is the risk-neutral probability measure that minimises the entropy difference between the objective probability measure, 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  , and the risk-neutral measure, 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  . In incomplete markets, this is one way of choosing a risk-neutral measure (from the infinite number available) so as to still maintain the no-arbitrage conditions.
The MEMM has the advantage that the measure 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
   will always be equivalent to the measure 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   by construction. Another common choice of equivalent martingale measure is the minimal martingale measure, which minimises the variance of the equivalent martingale. For certain situations, the resultant measure 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
   will not be equivalent to 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
  .
In a finite probability model, for objective probabilities 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}}
   and risk-neutral probabilities 
  
    
      
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q_{i}}
   then one must minimise the Kullback–Leibler divergence

   subject to the requirement that the expected return is

    {\displaystyle r}
  , where 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   is the risk-free rate.
