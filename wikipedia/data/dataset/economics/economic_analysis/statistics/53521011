A yoked control design is a research design used in experiments in which matched research subjects are yoked (joined together) by receiving the same stimuli or conditions. In operant conditioning the yoked subject receives the same treatment in terms of reinforcement or punishment.
Yoked control designs are used in a variety of scientific disciplines, including learning sciences, social psychology, and psychophysiology.
