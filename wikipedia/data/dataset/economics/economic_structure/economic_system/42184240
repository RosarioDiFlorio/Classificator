Vertcoin (VTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and software project. It is a Bitcoin-like blockchain currency with additional features such as Stealth Address technology and ASIC resistant Proof-of-work (PoW) function. The main difference between Bitcoin and Vertcoin is the latter's resistance to centralized mining and the long term promise of Vertcoin developers to keep it that way. Vertcoin has already forked two times to a new PoW function because of a veritable threat of centralized mining. The Vertcoin cryptocurrency wallet can be downloaded from Vertcoin's official website.
