Dream Market is an online darknet market founded in late 2013. Dream Market operates on a hidden service of the Tor network, allowing online users to browse anonymously and securely while avoiding potential monitoring of traffic. The marketplace sells a variety of content, including drugs, stolen data, and counterfeit consumer goods, all using the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Dream provides an escrow service, with disputes handled by staff. The market also has accompanying forums, hosted on a different URL, where buyers, vendors, and other members of the community can interact.
Following the seizures and shutdowns of the AlphaBay and Hansa markets in July 2017 as part of Operation Bayonet, there was much speculation that Dream Market would become the predominant darknet marketplace. Formerly, Dream Market had been considered the second-largest darknet marketplace, with AlphaBay being the largest and Hansa the third-largest. Many vendors and buyers from AlphaBay and Hansa communities registered on Dream Market in the aftermath of Operation Bayonet. Rumors, however, suggest that Dream Market may also be under law enforcement control. 
At the time, Dream Market was reported to have "57,000 listings for drugs and 4,000 listings for opioids".
Dream Administrator and prolific vendor Gal Vallerius was arrested in August 2017, after a border search of his laptop confirmed his identity as online drug kingpin OxyMonster. The equivalent of $500,000 USD in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was also discovered on this device. Vallerius is the subject of an ongoing investigation regarding large online narcotics purchases which began in February 2016.
