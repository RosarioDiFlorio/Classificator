Kolejka ([kɔˈlɛi̯ka]; Polish for "queue" or "line (of people)") is a board game designed by Karol Madaj and launched in February 2011 by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance. It was designed to teach young generations about the hardships under communism (1945–1989), particularly the difficulty of acquiring consumer goods in the shortage economy. The game has been described as inspired by Monopoly.
