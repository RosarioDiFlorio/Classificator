Proto-capitalist economies and free markets became active during the Islamic Golden Age where an early market economy and a form of merchant capitalism took root between the 8thâ€“12th centuries.
A vigorous monetary economy developed, based on a widely circulated currency (the dinar) and on the integration of previously independent monetary areas.
Business techniques and forms of business organisation employed during this time included:
contracts
bills of exchange
long-distance international trade
forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba)
forms of credit
debt
profit
loss
capital (al-mal)
capital accumulation (nama al-mal),
circulating capital
capital expenditure
revenue
cheques,
promissory notes,
trusts (see Waqf)
savings accounts
transactional accounts
pawning
loaning
exchange rates
bankers
money changers
ledgers
deposits
assignments
lawsuits
Organizational enterprises independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world, while the agency institution was also introduced.
Medieval Europe adopted and further developed many of these early capitalist concepts from the 13th century onwards.
