"Pink tide" (Spanish: marea rosa, Portuguese: onda rosa) and "turn to the Left" (Sp.: vuelta hacia la izquierda, Pt.: Guinada Ã  Esquerda) are phrases used in contemporary 21st century political analysis in the media and elsewhere to describe the perception of a turn towards left wing governments in Latin American democracies straying away from the neo-liberal economic model. The shift represented a move toward more progressive economic policies and coincides with a parallel trend towards direct democracy in some communities.
The Latin American countries viewed as part of this ideological trend have been referred to as "Pink Tide nations", with the term post-neoliberalism being used to describe the movement as well. Pink tide governments have been characterized by some authors as being anti-American, populist, and authoritarian-leaning.
