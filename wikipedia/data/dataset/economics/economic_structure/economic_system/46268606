Chope is a real time restaurant-reservation booking platform which connects diners with its partner restaurants. The name “Chope” was inspired by the term chope spoken colloquially in Singapore. The means to online reservation include the company’s website, mobile applications, and plug-ins for restaurant websites and Facebook pages. Chope charges restaurants fixed and per-diner fees for the use of its table booking system; diners are not charged booking or cancellation fees for reservations made through Chope’s system. In July 2012, Chope announced its application has been used by 1,000,000 diners.
On June 30, 2015 the company announced it had secured an investment of US$8M in a series C round co-led by F&H Fund Management, a fund chaired by pioneering Alibaba CTO John Wu, and NSI Ventures. 
In April 2016, the company announced its acquisition of MakanLuar.com - Indonesia's top restaurant reservations platform co-founded by Kunal Narang and Hiro Mohinani in its foray into the country of 250 million people. 
On October 16, 2017, Chope announced that it had raised a Series D funding of US$13M. The round is led by Asia-Pacific investment firm Square Peg Capital and joined by C31 Ventures and Moelis Australia. Existing investors NSI Ventures, Susquehanna International Group, DSG Consumer Partners, and SPH Ventures also came in for a top-up.
