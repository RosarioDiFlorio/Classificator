Ubiq (UBQ) is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. The Ubiq network provides a stable blockchain to host an Ethereum Virtual Machine, integrating a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine that allows for the creation of contracts and tokens. It provides a value token called "Ubiq (UBQ)", which was generated by transferring the value of a three-year old established token, Jumbucks (JBS), onto a blockchain with Ethereum functionality. Thus, it provides EVM functionality in a blockchain segregated technologically, politically, and conceptually from Ethereum or Ethereum Classic.
