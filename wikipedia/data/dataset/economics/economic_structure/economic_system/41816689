Ziferblat (free space) is an international pay per minute "Sitting Room" concept, where guests pay for the time spent there, rather than the food. This shared space was the first of its kind in the world.
The guests are welcome to unlimited teas, cakes, coffees, biscuits, fruits, soft drinks, breads, cereals, yoghurts, snacks, cookies, brownies, toasties and more. Decorated in the style of a living room, guests clock in and out at the desk on entry and are encouraged to treat the space like home. Typically, the public "Sitting Room" space includes boardgames, newspapers, Wi-Fi, a mixture of soft and hard furnishings, a piano, a library and craft supplies.
