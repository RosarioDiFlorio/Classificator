Uber Technologies Inc. is a global transportation technology company headquartered in San Francisco, California, United States, operating in 633 cities worldwide. It develops, markets and operates the Uber car transportation and food delivery mobile apps. Uber drivers use their own cars although drivers can rent a car to drive with Uber.
The name "Uber" is a reference to the common (and somewhat colloquial) word "uber", meaning "topmost" or "super", and having its origins in the German word Ã¼ber, meaning "above".
Uber has been a pioneer in the sharing economy, so much so that the changes in industries as a result of it have been referred to as "Uberification" or "Uberisation". Uber has also been the subject of protests and legal actions and is the subject of a criminal investigation.
