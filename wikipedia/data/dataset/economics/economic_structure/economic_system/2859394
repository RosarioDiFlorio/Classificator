Malik Ayaz, son of AymƒÅq Abu'n-Najm, was a slave from Georgia who rose to the rank of officer and general in the army of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni (also known as Mahmud Ghaznavi). Malik Ayaz's chaste love of Mahmud inspired poems and stories,  while local Muslim historians and Sufis commemorate Malik Ayaz due to his unwavering feudalistic loyalty to Mahmud Ghaznavi.
