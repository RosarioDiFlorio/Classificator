The National Farmers Organization (NFO) is a producer movement when it was founded in the United States in 1955. Notoriety came in 1967 when it organized milk farmers to engage in a holding action to improve the price of milk paid to producers.
NFO had its roots in earlier populist agrarian movements such as the Grange, the National Farmers Union, and the Farmers' Alliance.
Don Berkhahn was instrumental in the early years.
