A house-commune (дом-коммуна) was an architectural and social movement in early Soviet Union of 1920-1930s.
The purpose of the house-communes was to get rid of "the yoke of the household economy". 
The idea of a house-commune is borrowed from phalanstères of utopian socialists. In 1928 Tsentrozhilsoyuz (Общесоюзный центр жилищно-строительной и жилищно-арендной кооперации) issued the "Typical Statute of the House-Commune" (Типовое положение о доме-коммуне), which called for communal education of children, food preparation, household chores and recreation.
