Barracks communism (German: Kasernenkommunismus) is the term coined by Karl Marx to refer to a "crude," authoritarian, forced collectivism and communism, where all aspects of life are bureaucratically regimented and communal. Originally, Marx used the expression to criticise the vision of Sergey Nechayev, outlined in the Fundamentals of the Future Social System.
The term "barracks" here does not refer to military barracks, but to the workers' barracks-type primitive dormitories in which industrial workers lived in many places in the Russian Empire of the time.
Later, political theorists of the Soviet Union applied this term to the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong (1950sâ€“1970s). Still later, during the Soviet Perestroika period, the term was used to apply to the history of the Soviet Union itself.
