Eco-capitalism, also known as environmental capitalism or green capitalism, is the view that capital exists in nature as "natural capital" (ecosystems that have ecological yield) on which all wealth depends, and therefore, market-based government policy instruments (such as cap and trade systems) should be used to resolve environmental problems.
The term "Blue Greens" is often applied to those who espouse eco-capitalism. It is considered as the right-wing equivalent to Red Greens.
