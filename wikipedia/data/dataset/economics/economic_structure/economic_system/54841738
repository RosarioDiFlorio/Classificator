Foxhole is an upcoming cooperative sandbox massively-multiplayer action-strategy video game being developed and published by Canadian video game company Clapfoot, whom are based in Toronto, Ontario. The game uses Unreal Engine 4, utilising an axonometric projection perspective, much like that of a conventional real-time strategy video game with a top-down view. The game allows the user to join one of two factions as a soldier, having the choice of contributing to a persistent war by organising, acquiring and transporting resources as well as supplies, providing manpower and vehicles in combat, building and managing fortifications and upgrading production facilities with the end goal of annihilating the opposition. The game has been in alpha-stage since 28 July 2017, with a planned full release on Microsoft Windows.
The game was released for Microsoft Windows on Steam's early access program in July 2017, garnering a peak no. of 4,813 concurrent players in under 2 weeks.
