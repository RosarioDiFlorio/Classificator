The Kitchen Library was the first non-profit lending library of kitchen appliances in Canada. Since opening its doors inside the Toronto Tool Library in October 2013, The Kitchen Library has received local, national, and international media attention and community support. The Kitchen Library moved to Yonge and Eglinton (inside Living City Health) in October 2014 where they lend appliances and teach workshops. It closed Sep 1, 2016.
As population increases and the average size of condos decrease, they believe that space and income shouldn't be barriers to cooking and healthy eating. By providing access to otherwise costly and space-consuming appliances they are building a more shareable city for the future.
In 2014 they were named by Canadian Living as one of the 7 Canadian inventions that make your life better, and have been featured in Toronto Life, The Toronto Star, The National Post, and CBC News.
