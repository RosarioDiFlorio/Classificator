The concept of hospitality service, also known as "accommodation sharing", "hospitality exchange" (short "hospex"), "home stay networks", or "home hospitality network" ("hoho"), refers to centrally organized social networks of travelers, who offer or seek homestays (accommodation in a home) either with or without monetary exchange. These services generally connect users via the internet. Hospitality services are examples of collaborative consumption and sharing. In cases where money is not exchanged in return for accommodation, they are examples of a barter economy or gift economy.
