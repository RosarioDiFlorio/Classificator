Memetic institutionalism is a term created by Mikael Sandberg in Social Capital and Democratisation. Roots of Trust in Post-Communist Poland and Ukraine (with Martin Ã…berg, Ashgate 2003). Memetic institutionalism proposes the interpretation of institutions as evolving in a Darwinian fashion, analogous to that of memes.
