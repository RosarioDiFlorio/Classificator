Nihilist communism is a collection of anti-authoritarian, anti-political, anti-organizational communist perspectives cardinally developed by two anglophone authors using the pen names "Frère " and "Le Garçon". Since 2003, they have written collaboratively as Monsieur Dupont.
Nihilist communism aims to level "a critique of optimism in the far left". Rather than attempting to establish new and popular sets of positions, it is counterpoised against, among many other things, the "religious" dogma of the Marxist and anarchist milieus. It attempts to disencumber itself of its content in order to explore new concepts and ideas.
