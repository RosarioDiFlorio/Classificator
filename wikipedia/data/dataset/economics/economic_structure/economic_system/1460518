Riba (Arabic: ربا ,الربا، الربٰوة‎ ribā or al-ribā, IPA: [ˈrɪbæː]) can be roughly translated as "usury", or unjust, exploitative gains made in trade or business under Islamic law. Riba is mentioned and condemned in several different verses in the Qur'an (3:130,4:161,30:39 and perhaps most commonly in 2:275-2:280). It is also mentioned in many hadith.
While Muslims agree that riba is prohibited, not all agree on what it is, or whether it should be punished by humans. It is often used as an Islamic term for interest charged on loans, and this belief—that there is a consensus among Muslims that interest is riba—is the basis of a $2 trillion Islamic banking industry. However, not all scholars equated riba with all forms of interest, and among those who do there is also disagreement over whether it is a major sin and against sharia (Islamic law), or simply discouraged (makruh).
In addition to the unjust gains made from repayment of a loan—the full name of which is riba an-nasiya—most Islamic jurists believe there is another type of riba, riba al-fadl: the simultaneous exchange of unequal quantities or qualities of a given commodity.
