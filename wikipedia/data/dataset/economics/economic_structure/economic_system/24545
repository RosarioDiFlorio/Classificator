The Pasporta Servo (English: Passport Service) is an international hospitality service for Esperanto speakers. The website provides a platform for members to homestay as a guest at someone's home, host travelers, meet other members, or join an event. Pasporta Servo is an example of the gift economy; there is no monetary exchange between members and there is no expectation by hosts for future rewards.
Free lodging via Pasporta Servo has been described as one of the perks of learning Esperanto.
