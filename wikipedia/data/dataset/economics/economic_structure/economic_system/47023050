The Other Path: The Economic Answer to Terrorism is a book by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar which describes the informal sector and underground economy of Peru in the 1980s. The book was a top seller in both Latin American and the United States while also receiving international critical acclaim for its impact on economic growth and development in Latin America.
De Soto discusses the failures of government enforced regulations regarding property rights and how underground economies became a dominating presence in Peru as a result. In the book, de Soto explains how the rigid bureaucratic barriers and lack of legal structuring caused Peruvian citizens to have "houses but not titles; crops but not deeds; businesses but not statutes of incorporation". The difficulty for Peruvian citizens to acquire basic property rights forced them to participate and develop its own underground economy. De Soto's accounts in the book how he and his organization, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), solved this unstable situation through expansive reform.
