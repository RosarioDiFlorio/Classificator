Waste pickers in Khon Kaen, Thailand are unregistered workers who search through trash for recyclable goods that can be sold to distributors for a price. These workers live in all parts of the city, ranging from slums adjacent to railroad tracks to houses built on the landfill. Most scavengers have moved from surrounding provinces in search of a more reliable wage that can support their families. Others, however, were bankrupted after the Crash in 1997 and became scavengers. The two main communities of scavengers are slum communities and those who live by the landfill.
