The Wära was a demurrage-charged currency used in Germany introduced in the late 1920s as a free economy experiment in various places around Germany. It was introduced by Hans Timm and Helmut Rödiger, followers of Silvio Gesell, in 1926. The Wära is comparable to current models of local currencies.
