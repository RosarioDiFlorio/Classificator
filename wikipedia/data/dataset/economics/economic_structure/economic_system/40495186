Canaan Creative, known simply as Canaan, is a computer hardware manufacturer with specific integrated circuit design skills based in Beijing, China founded by N.G. Zhang in 2013. Canaan invented the first Bitcoin mining processors and computers and leads bitcoin hardware mining by using advanced ASIC semiconductor manufacturing processes. Canaan is known for its quality hardware paired with Open Source Software in all of its products up to the latest product, the AvalonMiner 741.
Most recently Canaan announced a $ 43 million USD Series A investment round to compete with other hardware manufacturers and develop artificial intelligence technology
The investment is the largest-ever announced by a bitcoin mining business, though one that's in line with moves from Canaan's competitors. One of the largest makers of ASIC chips specialized for mining, the firm's diversification follows competitor Bitfury's transition into software services and pursuits centered on enterprise blockchain offerings.
For Canaan, however, the funding will serve as a means to facilitate the exploration of computing chips for use in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and potentially, into hardware solutions for alternative cryptocurrencies that require different chips to optimize the mining process.
On May 21, 2017, Canaan announced the acquisition of "Blockchain Notary Service" Proof of Existence.
"We make the hardware that secures the blockchain; and now with the acquisition of Proof-of-Existence, we will also build services on top of the tamper proof features of the blockchain," Xiangfu Liu, Canaanâ€™s co-founder, said.
