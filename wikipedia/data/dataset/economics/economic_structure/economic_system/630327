International political economy (IPE), also known as global political economy (GPE), refers to either economics or an interdisciplinary academic discipline that analyzes economics and international relations. When it is used to refer to the latter, it usually focuses on political economy and macroeconomics, although it may also draw on a few other distinct academic schools, notably political science, also sociology, history, and cultural studies.
Political economy arose due to the fact that macroeconomics and politics are often intertwined and good macroeconomic policymaking requires knowledge of both economics and political science. Most scholars can concur that IPE ultimately is concerned with the interaction between political and economic forces.
Contemporary IPE degrees are usually heavily economics-based and usually located under political science or economics departments. IPE scholars are at the center of the debate and research surrounding globalization, international trade, international finance, financial crises, macroeconomics, development economics, (poverty and the role of institutions in development), global markets, political risk, multi-state cooperation in solving trans-border economic problems, and the structural balance of power between and among states and institutions.
