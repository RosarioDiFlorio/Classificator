During the Middle Ages, the Latin word advocatus (in English, advocate; in French avou√©; in German, Vogt) was a general term for any person called (ad vocatus) to defend another, such as a lawyer or an advocatus ecclesiae, usually a lay lord charged with the protecting a particular church.
The advocatus as an officer of a court of law first appears in the 12th and 13th centuries, concomitant with the rediscovery of Roman law.
