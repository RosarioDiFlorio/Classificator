Hospitality Club is a hospitality service. Via its website, hospitalityclub.org, it provides a platform for members to homestay as a guest at someone's home, host travelers, meet other members, or join an event. Hospitality Club is an example of the gift economy; there is no monetary exchange between members and there is no expectation by hosts for future rewards.
The hospitalityclub.org domain name is registered to the founder of the site, Veit KÃ¼hne, who, in 2006, was working full-time on Hospitality Club.
