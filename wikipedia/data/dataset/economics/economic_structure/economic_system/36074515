Ventoura was an app for travelers to connect with other travelers and locals in their destination.
Ventoura was founded by Matt Fox, an Australian living in Helsinki in 2014. Fox raised a seed investment round for Ventoura in mid 2014, and Ventoura launched in early 2015.
Due to disputes, Fox left the company to found another more successful mobile application called Sweat Mobile and ended up selling his shares to an investor in early 2016.
Ventoura was not founded by IT/engineering professionals, nor did it relocate offices, as displayed here earlier and displayed in this article by Griffith University.
