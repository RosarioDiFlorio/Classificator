The Porterâ€“MacKenzie debate is a historiographical disagreement in the field of Modern British and Imperial History over the extent to which colonialism played an important part of British culture during the 19th and 20th centuries. The debate was characterised by disagreement between the academic historians Bernard Porter and John MacKenzie. Porter argued that the expansion of empire during the era of New Imperialism had little effect on ordinary people in Britain, while the latter argued that colonialism dominated British popular culture for much of the period.
