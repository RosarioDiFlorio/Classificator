Spiral Knights is a massively multiplayer online game created by Three Rings Design and published by Sega. The free-to-play, Java-based game was released in 2011, and continues to be updated.
In the game, the player controls a knight of the Spiral order, which has crash-landed on the mysterious planet Cradle. Knights cooperatively battle monsters throughout the Clockworks, the dungeon that fills the planet's interior. They also battle each other in an optional player-versus-player mode.
Spiral Knights reached one million accounts in its first three months and three million accounts in its first thirteen months. The game won Best Online Game Design, and was nominated for three other awards, in the 2011 Game Developers Choice Online Awards.
