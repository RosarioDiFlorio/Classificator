"Late capitalism" is a term used by Marxists to refer to capitalism from about 1945 onwards, with the implication that it is a historically limited stage rather than a permanent one. This period includes the era termed the golden age of capitalism.
The American literary critic and cultural theorist Frederic Jameson considered Rudolf Hilferding's term latest capitalism (j√ºngster Kapitalismus) a more prudent and less prophetic-seeming one than late capitalism, although he repeatedly deployed the latter term in his writings. French philosopher Jacques Derrida favoured neo-capitalism over post- or late-capitalism.
