"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a slogan popular among Marxist-Leninist-Maoists. The quote came from Mao Zedong, as the final conclusive comments during the exigent meeting called by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China during August 1927, as a consequence of the collapse of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. By the means of the quote, Mao suggested to the cadres that in order to take the outright political control, the armed struggle is an absolute necessity.
