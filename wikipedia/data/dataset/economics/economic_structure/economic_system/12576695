WhizzGo is a United Kingdom car rental company that provides rental cars in more than 258 countries worldwide. The company started as a pay-by-the-hour service based in the United Kingdom. Since July 2017 it is restructured and is now providing car rental services by price comparing rates of most of the rent-a-car suppliers worldwide. Pay-by-the-hour cars were provided for an hourly price which included insurance, tax, fuel, maintenance and the Congestion Charge for London cars. In 2007, WhizzGo won Best Leasing/rental company of the year and Private Sector Fleet of the year in the GreenFleet awards.
On 28 August 2009, WhizzGo was acquired by City Car Club creating the UK's largest network of hourly rental cars. The WhizzGo name was dropped soon after.
