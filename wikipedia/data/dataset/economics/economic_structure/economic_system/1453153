Frontier: Elite II is a space trading and combat simulator video game written by David Braben and published by GameTek in 1993 and released on the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It is the first sequel to the seminal game Elite from 1984.
The game retains the same principal component of Elite, namely open-ended gameplay, and adds realistic physics and an accurately modelled galaxy.
Frontier: Elite II had a number of firsts to its name. It was the first game to feature procedurally generated star systems. These were generated by the game aggregating the mass of material within an early solar system into planets and moons that obey the laws of physics, but which have slightly randomised material distribution in order to ensure each systemâ€™s uniqueness.
It was followed by Frontier: First Encounters in 1995 and another sequel, Elite: Dangerous in 2014.
