Didi Dache (Chinese: 滴滴打车; literally: "Didi Taxi Calling") is a mobile platform taxi-calling application developed by Chinese mobile application company Beijing Xiaoju Keji Co., Ltd. The application is one of the major taxi apps in China, with over 100 million users in more than 300 cities. It was established in June 2012.
In February 2015, Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache announced they would merge to create one of the world’s largest smartphone-based transport service companies, worth around $6 billion. It was not clear whether the merger may have violated China anti-monopoly law.[1]
In December 2015, taxi drivers protested against Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. Both companies were forced to close their offices in the city of Luoyang.[2]
