Apa Khabar Orang Kampung (English title:Village People Radio Show) is a 2007 Malaysian documentary by Amir Muhammad. It was produced by Da Huang Pictures. Like its predecessor The Last Communist, it was banned in its home country but screened in several international film festivals. It premiered at the Berlinale in 2006.
The title (Malay: "How are the villagers doing?") is a reference to a famous song by Sudirman Arshad of the same name that is used in both the opening and closing credits.
