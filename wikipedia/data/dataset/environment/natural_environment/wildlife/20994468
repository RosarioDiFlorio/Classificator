Juan Varela (Madrid, Spain, 1950) is a biologist and Wildlife Artist. Born in Madrid where he studied Biology and obtained a master's degree with his studies on seabird behavior. Until 1980 he worked on seabird research in gull colonies off the African north coast. At the same time, he did scientific illustration for nature magazines and encyclopedias. He was the main illustrator of the Spanish well known nature film maker and writer Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente.
In 1986, Varela was appointed as Director of the Spanish Ornithological Society a post that he occupied until 1990 when he started to dedicate more time to art, eventually making of this a full-time job. He was co-founder of the Mediterranean seabird association that for many years contributed to the conservation of biodiversity of the Mediterranean basin. As an active Council member he participated in the organization of international symposium and congress in Spain, Italy and Tunisia.
In 1992 he started to cooperate with the Artist for Nature Foundation, a Dutch-based group involved in nature conservation through art, participating in several projects in different countries (i.e. Peru, Ecuador, Spain, Alaska, Portugal, Israel, etc.). He is the official representative of ANF in Spain. He has published 20 books, amongst them 2 identification field guides on birds and mammals and a students' manual on nature drawing. His paintings have been exhibited in galleries and museums of UK, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and USA, and his work was selected by the jury of the Birds in Art show (Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, Wausau, Wisconsin). Varela is considered by many one of the founders of the modern Wildlife Art in Spain and he has contributed to its development with his teaching. A great part of his paintings are produced on site, through direct observation of animals in their environment, but the studio work is also based on field sketches.
