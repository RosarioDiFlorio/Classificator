Wilderness (Previously Wildernress Reserve) is an area of restored natural lakes, parkland and woods situated in Suffolk's Yox Valley that flows into Minsmere nature reserve on the Heritage Coast. The estate is part of a recently implemented design in the nearby Blyth Valley by the landscape architect Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (1716â€“1783).
