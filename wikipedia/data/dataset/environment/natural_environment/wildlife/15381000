Bessie Bamber was a British artist from Birkenhead who was active between 1900 and 1910. It is not known if Bamber was her married name or maiden name.
Bessie Bamber worked in oils and specialised in painting cats, kittens and occasionally puppies. She usually painted on porcelain or opaline glass, and sometimes on a polished mahogany panel. She preferred to work using stuffed animals rather than live ones. There is no record of her exhibiting her paintings. A picture of three kittens with a pile of books was sold for Â£2,468 by Bonhams in 2004.
