New Zealand has a number of rare and endangered species and there have been cases of wildlife smuggling.
The Wildlife Enforcement Group, a group of three government departments, collectively investigate smuggling to and from New Zealand. The three agencies are the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Conservation.
New Zealand is a signatory to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) which was set up to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. CITES is administered by the Department of Conservation.
In 1997 over 600 Australian birds were being smuggled through New Zealand destined for Europe, the United States, and Japan.
