Nature's Great Events is a wildlife documentary series made for BBC television, first shown in the UK on BBC One and BBC HD in February 2009. The series looks at how seasonal changes powered by the sun cause shifting weather patterns and ocean currents, which in turn create the conditions for some of the planetâ€™s most spectacular wildlife events. Each episode focuses on the challenges and opportunities these changes present to a few key species.
Nature's Great Events was produced by the BBC Natural History Unit with the Discovery Channel and in association with Wanda Films. The British version of the series was narrated by David Attenborough. In United States, the series was shown under the alternative title Nature's Most Amazing Events beginning on 29 May 2009  and was narrated by Hasani Issa. In Australia, this program began airing on ABC1 each Sunday at 7:30pm from 14 June until 19 July 2009.
The title Nature's Great Events was previously used by Reader's Digest for an unrelated VHS series released in 1996.
