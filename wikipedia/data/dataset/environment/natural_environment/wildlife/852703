Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is a slow-growing (16- to 20-hour generation time) aerobic bacterium and the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle (known as bovine TB). It is related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis—the bacterium which causes tuberculosis in humans—M. bovis, and can jump the species barrier and cause tuberculosis in humans and other mammals.
