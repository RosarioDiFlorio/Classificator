Audubon is the flagship journal of the National Audubon Society. It is profusely illustrated and focuses on subjects related to nature, with a special emphasis on birds. New issues are published bi-monthly for society members. An active blog called The Perch produces daily updates on issues also. In 2011, Audubon Magazine received an Utne Reader Independent Press Award for Best Environment Coverage.
