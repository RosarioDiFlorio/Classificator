Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger or Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the (II) is the notname given to an artist or workshop to whom or which are attributed about 200 small still lifes likely dating to the late 16th and early 17th century. The artist's works rely on combinations of a limited number of motifs in rather simple to quite elaborate compositions. The motifs in the paintings are rendered in a rather naive and decorative manner. While the Flemish influence in the works hints at a Flemish artist or an artist who trained with a Flemish artist, the artist is believed to have been active in southern Europe, probably Italy.
