A wildlife biologist is someone who studies and/or manages wild animals and their habitats. Wildlife biology as an academic subject or profession is usually narrowly defined as applying to terrestrial vertebrates as the subject of study, however, a more general definition will often include the study and management of fish and other non-vertebrate wildlife. The similar term wildlife ecologist is often also used in reference to wildlife studies, and are often interchangeable in practice. Wildlife biologists may be distinguished from wildlife ecologists in their focus on the physiology, abundance, demographics, populations, and other management-oriented questions for a particular species (often but not always a "game" or sport-hunted species), whereas wildlife ecologists may use similar metrics, but may study communities of species and their interactions and relationships with biotic and abiotic factors in their environments for conservation purposes.
