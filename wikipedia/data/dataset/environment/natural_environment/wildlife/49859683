Emily Stackhouse (15 July 1811 â€“ 1 April 1870) was a 19th-century Cornish botanical artist and plant collector. She collected and painted flowers and mosses throughout the British isles, and her work was widely reproduced in a series of popular books issued by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Many of her watercolours show that she had collected and depicted specific plants years earlier than their accredited discovery in Cornwall, and it is now acknowledged that she collected and classified nearly all of the British mosses.
