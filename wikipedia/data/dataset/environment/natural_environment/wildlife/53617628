Fanny Elizabeth de Mole (1 March 1835- 26 December 1866) was a botanical artist who was born in London and migrated to South Australia in 1857. She was born in the residential rooms of Merchant Taylors Hall London, her father was John Bamber De Mole and her mother Isabel was the daughter of engineer Henry Maudslay.
She wrote and illustrated the first book on wildflowers in that state Wildflowers of South Australia in 1861.
In order to achieve colour quality which would not weaken through the printing process, lithographs of the illustrations were prepared in England by Paul Jerrard & Son and hand-coloured in Australia. The book contains 20 hand-coloured lithographed plates. The original edition of Wildflowers of South Australia is now quite difficult to obtain. In 2014 a copy of the book sold at Christie's for $3,750.
Five years after her book was published Fanny Elizabeth de Mole died from tuberculosis at Willunga, South Australia.
