Baptist approach to the subject and peculiar way of telling the story found international recognition. AFI Docs described the film as "an otherworldly and poetic look at the classic conflict of Man vs. Nature."  and Hot Docs wrote:"A village in the Netherlands is invaded by wild boar and its inhabitants must choose: eat or be eaten. A meticulously crafted folklore atmosphere beautifully captures the challenges we face when modern society conflicts with nature." In Switzerland, where the film won a Special Mention Award, Visions du Réel published: "An epic and eccentric film. The technique borrows from codes of fiction, and scenes follow one another in surrealistic style with a touch of joyful black humour". Canadian FERNTV published their Top 10 Films @ Hot Docs and wrote: "Downright dark and chilling at times like that of The Blair Witch Project."  Film review website Film Threat described the film as: "Darkly humorous... a marvelous small gem".  The Washington City Paper however criticised the film for "a possible allegorical connection to the Holocaust" and called the film "cold and unssetteling".
