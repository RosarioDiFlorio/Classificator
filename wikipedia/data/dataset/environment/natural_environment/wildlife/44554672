Tiger poaching in India has seriously impacted the probability of survival of tigers in India. About 3,000 wild tigers now survive compared with 100,000 at the turn of the 20th century. This abrupt decimation in population count was largely due to the slaughter of tigers by colonial and Indian elite, during the British Raj period, and indeed following India's independence. Most of those remaining, about 1,700, are India's Bengal tigers. Project Tiger in India had been hailed as a great success until it was discovered that the initial count of tigers have been seriously flawed.
Most of the tiger parts end up in China. where a single skin can sell for Rs. 6.5 million.
For poachers there has been about a four percent conviction rate.
