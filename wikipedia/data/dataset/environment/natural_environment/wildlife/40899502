The wildlife of Korea, a region encompassing North Korea and South Korea, belongs to the Palearctic ecozone. Native or endemic species of the Korean Peninsula include Korean hare, Korean water deer, Korean field mouse, Korean brown frog, Korean pine and Korean spruce. The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with its forest and natural wetlands is a unique biodiversity spot, which harbours eighty-two endangered species such as the red-crowned crane and the Amur leopard. Overall, DMZ is home to about 70 mammalian species, more than 300 birds and about 3,000 plants.
At the same time the populations of bears, lynxes, tigers, wolves, dholes and leopards, which once inhabited the Korean Peninsula, are presently very rare or extirpated, and likewise large ungulates (with the exceptions of roe deer, water deer and wild boar) are uncommon. The local wildlife sustained some damage during the Japanese occupation in 1910â€“1945 and subsequent Korean War, particularly due to overhunting of tigers.
