Andrew Jackson Grayson (1819–1869) was an American ornithologist and artist.
Grayson was the author of Birds of the Pacific Slope (1853–69), which he considered to be a completion of John James Audubon's Birds of America. Grayson was born August 20, 1819, in the northwest corner of Louisiana, on the Ouachita River, where his father had a cotton plantation. At his local school, the teachers were poorly trained, so later on, his father sent him to St. Mary's College in St. Louis, Missouri. There, they discouraged him from studying art.
