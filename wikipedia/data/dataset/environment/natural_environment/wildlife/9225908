Olive Muriel Pink (17 March 1884 â€“ 6 July 1975) was an Australian botanical illustrator, anthropologist, gardener, and activist for aboriginal rights.
Pink spent much of her life agitating and being a passionate advocate for improved rights and conditions for Australian aborigines. She never married, having lost a 'very dear friend' Captain Harold Southern who was killed at Gallipoli in 1915. In her later years, Pink concentrated on botanical pursuits and established the currently named Olive Pink Botanic Garden in Alice Springs.
