Hinterland Who's Who is best known as a series of 60-second public service announcements profiling Canadian animals, produced by Environment Canada Wildlife Service and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in the 1960s and 70s, and re-launched by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the 2000s. While the word "hinterland" refers to an area near a coast line or river bank, the series explores wildlife throughout Canada in general, regardless of location.
