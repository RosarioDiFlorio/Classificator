Walther Otto Müller (20 June 1833 – 17 July 1887 in Gera) was a German botanist, taxonomist and botanical illustrator, who produced botanical and anatomical drawing, lithography, chromolithography and hand-colouring. He collected and studied algae, bryophytes and fungi extensively in Germany and many of his specimens are housed at the British Museum.
