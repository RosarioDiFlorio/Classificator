Elizabeth Kirby (1823–1873) and Mary Kirby (later Mary Gregg, 1817–1893) were successful writers and illustrators of books for children and books on natural science. Mary Kirby is known particularly for leading the crowd-sourced Flora of Leicestershire and Elizabeth for her children's books. They both had a lifelong writing partnership that popularised science. Mary is thought to be the only British woman to publish a scientific study of the flora of her county in the nineteenth century.
