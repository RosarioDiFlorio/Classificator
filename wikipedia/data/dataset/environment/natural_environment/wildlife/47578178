Henri, Hendrik, or Henry Voordecker (15 August 1779, Brussels- 3 December 1861, Brussels) was a Belgian painter of genre scenes, especially of birds such as pigeons. By late in his career he was regarded as perhaps the most distinguished painter in Brussels, and was also successful in Britain.
He specialized in genre scenes from the beginning of his career, landscapes and animal scenes; in the latter genre predominately pigeons and poultry. Voordecker painted in the romantic style, at once charming and commercial. As Voordecker's art was in sympathy with the spirit of the age, his success with an audience of wealthy citizens was assured. King William I bought a panel by him in 1820.
Collections with his works include the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and the Belgian as well as the British Royal Collection. A scene with eight pigeons was given by Queen Victoria to her husband Albert, Prince Consort on his birthday in 1841.
