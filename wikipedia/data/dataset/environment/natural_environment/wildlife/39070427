William Markwick (1739 â€“ 6 April 1812), who took the name of William Eversfield, was a Fellow of the Linnaean Society and a keen naturalist, known for his pioneering phenological observations recorded in Gilbert White's 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne.
Many of his scientific writings remain unpublished, in some cases despite being submitted to the Linnaean Society.
