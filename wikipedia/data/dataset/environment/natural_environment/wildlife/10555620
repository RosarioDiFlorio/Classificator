Rough Sea at Dover (also known as Rough Seas at Dover, The Beach at Dover and Sea Waves at Dover) is an 1895 British short black-and-white silent documentary film directed and produced by Birt Acres and Robert W. Paul.
Paul and Acres shot the film in mid-1895, originally with the intention of showing it via kinetoscope. Projected, the film premiered on 14 January 1896 at the Royal Photographic Society in Hanover Street, London. This was the first public screening of a film in Britain and followed a month after the first such screening by the Lumi√®re Brothers in Paris. Following its successful screening in London the film was taken to the United States where it was shown on 23 April 1896 at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City with a series of American movies made by the Edison's company.
Despite its simple nature, Rough Sea at Dover became one of the most popular and widely screened early British films.
