Benedikt Kögl, otherwise Benno Kögl (12 March 1891, Greding – 29 April 1972, Munich) was a German painter. He was principally a miniaturist working in oil; his main subjects were still lifes and cats (from which he gained the nickname Katzen-Kögl or "Cat Kögl"). Some of his works were less than one inch square. He was a student of Hans von Hayek (1869-1940) and Philipp Röth (1841-1921).
His work is actively traded today in several galleries in the US and Germany.
