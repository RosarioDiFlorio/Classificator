Ernestine Panckoucke, née Désormeaux aka Anne-Ernestine Panckoucke (1784-1860), was a talented French botanical illustrator and flower painter, and considered one of Redouté's most gifted students.
She described herself as a 'translator of Goethe's poems, pupil of Redouté and designer of Chaumeton's "Flore Médicale"', published by her husband Charles Louis Fleury Panckoucke (1780-1844). She illustrated this work with Pierre Jean François Turpin (1775-1840). She is thought to have met Redouté at either the Château de Malmaison whilst a student under Prud'hon, or at Jean-Baptiste Isabey's studio while sitting for a portrait. Afterwards she regularly attended Redoute's classes at the Jardin des Plantes. Redouté had been commissioned by Empress Joséphine to depict the roses and lilies at Malmaison.
One of her works was sold at the Duc de Berry's 1834 sale.
