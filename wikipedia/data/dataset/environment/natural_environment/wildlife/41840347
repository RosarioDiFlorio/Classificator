Maureen Elizabeth Church (n√©e Griffiths) (16 January 1930 Swansea, Wales), was a Welsh-born botanist and skilled, self-trained botanical illustrator. Her preferred technique was that of line drawings and her work is in the permanent collections of the Forest Herbarium in Oxford, the East African Herbarium in Nairobi, the Herbarium at Kew, and the University of Edinburgh.
She was awarded a B.Sc. (Botany) by the University of Sheffield in 1952, after which she attended St Hilda's College, Oxford. 
The Daubeny Herbarium in Oxford was the herbarium of the former Department of Forestry. Miss Maureen Griffiths arrived there as Herbarium Assistant in 1952 and started work on her thesis, "The Taxonomy and Ecology of the African species of Terminalia", at the same time preparing the illustrations for this work. In 1957 she left to start a career in free-lance illustrating. 
Terminalia griffithsiana Liben was named in her honour.
