A Ramsar Site is a wetland site designated of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. 
The Convention on Wetlands, known as the Ramsar Convention, is an intergovernmental environmental treaty established in 1971 by UNESCO, and coming into force in 1975. It provides for national action and international cooperation regarding the conservation of wetlands, and wise sustainable use of their resources. 
Ramsar identifies wetlands of international importance, especially those providing waterfowl habitat.
In 2016 there are 2,231 Ramsar Sites, protecting 214,936,005 hectares (531,118,440 acres). 169 national governments are currently participating.
