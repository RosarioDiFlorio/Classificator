The National Parks Project is a Canadian music and film project. Released in 2011 to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the National Parks of Canada system, the project sent three Canadian musicians and a filmmaker to each of 13 Canadian national parks, one in each province and territory, to create and score a short documentary film about the park.
The project was commissioned by Parks Canada and produced by FilmCAN and Primitive Entertainment, in association with Discovery World HD. In addition to airing on Discovery World and on the web, the series was also screened at a number of film festivals, including Toronto's Hot Docs.
