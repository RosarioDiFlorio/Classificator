Edward William Minchen/Minchin (25 June 1852 â€“ 1913) was an Australian botanical artist.
Minchen was born in Middle Swan, Perth, Western Australia, the son of James Minchen and Elizabeth Fisher, and had a fairly checkered career pursuing jobs at sea, trades, an attempt at the stage and the National Art Gallery. He ended up working as a lithographer in New South Wales for the Lands Department, the Survey Office and the Government Printer. He often collaborated with Henry Baron (1863-?), a lithographic artist who joined the Government Printer in 1891.
