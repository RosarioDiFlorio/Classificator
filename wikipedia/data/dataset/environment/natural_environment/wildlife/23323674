Western Plains Animal Refuge is a non-profit, no-kill shelter and wildlife rehabilitation center located in Hays, Kansas.
It was incorporated in 2006 by Jessica Braun, DVM, and Curt Braun after changes in Kansas wildlife rehabilitation requirements resulted in tougher requirements for wildlife rehabilitators in the state to operate. As a result, an estimated 75% of the available rehabilitators were forced to close their doors. At the same time, euthanasia rates for domestic animals in regional shelters were not improving, so it was the vision of the Brauns to provide a safe haven for injured, abandoned and suffering animals.
Western Plains Animal Refuge is dedicated to the treatment, adoption and training of domestic animals, and rehabilitation and release of wild animals. Dr. Jessica Braun is the primary veterinarian overseeing the shelter. Veterinary staff from the Animal Health Center of Hays  also donate their time to care for the animals, and to socialize animals available for adoption.
