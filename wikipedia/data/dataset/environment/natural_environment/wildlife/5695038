Gertrude Hartland (1865â€“1954), was an Irish illustrator.
She was born in Cork, the daughter of Richard Hartland and Mary Walsh. She was the niece of artist Henry Albert Hartland. She married Stephen Jackson.
Hartland painted flowers, mainly daffodils. Her uncle, William Baylor Hartland, was a well-known plantsman who specialised in daffodils. He produced a unique catalogue, the Special Jubilee Catalogue, and for the 1897 edition it used her engraved portraits of daffodils. The engraving was done by W.J. Welch. She had a deep love for the countryside.
Gertrude Hartland was also a very accomplished landscape painter, especially the Wicklow mountains.
