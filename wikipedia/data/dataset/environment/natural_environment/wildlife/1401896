Elizabeth Taylor (January 8, 1856 - March, 1932) was an American artist, journalist, botanist and traveller. Her travel essays from Alaska, Canada, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Norway were published in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, Atlantic Monthly, Forest and Stream and others. Some of her essays are published in The Far Islands and Other Cold Places (ISBN 1-880654-11-3).
During World War I she was marooned at Ei√∞i in the Faroe Islands, where she was a probable influence on Faroese painting pioneer Niels Kruse. She died at her cottage Wake Robin in Vermont, in 1932.
