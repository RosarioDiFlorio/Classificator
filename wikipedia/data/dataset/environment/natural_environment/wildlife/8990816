Rudolph Franz Zallinger (November 12, 1919 â€“ August 1, 1995) was an American-based Austrian-Russian artist notable for his mural The Age of Reptiles (1947) at Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History. His painting of Tyrannosaurus heavily influenced the creature design of Toho Studios' Godzilla (1954). Two of Zallinger's dinosaurs, T. rex and Brontosaurus, are seen in the film as part of a slide demonstration during a lecture in the National Diet Building. A third slide showing Zallinger's Stegosaurus was planned but eventually not used in the film.
