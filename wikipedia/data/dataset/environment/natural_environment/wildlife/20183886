Titans of the Deep is a 1938 film inspired by the early 1930s deep sea dives made by William Beebe and Otis Barton. Beebe and Barton were the first to set ocean depth records in a device invented by Barton. The film was written by Les Adams. It was somewhat intended as a documentary but was often sold and advertised as an exploitation/horror picture.
