The November 2009 nor'easter (also referred to as "Nor'Ida") was a powerful autumn nor'easter that caused widespread damage throughout the east coast of the United States. This extratropical cyclone formed in relation to Hurricane Ida's mid-level circulation across southeastern Georgia and moved east-northeast offshore North Carolina before slowly dropping south and southeast over the succeeding several days.
