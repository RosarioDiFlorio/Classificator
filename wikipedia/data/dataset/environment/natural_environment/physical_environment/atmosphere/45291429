Boruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ボルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Boruto), originally spelled by Viz Media as "Bolt", is a fictional character created by manga author Masashi Kishimoto who first appears in the finale of the manga series Naruto as the son of the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga. He later appears as a significant role in the 2015 anime film Boruto: Naruto the Movie where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the Boruto film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates Sarada Uchiha, Mitsuki, and his teacher Konohamaru Sarutobi.
Despite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last: Naruto the Movie and by Yūko Sanpei in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by Maile Flanagan in The Last and by Amanda C. Miller in all subsequent appearances.
Boruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the Naruto manga. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions.
