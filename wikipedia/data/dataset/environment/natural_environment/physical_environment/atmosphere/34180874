The Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) is a global numerical weather prediction computer model run by the United States Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center. This mathematical model was run four times a day and produced weather forecasts. The NOGAPS was replaced by the NAVGEM in February 2013.
