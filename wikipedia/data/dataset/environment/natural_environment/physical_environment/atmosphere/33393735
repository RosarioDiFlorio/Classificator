The 1835 New Brunswick, New Jersey, tornado was the deadliest recorded in New Jersey history. It struck what is now part of downtown New Brunswick, along a path that stretched through or near what is now Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital property, rambled towards the site of Monument Square, and went downhill to the river from there, after wreaking havoc on George Street. The twister then destroyed all but two of the twelve houses in Piscataway, New Jersey.
