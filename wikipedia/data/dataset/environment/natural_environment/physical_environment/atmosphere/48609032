A snow dance is a ritual that is performed with the hopes of bringing snow in the winter months. This ritual is often performed with the goal of avoiding school, work the next day, or a visit from the in-laws. Specific Snow Dance rituals vary from person to person, but commonly include sleeping with silverware under one's pillow, throwing ice cubes out of a window, or walking backwards to bed. Considered by many to be an urban legend, the Snow Dance is often referred to in jest.
