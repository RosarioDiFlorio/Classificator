TAM Airlines Flight 3054 (JJ3054/TAM3054) was an Airbus A320-233, registration PR-MBK, on a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Porto Alegre to São Paulo, Brazil. On July 17, 2007, the Airbus A320 overran runway 35L at São Paulo during moderate rain and crashed into a nearby TAM Express warehouse adjacent to a Shell filling station. All 187 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus A320 died, along with 12 people on the ground. It surpassed Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 as the deadliest air disaster in Brazilian territory, and remains the deadliest aviation accident involving an Airbus A320 proper worldwide. It was also the deadliest accident involving an aircraft of the A320 family at the time, which was later surpassed by the bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268, an A321-231, which crashed in Egypt in October 2015 with 224 fatalities.
The accident was investigated by the Brazilian Air Force's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Portuguese: Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos (CENIPA)), with a final report issued in September 2009. CENIPA concluded that the accident was caused by errors committed by the pilots on the flight to São Paulo.
