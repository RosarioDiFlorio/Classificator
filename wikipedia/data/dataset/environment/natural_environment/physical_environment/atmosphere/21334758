Monga is a Bengali term referring to the yearly cyclical phenomenon of poverty and hunger in Bangladesh. It is also called "mora Kartik," which means "months of death and disaster." It refers to two times per year, from September–November (after the aman crop is planted) and from March–April (after the boro crop is planted). These natural phenomena lead to fewer available job opportunities for rural workers, resulting in the workers becoming migrant and moving to towns. Those who cannot migrate can face malnutrition and starvation. The public awareness of Monga has risen with media focus in the 2000s. It was cited in Bangladesh’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and has been the subject of NGO aid programs. Nilphamari, Rangpur, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram and Gaibandha are the monga-affected districts.
