The heat wave dubbed Lucifer                                    or Jolanda (by the Deutscher Wetterdienst) was an extreme heat wave that affected Southern Europe in 2017. It started at the end of July, and lasted till the fifth of August, before conditions gradually began to cool down again. Some countries that were affected included Italy, France, Croatia, Spain, Greece and Turkey. Those countries experienced temperatures of 40 째C (104 째F) or more, killing at least five people in the process. The remainder of August was very warm, with temperatures around 30 째C (86 째F), but not dangerously hot as it had been earlier on in the month.
