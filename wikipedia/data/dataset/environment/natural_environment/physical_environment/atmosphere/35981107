The molecular-scale temperature is the defining property of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962. It is defined by the relationship:

  
    
      
        
          T
          
            m
          
        
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          
            
              M
              
                0
              
            
            
              M
              (
              z
              )
            
          
        
        â‹…
        
          T
          (
          z
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{m}(z)={\frac {M_{0}}{M(z)}}\cdot {T(z)}}
  
Tm(z) is molecular-scale temperature at altitude z;
M0 is molecular weight of air at sea level;
M(z) is molecular weight of air at altitude z;
T(z) is absolute temperature at altitude z.
