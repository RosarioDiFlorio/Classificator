Black Saturday was a particularly dark, stormy Saturday in Scotland, on 4 August 1621. Many regarded the foul weather as a judgment of Heaven against Acts then passed in the Scots Parliament tending to establish Episcopacy.
Many suicides were recorded on this day, as some saw the foul weather as a preparatory for Armageddon.
