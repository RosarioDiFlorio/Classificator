The flood pulse concept is a theory that the annual flood pulse is the most important aspect and the most biologically productive feature of a river's ecosystem. It contrasts with previous ecological theories which considered floods to be catastrophic events.
The flood pulse concept describes the movement, distribution and quality of water in river ecosystems and the dynamic interaction in the transition zone between water and land.
