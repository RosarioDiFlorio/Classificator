Sabena OO-AUB was a Junkers Ju 52 airliner owned by Belgian airline Sabena, operating as a scheduled international passenger flight from Cologne, Germany, to London, England, which crashed near Ostend, Belgium, on 16 November 1937. The flight was scheduled to stop at Brussels, but bad weather forced the pilot to continue to Ostend. Conditions were little better at Ostend, and the aircraft hit a factory chimney while circling to land at Stene Airport.
