Here is a list of the hottest and coldest temperature recorded in Spain.
On July 30, 1876 and August 4, 1881, temperatures of 51 °C (124 °F) and 50 °C (122 °F) were both reported for Seville: these readings are unreliable, since they were measured under a standard exposure and in poor technical conditions. A temperature of 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) was also recorded at Cazalla de la Sierra on August 30, 1926, but is generally not considered valid by international standards, along with other unofficial readings measured in various locations, likely taken with not proper instruments. On July 17, 1978, an unconfirmed temperature of 47.5 °C (117.5 °F) was recorded at Barranco de Masca, Tenerife.
*This is the highest reliable and confirmed temperature for Murcia and Spain overall. A dubious reading of 118 °F (47.8 °C) was reported for Murcia on July 29, 1876.
