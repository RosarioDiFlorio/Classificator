Convective storm detection is the meteorological observation of deep, moist convection (DMC) and consists of detection, monitoring, and short-term prediction. Convective storms can produce tornadoes as well as large hail, strong winds, and heavy rain leading to flash flooding. The detection of convective storms relies on direct eyewitness observations, for example from storm spotters; and on remote sensing, especially weather radar. Some in situ measurements are used for direct detection as well, notably, wind speed reports from surface observation stations. It is part of the integrated warning system, consisting of prediction, detection, and dissemination of information on severe weather to users such as emergency management, storm spotters and chasers, the media, and the general public.
