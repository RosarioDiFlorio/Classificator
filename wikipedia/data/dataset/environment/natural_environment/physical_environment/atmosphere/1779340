In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Thor (Thorleif Golmen) is a fictional superhero based on the Marvel Universe version of Thor. Thor is the Asgardian God of Thunder based on the deity of the same name of Norse mythology and a founding member of the Ultimates.
Thor was adapted from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic book version of Thor by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch, first appearing in The Ultimates. "Ultimate Thor" is the alter-ego of Thorleif Golmen, an anarchist who discovered he is the reincarnated form of the Norse warrior Thor. The "Ultimate" redesign of the character reduces the number of Thor's powers, and reduces the character's reliance upon his hammer, Mjolnir, as a source of power. Perhaps most significantly, the Thunder God's long-established personality is drastically altered, changing him from an eager and willing divine combatant into an ecocentric, arguably unstable, and somewhat reluctant warrior.
