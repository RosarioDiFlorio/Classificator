Lake breakout is a geological term that refers to the collapse of a (usually high-altitude) lake. High-altitude lakes tend to form in volcanic craters – where they are called crater lakes – or in valleys dammed as the result of earthquakes or glacial or volcanic deposition. Lake breakouts are most common a few weeks or months after a volcanic eruption as a river becomes blocked by volcanic debris.
