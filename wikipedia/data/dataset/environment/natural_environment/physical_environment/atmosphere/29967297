Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 644 refers to a Douglas DC-6, registration LV-ADW, that on 19 July 1961 was due to operate a domestic scheduled passenger service between Ministro Pistarini International Airport and General Enrique Mosconi International Airport, but crashed 12 km (7.5 mi) west of Pardo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, half an hour after takeoff, owing to severe turbulence during climb out. This aircraft had been originally named 'Presidente Peron' but by 1956-57 had been re-named 'General San Martin'.  Some reports stated the aircraft was struck by lightning.
According to the investigation, the plane disintegrated en route after the rupture of one its wings following excessive loads in a zone of turbulence. Both the pilot and the company's flight dispatcher contributed to the disaster by misevaluating the weather forecast and choosing an inappropriate flight altitude. All 67 occupants of the aircraft – 7 crew and 60 passengers – were killed in the accident, which remains the deadliest one the company experienced all through its history.
Flight 644 is the deadliest aviation disaster in Argentine history.
