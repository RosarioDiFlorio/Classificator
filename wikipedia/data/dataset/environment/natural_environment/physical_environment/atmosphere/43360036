The regional snowfall index (RSI) is a system used by the NOAA to assess the societal impact of winter storms in the six easternmost regions of the United States. The system is a replacement for the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) system which the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) began using in 2005. The NCDC has retroactively assigned RSI values to over 500 historical storms since 1900.
The index makes use of population and regional differences to assess the impact of snowfall. For example, areas which receive very little snowfall on average may be more adversely affected than other regions, and so the index will grant storms in those regions higher severity.
