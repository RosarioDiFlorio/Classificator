On 31 October 2000, at 23:17 Taipei local time (15:17 UTC), the Boeing 747-412 operating the flight attempted to take off from the wrong runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport during a typhoon. The aircraft crashed into construction equipment on the runway, killing 83 of the 179 occupants aboard. As of 2014, the accident is the third-deadliest on Taiwanese soil. It is also the first and only Singapore Airlines crash to result in fatalities.
