The Great Red Spot is a persistent zone of high pressure, producing an anticyclonic storm on the planet Jupiter, 22Â° south of the equator. It has been continuously observed for 187 years, since 1830. Earlier observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 350 years. Storms such as this are not uncommon within the turbulent atmospheres of gas giants.
