Paternian or Paternianus (Italian: San Paterniano) is the name of an Italian saint. There are two figures, Paternian of Bologna and Paternian of Fermo, who are considered to be the same person. The first was bishop of Bologna from around 450 to 470. The second was a native of Fermo who escaped to the mountains during the persecutions of Christians by Diocletian. He then became bishop of Fano after being appointed to this position by Pope Sylvester I.
Historical details about Paternian are scarce. The Vita Sancti Paterniani can be found in a codex of the 12th century, though it dates earlier, and was written by a monk of the 10th or 11th century. But it is legendary and not reliable.
According to an ancient tradition, Paterniano was born at Fano around 275 AD. An angel told him in a vision to escape this city and hide out in a deserted place near the Metauro River. He became a hermit and the abbot of a monastery. Later, when the persecution of Christians stopped, the citizens of Fano demanded that he become their bishop. Paternian governed the city for many years. He died on November 13, around 360 AD. Miracles were reported at his tomb and his cult spread rapidly.
