A muddy flood is produced by an accumulation of run-off over agricultural land . Sediments are picked up by the run-off and carried as suspended matter or bed-load. Muddy floods are typically a hill-slope process, and should not be confused with mudflows produced by mass movements.
Muddy floods can damage the road infrastructure and may deposit layers of mud blanket and may also clog sewers and damage private property.
It has been referred to 'muddy floods' since the 1980s. A similar designation appeared in French ('inondations boueuses') during the same period.
