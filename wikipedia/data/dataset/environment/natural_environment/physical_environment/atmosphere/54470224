3D NowCasting refers to an experimental technology of nowcasting that uses a rapid phased-array radar to predict precipitation several minutes in advance. The phased-array radar takes a scan of the sky in anywhere from 10-30 seconds, viewing 100 vertical levels in a range of 60km. and in this way, provides inputs every 30 seconds. It breaks the sky into several "layers" and uses a new algorithm for forecasting very quickly. The models use the K computer, requiring a large amount of observational data, and a large amount of computational power. The radar produces 100 times more data than the conventional parabolic antenna radar.
