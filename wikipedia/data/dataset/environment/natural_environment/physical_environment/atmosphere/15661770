Seven Sleepers' Day (German: Siebenschl√§fertag) on June 27 is a feast day commemorating the legend of the Seven Sleepers as well as one of the most well-known bits of traditional weather lore (expressed as a proverb) remaining in German-speaking Europe. The atmospheric conditions on that day are supposed to determine or predict the average summer weather of the next seven weeks.
