The 4.2 kiloyear BP aridification event was one of the most severe climatic events of the Holocene period. Starting in about 2200 BC, it probably lasted the entire 22nd century BC. It has been hypothesised to have caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, and the Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze River area. The drought may also have initiated the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization, and southeastward habitat tracking of its population, as well as the migration of Indo-European speaking people into India.
