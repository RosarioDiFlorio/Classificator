Delta Air Lines Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled Delta Air Lines domestic service from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Los Angeles, via Dallas that crashed on August 2, 1985, at 18:05 (UTCâˆ’05:00). The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar operating this flight encountered a microburst while on approach to land on runway 17L (now marked 17C) at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The pilots were unable to escape the weather event and the aircraft struck the ground over a mile short of the runway. The flight hit a car driving north of the airport and two water tanks, disintegrating. The crash killed 136 people on board, including 128 of the 152 passengers and 8 of the 11 crew, and the driver of the car. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash resulted from the flight crew's decision to fly through a thunderstorm, the lack of procedures and training to avoid or escape microbursts, and the lack of hazard information on wind shear.
