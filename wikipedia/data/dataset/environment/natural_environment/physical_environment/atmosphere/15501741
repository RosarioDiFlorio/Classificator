Mango showers, or ‘mango rains’, is a colloquial term to describe the occurrence of pre-monsoon rainfall. Sometimes these rains are referred to generically as ‘April rains’ or ‘Summer showers’. They are notable across much of South and Southeast Asia, including India, and Cambodia. In southern Asia, these rains greatly influence human activities because the control the rains have on crops that are culturally significant like mangoes and coffee.
These rains normally occur from March to April, although their arrival is often difficult to predict. Their intensity can range from light showers to heavy and persistent thunderstorms. In India, the mango showers occurs as the result of thunderstorm development over the Bay of Bengal.They are also known as 'Kalbaishakhi' in Bengal, as Bordoisila in Assam and as Cherry Blossom shower or Coffee Shower in Kerala.
Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common, especially in Kerala, Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu in India. They help in the early ripening of mangoes, thus often referred to as 'mango showers'.
