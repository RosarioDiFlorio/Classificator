The anti-greenhouse effect is a mechanism similar to the greenhouse effect, but with the opposite consequence of cooling the surface temperature of a planet. If gases in the atmosphere of a planet have a lesser transmittance for inbound radiation (for instance, solar rays in the Solar System) than for outbound radiation (typically thermal radiation of the planet's surface in the infrared domain), the surface temperature at which inbound and outbound heat fluxes are at equilibrium is lower.
