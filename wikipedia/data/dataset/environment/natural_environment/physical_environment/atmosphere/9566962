The Tornado Intercept Vehicle 1 (TIV 1) and Tornado Intercept Vehicle 2 (TIV 2) are vehicles used to film with an IMAX camera from very close proximity to or within a tornado. They were designed by film director Sean Casey. On May 27, 2013 the TIV2 filmed the inside of a tornado in Kansas with Casey inside.
