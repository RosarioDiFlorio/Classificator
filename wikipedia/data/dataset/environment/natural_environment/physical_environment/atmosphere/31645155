A slush flow is a type of snow avalanche that occurs when the snow pack becomes saturated with water. They most commonly occur at higher latitudes in the spring. Because of their high water content they can flow down gentle slopes of only a few degrees. They are a significant hazard in Norway and Iceland and are responsible for the deaths of dozens of people as well as the destruction of buildings and the closure of roads.
