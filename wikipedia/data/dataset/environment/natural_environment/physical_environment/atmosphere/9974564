Linjeflyg Flight 277 was a controlled flight into terrain by a Convair 440-75 Metropolitan on 20 November 1964 at 21:14 in Ängelholm, Skåne, Sweden. The Linjeflyg pilots, misled by a non-conventional military runway light configuration, descended too early and on a faulty course during approach to Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport. The crash killed 31 of 43 people on board, making it the deadliest aviation accident in Sweden.
The flight was en route from Stockholm to Ängelholm, but bad weather caused it to skip stopovers at Hultsfred and Halmstad. There was less than 2.0 kilometers (1.2 mi) visibility and a low cloud base at Ängelholm, so air traffic control lit its approach lighting system. As the civilian sector at Swedish Air Force base F 10 Ängelholm, the airport had a military configuration and did not follow normal civilian configuration. This caused a pilot error in the navigation and the aircraft landed 2.0 kilometers (1.2 mi) before the runway threshold. The aircraft inverted while sliding after impact. Despite the death toll, three people walked uninjured from the crash.
The investigation commission found no fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure military airports in line with civilian regulations. The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused military airports to change their instrument landing system and approach lighting system to meet civilian requirements.
