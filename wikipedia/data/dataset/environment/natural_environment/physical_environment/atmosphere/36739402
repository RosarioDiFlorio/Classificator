A Satellite Cloud Image is an image based on data from meteorological satellite instruments. It captures the distribution of clouds in the atmosphere, to find the weather system and verify the correctness of surface weather maps that have been drawn. It can also be used with observations of sea ice distribution to determine the sea surface temperature and the medium-and long-term weather forecast oceanographic data.
This technology can be a single image to show a variety of scales of weather phenomena to provide a very useful remote sensing data, weather analysis and forecasting. In general, the satellite cloud can be divided into the Infra-red satellite, visible satellite cloud images and color enhancement of satellite cloud.
