This is a list of the wettest tropical cyclones, listing all tropical cyclones known to have dropped at least 1,270 millimetres (50 in) of precipitation on a single location. Data is most complete for Australia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico, Yap, Chuuk, and the United States, with fragmentary data available for other countries. The French region of RÃ©union holds several world records for tropical cyclone and worldwide rainfall due to rough topography of the island and its proximity to the Indian Ocean.
