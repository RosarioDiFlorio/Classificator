The Siberian orange snow of 2007 was an anomalous phenomenon that occurred in early February, 2007. Beginning on Wednesday, January 31st, 2007 an orange-tinted snow fell across an area of 1,500 square kilometres (580 sq mi) in Omsk Oblast, Siberian Federal District, Russia, approximately 1,400 miles from Moscow, as well as into the neighboring Oblasts of Tomsk and Tyumen. It was unclear what caused the orange snow. Speculation ranged from pollutants to a storm in neighboring Kazakhstan.
