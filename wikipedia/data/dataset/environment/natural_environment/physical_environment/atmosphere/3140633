TACA Flight 110 was an international scheduled airline flight operated by TACA Airlines, traveling from Belize to New Orleans. On May 24, 1988, the Boeing 737-300 lost power in both engines, but its pilots made a successful deadstick landing on a grass levee, with no one aboard sustaining more than minor injuries. Earlier in his career, the Captain of the flight, Carlos Dardano of El Salvador, had lost one eye to crossfire on a short flight to El Salvador, which was undergoing a civil war at the time.
