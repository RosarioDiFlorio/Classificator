A convergence zone in meteorology is a region in the atmosphere where two prevailing flows meet and interact, usually resulting in distinctive weather conditions. This causes a mass accumulation that eventually leads to a vertical movement and to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Large-scale convergence, called synoptic-scale convergence, provides weather systems such as baroclinic troughs, low-pressure areas, and cyclones. Small-scale convergence will give phenomena from isolated cumulus clouds to large areas of thunderstorms.
The inverse of a convergence is a divergence.
