The 1984 Balkan Bulgarian Tupolev Tu-134 crash occurred on 10 January 1984 when a Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Tupolev Tu-134 airliner crashed on an international flight from Berlin Schönefeld Airport in Schönefeld, East Germany, to Sofia Airport in Sofia, Bulgaria. All fifty on board were killed.
While on approach to Sofia Airport in heavy snow, the crew failed to make visual contact with the ground as they descended below decision altitude. The crew attempted to overshoot for an altitude of 80 to 100 meters (260 to 330 ft), but the aircraft hit a power line and crashed 4 km (2.5 mi) from the runway into a forest. The aircraft was destroyed with no survivors.
