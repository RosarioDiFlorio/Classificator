The standard measuring conditions for temperature are in the air, 1.5 meters above the ground, and shielded from direct sunlight. The highest confirmed temperature on Earth recorded according to these measures was 54 °C (129 °F) recorded in Mitribah, Kuwait, on 21 July 2016.
Aside from these confirmed records of 54 °C (129 °F), there are reports that Furnace Creek Ranch, California, located in the Death Valley desert in the United States, might have registered 56.7 °C (134.1 °F) on July 10, 1913 - what some weather experts today refute as a measurement error.
At 41.80 °C (107.24 °F), July 2017 in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, was the hottest single month (average monthly temperature) ever reliably measured anywhere on Earth since records began in 1911.
The former highest official temperature on Earth was in fact 57.8 °C (136 °F), registered on 13 September 1922, in ‘Aziziya, Libya, which was nonetheless de-certified by the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) in January 2012 after holding for 90 years the record for the world's highest surface temperature - the temperature is currently considered to have been a recorder's error.
Christopher C. Burt, the weather historian writing for Weather Underground who shepherded the Libya reading's 2012 disqualification, believes that also the 1913 Death Valley reading is "a myth", and is at least four or five degrees Fahrenheit too high, as do other weather historians Dr. Arnold Court and William Taylor Reid. Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth is still at Death Valley, but is instead 54.0 °C (129.2 °F), recorded both in Death Valley, California on 20 June 2013, and in Mitribah, Kuwait on 21 July 2016.
Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 °C. A ground temperature of 84 °C (183.2 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan, Sudan. A ground temperature of 93.9 °C (201 °F) was recorded also in Furnace Creek Ranch on 15 July 1972; this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded. The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 °C for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.
Temperature measurements via satellite also tend to capture occurrence of higher records but are considered less reliable than ground-positioned thermometers. There is a satellite record of 66.8 °C (152.2 °F) measured in the Flaming Mountains of China in 2008. Other satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.
