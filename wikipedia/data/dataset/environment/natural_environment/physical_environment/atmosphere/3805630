A weather war, sometimes called TV radar war or Doppler war, is a kind of sensationalist journalism primarily concerning weather news. The "war" is typified by competing local TV news stations engaging in technological one-upmanship to increase viewership.
The conflict has included attack ads, notably when WTWO, a television station in Terre Haute, Indiana, attacked WTHI-TV's coverage by name by claiming that WTHI's Doppler weather radar and staff were inferior to WTWO's. A similar ad by KWTV in Oklahoma City was satirized by The Daily Show.
