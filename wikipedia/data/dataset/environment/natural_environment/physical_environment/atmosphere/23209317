A warm core ring is a type of mesoscale eddy which breaks off from an ocean current, e.g. the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current. The ring is an independent circulatory system of warm water which can persist for several months. The rest of this article will use the Gulf Stream by way of an example but these mesoscale eddies also form in most powerful ocean currents, such as the Kuroshio or Agulhas currents.
Such rings can be detected using infrared satellites or sea height anomalies and are easily identifiable against the surrounding colder waters. These systems will drift west from their origin at the Gulf Stream until they break apart on the coastal shelf or are reabsorbed by the Gulf Stream.
This type of system is theorized to have helped develop several hurricanes, most notably Hurricane Katrina, into significantly stronger storms due to the abundance of warmer ocean water reaching down to a significant depth. In addition, these eddies can damage offshore drilling equipment due to their currents.
Warm core rings are also known for affecting wildlife, bringing warm-water creatures to unusual areas.
