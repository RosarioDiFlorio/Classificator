A relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) is an avalanche growth of a population of relativistic electrons driven through a material (typically air) by an electric field. RREA has been hypothesized to be related to lightning initiation, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, sprite lightning, and to spark development. RREA is unique as it can occur at electric fields an order of magnitude lower than the dielectric strength of the material.
