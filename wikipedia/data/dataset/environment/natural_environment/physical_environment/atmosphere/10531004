Lloró is a municipality and town in the Chocó Department, Colombia. It claims the second world record for highest average annual precipitation with 12,717 mm (501 in), after López de Micay, which holds the record with 12,892.4 mm (508 in). The rainfall data was measured in its Agricultural Farm, managed by the University of Bogotá, between 1952 and 1989. If accurate, that would make it the wettest place in the world. The town is named for Gioró, a pre-Columbian indigenous chief.
An 1853 watercolor by Manuel María Paz portrays two men in straw hats with a female vendor at a liquor stand in Lloró.
