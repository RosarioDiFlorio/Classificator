Lamar Seeligson Smith (born November 19, 1947) is an American politician in the Republican Party who has served in the United States House of Representatives for Texas's 21st congressional district since 1987. The district includes most of the wealthier sections of San Antonio and Austin, as well as some of the Texas Hill Country. He sponsored the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act (PCIP). He also co-sponsored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.
As the Head of the House Science Committee, Smith has been criticized for promoting climate change denial, baselessly attacking scientific outlets and researchers, and receiving funding from oil and gas companies. He was formerly a contributor to Breitbart News.
In November 2017, Smith announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in 2018.
