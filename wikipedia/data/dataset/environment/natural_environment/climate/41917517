Pattern Recognition in Physics was an open-access journal originally published by Copernicus Publications which was established in March 2013 and terminated in January 2014. The editors-in-chief were Sid-Ali Ouadfeul (Algerian Petroleum Institute) and Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, the latter of whom is a well-known global warming skeptic. Copernicus ceased its publication due to concerns over the publications views towards the scientific consensus of global climate change and the method of peer review. In March 2014 Ouadfeul reopened the journal, "run on private founding" [sic]
