The United States Chamber of Commerce (USCC) is a business-oriented American lobbying group. It is not an agency of the United States government.
Politically, the Chamber usually supports Republican political candidates, though it has occasionally supported conservative Democrats. The Chamber is the largest lobbying group in the U.S., spending more money than any other lobbying organization on a yearly basis.
