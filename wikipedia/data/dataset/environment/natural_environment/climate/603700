David Hillel Gelernter (born March 5, 1955) is an American artist, writer, and professor of computer science at Yale University. He is a former national fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and senior fellow in Jewish thought at the Shalem Center, and sat on the National Endowment for the Arts. He publishes widely; his work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Los Angeles Times, The Weekly Standard, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and elsewhere. His paintings have been exhibited in New Haven and Manhattan.
He is known for contributions to parallel computation and for books on topics including computed worlds (Mirror Worlds), and what he sees as the destructive influence of liberal academia on American society, expressed in his book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats).
In 1993 he was sent a mail bomb by Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, which almost killed him and left him with some permanent disabilities: he lost the use of his right hand and his right eye was permanently damaged.
Time Magazine profiled Gelernter in 2016, describing him as an "arch-genius." The Washington Post, profiling him in early 2017 as a potential science advisor to Donald Trump, called him "fiercely anti-intellectual ... a vehement critic of modern academia" and quoted Gelernter's book America-Lite as blaming an increasing "Jewish presence at top colleges" for what he sees as a decline in American culture. The Post also points to Gelernter's writings in America-Lite as evidence that he does not believe in global warming.
