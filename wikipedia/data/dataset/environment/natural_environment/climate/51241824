Malcolm Ieuan Roberts (born 3 May 1955 in India) is an Australian politician, a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party and formerly a member of the Australian Senate, representing Queensland.
He was elected to the Senate at the federal election of 2 July 2016. However, he was included in the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis with suggestions that he might be a foreign citizen (of the UK and possibly of India) and therefore ineligible to be elected to the Australian parliament: section 44(i) of the federal Constitution. On 22 September 2017, the High Court, as the Court of Disputed Returns, reported its findings from investigations the previous day. It found that he had sent emails to "no one at all" to clarify his dual citizenship issues before his election as a Senator, and had not renounced his British citizenship until December 2016. On 27 October 2017 the Full High Court of Australia (as the Full Court of Disputed Returns) ruled him ineligible to have been elected, having been a British citizen.
After being disqualified as a federal Senator, Roberts became an unsuccessful candidate for the electoral district of Ipswich in the Queensland state election, 2017.
