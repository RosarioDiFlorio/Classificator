Klausism is a term used to describe the political positions of Václav Klaus, former Prime Minister and President of the Czech Republic. It was first used by Mirek Topolánek, who considers Klausism the official ideology of the Civic Democratic Party. This term was also used by Jan Kasl. Klaus does not take issue with the term. The current usage of the term Klausism is distant from its origin, which engendered the phrase "Klausism without Klaus". Though Klausism primarily refers to the political ideology, it is frequently used as a label for the neologisms invented by Klaus.
Klaus himself used term "Mental Scheme of ODS" which he allegedly invented by chance. This term was also used by Jan Kasl.
