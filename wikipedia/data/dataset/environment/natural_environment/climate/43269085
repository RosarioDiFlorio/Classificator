The People's Climate March (PCM) was a large-scale activist event to advocate global action against climate change, which took place on Sunday, September 21, 2014, in New York City, along with a series of companion actions worldwide, many of which also took the name People's Climate March. With an estimated 311,000 participants, the New York event was the largest climate change march in history. Described as "an invitation to change everything," the march was called in May 2014 by 350.org, Avaaz, the environmental organization founded by writer/activist Bill McKibben, and it was endorsed by "over 1,500 organizations, including many international and national unions, churches, schools and community and environmental justice organizations." It was conceived as a response to (but not a protest against) the scheduled U.N. Climate Summit of world leaders to take place in New York City two days later, on September 23.
Although based in New York, the event was global in scope and implication, with "companion demonstrations" worldwide. Organizers intended the march to be "the largest single event on climate that has been organized to dateâ€¦ one so large and diverse that it cannot be ignored." The entire PCM project consisted of "numerous events, actions, symposia, presentations, and more organized over the course of the days leading up to the Summit, and in the days following," of which the march was intended to be "the anchor event." Worldwide, nearly 600,000 people were estimated to have marched on September 21, including those in New York.
