Ross McKitrick (born 1965) is a Canadian economist specializing in environmental economics and policy analysis. He is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph, and a senior fellow of the Fraser Institute, as well as a member of the academic advisory boards of the John Deutsch Institute, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, and the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation.
McKitrick has authored works about climate change issues, including co-authoring the book Taken By Storm: The Troubled Science, Policy and Politics of Global Warming in 2003. McKitrick produced a series of videos and articles for the Friends of Science in which he argued that there is a "pause" in global warming that reveals flaws in current climate change models. The Friends of Science argue that the sun—not human emissions of greenhouse gases—is the main driver of climate change.
