The Freedom and Prosperity Party, formerly known as No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics and The Climate Sceptics, were an Australian political party that describes itself as the world's first political party representing climate sceptics, dedicated to "...expose the fallacy of anthropogenic climate change".
The party was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission in early 2010, and endorsed candidates to stand in the 2010 federal election. Prior to being registered, party supporters stood as independent candidates in the Bradfield and Higgins by-elections.
