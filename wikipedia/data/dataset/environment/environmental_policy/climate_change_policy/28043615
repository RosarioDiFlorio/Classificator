A Removal Unit (RMU) is a tradable carbon credit or 'Kyoto unit' representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of greenhouse gases absorbed by a removal or Carbon sink activity in an Annex I country.
Removal Units are generated and issued by Kyoto Protocol Annex I Parties for carbon absorption by land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities such as reforestation.
