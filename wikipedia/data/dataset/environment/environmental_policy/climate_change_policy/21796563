The White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy was a new government entity in the United States created in 2008 by President Barack Obama by Executive Order, by-passing Congress, that existed for a little over two years when it was combined with another presidential office in April 2011. The office was created in order to coordinate administration policy on energy and climate change.
