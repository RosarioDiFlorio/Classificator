CleanPowerSF is the City and County of San Francisco’s Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program, whose purpose is to significantly increase the proportion of electrical energy supplied to the San Francisco electrical grid from local renewable sources, decrease San Francisco’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and help combat global climate change, while meeting or exceeding California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The RPS requires that 33% of energy supplied by "investor-owned utilities, electric service providers, and community choice aggregators" should be from eligible renewable sources by 2020.
CleanPowerSF is administered by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) and monitored by the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), which is currently chaired by Supervisor John Avalos. San Francisco’s electricity supplier, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), is on track but has not yet met California RPS requirements.
In 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a goal of a GHG-free electric system by 2030. The city has the Electricity Resource Plan to generate, deploy and procure all of its energy from renewable, zero-GHG electric energy sources. The report identified a strong CleanPowerSF as an important part of that change.
