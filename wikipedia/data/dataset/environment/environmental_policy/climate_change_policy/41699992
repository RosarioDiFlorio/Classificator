CO2 is Green is a non-profit organization supporting public policy on environmental issues. A main focus of the organization are federal proposals that may “interfere with natures dependence on carbon dioxide.” CO2 is Green does not view carbon dioxide as a pollutant and advocates for federal law and regulations to support this thinking.
