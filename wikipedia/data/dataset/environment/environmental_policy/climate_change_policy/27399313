The Solar Decathlon Europe is an international competition that challenges collegiate teams to design and build houses powered exclusively by the sun. The winner of the competition is the team able to score the most points in 10 contests.
On Oct. 18, 2007, the Spanish and U.S. governments signed a memorandum of understanding in which the Spanish Ministry of Housing committed to organize and host Solar Decathlon Europe. The agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., next to the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid’s Casa Solar during the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2007 competition. The American signatory was Alexander A. Karsner, assistant secretary of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Department of the U.S. Department of Energy, with Fernando Magro Fernández, undersecretary of housing of the Ministry of Housing representing the Spanish government.
This competition takes place during even years, alternating with the U.S.-based competition, by agreement between the United States and Spanish governments.
