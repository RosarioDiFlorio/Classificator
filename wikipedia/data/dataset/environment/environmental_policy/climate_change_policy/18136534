The Lexington Project is a plan proposed by 2008 U.S. Presidential candidate John McCain to move America towards energy independence. He named it for the town Lexington, Massachusetts where the American Revolution began.
Components of the plan include:
expanding domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production,
taking action to break U.S. dependency on foreign oil by reforming the transportation sector,
investing in clean, alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar power.
protecting the environment by addressing climate change,
promoting energy efficiency,
addressing speculative pricing of oil,
off-shore oil drilling along the continental shelf,
investing in nuclear technology, and
utilization of clean coal technology.
