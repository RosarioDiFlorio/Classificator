Executive Orders S-3-05 is an Executive Order of the State of California signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in June 2005 that set greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for the State of California and laid out responsibilities among the state agencies for implementing the Executive Order and for reporting on progress toward the targets.
Specifically, the Executive Order established these targets:
By 2010, reduce GHG emissions to 2000 levels
By 2020, reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels
By 2050, reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels
The first and second goals were enshrined into law by the legislation known as AB 32, or the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which gave the California Air Resources Board broad authority to implement a market-based system (also known as cap-and-trade) to achieve these goals.
California Executive Order B-30-15 (April 2015, signed by Governor Jerry Brown) added the intermediate target of:
By 2030, reduce GHG emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels.
This intermediate target was codified into law by SB 32, which was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on September 8, 2016. On July 17, 2017, the legislature passed a law that authorized the Air Resources Board to operate a cap and trade system to achieve these emissions reductions.
