The energy policy of Turkey refers to the national policy of Turkey regarding its energy resources and consumption
Turkey will likely see the fastest medium to long-term growth in energy demand among the International Energy Agency member countries. The primary aim of the government is to realize its own energy security  by diversifying supply, and increasing energy efficiency. In particular the government aims at meeting the forecasted rapid increase in demand for electricity by renewable electricity generation (for example by guaranteeing the price of solar electricity) and by building nuclear  and more coal-fired power plants.
