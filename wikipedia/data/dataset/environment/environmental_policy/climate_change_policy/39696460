The National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), also known as Manufacturing USA, is a network of research institutes in the United States that focuses on developing and commercializing manufacturing technologies through public-private partnerships between U.S. industry, universities, and federal government agencies. Modeled after Germany's Fraunhofer Institutes, the network currently consists of nine institutes, with six more planned by 2017.
