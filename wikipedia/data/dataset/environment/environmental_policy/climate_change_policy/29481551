CERINA Plan is the abbreviation for “CO2 Emissions and Renewable Investment Action Plan”. It is a CO2 reduction concept developed by the German renewable energy institute IWR. The CERINA Plan proposes a technical investment approach linking a country’s CO2 emissions to its investment in renewable energy technology. Therefore, it is an alternative model to approaches like the Kyoto idea of mere cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The model is meant to be flexible and to adapt to the special national circumstances of each country.
