Hoy No Circula (literally in Spanish: "today [your car] does not circulate", known as No-drive days) is the name of an environmental program intended to improve the air quality of Mexico City. A similar coordinated program operates within the State of MÃ©xico, which surrounds Mexico City on three sides. Mexico City and Mexico State have reciprocal agreements with surrounding states that also have emissions testing programs to permit their residents to travel freely without restriction.
The following restriction does not apply to vehicles that have other than 0 or 00 sticker (permits driving every day without restriction) and are plated in Mexico City, Mexico State and surrounding states that have an agreement with Mexico City and Mexico State. It is based on the last digit of their license plate. There are other restrictions that are applicable to non-local vehicles and foreigners, which are presented in the remainder of this article.
The hours of the program are from 5 A.M. to 10 P.M.
Emissions testing is conducted every 6 months.
