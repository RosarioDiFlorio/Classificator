10:10 is a charity that enables people to take practical action on climate change, and combines these local actions to inspire a more ambitious approach to the issue at every level of society.
Founded in 2009, 10:10 began by campaigning for a 10% reduction in carbon emissions in 2010, and has since broadened its approach to include a range of projects focused on carbon reduction and renewable energy.
Its three main projects are Solar Schools, which helps communities crowdfund the cost of solar panels for their local schools; #itshappening, which showcases positive examples of progress on climate change; and Back Balcombe, which supports a solar power cooperative in the Sussex village targeted for oil drilling, and promotes community-scale renewable energy nationally.
