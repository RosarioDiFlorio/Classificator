The Bangladesh climate Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) is a proposed institution to collect and disburse climate adaptation funding for Bangladesh, to be administered by the World Bank. The MDTF is now known as the Climate Change Resilience Fund (CCRF).
On February 15, 2009, the Bangladeshi government refused to accept a Â£60m climate funding offer from the United Kingdom if it was channelled through the World Bank.
