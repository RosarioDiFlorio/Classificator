Larry Persily was Federal Coordinator (director) of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects 2010-2015. The Federal Coordinator is nominated with advice and consent of the Senate by the President of the United States. He was nominated by Barack Obama on December 9, 2009, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2010.
Persily criticized his former employer, then-Governor Sarah Palin, as John McCain's choice for vice president. Until June 2008, he had worked as the Washington, DC liaison for the state government of Alaska. "She's not qualified, she doesn't have the judgment, to be next in line to the president of the United States," said Persily in August 2008.
In December 2009, Democratic Senator Mark Begich recommended Persily for the Obama administration post.
Persily was also a "key aide" to Alaska house member Mike Hawker.
