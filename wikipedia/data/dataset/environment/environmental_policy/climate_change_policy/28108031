"Green New Deal" is a term used to describe any stimulus package that aims to address both financial crises and environmental issues such as climate change. The term references the New Deal, the social and economic stimulus package undertaken by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. Therefore, one who supports a Green New Deal most likely advocates the combination of Roosevelt's fiscal ideals with more contemporary approaches such as investment in renewable energies and the promotion of greater resource efficiency.
