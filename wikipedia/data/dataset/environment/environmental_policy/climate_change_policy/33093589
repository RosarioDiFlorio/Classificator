CarbFix is a project in Iceland intended to lock away carbon dioxide by reacting it with basaltic rocks. Work on the project began in 2007. The CarbFix team involved American and Icelandic researchers including Iceland geologist Sigurdur Reynir Gislason serving as chief scientist, project technical manager Bergur Sigfusson, manager Juerg Matter who worked with Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and scientific overseer, Wallace S. Broecker (also with Columbia). Reykjavik Energy supplied almost half the $10 million spent thus far on CarbFix. Other sponsors included U.S. and Icelandic universities. In addition to finding a new method for permanent carbon dioxide storage, another objective of the project was to train scientists for years of work to come.
