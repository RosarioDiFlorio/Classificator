The Boardman Hill Solar Farm BHSF is a 150 kW AC community solar farm project. The Boardman Hill Solar Farm is the first community solar array in Vermont that fulfills the “Vermont Grown, Vermont Green” mission: complete member-ownership, democratic management of ongoing operations, and retirement of the RECs generated by the solar farm. It is located on the Boardman Hill Farm in West Rutland, Vermont.
