A Power Marketing Administration (PMA) is a United States federal agency within the Department of Energy with the responsibility for marketing hydropower, primarily from multiple-purpose water projects operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the International Boundary and Water Commission.
The federal government first assumed a role in power marketing in the early 1900s when power from federal water projects in excess of project needs was sold in order to repay the government's investment in the projects.
There are four federal PMAs, which market and deliver power in 34 U.S. states:
Bonneville Power Administration
Southeastern Power Administration
Southwestern Power Administration
Western Area Power Administration
