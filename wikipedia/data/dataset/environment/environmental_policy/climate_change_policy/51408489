AIR-INKTM is an ink brand which produces ink and ink-based art products by condensing soot-based gaseous effluents generated by motor vehicles due to incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Founded by Graviky Labs, a spin-off group of MIT Media Lab, Air Ink produces its materials through a step-by-step process which primarily involves capturing of emissions, separation of carbon from the soot, and then mixing of this carbon with different types of oils and solutions. It uses a patented device called 'Kaalink' to carry out the filtration of soot, which contains carbon and other polluting agents like heavy metals and carcinogens.
Air Ink is marketed as a solution to air pollution and its negative effects on human life. Dubbed as "the first ink made out of recycled air pollution," its products were used in August 2016 in association with Tiger Beer to create street art and murals in Hong Kong's Sheung Wan district. 30â€“50 minutes of car pollution can supply enough carbon to fill one Air Ink pen.
