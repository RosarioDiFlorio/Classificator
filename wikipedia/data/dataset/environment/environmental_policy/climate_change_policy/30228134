Government incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have been established by several national and local governments around the world as a financial incentives to plug-in electric vehicle vehicles to consumers. These mainly include tax exemptions and tax credits, and additional perks that range from access to bus lines to waivers on fees (charging, parking, tolls, etc.). The amount of these incentives usually depend on battery size and the vehicle all-electric range, and some countries extend the benefits to fuel cell vehicles, and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The IEA determined that, as of 2016, 0.2% of all passenger vehicles (approximately 2 million electric vehicles ) are currently on the road worldwide.
The worldâ€™s total final consumption of energy by sector represented 9,426 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (Mtoe) in 2014, 28% of which is attributed to transport alone, accounting for an increase of 5% from 1971 statistics. Moreover, 23% of energy-related Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions worldwide are also attributable to transport. Thus, the electrification of the transport sector represents an area of opportunity for governments to cut their GHG emissions, which is why they are starting to champion policies that increase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles adoption rates.
