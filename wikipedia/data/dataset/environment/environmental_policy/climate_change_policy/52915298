This is a working list of Carbon Ranches a term referring to regenerative agriculture practices that specifically accomplish carbon sequestration in the soil. "The world’s cultivated soils have lost between 50 and 70 percent of their original carbon stock." (Lal) "A mere two percent increase in the carbon content of the planet’s soils could offset 100 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions going into the atmosphere."(Lal) Grasslands cover 350 billion hectares, comprising 70% of global agricultural land  making carbon ranching an especially climate beneficial alternative to meat produced as part of a Concentrated animal feeding operation. Carbon ranching may include, but is not limited to Managed intensive rotational grazing, Compost application, Holistic management (agriculture) and Tree planting.
There are many research groups and NGO's studying and advancing this field including Arizona State University, The Carbon Cycle Institute, Holistic Management International, The Ohio State University, The Quivira Coalition, The Savory Institute, The Soil Carbon Coalition, Texas A&M University. This list does not necessarily reflect scientific or academic endorsements insofar as best practices and results vary across ranches, climates, time periods, and sources of funding and are therefore challenging to quantify and/or compare. Currently, confirmation of the carbon ranching designation is confirmed through either third party citation or Soil Organic Matter test result.
