Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) is an act of the Parliament of South Africa. It came into effect on May 1, 2004, and now governs the acquisition, use and disposal of mineral rights. The old common-law principles are therefore no longer applicable. The MPRDA entrenches state power and control over the mineral and petroleum resources of the country.
