Fossil fuel regulations are part of the energy policy in the United States and have gained major significance with the strong dependence on fossil fuel based energy. Regulatory processes are established at the federal and state level due to the immense economic, socio-political and environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction and production. Over 80% of the United States' energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. The Bush administration was marked by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which provided a monetary incentive for renewable energy adoption and addressed the issue of climate change. The Obama administration was made up of advocates for renewable energy and natural gas, while Donald Trump built his campaign on promises to revive the coal industry.
Oil, gas, and coal companies have been at odds with policy makers who have supported a wider implementation of renewable energy, with the former often spending millions of dollars to lobby against cleaner energy. The Washington Post reported on February 22, 2017 Scott Pruitt's potential special interests with the fossil fuel industry as he began his term as the appointed head of the EPA under the Trump administration. Fossil fuel emission disproportionately affects working class, poor and minority populations. The people most adversely affected also have the least political influence and least access to health care.
