The Government's Obligation to Protect the Nuclear Rights and Achievements of Iranian Nation Act (Persian: قانون الزام دولت به حفظ دستاوردها و حقوق هسته‌ای ملت ایران‎) is a bill that was passed on 23 June 2015 by Iran's Islamic Consultative Assembly to support Iran's nuclear program and put some constraints on Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
The bill passed in the Majlis by 213 to 10 (Yea and Nay) and 6 Abstains.
The implication of the Act is that the Majlis curtailed its own power to stand against the deal.
