President Barack Obamaâ€™s Climate Action Plan proposed a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. It included preserving forests, encouraging the use of alternate fuels, and increased study of climate change. The plan was first prepared in 2008 and had then been updated every two years.
President Obama's last Climate Action Plan, issued in June 2013, included regulations to industry with the ultimate goal of cutting domestic carbon emission, preparing the U.S. for impending effects of climate change, and working internationally to address climate change. Among the regulations outlined in the plan were initiatives to increase natural disaster preparedness, create and improve existing hospitals, and modernize infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather.
The plan would have support conservation of land and water resources and developing actionable climate science, and encouraged other countries to take action to address climate change, including reducing deforestation and lowering subsidies that increase use of fossil fuels. The plan specifically mentioned methane, building efficiency, wind, solar and hydroelectricity.
White House staff members who were directly tasked with implementation of the plan included Heather Zichal and Michelle Patron.
