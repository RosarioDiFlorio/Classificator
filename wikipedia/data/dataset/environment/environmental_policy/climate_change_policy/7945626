The Bannister Federal Complex is a United States federal government complex located at 1500 E. Bannister Road in Kansas City, Missouri. The 310-acre (1.3 km2) complex consists of 10 buildings located at the corner of Troost Avenue and Bannister Road. The complex is occupied primarily by the General Services Administration and the Department of Energy. It is currently slated for closure by 2014.
The largest component, the Kansas City Plant, produces and assembles 85% of the non-nuclear components of the United States nuclear bomb arsenal. The GSA has announced plans to relocate the Kansas City Plant to land adjacent to the former Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base beginning in 2011.
