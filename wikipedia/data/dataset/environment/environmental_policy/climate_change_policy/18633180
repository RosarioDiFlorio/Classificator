EcoSecurities is a business that sources and develops carbon credits and carbon offsets from greenhouse gas emission reduction projects throughout the world.
The company has offices in Europe, Middle East, Americas and Asia and has a large portfolio of green house gas emission reduction projects covering numerous countries and technologies.
EcoSecurities was created in January 1997, 12 months before the Kyoto conference. After a period of organic growth, the company floated on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange in December 2005, allowing it to grow its geographic presence by placing over 300 staff in 30 countries. Its portfolio grew to over 150 million CERs - the largest in the world at the time. In June 2007, the company raised an additional €100 million to expand into new markets, with Credit Suisse becoming a major investor. It trades in the international carbon market which was valued at €38 billion in the first six months of 2008.
The former President and co-founder of EcoSecurities was Pedro Moura-Costa and the former CEO was Bruce Usher.
At the end of 2009 the firm was acquired by JP Morgan and is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiarly of JPMorgan Chase and Co. and can provide its clients with access to the scope of services provided by the bank's Environmental Markets business in addition to those activities of sourcing and developing greenhouse gas abatement projects outlined above. Following on from acquisition of EcoSecurities the company appointed Paul Mark Kelly as Chief Executive Officer of the company in December 2009, when the company subsequently delisted from the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.
