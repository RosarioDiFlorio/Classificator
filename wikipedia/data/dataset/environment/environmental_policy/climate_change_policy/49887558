Net metering in Nevada is a public policy and political issue surrounding the rates that Nevada public utilities are required to pay to purchase excess energy produced by electric customers who generate their own electricity, such as through rooftop solar panels. The issue centers around two policies: paying solar customers the "retail" rate versus the "wholesale" rate.
Before 2016, Nevada utilities paid people with solar panels the “retail” rate for electricity. At the end of 2015, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (NPUC) approved new rules that changed that rate to the "wholesale" rate.
