Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan Through Peace and War is a 2003 book by Thomas de Waal, based on the study of Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet republics, during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. It cuts between a careful reconstruction of the history of Nagorno Karabakh conflict since 1988 and on-the-spot reporting on its convoluted aftermath.
Much of de Waal's analysis is concerned with the Caucasus region, focusing on the exercise of power on the Eurasian landmass in a post-Soviet environment.
