Campus Conservation Nationals (CCN) is a national competition in which colleges and universities in North America compete to reduce energy and water consumption over the course of a month. Participating schools aim to educate students and faculty about resource consumption and its effects on the environment.  The program is run by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), Lucid Design Group, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Alliance to Save Energy. The competition lasts for three weeks, and each individual school may choose when to hold their competition during CCN's three-month competition season each spring. Campuses can hold individual competitions, which involves campus buildings competing to have the highest reduction (by percent) of electricity and/or water compared to a previously-set baseline.  Many campuses also participate in a group competition, competing against other schools in their region. Campus Conservation Nationals 2015 marks the fifth year of the competition. Recent years' competitions resulted in an overall energy savings of over 2 million kWh each year. The first pilot competition was held in 2010, with the program resulting in 500,000 kWh of energy saved. DePauw University was the winner of the 2010 competition
