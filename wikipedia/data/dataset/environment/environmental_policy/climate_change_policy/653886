Petrocurrency is a neologism used with three distinct meanings, often confused:
Trading surpluses of oil producing nations, referred to as petrodollar recycling.
Currencies of oil producing nations which tend to rise in value against other currencies when the price of oil rises (and fall when it falls).
Currencies used as a unit of account to price oil in the international market.
