Association NegaWatt Power, Is a French advocacy group. It was founded in 2001 to promote the NegaWatt concept and its application to French society. The association seeks to reduce the use and consumption of fossil fuels and nuclear power. Its approach is based on energy conservation, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies. It published a scenario that details a path to phasing out these energy sources.
The association unites energy specialists in France, relying mostly on volunteer engineers. Other specialists include volunteer sociologists, economists and urban planners, who work together to create energy transition scenarios and to suggest the corresponding political steps that would need to be taken.
Association NÃ©gaWatt inspired local initiatives in transition towns called "Virage-Energie," meaning "energy bend."
