Mexico highly depends on the burning of its fossil fuels, and for the same reason, it is in its interest to look into mitigation solutions for its corresponding emissions. In the General Law on Climate Change on 2012, Mexico promised to reduce 20% of its GHG emissions by 2020 and 50% by 2050, as well as in the Paris Agreement. 19% of the this new mitigation plan will be dedicated to carbon capture and storage and specifically 10% to the energetic industry.
