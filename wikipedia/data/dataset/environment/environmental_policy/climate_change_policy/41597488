A Lehman Review is an independent peer review and evaluation of the status of a major construction project in the United States Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Science. Lehman Reviews evaluate all aspects of a construction project's current status, including technical aspects, cost, schedule and management, and they are usually held twice a year. Lehman Reviews are widely known in DOE, other agencies and abroad. The reviews are named after Daniel Lehman, Director of the DOE Office of Science's Office of Project Assessment since 1991.
