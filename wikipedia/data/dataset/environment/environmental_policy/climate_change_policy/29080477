Fee and Dividend or Carbon Fee and Dividend (CF&D) is a market-based mechanism for reducing the carbon emissions that help to drive anthropogenic climate change. Carbon Fee and Dividend begins with levying a progressively-rising tax on carbon-based fuels, then returning some or all of the revenue to the public as a regular energy dividend. This is intended to incentivize a shift to low-carbon energy while protecting consumers from any increases in the costs of carbon-based fuels.
Designed to maintain or improve economic vitality while speeding the transition to a sustainable energy economy, Carbon Fee and Dividend has been proposed as an alternative to emission reduction mechanisms such as complex regulatory approaches, cap and trade or a straightforward carbon tax. The method has been compared to wealth redistribution legislation that was used during the Great Depression.
