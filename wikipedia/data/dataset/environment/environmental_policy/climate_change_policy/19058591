88888 Lights Out was a campaign with the stated goal of increasing awareness of global warming and promoting actions to reduce energy consumption. By encouraging India's residents to turn out the lights for eight minutes and to become more aware of environmental concerns, the organisers sought to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce pollution of the globe.
