Tradable smoking pollution permits were proposed by the economists Robert Haveman and John Mullahy of the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison as an alternative to smoking bans to solve the problem of cigarette-smoking "externalities" in public bars and restaurants. The tradable smoking pollution permit systems work similar to other cap-and-trade emissions trading systems successfully used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency since the 1970s to curb other types of pollution.
