The Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action (AWG-LCA) is one of the two negotiating tracks established under the Bali Road Map at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 13th Conference of the Parties (COP13) in Bali in 2007. The other one is the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP). Its purpose is to negotiate emissions reductions commitments for Non-Annex-I countries, which don't have any mandatory reductions commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the United States which failed to ratify it. In theory, the two negotiation tracks together would result in a comprehensive Global climate regime.
