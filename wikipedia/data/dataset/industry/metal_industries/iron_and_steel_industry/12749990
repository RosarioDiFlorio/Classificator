Brown Bayley Steels was a steel-making company established in Sheffield, England in 1871, as Brown, Bayley & Dixon. They occupied a site on Leeds Road which was later occupied by the Don Valley sports stadium. The firm was founded by George Brown, Nephew of "John Brown" of the firm John Brown & Company. The firm manufactured Bessemer steel and railway tracks.
Notable among its employees was Harry Brearley, the inventor of stainless steel. Bearley left Firths after a dispute over the patents and was offered a position at Brown Bayley, where he was appointed works manager and then became a director.
