Washington Iron Furnace is an historic iron furnace, located in Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia. The furnace was built around 1770 and measures 30 feet on its south face and is constructed of granite. From 1770 to 1779, it was operated by John Donelson, the father of Rachel Donelson, who married Andrew Jackson, and his son-in-law, John Caffery, husband of Mary Donelson Caffery. The house, known as The Farm, was the ironmaster's house, for the Washington Iron Furnace. According to the Statement of Significance filed with the National Park Service, the facility was originally named "The Bloomery." A later owner was a friend of George Washington, and applied the current name.
Washington Iron Furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
