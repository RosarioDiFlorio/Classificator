The Călan steel works, formerly the Victoria Steel Works Călan (Romanian: Combinatul Siderurgic "Victoria" Călan), were a steel mill in the Transylvanian town of Călan, Romania. Begun around 1870, when the area was part of Austria-Hungary, the works underwent a powerful expansion following nationalization in 1948 by the nascent Communist regime, making a vital contribution to the growth of the town. Privatization in the late 1990s proved unsuccessful, and the works were largely abandoned within a decade, leading to economic hardship for Călan.
