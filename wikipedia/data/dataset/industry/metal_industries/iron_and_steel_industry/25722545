The Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, originally the Pittsburgh Engine Company was a company founded in 1811 by Oliver Evans to manufacture high-pressure steam engines. It opened for business soon after Fulton's low-pressure New Orleans left Pittsburgh on her maiden voyage as the first steamboat west of the Appalachian Mountains. In addition to engines, the company made other heavy equipment and iron castings, including anchors used by Commodore Perry in the War of 1812 in Lake Erie. It manufactured rolling mills for the iron industry as well.
It was located at the corner of Front Street and Redoubt Alley in Downtown Pittsburgh blocks from the Monongahela wharf.
