It was built as a hot-blast charcoal furnace around 1873-1874, and subsequently enlarged and converted into a coke furnace. In 1883, the stack was raised an additional five feet, and a tuyere was added. Callie Furnace went out of blast in 1884.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
