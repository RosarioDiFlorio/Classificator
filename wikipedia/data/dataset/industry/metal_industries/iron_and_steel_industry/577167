Bethlehem Works is a 120-acre (0.49 km2) development site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, based on land formerly owned by Bethlehem Steel. The company discontinued its steelmaking activities at the main Bethlehem plant in 1995 after about 140 years of metal production. With the closing of its local operations, Bethlehem Steel decided to help redevelop the South Side of Bethlehem, and hired outside consultants to develop concept plans on the reuse of the property. The plan was to rename the site "Bethlehem Works" and to use the land for cultural, recreational, educational, entertainment and retail development - including the Smithsonian Institution - an educational and research institution.
