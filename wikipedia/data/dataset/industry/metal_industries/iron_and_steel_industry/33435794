The Neabsco Iron Works (alternates: Neabsco Company; Neabsco Iron Foundry ) were located in Woodbridge, Virginia, US. After abandoning the Bristol Iron Works, John Tayloe I established the Neabsco Iron Foundry around 1737. The business became a multifaceted antebellum industrial plantation. Its activities included farming, leatherworking, milling, shipbuilding, shoemaking, and smithing, as well as supplying raw materials used as weaponry during the American Revolution. The business grew and expanded with his son, John Tayloe II, when, in 1756, he bought the Occoquan Ironworks company, eventually running it as one business with the Neabsco. It was situated on 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) by the Neabsco Creek.
