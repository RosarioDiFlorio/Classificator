Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), in Rourkela, Odisha is the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India. It was set up with West German collaboration with an installed capacity of 1 million tonnes in the 1960s. It is operated by Steel Authority of India.
German metallurgical firms Mannesmann, Krupp, Demag, Siemens and Austrian company Voestalpine provided machinery and consultancy to the plant among others. Rourkela Steel Plant was the first steel plant in Asia to use the LD (Linz-Donawitz) process of steel-making. Rourkela Steel Plant has an associated fertilizer plant that produces nitrogeneous fertilizers using ammonia feedstock (from its coke oven plant). On 3 February 1959, then president Rajendra Prasad inaugurated RSP's first blast furnace named 'Parvati' when the company was known as Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL). Subsequently, the RSP became a unit of the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL).
Recently, a Rs 12,000-crore modernisation and expansion project at the Rourkela Steel Plant was dedicated to the Nation by Prime minister Narendra Modi on 1 April 2015. RSP presently has the capacity to produce 4.5 million tonnes of hot metal, 4.2 million tonnes of crude steel and 3.9 million tonnes of saleable steel.
The capacity of Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) is expected to rise to 10.8 MTPA by 2025. Ashwini Kumar took over as Chief Executive Officer of Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) in 2016.
