The Grill family was one of several Swedish families having significant influence with the Swedish East India Company (SOIC). During the 17th century, 18th century and for some years into the 19th century, they owned ironworks and mills manufacturing goods for export while operating wharfs, textile companies, saw mills and other factories related to shipbuilding. Several Grills were directors of the SOIC and the Grill firm traded with the merchants in Canton (now known as Guangzhou) as members of the SOIC and privately. The Grills owned houses, manors and estates at a number of locations in Sweden.
All the noted Grills were in some way connected to the main Grill Trading House, and several other companies were established in association with the Trading House. The Grill name was kept and passed on through the generations and some of the Grills even shared the same first name.
Apart from the SOIC, the Grills are most noted for their contribution to the Swedish iron industry and for exports of iron during the 18th century.
