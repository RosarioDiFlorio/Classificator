Kirkstall Forge Engineering was a metalworking business based near Kirkstall, in Yorkshire.
The history of the forge can be dated to a 12th-century millrace which powered a corn mill for the monks of Kirkstall Abbey. Iron production began in the 16th century, making it the oldest forge in England.
In the 19th century, as well as ironforging, the business produced axles for horse-drawn vehicles. As motor vehicles became more common, in the early 20th century, the forge specialised in motor vehicle axles and in steel bar. During the First World War, forging was stopped, allowing the business to concentrate on axle production. During the Second World War, production expanded to meet the demand for military vehicles, and the site was camouflaged to reduce the risk of bombing raids.
In 1964, Kirkstall Forge bought the Regent Axle company based in Burnley to expand its gear machining capabilities. In 1974, Kirkstall Forge Engineering was bought by GKN. It is now closed.
