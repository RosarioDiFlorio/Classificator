Janney Furnace Park is a park surrounding a fifty-foot tall stone furnace in Ohatchee, Alabama. The furnace was built in 1863 by Alfred Janney to produce pig iron due to the prevalence of iron ore in what is now the park. A July 1864 Union raid destroyed all but the stone chimney, which still remains. The furnace is now surrounded by the Calhoun County Confederate Memorial, built by Sons of Confederate Veterans in June 2003; and the 2009 Confederate and Native American Museum, which includes Civil War and Native American artifacts dating back to the Iron Age. The Confederate Memorial is the world's largest black granite confederate memorial. The furnace was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
