Carrick Furnace is a historic iron furnace located at Metal Township in Franklin County, Pennsylvania. The property includes the limestone furnace stack, a Peter L. Weimer blowing engine (1879), boilers for the steam engine, and the charging ramp, engine house, and cast house foundations. The furnace was built about 1828, and measures 30 feet square at the base and 30 feet high. Furnace operations were suspended in 1837, the property sold in 1843, then leased in 1850 to "Witherow and Walker." The furnace was converted in 1879 to hot blast with the installation of the steam-powered blowing engine. The furnace went out of blast in 1884, and was donated to the Franklin County Historical Society-Kittochtinney in 1935.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
