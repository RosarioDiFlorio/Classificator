Lugar was once dominated by a large ironworks with several blast furnaces. Like the mining industry in nearby areas, though, the iron industry has been decimated by economic decline. The Lugar ironworks closed long ago.
Lugar was built to accommodate the workers at the ironworks around 1845. They were houses in "miners' raws" (sic). On the 1860 Ordnance Survey Map the rows included Peesweip Row, Craigstonholm Row, Store Row, Back Row and Hollowholm Row.(This map also shows a Curling Pond). Other maps included Laigh Row, Double Row and High Row. The population grew to 753 in 1861, and 1374 in 1871. By 1881 it had 1353 people and 1891 people, according to the Ordnance Survey.
The Lugar Institute was created in 1892 by a Mr. Weir of Kildonan. The Institute consisted of a lecture hall with a capacity of 400, a reading room, recreation room (for chess etc.), billiard room and bowling alley. It was partially demolished, and some of the remaining parts have been recently restored.
A local church, established in 1867, is another prominent feature of Lugar.
The Lugar Boswell Thistle Football Club is a Scottish football (soccer) club based there. The club is nicknamed The Jaggy Bunnets. They were formed in 1878 as a senior team, turning to the juniors after a short spell.
The 65th Ayrshire scout troop in the Kylesmuir District is based in Lugar.
Near Lugar, at Bello Mill Cottage on the estate of James Boswell in Auchinleck, William Murdoch was born in 1784.

A cave where he carried out a lot of his experiments on coal gas can still be seen on the riverbank of the Lugar Water.
