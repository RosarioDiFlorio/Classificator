The Yahata Steel Works (八幡製鐵所, Yahata seitetsu-sho) is a steel mill in Kitakyūshū, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Construction began in 1896 in order to meet increasing demand from the nation's burgeoning shipbuilding, railway, construction, and armaments industries. The site chosen was the former town of Yahata, now merged into Kitakyūshū, near coal mines and with easy access to the sea.
