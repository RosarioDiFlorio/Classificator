Hart, Son, Peard and Co. were architectural metalworkers based in London and Birmingham, most associated with ecclesiastical works.
Founded in 1842 in Wych St, off The Strand, by ironmonger Joseph Hart, they became artistic metalworkers specializing in ecclesiastical manufactures after merging with Birmingham-based Peard & Jackson in 1866-7. Also skilled in sculpture, the firm made designs by J.P. Seddon, B.J. Talbert and Alfred Waterhouse. They made silverwork for William Burges, and in the early 1870s for William Butterfield. The company had an agent, Henri Collet, in Paris.
The company were represented at all the major exhibitions, winning many medals, including at: London (1851, 1862); Paris (1855, 1867, 1878); Dublin (1855, 1865); and Philadelphia (1876).
The firm was disestablished shortly before World War I in 1913.
