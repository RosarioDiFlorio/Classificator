Skinningrove steelworks is a steel mill in Skinningrove, North Yorkshire, England. The business was formed in 1874 as the Loftus Iron Company, after a liquidation of the company reformed in 1880 as the Skinningrove Iron Company. The works expanded from producing only pig iron to include steel production in the early 20th century, with mills specialising in long products including railway rail. As part of the business the company constructed a jetty at Skinningrove, and owned an ironstone mine in Loftus.
The works existed as a separate entity under the overall ownership of Pease and Partners bank until nationalisation into the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain in 1951, returned to private ownership in 1963, and renationalised into British Steel Corporation (BSC) in 1967. Under BSC, the works was rationalised with all primary steel production ended by the early 1970, with the works supplied by a larger steel plant at Lackenby near Redcar. The plant became focused on the production of special sections.
Ownership as part of BSC passed to Corus Group plc (1999), and to Tata Steel Europe (2006). In 2016, the long products division of Tata Steel Europe including Skinningrove was sold to Greybull Capital.
