The Richmond Furnace Historical and Archeological District is a historic industrial area located on State, Cone Hill, and Furnace Roads in Richmond, Massachusetts. The industrial history of the site dates to 1763 when the first grist and sawmills were built. In 1829, the first stone furnace was constructed for the production of iron from abundant hematite ore found nearby. It was rebuilt in 1863, and overhauled in 1905 to increase capacity. The area saw industrial iron production until 1923. The historic district also includes several other houses and buildings related to the iron works. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
