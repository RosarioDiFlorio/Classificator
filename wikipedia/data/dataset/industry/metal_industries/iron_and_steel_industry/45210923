The Pennsylvania Steel Company is a name of two Pennsylvania steel companies.
The original company was located in Steelton, Pennsylvania and its steel mill was established in 1867 along the banks of the Susquehanna River and comprised blast furnaces and a Bessemer process mill. The company was acquired by Bethlehem Steel in 1917. The blast furnaces were closed in 1960. Open hearth furnaces continued to operate until 1968, when they were replaced by electric arc furnaces. In 1983 a continuous caster was installed at the plant. Bethlehem Steel declared bankruptcy in 2001, and the plant was acquired by International Steel Group, which later merged into Mittal and then ArcelorMittal.
The second Pennsylvania Steel Company was originally known as the Pennsylvania Steel & Aluminum Company and was established in 1972 in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. The company was renamed to the Pennsylvania Steel Company in 1988 and moved its production from Huntington Valley to Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania in 1993.
