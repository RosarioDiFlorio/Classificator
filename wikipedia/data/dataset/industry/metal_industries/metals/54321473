Chalconatronite is a carbonate mineral that contains copper, sodium, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen, its chemical formula is Na2Cu(CO3)2â€¢3(H2O). Chalconatronite is partially soluble in water, and only decomposes, although chalconatronite is soluble while cold, in dilute acids. The mineral is thought to be formed by water carrying alkali carbonates reacting with bronze. Most chalconatronite formed on bronze and silver that have been treated with either sodium sesquicarbonate or silver cyanide to prevent corrosion. The name comes from the mineral's compounds, copper ("chalcos" in Greek) and natron. Similar minerals include malachite, azurite, and other copper carbonates. Chalconatronite has also been found and recorded in Australia and Germany.
