The Katanga Supergroup is a Neoproterozoic sequence of geological formations found in central Africa. The formation is well-studied for its rich stratiform copper-cobalt deposits mined extensively in from the Central African Copperbelt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Particularly rich outcrops of the Roan Group of the supergroup occur in eastern Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where open-pit copper mining has occurred.
The Katanga Supergroup nonconformably overlies the 883 Ma Nchanga Granite. The Katangan Supergroup is divided into four metasedimentary series, from the oldest siliclastic and dolomitic Roan Group conglomerates, sandstones, and shales, to Nguba Group of mostly carbonates and carbon-rich shales, to the youngest, upper most Kundelungu Group including glacial metasediments and a cap carbonate.
The Katanga Supergroup correlates with rocks of the Makuti Group in other parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
