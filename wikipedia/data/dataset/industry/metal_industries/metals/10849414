The lever rule is a tool used to determine mole fraction of each phase of a binary equilibrium phase diagram. It is used to determine the percent of liquid and solid phases for a given binary composition and temperature that is between the liquidus and solidus line.
In an alloy with two phases, α and β, which themselves contain two elements, A and B, the lever rule states that the weight percentage of the α phase is

  
    
      
        
          X
          
            α
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              c
              −
              b
            
            
              a
              −
              b
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{\alpha }={\frac {c-b}{a-b}}}
  
where
a is the weight percentage of element B in the α phase
b is the weight percentage of element B in the β phase
c is the weight percentage of element B in the entire alloy
all at some fixed temperature.
