Aluminum powder is powdered aluminum. This was originally produced by mechanical means using a stamp mill to create flakes. Subsequently, a process of spraying molten aluminum to create a powder of droplets was developed by E. J. Hall in the 1920s. The resulting powder might then be processed further in a ball mill to flatten it into flakes for use as a coating or pigment. Aluminium powder is non toxic and is not harmful unless injected directly in a major blood vessel such as the aorta. Aluminum powder, if breathed in, it is not particularly harmful and will only cause minor irritation. The melting point of aluminum powder is 660 Â°C.
