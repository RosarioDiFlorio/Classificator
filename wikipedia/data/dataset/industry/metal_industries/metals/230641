Copper-based chips are semiconductor integrated circuits which use copper for interconnections in the metalization layer, the BEOL. Since copper is a better conductor than aluminium, chips using this technology can have smaller metal components, and use less energy to pass electricity through them. Together, these effects lead to higher-performance processors. They were first introduced by IBM, with assistance from Motorola, in 1997.
The transition from aluminium to copper required significant developments in fabrication techniques, including radically different methods for patterning the metal as well as the introduction of barrier metal layers to isolate the silicon from potentially damaging copper atoms.
