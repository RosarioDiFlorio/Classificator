Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory, published in August 2005's issue of Science, that uranium rhodium germanium (URhGe) is the first discovered metal that becomes superconducting in the presence of an extremely strong electromagnetic field. Very unlike other superconducting materials, whose superconducting properties can be lost due to strong magnetic fields, uranium rhodium germanium actually regains superconducting abilities at about 8 teslas.
