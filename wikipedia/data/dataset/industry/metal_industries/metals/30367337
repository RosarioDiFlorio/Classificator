The Jewish copper plate is a copper-plate charter issued by the Chera king of Cranganore, Bhaskara Ravi Varma (named as Parkaran Iravivanmar), granting land to a Jewish trader, Joseph Rabban of Cochin. Although the traditional date according to the Cochin Jews is 379 CE, the presently accepted date of this inscription is 1000 CE. It is the earliest evidence of a Jewish community settling in India, although local tradition has it that a previous settlement in Malabar dates to the early centuries CE.
During the visit of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to India in 2003, the then provincial tourism minister KV Thomas presented him with a replica of the copper plates. Similar replicas were also gifted by Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a state visit to Israel in 2017.
