Metal prices (metal commodities) are only for a few metals quoted on exchanges. Only aluminium alloy, aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, zinc and Nasaac (North American special aluminium alloy) are exchange traded commodities. Other metals (like bismuth, selenium, tellurium, and many others) are traded on market demand and the buyers/sellers themselves set the price.
The London Metal Exchange which trades the commodities mentioned above is planning to add trading contracts for cobalt and molybdenum in the course of 2009/2010.
Contracts traded on metal exchanges are also called futures contracts.
