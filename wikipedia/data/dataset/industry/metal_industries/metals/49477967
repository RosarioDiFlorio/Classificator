Lead poisoning epidemics refer to instances of mass lead poisoning, and usually occur unintentionally in low income countries. Lead recycling is a common cause of a poisoning epidemic, and it is commonplace and sometimes the only means of providing sustenance in poorer countries. The lack of immediate and obvious health effects often result in people taking excessive risks and few precautions when handling lead. These events can also cause disproportionate childhood fatalities, when levels of toxins become fatal in lower concentrations in children compared with adults.
