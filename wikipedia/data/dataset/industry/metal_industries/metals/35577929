The Wulfing cache, or Malden plates, are eight Mississippian copper plates crafted by peoples of the Mississippian culture. They were discovered in Dunklin County, Missouri in 1906 by Ray Grooms, a farmer, while plowing a field south of Malden. The repouss√©d copper plates were instrumental to archaeologists' developing the concept known as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.
