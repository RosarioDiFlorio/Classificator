Copper(I) hydroxide is the hydroxide of the metal copper with the chemical formula of CuOH. It is a mild, highly unstable alkali. The color of pure CuOH is yellow or orange-yellow, but it usually appears rather dark red because of the impurity substances. It is extremely easy to be oxidated even at room temperature.
