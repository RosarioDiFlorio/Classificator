The Dual Phase Steels Magnetism Modeling (DPS-MMOD) program is an investigation project funded by the French National Agency for Research (ANR). The project started in 2009 for a period of four years. It aims at modeling and simulating dual-phase steel materials.
With the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the trend is to make lighter auto bodies, yet without sacrificing their aptitude to protect car passengers in case of accidents. Steel manufacturers are currently developing a new generation of flat carbon steels dual-phase steel. However these steels are more exposed, in terms of properties consistency, to process variations than other conventional flat carbon steels. Therefore, adequate measurement tools are required to at least check the production scatter and control it.
The DPS-MMOD program will run full volume energy minimisation at mesoscopic scale, model the transition from mesoscopic to bulk properties with a multiscale approach and model the measurement system with a software developed for electrical appliances. The project also proposes a significant set of characterizations, including both laboratory and in-plant measurements to validate, at least qualitatively the aptitude of magnetic based non-destructive systems to assess Dual Phase steel microstructure.
The project includes research centers, universities and steel manufacturers.
