PAMP SA (acronym for Produits Artistiques Métaux Précieux), is a world leading, independently operated, precious metals refining and fabricating company, member of the MKS Group. It was established in 1977 in Ticino, Switzerland .
Originally starting as a minting facility of bars weighing less than 100 grams, and as an alloy specialist for the jewelry and luxury watch-making industries, it has grown to provide vertically integrated services in precious metals, from collection of doré from the mine, through to assaying, hedging and delivery of its bars and other products throughout the world.
The company produces a complete selection of bullion bars, from 12.5 kilograms to 1 gram. In particular, PAMP leads the world market for gold bars of 50 grams or less, and is known for its distinctive Fortuna design, which has done much to widen the vogue for small ingots.
PAMP also provides custom minting service for private companies and government mints. The company’s product range in that field goes from small bars and medals to legal tender coins.
