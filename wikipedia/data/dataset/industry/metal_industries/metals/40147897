Jeffrey A. Brent is a medical toxicologist who is a distinguished clinical professor of medicine and emergency medicine at the University of Colorado and School of Medicine, where he is among the clinical faculty. In addition, he is a professor at the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Colorado School of Public Health. He is also the past president of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, and as of 2010 was editor in chief of the journal Toxicological Reviews, as well as a member of the board of directors of the American College of Medical Toxicology. Most of Brent's research focuses on the use of fomepizole as a treatment for both methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, and he led a trial of this drug which resulted in the FDA approving it for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning in December 1997. Brent is also a senior editor of "Critical Care Toxicology: Diagnosis and Management of the Critically Poisoned Patient," originally published in 2005. The second edition is in production and will be published by Spring 2017 He was one of the U.S. government's experts in the autism omnibus hearing, in which he testified in support of the scientific consensus that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism, and specifically criticized a study by Holmes et al. which the plaintiffs had cited to argue that TCVs were dangerous to a specific subpopulation who were not as good at excreting mercury in hair. He also argued that chelation therapy is of no use as a treatment for autism, and that the signs and symptoms of autism are very different from those of ethylmercury poisoning. Brent is also a member of Toxicology Associates, an academic private practice.
