Dutch metal is a form of brass. The alloy typically consists of 85-88% copper and zinc. It is also known by other names such as "Composition gold leaf", "Dutch gold", "Schlagmetal" and "Schlag leaf".
It is very malleable and ductile and so can be beaten into very thin sheets. These sheets are sold for use as metal leaf or imitation gold leaf. The addition of arsenic produces an alloy with similar properties but coloured white.
