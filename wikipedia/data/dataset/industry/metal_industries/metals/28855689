Salzburgite has a general empirical formula of Pb2Cu2Bi7S12 and an orthorhombic crystal structure. This mineral is very similar to paarite in that they both have nearly the same empirical formulas. They are both of the bismuthinite - aikinite series. Salzburgite was named after the region in which it was found, Salzburg, Austria.
