Metal testing is a process or procedure used to check composition of an unknown metallic substance. There are destructive processes and nondestructive processes. Metal testing can also include, determining the properties of newly forged metal alloys. With many chemical-property databases readily available, identification of unmarked pure,common metals can be a quick and easy process. Leaving the original sample in complete, re-usable condition. This type of testing is nondestructive. When working with alloys (forged mixtures) of metals however, to determine the exact composition, could result in the original sample being separated into its starting materials, then measured and calculated. After the components are known they can be looked up and matched to known alloys. The original sample would be destroyed in the process. This type of testing is destructive.
