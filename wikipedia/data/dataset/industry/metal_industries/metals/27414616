Copper zinc water filtration is a high-purity brass water filtration process that relies on the redox potential of dissolved oxygen in water in the presence of a zinc anode and copper cathode. It uses dissolved impurities within water as constituent substrate, which are reduced to more physiologically inert compounds.
Due to inherent limitations in bactericidal and antiprotozoal activity and poor filtration of organic chemicals (in particular organophosphate pesticides), copper zinc water filters are not commonly used in the household setting unless combined with carbon based systems. They also have application in the industrial setting to extend the life of carbon based filtration systems for waste water effluent.
