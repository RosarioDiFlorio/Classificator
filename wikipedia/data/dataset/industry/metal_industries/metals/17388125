Oxide dispersion strengthened alloys (ODS) are used for high temperature turbine blades and heat exchanger tubing. Alloys of nickel are the most common but work is being done on iron aluminum alloys. ODS steels are used in nuclear applications.
ODS materials are used on space crafts as a layer designed to protect the vehicle, especially during re-entry into the atmosphere. Also, noble metal alloy ODS materials, for example, platinum-based alloys, are used in glass production.
When it comes to re-entry at hypersonic speeds, the properties of gases change dramatically. Shock waves that can cause serious damage on any structure are created. Also at these speeds and temperatures, oxygen becomes very aggressive.
