BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth-largest company (by revenue).
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Angloâ€“Dutch Billiton plc. The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered Limited has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered Plc arm has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In 2017, with most of the former Billiton assets having been spun out into South32, BHP Billiton rebranded itself back to BHP.
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered corporate office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.
