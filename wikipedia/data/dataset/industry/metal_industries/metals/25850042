Welded wire mesh, or welded wire fabric, or "weldmesh" is an electric fusion welded prefabricated joined grid consisting of a series of parallel longitudinal wires with accurate spacing welded to cross wires at the required spacing.
Machines are used to produce the mesh with precise dimensional control. The product can result in considerable savings in time, labour and money.
