Gabrielite is a rare thallium sulfosalt mineral with a chemical formula of Tl6Ag3Cu6(As,Sb)9S21 or Tl2AgCu2As3S7.
It was first reported in 2002 for its occurrence in the Lengenbach quarry, Binntal, Valais, Switzerland, and named after Walter Gabriel (born 1943), a Swiss mineral photographer. This region was transformed during the greenschist-garnet/amphibolite facies of metamorphism. Due to this many rare sulfosalts like gabrielite are found in this part of Switzerland.
