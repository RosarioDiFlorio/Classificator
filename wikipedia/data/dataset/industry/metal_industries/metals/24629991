The Zener–Hollomon parameter is used to help describe high temperature creep strain of a material such as steel.
The Zener–Hollomon parameter is also known as the temperature compensated strain rate.
Z = é exp(Q/RT)
Where é is the strain rate, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature.
It is named after Clarence Zener and John HerbertHollomon, Jr.
