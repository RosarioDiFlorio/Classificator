The KME Group is one of the world's largest copper producers. It was formed from the merging of several copper producers: Kabelmetal AG in Osnabrück (formerly called OKD - Osnabrücker Kupfer und Drahtwerke), Stolberger Metallwerke, Tréfimétaux SA in France, and Europa Metalli.
The Group is under the majority ownership of the SMI (Societa Metallurgica Italiana).
