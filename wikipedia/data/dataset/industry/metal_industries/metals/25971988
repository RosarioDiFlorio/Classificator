Plano-convex ingots are lumps of metal with a flat or slightly concave top and a convex base. They are sometimes, misleadingly, referred to as bun ingots which imply the opposite orientation of concavity. They are most often made of copper although plano-convex ingots of other materials such as copper alloy, lead and tin are also known. Plano convex ingots are found across a wide chronological and geographical range with the first examples known from the Near East during the 3rd and 2nd Millennia BC. By the end of the Bronze Age they were found throughout Europe and in Western and South Asia and similar ingot forms continue in use during later Roman and Medieval periods.
