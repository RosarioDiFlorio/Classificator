A moving crack is a crack that propagates with some speed due to loading and unloading of a metal work material. When loading and unloading is being done, a large fraction of irreversible energy associated with those actions is eventually dissipated as heat and other part is being stored in the work material due to change in material structure and constraints caused dislocation pile-ups, etc. The fraction of heat dissipated in material (
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
  ) depends on type of material of fracture model is being used there. By conducting some experiments, it is found that the fraction 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   dissipated as heat may be as large as 0.85-0.95 for metals, but this value doesn't depend on the magnitude and rate of deformation. So according to work of Mason, 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   can be as small as 0.5 for aluminium and steel at low value of strains only and for titanium at both and low value of strains.
