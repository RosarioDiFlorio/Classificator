Berzelianite is a rare copper selenide mineral with the formula Cu2Se. It occurs as thin dendritic crusts or as fine-grained inclusions. It crystallizes in the isometric system, unlike its dimorph, bellidoite, which crystallizes in the tetragonal system. The crystals are opaque and slightly malleable.
