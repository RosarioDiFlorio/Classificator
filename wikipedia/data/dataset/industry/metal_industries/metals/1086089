Not to be confused with Tobermorite, a Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH), one of the main constituents of cement paste.
Not to be confused with Torbanite, also known as boghead coal, a variety of fine-grained black oil shale.
Torbernite, whose name derives from the Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman (1735–1784), is a radioactive, hydrated green copper uranyl phosphate mineral, found in granites and other uranium-bearing deposits as a secondary mineral. Torbernite is isostructural with the related uranium mineral, autunite.
The chemical formula of torbernite is similar to that of autunite in which a Cu2+ cation replaces a Ca2+. The number of water hydration molecules can vary between 12 and 8, giving rise to the variety of metatorbernite when torbernite spontaneously dehydrates. Their respective chemical compositions are the following:
Torbernite
Cu(UO2)2(PO4)2·12 H2O
Metatorbernite
Cu(UO2)2(PO4)2·8 H2O
Torbernite's most common alternative names are copper uranite and cupro-uranite.
