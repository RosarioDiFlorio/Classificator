Bathgate Industrial Park is an industrial park located in The Bronx, New York City. It is south of the Cross Bronx Expressway, west of Third and Fulton avenues (near Crotona Park), north of Claremont Parkway, and east of Washington Avenue in the Bathgate/Claremont neighborhoods in Bronx Community Board 3 catchment area.
A joint project of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (the PANYNJ leasing it from the NYCEDC) it opened in 1982 and is operated as a non profit organization. It was developed as an incentive to revitalize the South Bronx. The designation of the Bathgate Industrial Park in 1980 involved rezoning a former residential district characterized by vacant land and buildings.
The park, which covers seven city blocks, or 20 acres (8.1 ha), contains eight buildings and has approximately 454,000 square feet of space for light industrial, distribution, office and educational uses. Tenants include a generic drug manufacturer and food distributors, academic and vocational training centers. The Mott Hall Bronx High School and the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science are located on the campus as a child day care center.
