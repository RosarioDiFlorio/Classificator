Ignition Park is a technology park under development in South Bend, Indiana, United States.
It represents the municipal government's response to a decision in 2008 by the Semiconductor Research Corporation's Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI) to locate the fourth of its national research centers, known as the Midwest Institute for Nanoelectronics Discovery (MIND), at the University of Notre Dame.
Ignition Park is one of the two locations that make up Indiana's first two-site State-Certified Technology Park in South Bend. The other is Innovation Park at Notre Dame, located on 12 acres (49,000 m2) on the city's northeast side adjacent to the Notre Dame campus. Innovation Park at Notre Dame facilitates commercialization of many forms of research, by convening innovators throughout the entire Notre Dame community and beyond. Companies formed at Innovation Park may choose to expand their operations at Ignition Park, and by doing so, they'll continue to receive support services and other benefits from being part of the same state-certified technology park.
Ignition Park sits on the grounds of the former Studebaker plant. It will concentrate on high-potential technologies and ventures, as well as the commercialization of nanotechnology concepts inspired by MIND.
