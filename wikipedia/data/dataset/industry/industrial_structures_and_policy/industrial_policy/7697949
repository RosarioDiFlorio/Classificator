This is a list of technology centers throughout the world. Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name "silicon" or "valley" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of Silicon Valley in California. Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.
These metrics include:
How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development funds are spent in the zones
What percentage of local employment is technology related.
If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or both)
If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporates have headquarters there.
If mainly corporate, how much venture capital has been made available to companies in the zone.
What supporting higher educational institutions are located in nearby.
