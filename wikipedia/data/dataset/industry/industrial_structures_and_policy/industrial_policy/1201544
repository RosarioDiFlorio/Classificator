Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (French: Innovation, Sciences et Développement économique Canada), or ISED, formerly Industry Canada, is the department of the Government of Canada with a mandate of fostering a growing, competitive, knowledge-based Canadian economy. The Department headquarters are located at the C.D. Howe Building at 235 Queen Street in Ottawa, Ontario.
Upon the November 2015 installation of the 29th Canadian Ministry, led by newly-elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the position of Minister of Industry was re-named Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, and Industry Canada was subsequently re-named Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.
