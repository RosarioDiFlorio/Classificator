The Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS) is an agro park in Seri Kembangan, Petaling District, Selangor, Malaysia. It is the largest agro park in Malaysia and Asia. It was created under an initiative by the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture to be a venue for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE), especially for those catering towards the agriculture, horticulture and agrotourism field.
MAEPS is situated to the south of the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute. It is accessible via the South Klang Valley Expressway.
The convention centre has four halls (Halls A to D), which are situated on 368 acres (149 hectares) of land. The buildings and outdoor spaces were designed to bring out the best of the surrounding landscape.
The Malaysia Agriculture, Horticulture and Agrotourism Show (MAHA) is held here once every two years. The last was held in 2016.
