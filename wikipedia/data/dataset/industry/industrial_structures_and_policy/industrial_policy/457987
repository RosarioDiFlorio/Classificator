Logan Botanic Garden is a botanical garden located near Port Logan on the Rhins of Galloway, at the south-western tip of Scotland.
Logan, like Dawyck in the Scottish Borders and Benmore in Argyll and Bute, is an outpost or Regional Garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.
The area has a mild climate due to the influence of the North Atlantic drift. The combination of this and the sheltered aspect of the gardens enables plants to be cultivated which would not normally survive outdoors in Scotland, with species from as far away as Chile, Vietnam and New Zealand all thriving in Logan's borders. Features of Logan include a sizable Walled Garden complete with formal fish pond, the newly built eco-Conservatory housing a variety of South African plants, Tasmanian Creek area, and Discovery Centre which houses various exhibitions throughout the seasons.
The garden is also home to Plant Heritage's National Plant Collections of Gunnera, Griselinia and Leptospermum.
Current opening times are March to October 10.00am - 5.00pm daily. Admission charges are: Adult £6.50, Concessions £5.50, Children Under 15 go free.
