The Research Triangle Park (RTP) is one of the largest research parks in the world. It is named for the three hub cities of Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill, or more properly for the three major research universities in those three cities (Duke University, NC State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill respectively). The Research Triangle region of North Carolina received its name as an extension of the name of the park. Besides the three anchor cities, the park is also bounded by the communities of Morrisville and Cary and the proposed annexations to the town of Pittsboro would also bring that community into close contact with the RTP. Approximately one fourth of the park's territory lies in Wake County, but the majority of its land is in Durham County.
