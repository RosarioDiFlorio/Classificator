Silicon Beach is the Westside region of the Los Angeles metropolitan area that is home to over 500 tech startup companies, with emphasis on the coastal strip north of LAX to Santa Monica Mountains, but the term may be applied loosely or colloquially to refer to most anywhere in the LA Basin. Major technology companies have opened offices in the region including Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, BuzzFeed, Facebook, Salesforce, AOL, Electronic Arts, EdgeCast Networks, and MySpace. In 2012, the region was considered the second- or third-hottest tech hub in the world, according to some metrics. Nevertheless, the headquarters of these established corporate tech titans tends to be elsewhere, though the region has had startups proliferation. Unlike the traditional definition of Silicon Valley (Menlo Park to Santa Clara) where the economy is overwhelmingly technology geared, Silicon Beach, much like San Francisco, tends to have a more diversified economy whereby tourism, finance, and/or other industries also play a major role.
