The Good Design Award (グッドデザイン賞, Guddo-dezain-shō) is Japanese comprehensive design evaluation and commendation system, operated by the Japan Institute of Design Promotion (formerly known as the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization). The system has its origins in the “Good Design Selection System” (known as the “G-Mark System”) instituted by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan in 1957.
The award system was established based on the belief that good design is essential and indispensable to everyday life of people after the Pacific war, and that the good design shall give people prosperous lives through the eminent power of good designs. More than 1,000 companies and designers submit entries for consideration for the Good Design Awards each year. These entries are screened by distinguished design experts who are selected by JIDPO from various industries for assessing those worthy of the Good Design Awards. The main deciding factor for the Award selection is always based on whether or not product can bless and enrich society and people's lives through its design.
Approximately 35,000 awards have been given since the inception.
