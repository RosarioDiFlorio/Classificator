The Optical Media Board, formerly known as the Videogram Regulatory Board, is a national agency under the Office of the President responsible for regulating the production, use and distribution of recording media in the Philippines.
Under Republic Act 9239, the former Videogram Regulatory Board was renamed and reorganized in response to the increasing popularity of VCD and DVD players in the country during the early 2000s, and consequently the widespread piracy of optical media such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs. It has conducted, and thus earned a reputation, for numerous raids on flea market stalls and similar establishments selling bootleg media.
