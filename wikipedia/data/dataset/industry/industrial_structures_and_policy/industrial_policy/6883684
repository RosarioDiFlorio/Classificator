The Tea Board of India is a state agency of the Government of India established to promote the cultivation, processing, and domestic trade as well as export of tea from India. It was established by the enactment of the Tea Act in 1953 with its headquarters in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). It is headed by the Deputy Chairman Mr. Santosh Sarangi, IAS and separated into Standing Committees referred to as the Executive Committee, the Development Committee, the Labour Welfare Committee and the Export Promotion Committee.
The Tea Board India is responsible for the assignment of certification numbers to exports of certain tea merchants. This certification is intended to ensure the teas’ origin, which in turn would reduce the amount of fraudulent labelling on rare teas such as ones harvested in Darjeeling. The excessive amounts of ‘ faux’ Darjeeling tea sold on the global market relates in stark opposition to the fraction of exporters which are licensed by the Tea Board India as legitimate traders of this region.
The Tea Board India’s tasks include endorsement of the diverse production and productivity of tea, financial support of research organisations and the monitoring of advances in tea packaging as it relates to health beneficial aspects.
It coordinates research institutes, the tea trade and government bodies, ensuring the technical support of the tea trade in the global industry.
Offices are located in Kolkata, London, Moscow and Dubai.
