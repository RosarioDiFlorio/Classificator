The Golden Corridor is the area around the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (Interstate 90), formerly known as the Northwest Tollway, in the Chicago metropolitan area. It is coined as such since the corridor generates a "gold" mine of economic profit for communities in the area. Several Fortune 500 company headquarters, office parks, industrial parks, exhibition and entertainment centers, medical facilities, hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants are located along the Golden Corridor. With the exception of the O'Hare area of Chicago, all of the communities located in this region are part of a larger region known as the "Northwest Suburbs".
