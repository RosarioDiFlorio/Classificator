Manuel "Mar" Araneta Roxas II (born May 13, 1957) is a Filipino politician and the grandson of former Philippine President Manuel Roxas. He served in the Cabinet of the Philippines as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government from 2012 to 2015. Previously, he was the Secretary of Trade and Industry from 2000 to 2003, a Senator from 2004 to 2010, and Secretary of Transportation and Communications from 2011 to 2012. He is the son of former Senator Gerry Roxas.
After gaining a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Roxas worked as an investment banker in New York, mobilizing venture capital funds for small and medium enterprises. He served as the Representative of the 1st District of Capiz from 1993 to 2000. His stint as congressman was cut short after he was appointed by President Joseph Estrada as Secretary of Trade and Industry. He resigned from the position at the height of the EDSA Revolution of 2001 and was later re-appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in her new cabinet. He resigned again to run for a Senate seat in the 2004 election. He was elected senator with 19 million votes, the highest ever garnered by a national candidate in any Philippine election. Roxas co-authored the Expanded Value Added Tax Law (E-Vat).
Initially one of the leading contenders in the 2010 presidential election, he slid down to become a vice-presidential candidate in order to make way for fellow senator Benigno Aquino III, who won. Roxas was defeated by Makati mayor Jejomar Binay of the PDPâ€“Laban by a margin of 727,084 votes. He filed an electoral protest with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, the Court sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal. On June 7, 2011, President Aquino appointed Roxas as Secretary of Transportation and Communications to replace outgoing secretary Jose de Jesus, and he took office on July 4, 2011. Afterwards, on August 31, 2012, President Aquino nominated him as Secretary of Interior and Local Government, replacing Jesse Robredo who died in a plane crash.
Roxas was the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party for the 2016 presidential election. He was officially endorsed by President Aquino to continue the present administration's reforms, collectively dubbed Daang Matuwid ("straight path"), which he formally accepted on July 31, 2015. On August 3, 2015, Roxas officially tendered his resignation as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government in order to focus on his presidential campaign. On May 10, 2016, a day after the election, Roxas conceded to Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte.
