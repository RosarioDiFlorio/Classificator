It is also called Zhuhai National Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone.
In December, 1992, the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved the establishment of Zhuhai National High-Tech Industrial Development District, with an initial area of 9.8 square kilometers. Following a 1999 adjustment, it now includes four industrial parks: Nanping (南屏), Sanzao (三灶), Baijiao (白蕉) and Xinqing (新青), and an innovation coast.
