The Hanshin Industrial Region (阪神工業地帯, Hanshin Kōgyō Chitai) is one of the largest industrial regions in Japan. Its name comes from the on-reading of the kanji used to abbreviate the names of Osaka (大阪) and Kobe (神戸), the two largest cities in the megalopolis. The GDP of this area (Osaka and Kobe) is $341 billion, one of the world's most productive regions.
