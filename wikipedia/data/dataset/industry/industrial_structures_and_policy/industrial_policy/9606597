Teheranno (alternatively Teheran-ro, translation "Tehran Boulevard") is a street in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea. It runs from Gangnam Station through Yeoksam-dong and into Samseong-dong. It is colloquially known as "Teheran Valley" (after Silicon Valley) due to the number of internet-related companies operating there. The district of Gangnam-gu experienced phenomenal growth and waves of construction, with Teheranno becoming one of the busiest streets in South Korea. Its counterpart, Seoul St. in Tehran, runs in the north of that city, close to the Evin district.
Teheranno is a 3.5 km section of Korean Highway 90, and runs eastwards from Gangnam Station to Samseong Station and the COEX/KWTC complex. Yeoksam and Seolleung stations are also on Teheranno. All stations are on Seoul Subway Line 2.
Some of Korea's tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate are in Teheranno, while Seoul Metropolitan Government estimates that more than half of Korea's venture capital, some 200,000,000,000 won (approximately $200,000,000), is invested in Teheran Valley.
