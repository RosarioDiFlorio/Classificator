Founded in 1954 by Ben G. Stone, SCAFCO Corporation (now the Stone Group of Companies) is a privately held company headquartered in Spokane, Washington. Initially producing steel culvert for the construction industry as Spokane Culvert And Fabrication Company, SCAFCO expanded in 1961 to manufacture grain storage systems and again in 1994 to produce steel framing products. The original culvert product division was sold in 1986, and the name was changed to simply SCAFCO. Both divisions currently operate out of two 75,000-square-foot (7,000 m2) manufacturing facilities in Spokane, Washington.
SCAFCO manufactures many types of steel products including Grain Storage Bins and Silos, Water Tanks, Steel Studs, Steel Framing Equipment, Curved and Slotted Track, and Resilient Sound Channel. SCAFCO's grain storage systems have been installed in over 80 countries worldwide.
As of 2017, the President and CEO is Lawrence Stone.
