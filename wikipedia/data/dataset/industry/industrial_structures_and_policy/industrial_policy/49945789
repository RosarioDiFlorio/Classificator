The West Baltimore Innovation Village District is a neighborhood district of Baltimore City that will specialize in attracting startup companies and other employers to West Baltimore. Following the Death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent 2015 Baltimore protests, government leaders decided to launch the innovation district as a way to attract redevelopment and revitalization to the areas hardest hit by the protests. The district includes the neighborhoods of Mondawmin, Coppin Heights, Penn-North, Reservoir Hill and Bolton Hill.
