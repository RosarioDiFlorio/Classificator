The Cambridge Science Park, founded by Trinity College in 1970, is the oldest science park in the United Kingdom. It is a concentration of science and technology related businesses, and has strong links with the nearby University of Cambridge.
The science park is situated about 3 km to the north of Cambridge city centre, by junction 33 of the A14, in the parish of Milton, contiguous with Cambridge itself.
