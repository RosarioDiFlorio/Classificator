A Megasite or Mega-Site is a land development by private developers, Universities, or governments to promote business clusters. These organizations develop the land so that it is "shovel ready" for big business, by improving the infrastructure (roads, utilities, and landscape). Megasites can be an industrial district, business park, research park, science park, commercial district, tourist park or a combination of these.
