Route 128 (designated as the Yankee Division Highway) is a state highway in Massachusetts, maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning 57 miles (92 km) along a generally south-north axis, it forms a beltway roughly 15 miles (24 km) outside of Boston. The original 128, called the "Circumferential Highway," followed existing roadways in Boston suburbs and was designated in 1927. The present-day 128 exists as a controlled-access highway and was the first limited-access circumferential highway in the United States, the first segment of which opened in 1951.
Its southern terminus was previously located at the Braintree Split in Braintree; presently, it exists at the interchange with Interstate 93 (I-93), Interstate 95 (I-95), and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Canton. Despite no longer carrying this designation, the section of highway between Braintree and Canton continues to be informally called 128 within Massachusetts. At its current terminus, 128 begins running concurrently with I-95 and US 1. While its concurrency with US 1 ends in Dedham, its concurrency with I-95 continues as it intersects with expressways including I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) in Weston; US 20 in Waltham; Route 2 in Lexington; US 3 in Burlington (with which it runs concurrently within the town); and I-93 and US 1 again in Reading and Lynnfield, respectively. 128 and I-95 split in Peabody; as I-95 continues north towards New Hampshire, 128 travels east towards its northern terminus at an interchange with Route 127A in Gloucester.
In local culture, 128 is recognized as an informal dividing line between the inner municipalities of Greater Boston and the more distant suburbs. It delimits the areas accessible by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transit system, and is used to reference the high-technology industry that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the suburban areas along the highway.
