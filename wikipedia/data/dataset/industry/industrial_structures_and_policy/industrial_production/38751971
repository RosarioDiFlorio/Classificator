The FORAN System is an integrated CAD/CAM/CAE system developed by SENER for the design and production of practically any naval ship and offshore unit. It is a multidisciplinary and integrated system that can be used in all the ship design and production phases and disciplines. The System collects all the information in a single database. FORAN is mainly focused on the design of:
Merchants, Ro-Pax, Ro-Ro, bulk carriers, chemical tankers, container ships and cement and oil tankers.
Navy vessels (surface ships and submarines), in which the systems allows to carry out configuration control, analyze different design alternatives (prototypes), handle advanced hull forms and manage materials and special standards, as well as introducing customized criteria.
Specific vessels, tugs and workboats, hotel vessels, fishing vessels, fish transport vessels, oceanographic vessels, etc.
For use in the offshore industry such as floating platforms (both anchored and fixed), staff transportation services, anchor vessels and vessels for applications such as supply, rescue, firefighting or anti-pollution.

The latest version of the integrated CAD/CAM/CAE system is FORAN V70.
