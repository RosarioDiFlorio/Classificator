Domar aggregation is an approach to aggregating growth measures associated with industries to make larger sector or national aggregate growth rates. The issue comes up in the context of national accounts and multifactor productivity statistics.
The objective is to construct growth rate of an aggregate, a sector or national total, as a weighted average of the growth rates of its components. The term Domar weights refers to the weights of the components, and refers to a ratio of the industry's gross output to another output measure. The growth of an industry sector's multifactor productivity after a Domar aggregation sums the weighted level of each industry's rate of multifactor productivity growth weighted by the ratio of the market value of the "industry's output to the final product of the sector."
This methodology was introduced by Evsey Domar (1961). Economist Charles Hulten later developed this theory and showed its implementation in a model of a closed economy. According to a later work, Hulten (1978)'s weights are "observed expenditure shares," and in that model "the first-order impact on output of a TFP shock to a firm or an industry is equal to that industry or firmâ€™s sales as a share of output."
