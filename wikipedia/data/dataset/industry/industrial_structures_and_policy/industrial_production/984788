The read-through, table-read, or table work is a stage of film, television, radio, and theatre production when an organized reading around a table of the screenplay or script by the actors with speaking parts is conducted.
In addition to the cast members with speaking parts, the read-through is usually attended by the principal financiers or studio executives, producers, heads of department, writers, and directors. It is generally attended only by people involved in the production. It is usually the first time everyone involved in the production will have gathered together and it is traditional for everyone to introduce themselves by both name and job. The director may then open proceedings by making a short speech outlining his or her aspirations for the project.
An additional professional actor not otherwise involved in the production may be hired to read the non-dialogue parts of the script such as scene headings and action. These parts of the script are usually edited down severely for the purposes of the read-through to keep the pace of the reading up.
