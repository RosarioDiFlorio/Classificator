Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is the management of integrated multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects, including the product (i.e., facilities), work processes and organization of the design - construction - operation team in order to support explicit and public business objectives.
The theoretical basis of VDC includes:
Engineering modeling methods: product, organization, process
Analysis methods - Model-based design: including quantities, schedule, cost, 4D interactions and process risks, these are termed Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools
Visualization methods
Business metrics - within Business analytics - and a focus on strategic management
Economic impact analysis, i.e., models of both the cost and value of capital investments
