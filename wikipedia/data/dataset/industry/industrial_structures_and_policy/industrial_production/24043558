ScanIP is a 3D image processing and model generation app developed by Synopsys Inc. to visualise, analyse, quantify, segment and export 3D image data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), microtomography and other modalities for computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and 3D printing. The app is used in the life sciences, materials science, nondestructive testing, reverse engineering and petrophysics.
Segmented images can be exported in the STL file format, surface meshes and point clouds, to CAD and 3D printing or, with the FE module, exported as surface/volume meshes directly into leading computer-aided engineering (CAE) solvers. The CAD and NURBS add-on modules can be used to integrate CAD objects into image data, and to convert scan data into NURBS-based models for CAD. The SOLID, FLOW and LAPLACE add-on modules can be used to calculate effective material properties from scanned samples using homogenisation techniques.
