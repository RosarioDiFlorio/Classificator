The Allied Quality Assurance Publications (AQAP) are standards for quality assurance systems that have been developed by NATO 
The aim of the AQAP agreement is to define standards for Quality Assurance of defence products. These standards are an integral part of contracts awarded in the military field involving NATO member countries. AQAP documents are therefore important to contractors and companies wanting to bid for such contracts.
The AQAP system is described in STANAG 4107 issued by the NATO Standardization Agency. There are currently two main types of AQAP documents; Contractual Type which are written as a Technical Specification intended for contractual use; and Guidance Type which provide general guidance.
