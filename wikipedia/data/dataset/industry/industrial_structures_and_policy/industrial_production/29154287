Good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) is a GxP guideline for laboratory samples from clinical studies.
Good clinical practice (GCP) does not define requirements for laboratories and good laboratory practice (GLP) focusses on pre-clinical analyses and not on human samples from clinical trials. The Research Quality Association (RQA) suggested in 2003 a guideline to close the gap. Later the World Health Organization and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency issued their own versions of a GCLP guideline.
