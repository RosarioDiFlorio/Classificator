A lid, also known as a cover, is part of a container, and serves as the closure or seal, usually one that completely closes the object.
Lids can be placed on small containers such as tubs as well as larger lids for open-head pails and drums.
Some lids have a security strip or a tamper-evident band to hold the lid on securely until opening is desired or authorized. These are usually irreversible to indicate that the container has been opened.
