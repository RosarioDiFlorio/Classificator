Vendor Bid Analysis (Vendor analysis) is a technique used to figure out the cost of a project by comparing the bids submitted by many suppliers. This can be accomplished by considering the costs (via quotes, bids, proposals, etc) presented for project work. By using a selection criteria divided into categories, vendor proposals have to meet these criteria or may be eliminated.
