Bottle variation is the degree to which different bottles, nominally of the same product, can have different taste, smell, etc.
There are many possible causes of bottle variation:
variation in the contents prior to packaging
variation in the packaging components
variation in the product and packaging processes
variation in storage, distribution, cold chain, etc.
variation in the quantity of contents
