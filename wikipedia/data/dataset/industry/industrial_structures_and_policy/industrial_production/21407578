Owner's Engineer, also known as the Client's Engineer, is a term often given to the representative of the commissioning company of a construction or engineering project.
Most often, an Owner's Engineer is a subcontracted role; undertaken to protect the owner's interests by ensuring that the technical and build contractors are adhering sufficiently to the project specification. Owner's Engineers also fill gaps in resources and expertise for a project.
