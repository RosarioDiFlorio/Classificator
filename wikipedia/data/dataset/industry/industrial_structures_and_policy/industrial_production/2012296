The Calico M960 is a 9Ã—19mm (Luger/Parabellum) caliber semi-automatic carbine (fully automatic versions are available only to authorized law enforcement and military), manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems. Its features include its high-capacity, cylindrical, helical-feed magazine and retractable stock. This method allows magazine capacities of 50 and 100 rounds in a relatively small space. The rear sight is mounted as part of the plastic magazine shell.
