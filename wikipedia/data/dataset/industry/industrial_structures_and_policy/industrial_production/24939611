The M1944 Hyde Carbine was an attempt by George Hyde to manufacture a light rifle for the US Armed Forces. The overall weapon was based on the Thompson Submachine Gun which Hyde himself designed many of his weapons on.
An original .30 Carbine calibre carbine based on the M1921/27 variants, it worked well but due to the war effort was found expensive for mass production and its weight defied the concept of a Light Rifle.
The M1944 Hyde Carbine came with a quick barrel change device similar to the MG42 and pressed steel components to ease production/reduce weight. The M1944 Hyde Carbine was more reliable and accurate than the M1 Carbine that was adopted and also came with the capability of select fire, which made it close to the likes of the StG-44.
