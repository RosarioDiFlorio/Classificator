The L0 Series (Japanese: L0系, Hepburn: Eru-zero-kei, "L zero series") is a high-speed maglev train that the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) is developing and testing. JR Central plans to use the L0 Series on the Chūō Shinkansen railway line between Tokyo and Osaka, which is under construction.
The L0 Series uses the Japanese-designed SCMaglev system. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo, a subsidiary of JR Central, are building fourteen pre-production vehicles.
A seven-car train set a land speed record for rail vehicles of 603 km/h (375 mph) on 21 April 2015. The trains are planned to run at a maximum speed of 505 km/h (314 mph), offering journey times of 40 minutes between Tokyo (Shinagawa Station) and Nagoya, and 1 hour 7 minutes between Tokyo and Osaka.
