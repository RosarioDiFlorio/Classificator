Unlike traditional factoring, where a supplier wants to finance her receivables, reverse factoring (or supply chain financing) is a financing solution initiated by the ordering party in order to help its suppliers to finance its receivables more easily and at a lower interest rate than what would normally be offered. In 2011, the reverse factoring market was still very small, accounting for less than 3% of the factoring market.
