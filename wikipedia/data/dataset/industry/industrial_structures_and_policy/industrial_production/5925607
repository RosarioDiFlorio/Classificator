In economics and business administration literature, David A. Schon introduced the notion of bootlegging in 1963. Bootlegging is defined as research in which motivated individuals secretly organize the innovation process. It usually is a bottom-up, non-programmed activity, without the official permission of the responsible management, but for the benefit of the company. It is not in the departmentâ€™s action plan nor are there any formal resources allocated towards it (Augsdorfer 1996). Bootlegging causes an ethical dilemma because there is a conflict between moral imperatives (management's action plan and the task to innovate).
