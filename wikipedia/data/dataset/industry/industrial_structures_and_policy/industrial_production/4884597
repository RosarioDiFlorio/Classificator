The Scion Fuse is a concept car created under one of Toyota's brands, Scion. The Fuse was built by Five Axis Models in Huntington Beach, CA with assistance from MillenWorks. It was first introduced at the 2006 New York International Auto Show. According to Scion, the Fuse is a 2-door coupe with 4 seats and swan doors for clearer ground clearance.
The Fuse uses a DOHC gasoline I4 engine equipped with multi-port fuel-injection and VVT-i. The engine's compression ratio is 9.6:1, and is rated at 160 hp (119 kW) and 163 lb·ft (221 N·m) of torque.
The Fuse uses very high-tech instruments in it along with a highly sophisticated steer by wire system. Inside the Fuse are video, driving, and car configurations that can make driving around a bit easier. With the help of the Wi-Fi connection that is built into the Fuse, the driver and passengers can instant message one of their friends; much like how a computer or a mobile phone does. Also, the front passenger seat can fold down to create a table, footrest, or just as extra cargo space.
