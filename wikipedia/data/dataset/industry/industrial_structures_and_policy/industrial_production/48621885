Netzler & Dahlgren Co AB, or NDC for short, was a Swedish company founded in 1962 by GÃ¶ran Netzler and Anders Dahlgren. The initial business idea was to build customized electronics equipment. Over the years, NDC evolved into a technology platform provider (navigation, hardware, software) for AGV (automated guided vehicle) builders. Danaher acquired NDC in 2001.
