The Lola B08/80 is a Le Mans Prototype built by Lola Cars International. It is effectively the LMP2 version of the larger Lola B08/60; they are the first closed-cockpit sports prototypes built by Lola since the T92/10 of 1992. The B08/80 is optimised for the smaller engines and lighter weight of the LMP2 category in comparison to the larger and heavier B08/60.

The first chassis of the B08/80 is used by the joint Speedy Racing Team and Sebah Automotive outfits in the Le Mans Series as well as at 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team's car uses the latest V8 engine from Judd. A second car was entered by B-K Motorsports and Mazda in the American Le Mans Series, debuting at the Petit Le Mans in October 2008, while a third B08/80 chassis was sold to Ray Mallock Ltd. and completed with parts from the team's former B05/40 to create the MG-Lola EX265C for the Le Mans Series. B-K Motorsports closed shop in late 2008 and sold their car to Dyson Racing. 2009 LMS season saw the B08/80 being the 2nd fastest LMP2, behind the Essex Porsche.
