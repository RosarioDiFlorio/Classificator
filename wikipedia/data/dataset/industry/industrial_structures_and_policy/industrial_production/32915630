The KiHa 160 (キハ160形) was a single-car diesel multiple unit (DMU) train operated by Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido) on the Hidaka Main Line in Japan. A single car was built in 1997 by Niigata Tekko (now Niigata Transys) to replace the KiHa 130 DMU car (KiHa 130-5) withdrawn due to collision damage sustained in a level crossing accident in January 1996. From 2007, the unit was rebuilt as an experimental hybrid car, branded "Inno Tech Train", before being finally withdrawn in fiscal 2013.
