The Mercedes-Benz W194 (also 300 SL) was the Mercedes-Benz entry for the 1952 Sportscar racing season, its first after World War II.
Powered by a 3.0 litre SOHC straight-6, it ran off an impressive string of victories that included 24 Hours of Le Mans, Bern-Bremgarten, the Eifelrennen at NÃ¼rburgring, and Mexico's Carrera Panamericana.
Only ten W194s were made. It was succeeded by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR on the track, and led to the iconic Mercedes 300 SL W198 Gullwing road car in 1954.
