The Felicity effect is an effect observed during acoustic emission in a structure undergoing repeated mechanical loading. It negates the effect of emission silence in the structure that is often observed from the related Kaiser effect at high loads. A material demonstrating the Felicity effect gives off acoustic emission at a lower load than one previously reached in an increasing load cycle regime.
