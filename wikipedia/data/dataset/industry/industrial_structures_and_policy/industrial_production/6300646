Electromagnetic Testing (ET), as a form of nondestructive testing, is the process of inducing electric currents or magnetic fields or both inside a test object and observing the electromagnetic response. If the test is set up properly, a defect inside the test object creates a measurable response.
The term "Electromagnetic Testing" is often intended to mean simply Eddy Current Testing (ECT). However, with an expanding number of electromagnetic and magnetic test methods, "Electromagnetic Testing" is more often used to mean the whole class of electromagnetic test methods, of which Eddy-Current Testing is just one.
