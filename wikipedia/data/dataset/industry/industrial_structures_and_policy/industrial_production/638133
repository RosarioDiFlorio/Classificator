Product data management (PDM) is the business function often within product lifecycle management (PLM) that is responsible for the management and publication of product data. In software engineering, this is known as version control. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained.
