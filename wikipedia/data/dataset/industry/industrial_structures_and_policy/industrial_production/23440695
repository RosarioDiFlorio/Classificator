ISO 31000 is a family of standards relating to risk management codified by the International Organization for Standardization. The purpose of ISO 31000:2009 is to provide principles and generic guidelines on risk management. ISO 31000 seeks to provide a universally recognised paradigm for practitioners and companies employing risk management processes to replace the myriad of existing standards, methodologies and paradigms that differed between industries, subject matters and regions.
Currently, the ISO 31000 family is expected to include:
ISO 31000:2009 – Principles and Guidelines on Implementation
ISO/IEC 31010:2009 – Risk Management – Risk Assessment Techniques
ISO Guide 73:2009 – Risk Management – Vocabulary
ISO also designed its ISO 21500 Guidance on Project Management standard to align with ISO 31000:2009.
