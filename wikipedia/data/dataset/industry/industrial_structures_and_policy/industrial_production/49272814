Mesoscale manufacturing is the process of creating components and products in a range of approximately from 0.1mm to 5mm with high accuracy and precision using a wide variety of engineering materials. Mesomanufacturing processes are filling the gap between macro- and micromanufacturing processes and overlaps both of them. (see picture). Other manufacturing technologies are nanoscale (< 100 nm), microscale (100 nm to 100 Âµm) and macroscale manufacturing (> 0.5 mm).
