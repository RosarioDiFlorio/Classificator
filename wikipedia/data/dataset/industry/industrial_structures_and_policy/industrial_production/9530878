In the American entertainment industry, the studio zone, also known as the thirty-mile zone (TMZ) is the area marked roughly around a 30-mile (48 km) radius from the intersection of West Beverly Boulevard and North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, which at one time was the location of the headquarters of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the negotiating body for most studio management. This area includes almost all of the southern half of Los Angeles County, as well as slices of eastern Ventura County and northwestern Orange County.
Entertainment industry unions currently use this area to determine rates and work rules for union workers. The zone also largely determined the location and success of the original movie ranches in or near Hollywood. In addition, the studio zone includes some locations that technically lie outside the 30-mile radius. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Conejo Ranch property near Thousand Oaks in Ventura County, and Castaic Lake in northwest Los Angeles County were included.
In 2010, additional locations were added: Agua Dulce, the entire community of Castaic (in addition to Castaic Lake), Leo Carrillo State Park, Moorpark, Ontario International Airport, Piru, and Pomona (including the Fairplex of which a small portion is jurisdictionally in La Verne). With respect to the locations added in 2010, producers are required to grant reasonable requests to actors for hotel accommodations if the locations listed above lie over four miles outside of the original thirty mile zone. Other locations rejected in negotiations included adding Lancaster and Port Hueneme to the zone. Furthermore, the addition of Pomona to the studio zone has led to an increase in filming in that city.
