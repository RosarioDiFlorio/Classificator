The Isuzu 4200R is a midship engine sports car that Isuzu displayed at the 1989 Tōkyo Motor Show. The development theme was establishment of a sporty performance and image, in a traditional European taste. Lotus and Isuzu were connected at time, both being in the GM group, and Shirō Nakamura who was with Isuzu (later changed to Nissan) worked together with a designer from Lotus to create a dynamic, elegant style.
It is notable that while being a mid engine car, it was designed to accommodate two adults and two children, and is practical enough to use for long drives. The transversely mounted engine was Isuzu's newly developed 4.2L, DOHC 32 valve V8 engine, and its light weight and high power was it strong point. The active suspension was developed in conjunction with Lotus, and it balanced both control stability and ride quality. The interior contained a automotive navigation system, a video deck, high performance audio system and even a fax machine.
The commercial sale of the 4200R combining high tech and sportiness was strongly desired by fans. Isuzu also prototyped a 3.5L, V12 DOHC engine, and performed test drives with it mounted in a Lotus F1. Isuzu went on to mount this engine in a midship, multipurpose car, the Isuzu Como, and displayed it at the Tōkyo Motor show of the same year.
However, in 1993, Isuzu ceased the development and manufacture of all small passenger cars, and has focused only on commercial vehicles since 2002.
