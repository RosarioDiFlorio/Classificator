6P62 (6П62) is the GRAU designation of a Russian hand-held fully automatic anti-materiel rifle chambered for the 12.7×108mm round. At 100 meters it can penetrate up to 20 mm of RHA steel.
Only one similar weapon was ever constructed, the KPB-12.7 (КПБ-12,7). It was intended as a hand-held machine gun. Some sources state the weapon was uncontrollable when shoulder fired in fully automatic mode. The recoil-reducing system allowed this weapon to be fired from the shoulder, but it still had an insufficient reliability and an insufficient accuracy in single shots, and accurate bursts were also all but impossible from such large caliber but lightweight weapon with a limited magazine capacity.
