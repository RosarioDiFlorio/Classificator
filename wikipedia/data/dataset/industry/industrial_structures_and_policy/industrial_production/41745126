The Rapier 6 (also known as the Rapier SR2) was a sports prototype racing car built by LM3000 in 1999. It used a 3-litre Nissan V6 engine, and Team Sovereign ran the car in the FIA Sportscar Championship (then known as the Sports Racing World Cup). The car achieved moderate success, and Team Sovereign retired it at the end of the 2003 season, after the series folded. In 2011, it reappeared in the Britcar series, being driven by Mike Millard.
