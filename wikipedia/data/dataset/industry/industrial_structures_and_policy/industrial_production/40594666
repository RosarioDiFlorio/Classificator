The Ford Mustang GTP was an American race car constructed to compete in the IMSA GTP series by Ford in 1983, based on the "Fox-Body" generation of the Ford Mustang road car. In 1983 the engine was a 1.7 liter twin turbo supplied by Zakspeed. In 1984 it used a 2.1-litre turbocharged variant of the Ford Cosworth BDA straight-four engine, capable of producing around 600 hp (447 kW; 608 PS); unusually for an IMSA GTP car, the engine was fitted in the front of the car. Zakspeed would replace the car with the Ford Mustang Probe for 1985, while Roush Performance would build the more successful V8-powered Ford Mustang Maxum GTP in 1987.
