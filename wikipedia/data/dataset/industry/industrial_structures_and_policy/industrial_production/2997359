A project management office, abbreviated to PMO, is a group or department within a business, agency or enterprise that defines and maintains standards for project management within the organization. The PMO strives to standardize and introduce economies of repetition in the execution of projects. The PMO is the source of documentation, guidance and metrics on the practice of project management and execution.
Darling & Whitty (2016) identify the definition of the PMO's function has evolved over time:
The 1800s project office was a type of national governance of the agricultural industry
1939 appears as the earliest instance of the term 'project management office' being published
The 1950s concept of the PMO is representative of what a contemporary PMO looks like
Today the PMO is a dynamic entity used to solve specific issues
Often PMOs base project management principles on industry-standard methodologies such as PRINCE2 or guidelines such as PMBOK.
