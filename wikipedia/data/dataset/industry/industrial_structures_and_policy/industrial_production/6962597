Tank Ex, or MBT Ex, was the code name of the main battle tank developed by the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 2002. It was rumoured the tank would be called Karna, after one of the heroes of the Indian epic The Mahabharata. Tank Ex was developed as a second attempt after the development of the Ajeya (an upgraded T-72) by DRDO in order to capitalize on the technology developed for that project. It underwent six months of trials, but was subsequently rejected by the Indian Army. At least two Tank Ex prototypes were built.
