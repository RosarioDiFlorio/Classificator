Supply-chain security refers to efforts to enhance the security of the supply chain, the transport and logistics system for the world's cargo. It combines traditional practices of supply-chain management with the security requirements driven by threats such as terrorism, piracy, and theft.
Typical supply-chain security activities include:
Credentialing of participants in the supply chain
Screening and validating of the contents of cargo being shipped
Advance notification of the contents to the destination country
Ensuring the security of cargo while in-transit via the use of locks and tamper-proof seals
Inspecting cargo on entry
