A specification tree shows all specifications of a technical system under development in a hierarchical order.
For a spacecraft system it has the following levels:
System (requirements) specification - generated by customer
System (design to) specification - generated by system responsible prime contractor
Subsystem specifications - generated by system responsible prime contractor
Assembly¹ specifications - generated by subsystem responsible contractors
Unit specifications - generated by subsystem (or assembly) responsible contractors.

¹ An assembly level is defined as intermediate level when the subsystem contractor prefers to contract a group of units with complex interfaces to another contractor (for instance the operating system and subsystem application software can be an assembly of the data management subsystem).
