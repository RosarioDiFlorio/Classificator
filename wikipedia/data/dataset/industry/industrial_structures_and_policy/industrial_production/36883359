A dynamic manufacturing network (DMN) is a coalition, either permanent or temporal, comprising production systems of geographically dispersed small and medium enterprises and/or original equipment manufacturers that collaborate in a shared value-chain to conduct joint manufacturing.
Manufacturing networks have become increasingly common in applied research on manufacturing, since several manufacturing enterprises have recently shown great interest for creating such networks and take advantage of them both for collaborative product development  and for supply chain optimization.
During the last decade the effort is mainly focused on the dynamic management of the manufacturing networks, as proven by several studies published by Accenture, MIT  and University of St.Gallen
