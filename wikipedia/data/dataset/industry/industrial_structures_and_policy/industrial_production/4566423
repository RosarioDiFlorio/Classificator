PREview (Process and Requirements Viewpoints) is a requirements method which focuses on the early stage of Requirements Engineering: discovering and documenting requirements. PREview uses a Viewpoint-Oriented Approach to enable the conversion of top-level goals (“concerns”) into requirements and constraints. “Preview aims to improve the quality of requirements specification by providing a framework which can support both requirements elicitation and the structuring of the requirements document.”
