The Argo P was a sports prototype racing car, built by Argo Racing Cars in 1997 for the IMSA GT Championship. The car used a naturally-aspirated 4-litre BMW V8 engine throughout its racing life. The car proved to be uncompetitive, and its fastest race laps were frequently well off the pace of the other runners.
