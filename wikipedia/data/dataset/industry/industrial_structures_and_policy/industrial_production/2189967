In economics, the Leontief production function or fixed proportions production function is a production function that implies the factors of production will be used in fixed (technologically pre-determined) proportions, as there is no substitutability between factors. It was named after Wassily Leontief and represents a limiting case of the constant elasticity of substitution production function.
For the simple case of a good that is produced with two inputs, the function is of the form

  
    
      
        q
        =
        
          Min
        
        
          (
          
            
              
                z
                
                  1
                
              
              a
            
          
          ,
          
            
              
                z
                
                  2
                
              
              b
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q={\text{Min}}\left({\frac {z_{1}}{a}},{\frac {z_{2}}{b}}\right)}
  
where q is the quantity of output produced, z1 and z2 are the utilised quantities of input 1 and input 2 respectively, and a and b are technologically determined constants.
