Manufacture on demand is a process which enables companies to offer video content to consumers on recordable DVDs. It differs from traditional DVD and Blu-ray releases as it is only produced on demand, rather than being stored in a warehouse, eliminating inventory.
Many companies have taken advantage of this new process, including:
Warner Brothers (Warner Archive Collection)
Sony
