The Blood List is a survey of unproduced thriller and horror scripts voted upon by industry professionals. It is similar to the Black List and was created in 2009 by Kailey Marsh. Steve Barton of Dread Central has called it "one of the most vital and necessary horror resources you'll ever need to break into the business".
