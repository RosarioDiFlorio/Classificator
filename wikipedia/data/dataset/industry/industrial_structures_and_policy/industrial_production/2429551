The JetTrain was an experimental high-speed passenger train created by Bombardier Transportation in an attempt to make European-style high-speed service more financially appealing to passenger railways in North America. It was expected to use the same LRC-derived tilting carriages as the Acela Express trains that Bombardier built for Amtrak in the 1990s and a similar locomotive. Unlike the Acela, powered electrically by overhead lines (as are most other high-speed trains), the JetTrain was designed to use petroleum-based fuel to power a diesel engine and multiple turboshaft engines for higher speeds.
