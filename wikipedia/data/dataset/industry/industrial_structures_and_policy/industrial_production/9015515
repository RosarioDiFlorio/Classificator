IBM Product Test was a group level organization for testing of IBM hardware and software products as part of the product development rather than manufacturing. It was housed in a number of laboratories associated with the various manufacturing and software development facilities. As an independent organization, Group Product Test had much power and exercised strict control over product quality. Ultimately, however, its contribution to the bottom line could not be quantified, and it was disbanded in 197?.
