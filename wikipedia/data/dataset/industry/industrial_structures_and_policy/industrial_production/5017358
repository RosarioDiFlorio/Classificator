The Suzuki GSX-R/4 is a concept car made by Suzuki in 2001. It reaches a top speed of 181 mph (291 km/h) at 9800 rpm and weighs 640 kg (1,410 lb). It has a mid-mounted, 1.3 l (79 in3) DOHC engine taken from the company's flagship motorcycle, the GSX-1300R Hayabusa. Designed as a showcase for technology, the GSX-R/4 was never meant for production. It had upscale features for its time, such as GPS navigation. Alongside the GSX-R/4, Suzuki presented the Formula Hayabusa, an open wheel race car concept, also using the 173 bhp (129 kW) motorcycle engine.
