Conformance testing, or type testing, is testing to determine whether a product, system or just a medium complies with the requirements of a specification, contract or regulation. That may apply to various technical terms as well as to pure formal terms with respect to obligations of the contractors. Conformity assessment, also known as compliance assessment, is any activity to determine, directly or indirectly, that a process, product or service meets relevant technical standards and fulfills relevant requirements.
Conformity assessment activities may include:
Testing
Surveillance
Inspection
Auditing
Certification
Accreditation
Additionally, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) governs conformity assessment through the Agreement on Mutual Recognition in Relation to Conformity Assessment (Signed July 4, 2000)
Testing is often either logical testing or physical testing. The test procedures may involve other criteria from mathematical testing or chemical testing. Beyond simple conformance other requirements for efficiency, interoperability or compliance may apply.
To aid in the aim towards a conformance proof, various test procedures and test setups have been developed, by either the standard's maintainers or external auditing organizations, specifically for testing conformance to standards. Conformance testing is performed preferably by independent organizations, which may be the standards body itself, to give sound assurance of compliance.
Products tested conformance may then become advertised as being certified by the testing organization as complying with the referred technical standard. Service providers, equipment manufacturers, and equipment suppliers rely on such qualified data to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) through this conformance process.
