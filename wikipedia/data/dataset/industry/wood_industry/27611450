The Story is an e-book reader manufactured and marketed by iriver and employing a Linux operating system. The device uses code licensed under the GPL, but iriver did not make the sources available immediately; this issue has since been addressed. The reader was updated in July 2010, and supports Wi-Fi. A July 2011 update integrated the device with the Google eBooks store. The product was a Target exclusive release.
The Story HD offers, with 1024Ã—768 pixels, one of the higher resolution in e-book readers on the market, using a display manufactured by LG, although its resolution is now matched by Kindle Paperwhite and surpassed by Kobo Aura HD. Competitors presented new devices for Q4 2012 with similar resolutions.
