Shatter is a type of cannabis concentrate, shatter specifically refers to a texture of concentrate that breaks and shatters like glass, rather than pulling like taffy. It is created by extracting the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant usually from dried cannabis. Shatter is similar to Live resin, but instead Live resin uses fresh cannabis and is extracted differently than Shatter. A wide variety of solvents can be used for extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol. Shatter is usually transparent and has an amber glass color. The reason shatter is clear has to do with the molecules in the cannabis. If this molecules are left undisturbed, they form the glass-like appearance. Heat, moisture, and high terpene content can also affect the texture of the outcome of the extraction, which may turn oils into a runnier substance that resembles sap. Oils with a consistency that falls somewhere between clear shatter and viscous sap is often referred to as "pull-and-snap".
