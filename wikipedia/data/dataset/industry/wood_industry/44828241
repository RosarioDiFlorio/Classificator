Bruunshaab Gamle Papfabrik (Bruunshaab Old Cardboard Factory) is a former textile and cardboard factory located in the town Bruunshåb, a few kilometers south of Viborg, Denmark. Build as a textile factory by manufacturer Bertel Bruun in 1821, his sons Peter Daniel Bruun and Mads Pagh Bruun took over the factory. The latter brought a further offshoot of the company in the form of the cloth mill Ny Bruunshaab at Aarhus.
After a large fire in the early 1900s, a new main building was built in 1909, designed by architect Søren Vig-Nielsen. In 1919, the premises were adapted for the production of cardboard which ended in the late 1960s.
The buildings have been protected since 1999. Today they function as a working museum.
