Reqa (Arabic: رقاع‎) is one of the six scripts of the Perso-Arabic calligraphy. Reqa was used for private correspondence on small papers or for nonreligious books and texts. Ibn al-Nadim mentioned in his book Al-Fehrest, that the inventor of Reqa script was Al-Fadl ibn Sahl. The script was one of the most favorite scripts in Ottoman Empire. Reqa became gradually simpler by other calligraphers and was changed to a new script called Ruqʿah, which is nowadays the most usual script in the Arab countries.
