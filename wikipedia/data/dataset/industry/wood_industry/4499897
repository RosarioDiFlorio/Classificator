AT-10 is a synthetic resin, mainly used in the manufacture of ultra-thin condoms. It has a higher strength in thinner sheets than other materials such as natural latex.
AT-10 is not stretchable, but does cling to skin to form a "wrap". It is well suited to condom manufacture as it:
can be made into very thin sheets, circa 15 micrometres thick
is hypoallergenic so does not have the potential to cause allergic reactions on contact with skin like natural latex
allows body heat to pass through quickly
is strong at relatively thin levels
is non-porous
does not degrade when exposed to common oils, such as oil based lubricants
