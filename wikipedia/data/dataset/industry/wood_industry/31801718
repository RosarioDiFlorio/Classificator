Lamina Emergent Mechanisms (also known as LEMs) are more commonly referred to as "Pop-up Mechanisms" as seen in "pop-up-books". LEM is the technical term of such mechanisms or engineering. LEMs are a subset of compliant mechanisms fabricated from planar materials (lamina) and have motion emerging from the fabrication plane. LEMs use compliance, or the deflection of flexible members to achieve motion.
