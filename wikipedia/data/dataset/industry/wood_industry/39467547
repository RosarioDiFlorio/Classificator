Drawdown charts are rectangular pieces of non-fluorescent paper which are used to test a variety of coating properties. These properties include opacity, spreading rate, penetration, and flow & leveling behavior. This non-fluorescent material has to be especially rugged in order to maintain its structure and give reliable readings, as the coatings tested are often corrosive or abrasive. These charts are necessary in the testing of any coating as they give reliable and accurate readings for any type of coating before the coating is applied to the intended material.
