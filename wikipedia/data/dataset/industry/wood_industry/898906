Braviken Paper Mill (or simply Braviken) is a paper mill located outside Bråviken, Norrköping, in Sweden. It is owned by Holmen Paper, which in turn is a subsidiary of Holmen.
Since the name is derived from the location, Bråviken, and since the name of the paper mill was to be internationally read and spoken, the ring diacritic above the a was dropped.
The current mill manager is Rikard Wallin.
