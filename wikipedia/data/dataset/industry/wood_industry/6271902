Inkjet transfer or inkjet photo transfer is a technique to transfer a photograph or graphic, printed with an inkjet printer onto textiles, cups, CDs, glass and other surfaces.
A special transfer sheet, usually ISO A4 size, is printed on with a regular inkjet printer. The photo has to be printed as a mirror image (except for some transfer sheets for dark materials).
