Enterprise forms automation is a company-wide computer system or set of systems for managing, distributing, completing and processing paper-based forms, applications, surveys, contracts and other documents. It plays a vital role towards achieving the goal of a paperless office.
The term "enterprise forms automation" was first used in the mid 1990s by JetForm Corporation to describe their solution to automating paperwork. This process was later acquired by Adobe Systems and is now part of the Adobe LiveCycle suite of products. In 2004 Efficient Technology Inc became the first company to apply this term in the software as a service.
This term is intended to refer to the automation of paper-based processes that specifically rely on documents (forms, applications, etc.) that retain their paper-based look and feel even if not printed out during the process. In order for a forms automation solution to be considered an ‘Enterprise Forms Automation’ solution it must meet the requirements of enterprise software and be specifically focused on automating paperwork and paper-based forms.
