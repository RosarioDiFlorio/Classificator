The orizuru (折鶴 ori- "folded," tsuru "crane"), or paper crane, is a design that is considered to be the most classic of all Japanese origami. It is a representation of the Japanese red-crowned crane that is referred to as the "Honourable Lord Crane" in Japanese culture. The Japanese culture believed that its wings carried souls up to paradise. It is often used as a ceremonial wrapper or restaurant table decoration. A thousand orizuru strung together is called senbazuru (千羽鶴), meaning "thousand cranes". "Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes" is a classic Japanese work that talks about the significance of a thousand paper cranes. It is said that a thousand cranes need to be made in order for a wish to come true.
