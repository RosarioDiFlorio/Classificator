The Tasman Mill site is a pulp and paper mill located on Fletcher Avenue just outside the town of Kawerau in New Zealand. The Tasman Mill site is the largest single employer in the Eastern Bay of Plenty region. Three pulp or paper companies operate in Kawerau: Norske Skog operate the mechanical pulp mill and paper mill; Oji Fibre Solutions, formerly Carter Holt Harvey, operate the kraft pulp mill; and SCA who manufacture tissue and base paper (physically separate mill on Fletcher Avenue).
The Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill has been discharging waste into the Tarawera River since 1955, causing irreparable damage to freshwater resources. Despite protests of local MƒÅori, in 2009, the mill gained permission to continue discharging pollution into the river for the next 25 years.
