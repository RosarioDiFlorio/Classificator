Kamikiri (紙切り) is essentially papercutting, but it is a Japanese offshoot performed on stage to a live audience. It is a traditional performing art in Japan that dates back to the Edo period (1603–1868). The performer takes suggestions from the audience and to musical accompaniment quickly cuts a piece of paper with scissors to create the suggested figure.
