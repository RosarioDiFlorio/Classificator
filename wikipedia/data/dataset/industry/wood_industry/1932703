Clipping is the cutting-out of articles from a paper publication. Newspaper clippings are often used when people have to write a report or make a presentation on current events for school. Clippings may also be kept by adults for future reference, or for sentimental reasons such as an article on a history-making event. One service of Media monitoring services, which monitor the media exposure of a client, is to collect clippings referring to a client.
