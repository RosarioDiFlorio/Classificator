The Rocket eBook was an early commercial handheld e-reader that was produced by NuvoMedia in late 1998; it used a LCD screen and could store up to ten e-books. E-books were loaded on the device by connecting it to a computer and the device had two page turn buttons. Rocket-compatible e-books were sold online at Barnes & Noble and Powell's Bookstore. It had a retail price of $499.
The Rocket eBook was manufactured by NuvoMedia until 2000, when it was purchased by Gemstar-TV Guide International for $187 million. After purchasing NuvoMedia and merging it with SoftBook, Gemstar released an e-reader called the RCA eBook Reader.
