Eaton's Corrasable Bond is a trademarked name for a brand of erasable typing paper. Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible, is easily removed by friction, and accepts typewriter ink fairly well. Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it, so mistakes can be easily erased once. After erasure, the correction is typed onto an unprotected paper surface and cannot be easily erased a second time.
Because the coated surface does not absorb ink, erasable paper is apt to smudge. Since the coating is intended to be easily removed by friction, the typed pages are not very durable. Under some storage conditions, the coating is apt to make pages stick together. Erasable paper is not suitable for legal documents or archival records. It was available in a number of thicknesses.
Eaton's Corrasable Bond is no longer manufactured.
In the United States, Eaton's Corrasable Bond was a very familiar brand of erasable typing paper during the mid-1950s and 1960s, and "corrasable" became almost a generic name for erasable typing paper. For example, in prohibiting the use of such paper for manuscript submissions, the Linguistic Society of America refers to "Eaton's 'Corrasable Bond' and similar brands."
Writer Peter David, who worked as an editor's assistant at the E. P. Dutton imprint Elsevier/Nelson before becoming a professional writer, once related finding a submission written on erasable bond, which made the print difficult to read. In a 1992 Comics Buyer's Guide column in which he provided aspiring writers with tips on composing submissions, he stated, "Don't write on anything other than standard-weight white bond paper. I don't care what Abe Lincoln or Jack Kerouac wrote on; you're not Lincoln or Kerouac. And for crying out loud, don't use erasable bond. That wasn't a dodge the writer used in Misery to get Annie out of the house; no real writer types on erasable bond."
