Wooden bullets are wooden projectiles designed to be fired from a gun. They are intended to be used as non-lethal weapons for crowd control by enforcing "pain compliance" at a distance. They have been known to raise large welts or bruises on their targets.
First used by British troops in Hong Kong, and then in Northern Ireland, they are still used by some U.S. police forces for crowd control.
