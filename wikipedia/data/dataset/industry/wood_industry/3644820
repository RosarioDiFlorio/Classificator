Construction paper (also called sugar paper) is a tough, coarse, coloured paper. The texture is slightly rough, and the surface is unfinished. Due to the source material, mainly wood pulp, small particles are visible on the paperâ€™s surface. It is used for projects or crafts.

The origin of the term "sugar paper" lies in its use for making bags to contain sugar. It is related to the "blue paper" used by confectionery bakers from the 17th century England onwards; for example, in the baking of Regency ratafia cakes (or macaroons).
The animated television series Blue's Clues and South Park (initially) were made using construction paper and stop motion.
