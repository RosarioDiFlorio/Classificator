The Bibliotheca Wittockiana is a private museum and library in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, Brussels in Belgium devoted to bookbinding.
The museum is based on the personal collection of Michel Wittock, an industrialist, which numbers some 3,000 art bindings. The library was opened to the public in 1983. Since 2010, the museum has been managed in collaboration with the King Baudouin Foundation to which 80 percent of the Wittock collection has been donated.
The museum reflects Wittock's collecting interests and focuses on bookbindings dating back to the Renaissance. It also holds a full collection of the Almanach de Gotha and the personal archive of Lucien Bonaparte. The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions.
