An e-reader, also known as an e-book reader, is a portable electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading e-books and periodicals. E-readers have a similar form factor to a tablet and usually refers to devices that use electronic paper resulting in better screen readability, especially in bright sunlight, and longer battery life when compared to a tablet. An e-reader's battery will typically last for multiple weeks. In contrast to an e-reader, a tablet has a screen capable of higher refresh rates which make them more suitable for interaction such as playing a video game or watching a video clip.
Any device that can display text on a screen can act as an e-reader but without the advantages of electronic paper. On the other hand, most e-books are read on devices not specifically designed for reading e-books, such as desktop/laptop computers, smartphones and tablets.
