Louis Pons (born 1927) is a French collage artist. He specializes in reliefs and assemblages made entirely from discarded objects and junk. In Agn√®s Varda's documentary The Gleaners and I, Pons explains his artistic process and understanding of art; what others see as "a cluster of junk," he sees as "a cluster of possibilities;" and that the function of art is to tidy up one's inner and exterior worlds.
