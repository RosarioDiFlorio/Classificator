A wet wipe, also known as a wet towel, or a moist towelette, is a small moistened piece of paper or cloth that often comes folded and individually wrapped for convenience. Wet wipes are used for cleaning purposes, like personal hygiene or household cleaning. Because of their failure to break down when flushed, they have been implicated by water companies as contributory to sewer blockages known as fatbergs.
