softwall is a flexible room divider designed by Stephanie Forsythe and Todd MacAllen of molo. Made from paper or nonwoven polyethylene, the walls use a structured honeycomb geometry to bend, curve, expand and contract. The honeycomb structure also provides acoustic absorption. Part of a modular system, each softwall can connect to another by magnetic end panels. The walls have been used to create booths for trade fairs, pop-up retail, sculptural art installations, backdrops for performances, as well as to divide space in living and working environments.
In 2003, softwall was welcomed into the Museum of Modern Artâ€™s permanent collection. Two years later, it was presented with the INDEX Award for Design to Improve Life.
