The International Association of Master Penmen, Engrossers and Teachers of Handwriting (IAMPETH) (pronounced "I am Peth") is an international association for practicing and preserving the arts of calligraphy, engrossing and penmanship. It is currently the largest penmanship organization in the world and was founded in 1949.
IAMPETH is dedicated to helping people improve their lettering and artistic skills, and maintains an archive of works of past masters in addition to online instruction guides covering most popular methods of handwriting including Copperplate, Spencerian Script, Illuminated manuscript production (engrossing) and others.
Each year hundreds of members from all over the world participate in a week long conference held in a US city. This week includes instruction, history and fellowship.
In 2017 IAMPETH introduced a new Certificate Program, replacing the Master Penman Program which was discontinued in 2015. This program allows all members who have been with the organization for 3 plus years to submit work to be considered for Certificate of Proficiency, Certificate of Excellence, and finally a Master Penman's Certificate.
IAMPETH welcomes members from all over the world who have a love of penmanship. Dues range from $25 to $55 USD.
