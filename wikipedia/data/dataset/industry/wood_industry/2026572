For production wrapping tissue paper is made by the machine glaze process. A slurry of bleached wood pulp beaten together with soda ash and optical brightners is placed on a forming wire where the water is allowed to drain away. The sheet is then pressed against a felt and pressed against a drying cylinder for the final drying step. The sheet is then pulled away from the dryer and wound up ready for further processes like calendering etc. or straightaway converting it into wrapping paper.
