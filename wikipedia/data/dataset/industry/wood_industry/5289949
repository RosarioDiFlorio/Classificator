Perforated paper is a craft material of lightweight card with regularly spaced holes in imitation of embroidery canvas. It is also sometimes referred to as punched paper.
Perforated paper is most commonly embroidered with cross stitch motifs and borders. When the stitching is complete the excess paper around the design can be cut away to create a regular or irregular shaped decorative item. Typical uses for such items include ornaments to decorate Christmas trees, bookmarks and greetings cards. It is also used in larger sized sheets to embroider motto sayings to frame and display on the wall. Since the paper is of a heavy weight, it does not require a hoop or frame when stitching.
Perforated paper is manufactured in a number of different colours and is typically sold as 14-count A4 size sheets. The count refers to the fact that there are 14 holes/perforations per linear inch.
