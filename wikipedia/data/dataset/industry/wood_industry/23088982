The Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW) was established in September, 1964, when West Coast rank-and-file members of the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite, and Paper Mill Workers became dissatisfied with the conduct of wage negotiations by international vice-presidents and those of another international union, the United Papermakers and Paperworkers, with whom a Uniform Labor Agreement had been negotiated. The dissatisfaction was a result of the international Vice Presidents announcing that they were taking over the United Labor Association bargaining session. They established a new union, the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Mill Workers, in 1964. Litigation followed, a NLRB election was conducted in October 1964, and the Western organization was certified as the Uniform Labor Agreement bargaining agent.
