Rigid origami is a branch of origami which is concerned with folding structures using flat rigid sheets joined by hinges. That is, unlike with paper origami, the sheets cannot bend during the folding process; they must remain flat at all times. However, there is no requirement that the structure start as a single flat sheet â€” for instance shopping bags with flat bottoms are studied as part of rigid origami.
Rigid origami is a part of the study of the mathematics of paper folding, and rigid origami structures can be considered as a type of mechanical linkage. Rigid origami has great practical utility.
