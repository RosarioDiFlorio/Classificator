Robert Rutherford "Colonel" McCormick (July 30, 1880 â€“ April 1, 1955) was a member of the McCormick family of Chicago who became a lawyer, Republican Chicago alderman, distinguished U.S. Army officer in World War I, and eventually owner and publisher of the Chicago Tribune newspaper. A leading Republican and non-interventionist, McCormick opposed the increase in Federal power brought about by the New Deal and later opposed American entry into World War II. His death also created what is now the McCormick Foundation, known for its philanthropic activities.
