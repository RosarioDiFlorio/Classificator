Perma-Bound is a division and registered trademark of Hertzberg-New Method, Inc. Perma-Bound rebinds books for libraries and schools, and turns paperbacks into hardbacks.
Hertzberg-New Method Bindery opened in its current location in South Jacksonville, Illinois on June 17, 1954. In the mid-1960s Hertzberg-New Method began a division of reinforced paperback books that were called Perma-Bound Books. Perma-Bound originated from three separate companies coming together to combine their rebinding work into one location. Two of these companies were owned by members of the Hertzberg family, Lawrence Hertzberg of Monastery Hill Bindery in Chicago and Ernest Hertzberg of Hertzberg Craftsmen Bindery in Des Moines, Iowa.
