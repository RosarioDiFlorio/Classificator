A Mojo Books is a company that produced books, in e-book PDF format, based on the output of a given band, singer or composer. Its creators were the Brazillian editors Danilo Corci and Ricardo Giassetti, with the aid of the cover artist Delfin.
During the mid-1990s, Corci and Giassetti formed a synthpop band called Toward the Cathedral along with composer Will Geraldo. The lyrics for the band's songs were usually based on such writers as James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Franz Kafka, Edgar Allan Poe and Marcel Proust. Ten years later they decided to turn music into literature and by the end of 2006 Corci and Giassetti had established the Mojo Books project to produce e-books based on records. Writers have ranged from amateurs to professional writers and academics.
