Copperplate is a style of calligraphic writing that uses a pointed steel nib or quill to produce a style of lettering characterized by both thick and thin strokes. Often misused as an umbrella term for all forms of pointed pen calligraphy, Copperplate most accurately refers to a wide variety of styles produced after studying the copper plate engravings used to print and redistribute the artwork of English round hand writing masters as far back as the 16th century.
