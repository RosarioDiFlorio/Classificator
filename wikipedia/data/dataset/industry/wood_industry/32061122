The Nook Simple Touch (also called the Nook Touch) is the second generation Nook e-reader developed by Barnes & Noble. It features an 600x800 E Ink screen with a touchscreen that uses a network of infrared beams slightly above the screen surface. The device also has wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n and a micro USB port for charging and connecting to a computer.
In April 2012, Barnes & Noble introduced a Simple Touch Reader with "GlowLight" LED technology. On 30 October 2013, Barnes & Noble released the Nook Glowlight, which replaced the Simple Touch with Glowlight. The Simple Touch was still sold until late February 2014, when it was discontinued.
