Katagami (型紙) or Ise-katagami (伊勢型紙) is the Japanese craft of making paper stencils for dyeing textiles. It is designated one of the Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan. The art is traditionally centered on the city of Suzuka in Mie Prefecture. This is good for making a certain shape or picture within your project. It is different from IseWashi though both are made in Mie Prefecture.
