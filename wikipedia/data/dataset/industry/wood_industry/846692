Chinese paper folding, or zhezhi (Chinese: 摺紙; pinyin: zhézhǐ), is the art of paper folding that originated in medieval China.
The work of Japanese paper artist Akira Yoshizawa widely popularized the Japanese name "origami"; however, in China and other Chinese speaking areas, the art is referred to by the Chinese name, zhezhi. Traditional Chinese paper folding concentrates mainly on objects like boats or hats rather than the animals and flowers of Japanese origami. A recent innovation is Golden Venture where large representational objects are made from modular forms.
