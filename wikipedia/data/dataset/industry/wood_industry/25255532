Gum copal, also known as manila copal, is a resin produced by the sap of forest tree in the genus Daniellia. Due to common impurities and differences in regions, gum copal ranges in color from black to yellow to white. Gum copal, along with ivory and slaves, was a significant export from East Africa in the nineteenth century. Gum copal can have an appearance similar amber and may be mistaken for it. Unlike amber, gum copal is usually only 100-1,000 years old and it has not yet fossilized.
