The Tillinghast Mill Site is an historic industrial site in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. The site is the location of a cotton mill established in 1812 by Deacon Pardon Tillinghast, and was more formally known as the Mount Hope Factory. At its height the area included 25 mill worker houses as well as the waterworks and wood frame mill structure. Now only the foundational remnants of the mill and the waterworks remain. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
The site is now part of Frenchtown Park, situated behind the Recreation Department Building. It can be accessed via Frenchtown Road. Many foundations still exist, including the structure of the mill itself, a boiler room, a restroom, bridge foundations, and the remnants of several dwellings.
