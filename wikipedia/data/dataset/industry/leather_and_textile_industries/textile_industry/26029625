Mavis Mill was a cotton spinning mill in Coppull, Chorley, Lancashire.
Mavis Mill was built in 1908 alongside the Coppull Ring Mill, which still survives under a change of use to an enterprise centre. The mill was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s, but was subsequently demolished to make a car park. The spinning machines were driven by a 2000 hp triple-expansion four-cylinder engine by J & E Wood, 1909, which had a 26 ft flywheel with 36 ropes.
