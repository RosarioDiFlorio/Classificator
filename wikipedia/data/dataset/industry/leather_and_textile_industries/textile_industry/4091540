The Order of the Knights of St Crispin was an American labor union of shoe workers formed in Wisconsin in 1867. It soon reached a membership of 50,000 or more, largely in the Northeast. However it was poorly organized and faded away by 1874. They fought encroachments of machinery and unskilled labor on the autonomy of skilled shoe workers.
