Pashmina is a fine type of Kashmiri wool. The textiles made from it were first woven in Indian Kashmir. The name comes from Persian: پشمینه‎ / pašmina, meaning "made from wool" and literally translates to "Soft Gold" in Kashmiri. Pashmina shawls are known to pass entirely through a wearable ring with diameter of about half an inch. Pashmina came to be known as 'cashmere' in the West because Europeans first encountered this fibre in Kashmir. The wool comes from four distinct breeds of the Cashmere goat; namely the Changthangi or Kashmir Pashmina goat from the Changthang plateau in Kashmir region, the Malra from Kargil area in Kashmir region, the Chegu from Himachal Pradesh in northern India and Pakistan, and Chyangara or Nepalese Pashmina goat from Nepal. These shawls are hand spun, and woven in Kashmir and Nepal, and made from fine cashmere fibre.
