Lowe Mill is a former cotton mill of approximately 171,000 sq ft (15,900 m2) located southwest of downtown Huntsville, Alabama.
Today the building, operated by Lowe Mill ARTS & Entertainment, houses the largest privately owned arts facility in the United States. With a focus on visual arts, it has been redeveloped into 148 working studios for over 200 artists and makers, 6 fine art galleries, a multi-use theater, and performance venues. The entire complex has never been annexed into the Huntsville City Limits (as many mills and plants were in the 1940s/1950s). The city receives no tax revenue from the facility.
