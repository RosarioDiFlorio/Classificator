The Coleman-Franklin-Cannon Mill is a historic industrial complex at 625 Main Street SW in Concord, North Carolina. The complex consists of ten buildings on 6.6 acres (2.7 ha), about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of downtown Concord. The oldest portion of the mill, now its eastern section, is a brick two-story structure 14 bays long and 9 deep. It was built 1898 and repeatedly altered and enlarged. The mill was built by the Coleman Manufacturing Company, owned by Warren Coleman, an African-American businessman who sparked a national debate by stating he would only hire African-American workers.
The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.
