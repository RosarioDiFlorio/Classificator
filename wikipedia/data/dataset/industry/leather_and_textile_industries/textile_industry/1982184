Salts Mill (sometimes spelt Salt's Mill) is a former textile mill, now an art gallery, shopping centre, and restaurant complex in Saltaire, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was built by Sir Titus Salt in 1853, and the present-day 1853 Gallery takes its name from the date of the building which houses it. The mill has many paintings by the local artist David Hockney on display and also provides offices for Pace plc.
When completed, the mill was the largest industrial building in the world by total floor area. It is a grade II* listed building. The mill closed in 1986, and the following year it was sold to Jonathan Silver, who began a long renovation scheme.
