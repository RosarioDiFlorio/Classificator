Sir William Henry Perkin, FRS (12 March 1838 â€“ 14 July 1907) was an English chemist best known for his accidental discovery of the first aniline dye: the purple mauveine. Though failing in trying to synthesise quinine for the treatment of malaria, he became successful in the field of dyes after his discovery at the age of 18.
