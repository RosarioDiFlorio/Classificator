Cashmere wool, usually simply known as cashmere, is a fiber obtained from cashmere goats and other types of goat. The word cashmere is an old spelling of Kashmir, the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent, which includes parts of Pakistan and India.
Common usage defines the fiber as wool but it is finer and softer than sheep's wool. Some say it is hair, but as seen below, cashmere requires the removal of hair from the wool. Cashmere is finer, stronger, lighter, softer, and approximately three times more insulating than sheep wool.
In the United States, under the U.S. Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, as amended, (15 U. S. Code Section 68b(a)(6)), states that a wool or textile product may be labelled as containing cashmere only if the following criteria are met:
such wool product is the fine (dehaired) undercoat fibers produced by a cashmere goat (Capra hircus laniger);
the average diameter of the fiber of such wool product does not exceed 19 microns; and
such wool product does not contain more than 3 percent (by weight) of cashmere fibers with average diameters that exceed 30 microns.
The average fiber diameter may be subject to a coefficient of variation around the mean that shall not exceed 24 percent.
