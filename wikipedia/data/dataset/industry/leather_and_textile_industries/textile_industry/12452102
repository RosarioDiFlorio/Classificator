The Bernat Mill, also known as Capron Mill, and later Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, was a yarn mill in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, USA, that was for the most part destroyed by fire on July 21, 2007.
This mill complex at Uxbridge had been a hub of manufacturing for Bernat, once based in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The town of Uxbridge was the site of Bernat's main manufacturing unit in the later 20th century. This was the third largest yarn mill in the U.S. The Bernat mill and the town of Uxbridge have a role in U.S. history, and the history of the American Textile manufacturing.
"Bernat" is a trademark of an existing company (Bernat.com) which manufactures yarn products.
