Verdant Works, also known as Scotland's Jute Museum @ Verdant Works, is a former jute mill in the Blackness area of Dundee, Scotland. It was purchased in 1991 by the Dundee Heritage Trust. The trust restored the buildings and opened them in 1996 as a museum dedicated to the textile industry, an industry that once dominated the city's economy.
