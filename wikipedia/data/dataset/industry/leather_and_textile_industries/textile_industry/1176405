The Laundry and Dry Cleaning International Union is an AFL-CIO union in the United States. It was created as an alternative to the old Teamsters Laundry and Dry-Cleaners, which had been expelled from the AFL-CIO in 1958 for corruption. Russell Crowell was president of the new union from 1962 to 1983.
The organization later merged with the Service Employees International Union.
