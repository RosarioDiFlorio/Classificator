Beehive Mill is a Grade II* listed former cotton mill in the district of Ancoats, Manchester, England. It is located at (grid reference SJ850987) on a site surrounded by Radium Street, Jersey Street, Bengal Street and Naval Street.
The building was constructed in three phases, the first two being in the early 1820s with the third phase being added in 1847. The second phase, built in 1824 and used as warehousing, is an important example of early fireproof construction. The roof of the 1824 warehouse belonging to Beehive Mill is the only known surviving example in Manchester of an advanced form of mill roof using cast and wrought iron, and which was prefabricated. The third phase was five storeys high and built along Bengal Street; this block was damaged by fire and partially rebuilt in 1861. The estimated value of the damage caused was Â£25,000.
The disused Bengal Street block of Beehive Mill was completely destroyed by fire in July 2005. The fire threatened to destroy the rest of the complex, which housed Sankeys nightclub and offices. In an effort to extinguish the fire, water was pumped from the nearby Rochdale Canal.
In January 2017, it was announced that Beehive Mill had been sold to be turned into apartments. But is now being kept for commercial use.
