Mary Brooksbank (born Soutar; 15 December 1897 â€“ 16 March 1978) was a Scottish mill worker, socialist and trade unionist. She was an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain between 1920 and 1933, and spent three periods in prison as a result of her agitation. She attended John Maclean's last meetings at the Scottish Labour College.
She is remembered today as a prominent figure in Dundee's labour movement. She founded the Working Women Guild to fight for better health and social services in Dundee, securing a membership of over 300, and was heavily involved in October 1934 with the National Unemployed Workers Movement county march to Forfar, to lobby the County Council; contingents were raised from Dundee, Blairgowrie, Montrose, Ferryden, and Arbroath.
