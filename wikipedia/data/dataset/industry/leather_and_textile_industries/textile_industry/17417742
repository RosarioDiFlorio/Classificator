Cowan Mill (also known as the Aurora Mill or Cowan Woolen Company Mill) was an historic mill at Island Mill Street in Lewiston, Maine.
The 4 story Greek Revival mill was built in 1850 on the site of Lewiston's first textile mill (built by John A. Briggs in 1836 and destroyed by fire in March 1850). David Cowan was twice elected mayor of Lewiston. The mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
On July 15, 2009, the Mill was completely destroyed under suspicious circumstances in a massive fire.
On Tuesday, July 21, 2009 Justice Thomas Delahanty ordered the mill be destroyed due to it being unsafe. Chabot Construction Company carried out the order the same day.
The mill was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on November 2, 2011.
