This is a list of textile factories that have existed in Shaw and Crompton, formerly of Lancashire and now in Greater Manchester, England.
From the Industrial Revolution until the 20th century, Crompton (as it was then mainly known) was a major centre of textile manufacture, particularly cotton spinning. During this period, it was dominated by large rectangular brick-built factories, some of which still remain today as warehouses or distribution centres. The town has seen forty-eight separate textile factories built within its boundaries.
