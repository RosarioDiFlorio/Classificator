WestPoint Home's goal of being the "preferred supplier of fashion and core home textile products" is backed by almost 200 years of textile history. WestPoint Home, Inc. as it is known today is the result of the mergers of three of the oldest companies in the textile industry: J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc. (est. 1813 in Massachusetts), Pepperell Manufacturing Company (est. 1851 in Maine), and West Point Manufacturing Company (est. 1880 in Georgia).
The company was led by the Lanier family through the late 1980s. The Laniers originally incorporated the Westpoint Manufacturing Company in 1880. WestPoint Home, Inc. is now owned by Icahn Enterprises, L.P. In June 2011 WestPoint Home named Normand Savaria President & CEO, and Taran Chernin Executive VP & Chief Merchandising Officer. WestPoint Home chairman Carl Icahn said the appointments "will further elevate the performance of WestPoint Home".
