Sterling Cotton Mill, also known as the Franklinton Cotton Mill, is a historic cotton mill complex located at 106 East Green Street in Franklinton, Franklin County, North Carolina. The main mill is a one and two-story L-shaped brick building with Industrial Italianate style design elements. The mill consists of five sections: the original gabled one-story section rising to a two-story section at the east end (1895); a two-story addition (1914), a one-story addition (1960s); pre-1926 "cotton sheds"; and a small two-story brick office (1966). Associated with the mill is the contributing detached chimney stack. The mill was built by Samuel C. Vann, whose son Aldridge built the Aldridge H. Vann House. The mill closed in 1991.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
