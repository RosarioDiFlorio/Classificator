Robert Noble is a weaving and textiles business based in the Scottish borders town of Peebles at March Street Mills. It is listed amongst one of the oldest surviving UK businesses 
The origins of the company can be traced back to 1666 when it was formed in Galashiels under the name of David Ballantyne.
During the next two hundred years the company grew and developed. In 1884 it moved to a new purpose built mill at March Street in Peebles; still the home of Robert Noble today.
During the twentieth century Ballantyne's formed part of the Dawson International business. However, during the latter part of the twentieth century the UK textiles industry went through various re-structuring and Robert Noble was sold off as a separate business.
The Robert Nobles business had lost significant sales in early 2000s when MoD contracts for Scottish Regiments were sent outside the UK 
In 2015, after trying to sell the company privately, the management publicly put the site up for sale. Unable to find buyers for the site, the two businesses Robert Noble and Replin were sold to other manufacturers.
Robert Noble was sold to Magee's in Ireland and Replin was sold to AW Hainsworth based in Yorkshire
