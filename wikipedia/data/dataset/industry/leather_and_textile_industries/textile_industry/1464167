The wool combing machine was invented by Edmund Cartwright, the inventor of the power loom, in Doncaster. It was patented on 1790. This machine was used to arrange and lay parallel by length the fibers of wool, prior to further treatment. The machine was important in the mechanization of the textile industry. The machine was refined by many later inventors.
