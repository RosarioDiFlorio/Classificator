Mount Holly Cotton Mill, also known as Alsace Manufacturing Co., is a historic cotton mill complex located at Mount Holly, Gaston County, North Carolina. The original section was built in 1875, and is a 2 1/2-story, rectangular brick mill building with Industrial Italianate detailing. A three-story addition was built in 1916, and a one-story, T-plan brick machine shop and boiler house was added in 1919. The complex was converted into a research unit in 1953, and in 1973 was sold to an independent mill operator who presently uses the building for a variety of industrial and commercial purposes.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.
