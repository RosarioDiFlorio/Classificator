He worked at the British Linen Company's bleachfield in Saltoun, East Lothian before moving in 1753 to Luncarty near Perth to be the business partner of William Sandeman who was leveling 12 acres (49,000 m2) there to be bleachfields. By 1790, the Luncarty bleachfields covered 80 acres (320,000 m2) and processed 500,000 square yards of cloth annually.

One son William Turnbull established the bleachfield at Huntingtower. One grandchild was George Turnbull, the Chief Engineer building in the 1850s the first railway in eastern India. Hector died in 1788. Hector had a brother Lt Colonel George Turnbull who fought in America.
