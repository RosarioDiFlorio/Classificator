Helmshore Mills are two mills built on the River Ogden in Helmshore, Lancashire. Higher Mill was built in 1796 for William Turner, and Whitaker's Mill was built in the 1820s by the Turner family. In their early life they alternated between working wool and cotton. By 1920 they were working shoddy as condensor mule mills; and equipment has been preserved and is still used. The mills closed in 1967 and they were taken over by the Higher Mills Trust, whose trustees included Chris Aspin, the historian and author and Dr Rhodes Boyson who maintained it as a museum. The mills are certainly the most original and best preserved examples of both Cotton Spinning and Woollen Fulling left in the country which are still operational.
Following the withdrawal of its grant from Lancashire County Council this museum was closed to the public on 30 September 2016 for an indefinite period. However the museum is still open for pre-booked school visits.
