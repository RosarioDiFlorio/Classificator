The Yantic Woolen Company Mill is a mill complex located at the junction of Chapel Hill and Yantic Roads in Norwich, Connecticut. Its main building is a large 4-1/2 story ashlar stone structure with a five-story square tower at its center. It is connected to a series of smaller buildings, also stone. The mill complex dates to 1865, when it was built by E. Winslow Williams on the site of an older mill (built by his father) which had been destroyed by fire. The mill was the economic engine of the village of Yantic well into the 20th century, ending textile production in 1989.

The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 1996.
