Lambert's Point Knitting Mill, also known as The Knitting Mill and Old Dominion Paper Company, is a historic mill building located at Norfolk, Virginia. It was built in 1895, and consists of the central two-story original mill building highlighted by a tall four-story tower. It was augmented in the 1950s by a one-story addition on the south elevation, and by additional one-story additions on the north and west sides of the building. The masonry structure is clad with smooth-finished concrete stucco.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.
