Peiraiki-Patraiki (Greek: Πειραϊκή-Πατραϊκή) was one of Greece's largest industrial groups in the 20th century. It was the country's largest textile producer, and its annual production was said to be able to cover the Hellenic coastline twice over. The company was created in 1919, and operated until 1996.
