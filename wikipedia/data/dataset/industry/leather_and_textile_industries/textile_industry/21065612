Ella May Wiggins (September 17, 1900 â€“ September 14, 1929) was a union organizer and balladeer who was killed during the Loray Mill Strike in Gastonia, N.C.
According to Like a Family, a 1987 account of "the making of a Southern cotton mill world," the Gastonia protest collapsed in the aftermath of Wiggins's death. Her union, the National Textile Workers Union, ultimately was "too weak to challenge the economic and political power of the cotton manufacturers and to organize the labor force."
