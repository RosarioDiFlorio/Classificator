The Board of Directors of Supima is made up of American Pima growers from Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.
Production of Supima cotton has risen from about 100,000 bales per year in the 1980s to over 800,000 bales in 2006. More than 90% of Supima cotton is exported from the United States, the majority of this being for the overseas manufacture of yarn, finished fabrics, clothing, sheets and towels which are re-exported to the United States for sale. The top five importers of Supima cotton are China, India, Pakistan, Turkey, and Peru.
