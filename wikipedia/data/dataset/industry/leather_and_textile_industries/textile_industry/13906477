A magnanery (French: magnanerie) is the site of sericulture, or silk farming, similar to a farm being the site of agriculture. The yeoman who runs it is called a magnanier or, more recently, a mangnan. The word magnani√®re, meaning building dedicated to sericulture, is also seen.
The word originated from the Occitan word magnan, as Provence was the centre of French sericulture.
The area around Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort has Magnaneries, and the town itself has a silk museum.
