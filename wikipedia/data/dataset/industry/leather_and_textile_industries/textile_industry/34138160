Ashley and Bailey Company Silk Mill, also known as Franklin Silk Mill and Leinhardt Brothers Furniture Warehouse, is a historic silk mill located at West York, York County, Pennsylvania. It was built about 1899, and is a three-story, brick building on a rough cut stone foundation. It has a shallow gable roof, a three-story "L"-shaped tower, and a broad one-story ell. Also on the property is a small, flat roofed brick building built about 1925. The mill closed in 1937, then was used as a furniture warehouse into the 1980s.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It should not be confused with the Ashley and Bailey Silk Mill, a similarly constructed factory built about two years earlier, which is also listed on the NRHP and is located about 18 miles east in Marietta, Pennsylvania.
