The International Wool Secretariat was formed in 1937 to promote the sale of wool on behalf of woolgrowers and review research carried out by independent bodies such as the Wool Industries' Research Association at Torridon, Leeds, England.
It was supported by levies on wool grown in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay.
