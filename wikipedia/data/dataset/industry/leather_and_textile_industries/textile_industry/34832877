The Calico Printers' Association Ltd was a British textile company founded in 1899, from the amalgamation of 46 textile printing companies and 13 textile merchants. The industry had prospered in the latter half of the 19th century but the fierce competition led to a decline in quality and profit margins. Most of the leading companies in the industry decided to amalgamate in order "to preserve the tradition and standing of calico printing and to produce textiles of a high standard at reasonable prices." The company at its inception accounted for over 80% of Britain’s output of printed cloth.
The Calico Printers' Association Limited was incorporated on 8 November 1899 with an issued share capital of £8,200,000, consisting of £5,000,000 share capital and £3,200,000 of debenture stock. Under the chairmanship of F. F. Grafton, the company established its first head office at 2 Charlotte Street, Manchester, before moving to more suitable premises at 56 Mosley Street. In 1912, a new head office, the magnificent St James's Buildings was completed on Oxford Street, Manchester.
