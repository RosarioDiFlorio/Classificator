The Norwegian Union of Clothing Workers (Norwegian: Bekledningsarbeiderforbundet) was a trade union in Norway, organized under the national Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions.
It was founded in 1892 as Norsk Skredderforbund, and changed its name to Norsk Bekledningsarbeiderforbund in 1931. In 1969 it was merged with Norsk Tekstilarbeiderforbund and Norsk Skotøyarbeiderforbund, and changed its name to Bekledningsarbeiderforbundet. It then absorbed Norsk Skinn- og Lærarbeiderforbund in 1973.
In 1988 it was merged with the Norwegian Union of Forestry and Land Workers, the Norwegian Union of Iron and Metalworkers, the Norwegian Union of Building Industry Workers and the Norwegian Union of Paper Industry Workers to form the United Federation of Trade Unions. It had about 12,000 members before the merger.
