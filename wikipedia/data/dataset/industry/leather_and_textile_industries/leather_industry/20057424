Arnold "Arnie" Horween (originally Arnold Horwitz; also known as A. McMahon; July 7, 1898 â€“ August 5, 1985) was a college and professional American football player and coach. He played and coached both for Harvard University and in the National Football League (NFL).
Horween played left halfback, right halfback, fullback, and center for the unbeaten Harvard Crimson football teams of 1919, which won the 1920 Rose Bowl, and 1920. He was voted an All-American.
Horween also played four seasons in the NFL, as a fullback, halfback, and blocking back (quarterback) for the Racine Cardinals and the Chicago Cardinals. He was a player-coach for the Cardinals. Later, he was Harvard's head football coach, from 1925 to 1930.
His brother Ralph Horween was also an All-American football player for Harvard, and also played and coached in the NFL for the Cardinals. They were the last Jewish brothers to play in the NFL until Geoff Schwartz and Mitchell Schwartz, in the 2000s. After retiring from football, Horween and his brother inherited and ran the family leather tannery business, Horween Leather Company.
