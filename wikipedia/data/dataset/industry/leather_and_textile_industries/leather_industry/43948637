Louis Breithaupt (November 8, 1827 â€“ July 3, 1880) was a German-born tanner and politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as mayor of Berlin from 1879 to 1880.
The son of Liborius Breithaupt, a tanner, and Catherine Goetze, he was born in Allendorf, Kurhessen, was educated in Germany and learned the tanner's trade. Breithaupt came to Buffalo, New York with his family in 1844. He operated a tannery in partnership with his father; after his father's death, he took on a partner and continued in business until 1861, when he sold his share and moved to Berlin.
In 1853, he had married Catharine Hailer of Berlin. He had met his future wife while on a trip to Canada to buy sheepskins. Hailer was the daughter of businessman Jacob Hailer, an early German immigrant to the area. In 1857, Breithaupt opened a tannery in Berlin in partnership with Jacob Wagner, who died in 1858. His tannery in Berlin was destroyed by fire in 1867 and 1870, but Breithaupt rebuilt each time.
He died in 1880 while still in office as the mayor of Berlin.
