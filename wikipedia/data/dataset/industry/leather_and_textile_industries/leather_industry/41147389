Pfister & Vogel (P&V) was an American tannery business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Frederick Vogel emigrated from Wurtemberg, Germany to Milwaukee. In 1848, he founded a tannery on Milwaukee's Menominee River. Having also emigrated from Wurtemberg in 1845, Vogel's cousin Guido Pfister opened a shoe store on nearby West Water Street. They joined forces as the Pfister & Vogel Leather Company in 1853, and their company thrived, becoming one of the largest leather producers in the country. August H. Vogel was vice-president of the company until his death.
The company changed hands several times. Its last owners, U.S. Leather Company, shut it down in 2000. Their buildings have been readapted for residential use.
