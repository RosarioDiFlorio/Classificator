Gascoigne Leather Furniture was founded in Perth, Western Australia by Kim Gascoigne and Helen Gascoigne in 1976. Originally with 130 employees, Gascoigne Leather Furniture began operating out of a small factory in Willetton before relocating to a larger factory in Midvale several years later. In February 1999 the Midvale factory suffered $1.5 million worth of damage following an extensive fire started accidentally by two teenage employees.
In 2000, the company made the decision to begin manufacturing in Malaysia, with a factory controlled by Michael Gascoigne. The Malaysian factory is currently the company's primary manufacturer, with over 50% of Gascoigne Leather Furniture's products being manufactured by the Gascoigne Group. The company has also opened the first of five retail stores, Gascoigne Leather Centre in Osborne Park, Western Australia.
