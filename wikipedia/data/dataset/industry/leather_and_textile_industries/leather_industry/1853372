Chamois leather (British pronunciation:  or American pronunciation: ) â€” is a type of porous leather, traditionally the skin of the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), a type of European mountain goat but today it is made almost exclusively from the flesh split of a sheepskin. The leather is favored for its gentle, non-abrasive composition and absorption properties. It has a range of uses:
Gloves in the 19th to the first half of the 20th century
Leather jackets, small bags, and pouches
Polishing cloths for jewels or shoes
Filtering fuel
Automotive drying material that is safe on acrylic, lacquer, enamel, and polyurethane paints and clear-coats
General household cleaning
Orthopedics and other medical uses
Imitation chamois leather is made using other leathers (such as the domestic goat, or pig), and synthetic chamois leather is usually made from polyvinyl alcohol or non-woven viscose rayon.
