G Ettinger Limited is a British company, based in London, specialising in luxury leather goods. Founded in 1934 by the German emigrant Gerard Ettinger, the eponymous company is still family-owned and run.
The company designs and traditionally manufactures small leather goods for various British and international brands and retailers. It also has developed its own brand (Ettinger), which is distributed internationally, especially in Japan.
The company has its own leather factory in Walsall, but has kept its head office in London.
G Ettinger Ltd was awarded a Royal Warrant to HRH The Prince of Wales in 1996 and has also made gifts under licence for the Wimbledon Championships since 1992.
