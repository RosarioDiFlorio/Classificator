Poltrona Frau is a furniture-maker founded in 1912 by Sardinian-born Renzo Frau in Turin, Italy, headquartered since the early 1960s in Tolentino, Italy and specializing in leather seating for interior and automotive applications. The company name combines the Italian word for armchair, "Poltrona" and "Frau," the last name of its founder.
Noted for their exhaustive quality standards, the company uses a 21-step leather tanning process (vs. industry standard ranging from 12-15 steps) where the full-grain leather is dyed through, so a surface scratch wonâ€™t reveal a lining underneath. 95% of the company's products are made by hand.
In 2004, Poltrona Frau acquired noted Italian furniture company Cappellini, and the Poltrona Frau Group now includes brands Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Cassina, Alias, Nemo Lighting, Ceramica Flaminia and Fish Design. In 2014, United States-based Haworth Group purchased a controlling interest in Poltrona Frau.
As of early 2014, the company operates 70 brand stores in 65 countries.
