Garvergården (lit. "The Tanner's House") is a half-timbered building complex from circa 1600 situated in Vestergade in Køge, Denmark. Owned by shoemakers and tanner for almost 200 years, from 1732, until the early 1920s, it bears testament to a time when Køge was a centre for shoemaking and tanning. The building fronting the street and a side wing on its rear are listed.
