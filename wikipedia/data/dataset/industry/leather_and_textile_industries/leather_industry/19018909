Kangaroo leather is a strong light weight leather derived from the hide of the kangaroo.
Kangaroos are harvested. Both the meat and the hides are sold. Although most species of macropod are protected from hunting by law, a small number of the large-sized species which exist in high numbers can be hunted by commercial hunters. This policy has been criticised by some wildlife activists.
