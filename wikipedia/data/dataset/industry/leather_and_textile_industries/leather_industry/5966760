Bicast leather (also known as bi-cast leather, bycast leather, sometimes described as split leather) is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane that is applied to the surface and then embossed. Because it is only used for the backing, the leather portion of this material is generally not visible in finished goods made from bicast. Bicast was originally made for the apparel industry for glossy shoes, and more recently was adopted by the furniture industry. The resulting product has an artificially consistent texture that is easier to clean and maintain, as is the case with most plastic materials. When used for footwear, it cannot be considered equal to conventional leather as it lacks the strength, breatheability, and durability of the natural product.
Production of synthetic, artificial/faux "leathers" has evolved so that a shell coating layer is applied on top of a synthetic polymer blend, so the definition of "synthetic", "artificial/faux" leather methods of production no longer necessarily requires composite leather blends of (coated) raw-tanned cowhide grains or its fibrous layers. Such purely synthetic materials are called PU leather (short for "polyurethane leather") or vegan leather.
