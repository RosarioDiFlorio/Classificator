Tanbark is the bark of certain species of tree. It is traditionally used for tanning hides into leather.
The words "tannin", "tanning", "tan," and "tawny" are derived from the Medieval Latin tannare, "to convert into leather."
Bark mills are horse- or oxen-driven or water powered edge mills and were used in earlier times to shred the tanbark to derive tannins for the leather industry. A "barker" was a person who stripped bark from trees to supply bark mills.
