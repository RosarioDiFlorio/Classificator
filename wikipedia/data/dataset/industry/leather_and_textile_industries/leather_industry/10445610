Liming is a process used for parchment or leather processing, in which hides are soaked in an alkali solution. It is performed using a drum and paddle or a pit. Its objectives are:
Removal of interfibrillary proteins.
Removal of Keratin proteins.
Collagen swelling due to the alkaline pH.
Collagen fibre bundle splitting.
Removal of natural grease and fats
Liming operations of cattle hides usually last 18 hours and are generally associated with the alkaline phase of beamhouse operations.
