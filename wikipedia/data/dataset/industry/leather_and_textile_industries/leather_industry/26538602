Dowden Tannery is a historic tannery building located at Cold Spring Harbor in Suffolk County, New York. It was built about 1840 and is a three bay, two story brick structure coated in stucco. Two, one story gable roofed side additions were built in the early 20th century. The tannery is located in a residential area southeast of Woodbury Road, and east of Cold Spring Harbor Railroad Station. Long Island Rail Road's Port Jefferson Branch runs behind the building, which is accessible only from a diagonal driveway leading from above the embankment of West Rogues Path.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
