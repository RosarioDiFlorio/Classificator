Jean-François Leleu (1729 - 1807) was a leading French furniture-maker (ébéniste) of the eighteenth century.
Leleu was trained in the workshop of Jean-François Oeben (1721-1763), and after his master's death took the workshop's lead and became master in 1764. His furniture was known for its high quality, elegance, and restraint, with inlays of diamonds, roses, or floral bouquets. When working for marchands-merciers, he also used inlays of Sèvres porcelain and lacquer. Leleu's clients included the Prince de Condé and Madame du Barry.
