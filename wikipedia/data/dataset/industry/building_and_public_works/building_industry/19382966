Property Ladder was the original British version of the television series Property Ladder which ran for 7 series between 2001-2009. Hosted by Sarah Beeny, it followed the journey of amateur property developers as they set out to make a life changing profit from renovating challenging houses.
The show underwent a change in format during 2004, featuring two developments per episode rather than one. In early 2009, Channel 4 announced that a new series, re-titled Property Snakes and Ladders, would be broadcast. The first to be filmed in a struggling market, ultimately it was the final series broadcast.
In 2012 Beeny returned to the format to host "Sarah Beeny's Double Your House for Half The Money", which follows two sets of home owners renovating their own homes rather than developing them to sell.
