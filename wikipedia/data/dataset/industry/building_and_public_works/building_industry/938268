Building co-operatives are co-operative housing corporations where individuals or families work together to directly construct their own homes in a cooperative fashion.
Members of this type of co-operative purchase building materials in bulk and co-operate with other members of the co-op during the construction phase of the co-operative. When the housing has been completed the members usually own their homes directly. In some cases, roads, parkland and community facilities continue to be owned by the co-operative.
