The sabre saw (also saber saw) is a hand-held powered reciprocating saw. It is similar to, but larger than, a jigsaw.
The sabre saw uses a toothed blade, chiefly to cut through wood and other soft materials. The lack of a large sole plate, which a jigsaw possesses, significantly reduces the controllability of the sabre saw.
