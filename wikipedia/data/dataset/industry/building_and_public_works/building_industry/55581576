In Norse mythology, Sumarbrandr is the sword of Freyr, a Norse god associated with sunshine and fair weather. Sumarbrandr is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the few weapons that is capable of fighting on its own. Sumarbrandr was the only other weapon feared by the giants after Mjölnir. After Freyr gave up the sword to Skírnir for the hand of the giantess Gerðr, he will die at Ragnarök because he didn't have his sword, fighting Surtr with an antler.
