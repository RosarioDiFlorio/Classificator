Metal profile sheet systems provide an efficient and reliable solution to the need to build envelopes of single story buildings. Over the years, these systems have evolved from the single skin metal cladding often associated with agricultural buildings to highly developed systems used with industrial, retrial and leisure applications. However, as with all construction components, the ability of the cladding to satisfy its functional requirements is dependent on its correct specification and installation. And equally as important, on its interaction with the other elements of the building envelope and structure.
