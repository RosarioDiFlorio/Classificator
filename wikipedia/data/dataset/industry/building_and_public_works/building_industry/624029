Duncan Phyfe (1768-16 August 1854) was one of nineteenth-century America's leading cabinetmakers.
Although he did not create any new furniture style, he interpreted fashionable European trends in a manner so distinguished and particular that he became a major spokesman for Neoclassicism in the United States, influencing a whole generation of American cabinetmakers.
