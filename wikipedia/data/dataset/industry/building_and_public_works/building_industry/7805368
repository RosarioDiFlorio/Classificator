Carl Martin Timell (born 13 November 1957) is a Swedish television presenter.
He started his career as a television host on SVT in the 1980s, hosting several entertainment and children's programs. In 1996 he moved to TV4 where he worked as one of the channel's main profiles, as a host for multiple television programs. He is best known for hosting Ã„ntligen hemma, one of the most successful and long-running Swedish Do it yourself-shows, since 1997.
In October 2017, all of Timell's shows on TV4 were cancelled after the hashtag #MeToo had been used by a few women to point out Timell's sexual and mental abuse of them. He was also suspended from TV4.
Timell is married and has two children. He is the brother of Anders Timell, a Swedish restaurant manager and radio host.
