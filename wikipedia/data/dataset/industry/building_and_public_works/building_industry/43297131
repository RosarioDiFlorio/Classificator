Anne Hvide's House (Danish: Anne Hvides GÃ¥rd) is a two-storey, half-timbered building in Svendborg on the Danish island of Funen. One of the oldest houses in the town, it was built in 1560 by Anne Hvide, a widow of noble descent. It was used as an inn from 1837 to 1867. After being restored in 1916, it became a museum with exhibitions relating to the history of Svendborg.
