The shepherd's axe (Slovak: valaška; Hungarian: fokos; Polish: depending on the region: ciupaga, rabanica, uobeszek, cekanka; Czech: valaška; Romanian: baltag; Rusyn: валашка, valaška; Ukrainian: бартка, bartka, топірець, topirets') is a long thin light axe used in past centuries by shepherds in the Carpathian Mountains, especially in Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine and Hungary. The features of a shepherd's axe combine a tool with a walking stick, that could be used as a light weapon. It has symbolic historical and cultural connotations and is still used as a prop in many traditional dances, for example the odzemok.
