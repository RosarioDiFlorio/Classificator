A claw hammer is a tool primarily used for pounding nails into, or extracting nails from, some other object. Generally, a claw hammer is associated with woodworking but is not limited to use with wood products. It is not suitable for heavy hammering on metal surfaces (such as in machining work), as the steel of its head is somewhat brittle; the ball-peen hammer is more suitable for such metalwork.
An early claw hammer is seen in Albrecht DÃ¼rer's etching "Melencolia I," dated 1514, halfway up the left side. There are several nails in the lower right corner.
