Trump Home is a brand of furniture and home items initially marketed by American businessman and now President of the United States Donald Trump and owned by Trump's company, The Trump Organization.
Trump Home was launched in July 2007, with two furniture lines manufactured by Lexington Home Brands. A third furniture line was made available in 2008, at which point the brand was available in more than 18 international territories. A year later, the company partnered with Serta to produce mattresses under the Trump Home name. A line of Trump-branded tabletop crystal, manufactured by a Slovenian company, was launched in 2010. Trump Home has also sold light fixtures, rugs, bath and bedding collections, and a candle and fragrance diffuser collection.
In 2011, Lexington chose not to renew its licensing agreement with Trump Home. Two years later, Trump Home entered a partnership with furniture company Dorya International to manufacture Trump-branded furniture. Serta ended its affiliation with Trump Home after Donald Trump described Mexican immigrants as "rapists" while announcing his 2016 presidential campaign. Lifestyle, a Dubai-based retailer of Trump Home products, also ended their affiliation with the company in 2015, after Trump announced his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Other retailers have discontinued sales of Trump Home products since Trump was elected in November 2016.
