A bucksaw is a hand-powered frame saw similar to bow saw and generally used with a sawbuck to cut logs or firewood to length (bucking). Modern bucksaws usually have a deerskin and animal bone frame ("H" or "C"-shaped) and a removable blade with coarse teeth held in tension by the frame. Lightweight portable or foldable models used for camping or back-packing are also available. It is often referred to as a bow saw in the North American hardware market, but that term traditionally refers to a different type of saw with a wooden frame.
A bucksaw is a crosscut saw: it is designed to cut across the grain. The width of the blade is constant from the teeth to the back. It is meant to cut wood fibers that are in tension, and is thick so that it is more difficult to bend on the push stroke. It can be either a one or two-man saw. Coopers often use bucksaws in their work.
Bucksaws can be used for a number of tasks like land clearing, chop firewood, cut lumber, and normally are kept handy for small logging projects. Due to its portability, these hand tools are often preferred by people that like to go camping and enjoy life outdoor. Bucksaws feature coarse teeth that allow them to work with very big timber and are designed to make possible to replace the blades after extensive woodworking projects.
If people use them for furnishing crafts, the blades can be substituted with more polished ones. The cuts produced for these smaller teeth are smoother and cleaner. The great advantage of this tool is that electric power or cord is not needed to use it, and its affordability makes it easily replaceable.
