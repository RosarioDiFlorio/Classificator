The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is intended to describe building and construction industry data.
It is a platform neutral, open file format specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based file format with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building information modeling (BIM) based projects. The IFC model specification is open and available. It is registered by ISO and is an official International Standard ISO 16739:2013.
Because of its focus on ease of interoperability between software platforms, the Danish government has made the use of IFC format(s) compulsory for publicly aided building projects. Also, the Finnish state-owned facility management company Senate Properties demands use of IFC compatible software and BIM in all their projects. Also the Norwegian Government, Health and Defense client organisations require use of IFC BIM in all projects as well as many municipalities, private clients, contractors and designers have integrated IFC BIM in their business.
