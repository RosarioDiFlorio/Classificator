A sewer dosing unit (SDU) is a plumbing device to allow effective sewage disposal with low liquid-flow rates. With a global emphasis on water saving, many new buildings and renovations are seeing the installation of water saving fixtures such as low flow shower heads and low flush toilets. With the decrease in wastewater flows problems are arising from waste solids not being carried completely to the main sewers, often causing blockages.
