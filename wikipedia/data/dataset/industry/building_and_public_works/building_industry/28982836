John McLean (born 1770; died 1825) was an English furniture maker and designer. He was recognized as one of the best of his era, representing the best in English cabinetmaking. Examples of his furniture can be found in the Victorian and Albert Museum, The California Palace of the Legion of Honor and the Library at Saltram, Devon.
The origins of the McLean firm is somewhat confused by the many variations in spelling the name 'McLean'. "John MacKlane, upholder and cabinet maker in Little Newport Street, off Leicester Square" is listed in 1774. As many as eight spellings have been recorded, the problem arising because many people in those days were illiterate and names were written phonetically at the whim of whoever was writing the name at the time.
