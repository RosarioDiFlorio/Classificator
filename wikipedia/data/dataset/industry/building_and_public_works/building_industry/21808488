The Axe of Perun, also called a "hatchet amulet", is an archaeological artifact worn as a pendant and shaped like a battle axe. It is mostly found in modern day Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Scandinavia. Connection with the Slavic pre-Christian god Perun was made by VP Darkevich, although some authors prefer the association with Norse material culture.
