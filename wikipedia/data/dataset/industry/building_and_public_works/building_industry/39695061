Zero liquid discharge is a process that is beneficial to industrial and municipal organizations as well as the environment because it saves money and no effluent, or discharge, is left over. ZLD systems employ the most advanced wastewater treatment technologies to purify and recycle virtually all of the wastewater produced. Also Zero liquid discharge technologies help plants meet discharge and water reuse requirements, enabling businesses to:
Meet stringent cooling tower blowdown and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) discharge regulations.
Treat and recover valuable products from waste streams.
Better manage produced water.
A Zero liquid discharge facility (ZLD), is an industrial plant without discharge of wastewaters. Target ZLD is normally reached by
Waste water strong recovery
Separation by evaporation or boiling of water part of waste water not reusable, in evaporators, crystallizers and condensate recovery. ZLD plants produce solid waste.
