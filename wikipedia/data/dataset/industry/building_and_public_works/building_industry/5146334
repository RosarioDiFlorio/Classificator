Over illumination is the presence of lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate for a specific activity. Over illumination was commonly ignored between 1950 and 1995, especially in office and retail environments. Since then, however, the interior design community has begun to reconsider this practice. Over illumination encompasses two separate concerns:
Unnecessary electric lighting is expensive and energy-intensive. Lighting accounts for approximately 9% of residential electricity use as of 2001 and about 40% of commercial electricity use.
Excessive levels of artificial light may adversely affect health. These detrimental effects may depend on the spectrum as well as the overall brightness level of light.
Over illumination can be reduced by installing occupancy sensors, using natural sunlight whenever possible, turning off lights when leaving a room, or changing the type of lightbulb. Over illumination does not refer to snowblindness, where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye. Too little light, the opposite of over illumination, is associated with seasonal affective disorder.
