Industrially, the correct term is wood dust. In everyday language, it is known as sawdust. Sawdust or wood dust is a by-product or waste product of woodworking operations such as sawing, milling, planing, routing, drilling and sanding. It is composed of fine particles of wood. These operations can be performed by woodworking machinery, portable power tools or by use of hand tools. Wood dust is also the byproduct of certain animals, birds and insects which live in wood, such as the woodpecker and carpenter ant. It can present a hazard in manufacturing industries, especially in terms of its flammability. Sawdust is the main component of particleboard. Wood dust is a form of particulate matter, or particulates. Research on wood dust health hazards comes within the field of occupational health science, and study of wood dust control comes within the field of indoor air quality engineering.
