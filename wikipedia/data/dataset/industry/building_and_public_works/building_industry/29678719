Radiant cooling is the use of cooled surfaces to remove sensible heat by radiation and convection. It is related to radiant heating. Radiant systems that use water to cool the radiant surfaces are called hydronic systems. Unlike “all-air” air conditioning systems that circulate cooled air only, hydronic radiant systems circulate cooled water in pipes through specially-mounted panels or a building’s floor or ceiling to provide comfortable temperatures. There is a separate system to provide air for ventilation, dehumidification, and potentially additionally cooling. Radiant systems are less common than all-air systems for cooling, but can have advantages compared to all-air systems in some applications.
Some well-known buildings using radiant cooling include Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport, the Infosys Software Development Building 1 in Hyderabad, and the San Francisco Exploratorium. Radiant cooling is also used as a design strategy in some net zero energy buildings.
