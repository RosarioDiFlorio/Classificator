In architecture a reglet is 1.) a thin, flat band relating to mouldings or 2.) a groove in a wall or parapet for receiving the top edge of a flashing. In this usage it is also called a raggle and may be related to regle, a groove. If a flashing is simply applied to a surface then it is called a face reglet.
Flashing reglets secure a receiver counter flashing or the roofing membrane and must contain a sealant to secure the material. The reglet counter flashing allows for the roofing material to be removed for re-roofing.
Usually, in the U.S.A., when reglet is pronounced, the T is not silent. Alternative descriptions used by tradesmen include "rivlet", or "rivulet". In modern, budget construction where low slope roofing and parapets are used, reglet and coping can comprise the majority of flashing costs.
