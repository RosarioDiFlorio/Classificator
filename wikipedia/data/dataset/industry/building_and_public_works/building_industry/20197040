Integrated project delivery (IPD) is a collaborative alliance of people, systems, business structures and practices into a process that harnesses the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results, increase value to the owner, reduce waste, and maximize efficiency through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction.
There are eight main sequential phases to the integrated project delivery method:
conceptualization phase [expanded programming]
criteria design phase [expanded schematic design]
detailed design phase [expanded design development]
implementation documents phase [construction documents]
agency review phase
buyout phase
construction phase
closeout phase
facilities management
