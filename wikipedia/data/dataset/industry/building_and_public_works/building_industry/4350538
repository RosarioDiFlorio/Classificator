André Jacob Roubo (1739–1791) was a carpenter, cabinetmaker and author. Roubo was born and died in Paris. The son and grandson of master cabinetmakers, he earned that same designation himself in 1774 through the publication of his masterwork treatise on woodworking.
He wrote a highly influential complete treatise on woodworking that covers practically all the associated trades. This multi-volume work, L'Art du Menuisier (The Art of the Joiner), published between 1769 and 1774 by the Académie des Sciences, contains sections and illustrations on: building carpentry, furniture making, and precious woodworking (ébénisterie), carriage making, and garden woodworking.
Roubo's design for a workbench has proven to be popular amongst some modern woodworkers.
