A rebar spacer is a device that secures the reinforcing steel or "rebar" in reinforced concrete structures as the rebar is assembled in place prior to the final concrete pour. The spacers are left in place for the pour to keep the reinforcing in place, and become a permanent part of the structure.
The main categories of rebar spacers are:
Linear Spacers (Î -section profiles, H-section profiles, or other 3 dimensional shapes),
Point Spacers (wheel spacers, various tower or chair-like shapes)
Rebar spacers can be divided in three raw materials categories:
Concrete spacers
Plastic spacers
Metal spacers
The concrete spacers have the advantage of the same raw material which will improve the watertightness and strength of the concrete. Plastic spacers have the advantage of the low cost production and fast processing.
