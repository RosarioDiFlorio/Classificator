Limestone Calcined Clay Cement (LC3) is a low-carbon cement developed by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, IIT-Delhi, IIT-Bombay, Technology and Action for Rural Development (TARA), IIT-Madras, and the Central University of Las Villas (Cuba). The cement can reduce carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) related to manufacturing by 30% as compared to Ordinary Portland Cement. In 2014, the LC3 project received 4m CHF in Research and Development funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).
