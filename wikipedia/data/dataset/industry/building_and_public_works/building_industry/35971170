5D BIM, an acronym for 5D Building Information Modeling, is a term used in the CAD and construction industries, and refers to the intelligent linking of individual 3D CAD components or assemblies with schedule (time - 4D BIM) constraints  and then with cost-related information.
The creation of 5D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to owners) of a construction project to visualize the progress of construction activities and its related costs over time. This BIM-centric project management technique has potential to improve management and delivery of projects of any size or complexity.
In June 2016, McKinsey, a consultancy, identified 5D BIM technology as one of five big ideas poised to disrupt construction.It defined 5D BIM as "a five-dimensional representation of the physical and functional characteristics of any project. It considers a projectâ€™s cost and schedule in addition to the standard spatial design parameters in 3-D."
