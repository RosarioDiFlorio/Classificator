Trelystan is a remote parish and township on the border of the historic county of Montgomeryshire with Shropshire. Trelystan now forms part of the community of Forden, Leighton and Trelystan in Powys. St Maryâ€™s Church, Trelystan is sited 900 feet up at the S end of the Long Mountain to the east of Welshpool. Trelystan was a chapel of ease within the parish of Worthen and it also served the township of Leighton. In 1854 Leighton became a separate parish and in 1874 Trelystan also became a parish. In 1933 Trelystan, Leighton and Rhos Goch parishes were combined into a larger Trelystan parish.
Trelystan is now within the Chirbury parish grouping in the Diocese of Hereford and within the Archdeaconry of Ludlow.
In some old sources the parish is also referred to as Wolston Mynd. (Walton Hill is on the eastern edge of the parish.)
