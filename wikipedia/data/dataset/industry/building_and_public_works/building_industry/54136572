A glass breaker is a small hand tool designed to aid in the emergency extrication of occupants from a vehicle. Most glass breakers contain a sharp pointed metal tip for breaking tempered glass and a sharp knife for slicing seatbelts.  Glass breakers are also built into other tools, such as flashlights or multitools. Unlike bus mallets, glass breakers are smaller and generally privately owned.
