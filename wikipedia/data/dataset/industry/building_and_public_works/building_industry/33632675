Saint Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal (French: Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal) is a Roman Catholic minor basilica and national shrine on Mount Royal's Westmount Summit in Montreal, Quebec. It is Canada's largest church. Its dome is the third-largest of its kind in the world after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in Côte d'Ivoire.
The basilica enshrines a statue of Saint Joseph, which was authorised a Canonical coronation by Pope Pius X on 19 March 1910 via Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli and another from Pope Pius XII on 31 July 1955 via Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger now located within its crypt department. The shrine is also famous due to its association with Brother Andre Bessette who was believed to possess healing powers through his Josephian devotion with its notable oil oinment given freely to its believers.
