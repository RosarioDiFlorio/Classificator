SolarWall was invented by Conserval Engineering's president, John Hollick in the late 1980s. Conserval decided to focus on building integrated solar heating with its SolarWall invention often referred to as transpired collector. SolarWall systems are building integrated and consist of perforated metal heating panels mounted onto the building's sun facing wall. SolarWall heaters were first used to heat and ventilate large buildings with a requirement for ventilation air or fresh air. Solar space heating and solar crop or process drying are other applications that are ideally suited for SolarWall heaters. The unglazed design has and continues to be used for heating or preheating large volumes of fresh air whereas the partially glazed 2-stage SolarWall heater is becoming the preferred choice for achieving higher temperatures when heating buildings in colder climates.
