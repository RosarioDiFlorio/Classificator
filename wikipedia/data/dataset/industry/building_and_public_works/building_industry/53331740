Wendy Maruyama (born 1952) is an artist, furniture maker, and educator from California. Born in La Junta, CA, to Reiko and John Maruyama, she is the oldest of three sisters. Wendy was born deaf in both ears and has worn a hearing aid since nine years old.
Maruyama was influential in the early period of post-modern artistic furniture. She challenged the masculine environments within the field of woodworking. Her work uses humor, social commentary, sculptural forms, and color to challenge the accepted notions of furniture. Conceptually her work deals with social practices such as her Japanese-American heritage, feminism, and wildlife endangerment in Africa. Maruyama served as the head of the Furniture Design department at San Diego State University for 30 years.
