Ligne Roset is a French modern furniture company that has over 200 stores and more than 1,000 retail distributors worldwide. The company was founded by Antoine Roset in 1860 in Montagnieu, France as a small business manufacturing bentwood walking sticks. In 1936, the company started manufacturing upholstered furniture and presently they design and manufacture household furniture, lighting, accessories, and textiles from a team of 50 European designers.
Among Ligne Roset's most recognized pieces is the Togo line of seating, designed by Michel Ducaroy in 1973. It features ergonomic designs with 5 densities of foam combined to make the frame. The foam construction and quilted covers make each piece both visually attractive and very comfortable.
Known for its artful collaborations with both established and up-and-coming talents in contemporary design, Ligne Roset offers consumers an entire lifestyle in which to live both boldly and beautifully via its furniture collections and complimentary decorative accessories, lighting, rugs, textiles and occasional items. In-house manufacturing allows Ligne Roset to closely supervise the entire product creation process and uphold the highest production standards. Matching its deeply held belief in design with investment and technical innovation, Ligne Roset has grown from a small business to a multinational company with factories and headquarters in France and more than 200 exclusive Ligne Roset stores and 1,000 retail distributors worldwide. All the while, the company has been family-run since its inception in 1860.
