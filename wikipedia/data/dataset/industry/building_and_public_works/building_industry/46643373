B&ES TR/19 are the duct-work cleaning guidelines provided by Building Engineering Services Association for internal cleanliness of ventilation systems. The guidelines were introduced in 2005 by amalgamation of pre-existing TR/17 and DW/TM2 guidelines. Once a system is TR/19 compliant, it has been found that average total High Risk Combustion Load Levels (HR-CLLs) can be reduced by a total of 83%.
