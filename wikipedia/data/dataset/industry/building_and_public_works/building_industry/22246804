A natural swimming pool or natural swimming pond (NSP) is a system consisting of a constructed body of water, where the water is contained by an isolating membrane or membranes, in which no chemicals or devices that disinfect or sterilize water are used, and all clarifying and purifying of the water is achieved through biological filters and plants rooted hydroponically in the system.
This definition is based on the FLL (Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau e.V - the Landscaping and Landscape Development Research Society) publication "Recommendations for the planning, construction and maintenance of private swimming and natural pools" 2006 Edition.
It is called a "natural swimming pool" because the filtration systems used have biological equivalents in the natural world. In fact if there is not an example of the type of filtration being used in the natural world then it is not seen by the IOB (International Organization for natural Bathing waters) to be naturally filtered. Natural aquarium and koi ponds also exist, but use algae scrubbers for their filtration.
Systems that use UV, ozone and copper/silver ion disinfection techniques are examples of non natural methods and, by definition, are not Natural Swimming Pools.
