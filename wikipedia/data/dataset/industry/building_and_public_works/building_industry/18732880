A storey (British English) or story (American English; see spelling differences) is any level part of a building with a floor that could be used by people (for living, work, storage, recreation, etc.). The plurals are "storeys" and "stories" respectively.
The terms "floor", "level", or "deck" are used in a similar way, except that it is usual to talk of a "24-storey building", but "the 13th floor". The floor at ground or street level is called the "ground floor" in many places. The words "storey" and "floor" exclude levels of the building that are not covered by a roof, such as the terrace on the top roof of many buildings.
