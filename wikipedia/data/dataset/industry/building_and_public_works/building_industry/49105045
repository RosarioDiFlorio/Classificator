Judeo-nazarenism is a new term in the study of early Christianity. The term is distinguished from the term "Nazarenes" used in Jewish writings, to avoid the recognition of Jesus as Messiah, which is inherent in the term "Christians". It's also necessary to distinguish the various Christian sects who were using the name "Nazarenes" over the centuries.
