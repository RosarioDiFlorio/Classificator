Systematic hierarchical approach for resilient process screening (SHARPS) is a cost-screening technique to assist designers achieve a desired investment payback period during preliminary design of water-using systems. Heuristics involving equipment susbtitution and intensification are used to guide process changes. SHARPS method has been used to yield cost-effective minimum water network for water-intensive facilities.
