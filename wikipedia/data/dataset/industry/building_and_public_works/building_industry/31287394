A jigsaw power tool is a jigsaw made up of an electric motor and a reciprocating saw blade.
A jigsaw with a bevel function on the sole plate allows cutting angles of typically up to 45 degrees relative to the normal vertical stroke for cutting miter joints.
In the past, what are now usually called scroll saws were often referred to as jigsaws.
A power jigsaw may also be referred to, by some manufacturers, as a "bayonet saw" or sabre saw.
