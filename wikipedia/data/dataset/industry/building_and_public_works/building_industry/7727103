Self-build is the practice of creating an individual home for oneself through a variety of different methods. The self-builder's input into this process varies from doing the actual building work to contracting out all the work to an architect or building package company. The term self-build in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland is expressly used when an individual obtains a building plot and then builds his or her own home on that plot.
