The Pontifical College Josephinum is a four-year, Roman Catholic liberal arts college and graduate school of theology founded by Monsignor Joseph Jessing in 1888 and located in Columbus, Ohio, United States. The seminary prepares its students to become priests in the Roman Catholic Church. Students come from U.S. dioceses that do not have their own seminaries, as well as dioceses from around the world.
The Josephinum, which means "House of Joseph", was granted pontifical status in 1892 by Pope Leo XIII, recognizing her unique mission of forming priests for the international Church.
