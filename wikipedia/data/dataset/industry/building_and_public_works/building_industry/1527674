A trip hammer, also known as a tilt hammer or helve hammer, is a massive powered hammer used in:
agriculture to facilitate the labor of pounding, decorticating and polishing of grain;
mining, where ore from deep veins was crushed into small pieces (though a stamp mill was more usual for this);
finery forges, for drawing out blooms made from wrought iron into more workable bar iron;
fabricating various articles of wrought iron, latten (an early form of brass), steel and other metals.
One or more trip hammers were set up in a forge, also known variously as a hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works. The hammers were usually raised by a cam and then released to fall under the force of gravity. Historically, trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel, and are known to have been used in China as long ago as 40 BC or maybe even as far back as the Zhou Dynasty (1050 BCâ€“221 BC) and in medieval Europe by the 12th century. During the Industrial Revolution the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the power hammer. Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of line shafts, pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply.
