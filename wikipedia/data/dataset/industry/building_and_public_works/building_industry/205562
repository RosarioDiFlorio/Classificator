A saltire, also called Saint Andrew's Cross, is a heraldic symbol in the form of a diagonal cross, like the shape of the letter X in Roman type. The word comes from the Middle French sautoir ("stirrup"), possibly owing to the shape of the triangular areas in the design.
It appears in numerous flags, including those of Scotland and Jamaica, and other coats of arms and seals. A variant, also appearing on many past and present flags and symbols, is the Cross of Burgundy.
A warning sign in the shape of a saltire is also used to indicate the point at which a railway line intersects a road at a level crossing.
In Unicode, the cross is encoded at U+2613 â˜“ saltire (HTML &#9747;). See X mark for similar symbols that might be more accessible.
