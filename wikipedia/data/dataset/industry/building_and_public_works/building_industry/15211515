The solarCity is an energy-saving living district in Linz-Pichling, Austria, which provides living space for about 4,000 people. The houses were built using a low-energy design. The idea and motivation for providing energy efficient living arrangements stems from the fact that fossil fuels contribute to global warming and that their use should therefore be avoided.
Planning of the project began in 1992. Since 1999, 1,300 apartments were gradually built during a 6-year period. The total cost of the project amounted to 190 million euros. Nearly two-thirds of which was used for the residential building, and only a third of the total cost was due to infrastructure.
