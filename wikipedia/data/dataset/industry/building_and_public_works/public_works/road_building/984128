Burlington House is a building on Piccadilly in Mayfair, London. It was originally a private Palladian mansion owned by the Earl of Burlington, and was expanded in the mid-19th century after being purchased by the British government.
Burlington House is most familiar to the general public as the venue for temporary art exhibitions from the Royal Academy, which is housed in the main building at the northern end of the courtyard. Five learned societies occupy the two wings on the east and west sides of the courtyard and the Piccadilly wing at the southern end. Collectively known as the Courtyard Societies, these societies are:
Geological Society of London (Piccadilly/east wing)
Linnean Society of London (Piccadilly/west wing)
Royal Astronomical Society (west wing)
Society of Antiquaries of London (west wing)
Royal Society of Chemistry (east wing)
