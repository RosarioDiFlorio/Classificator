The Aztec Hotel is a historical landmark building in Monrovia, in the San Gabriel Valley, California. The hotel is an example of Mayan Revival architecture still in existence. It was designed by architect Robert Stacy-Judd, and built on U.S. Route 66 in 1924. The hotel was closed for renovations in 2012. 
The hotel has a revivalist style that mixes an abstraction from Maya architecture sources along with art deco and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.
The Aztec Hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The hotel's owners began restoration to preserve as much of the original ornamentation as possible in 2000 under the National Park Service's Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program.
The hotel was featured in the 2009 romantic comedy Spooner. Scenes were filmed in front of the hotel as well as many interior scenes showing the lobby, bar, hallways and inside one of the rooms.
