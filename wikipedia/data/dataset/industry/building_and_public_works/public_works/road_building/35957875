The Munger-Moss Sandwich Shop served travellers on U.S. Route 66 in Missouri circa-1936. Located on the Big Piney River at Devil's Elbow, Missouri until 1945 (at what is now the Elbow Inn), it relocated to Lebanon, Missouri after World War II when construction of a four-lane bypass of U.S. Route 66 in Missouri to Fort Leonard Wood drew traffic away from the original Munger Moss BBQ site.
A Munger Moss Motel was added in 1946 as an addition to the Lebanon roadside restaurant and filling station, both of which are now gone.
