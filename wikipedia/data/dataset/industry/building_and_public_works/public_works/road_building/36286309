66 Motel, an independently owned six-room motel established 1946-47 in Needles, formerly served travellers on U.S. Route 66 in California. Bypassed c. 1970 by Interstate 40, the motel has been used as single room occupancy apartments since the 1990s.
The tiny independent motel is one of numerous U.S. Route 66 businesses which had taken the name of the now-historic highway in its heyday; there is also a 66 Drive-In cinema in Carthage, Missouri and a Route 66 Motel in Kingman, Arizona.
