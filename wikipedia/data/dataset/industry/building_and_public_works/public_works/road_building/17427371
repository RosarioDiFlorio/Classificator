The National Bank of Rolla Building was opened in March 1931 at 8th and Pine Streets in Rolla, Missouri, midway between St. Louis and Springfield. Because of its architectural character and its importance in the life of the city and history of U.S. Route 66, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
