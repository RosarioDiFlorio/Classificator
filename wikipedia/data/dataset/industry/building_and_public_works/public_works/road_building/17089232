The Piccadilly Arcade runs between Piccadilly and Jermyn Street in central London. It was opened in 1909, having been designed by Thrale Jell, and is a Grade II listed building.
The main entrance is on the south side of Piccadilly between Fortnum & Mason and The Ritz, directly opposite The Royal Academy. The Piccadilly Arcade contains sixteen high class shops, Piccadilly Vaults, an antique jewellery emporium, being the most notable. Other beautiful shops line the Arcade, many of which are tailors; being close to the historic shirt makers on Jermyn Street. Once there was a showroom for Waterford Crystal and Wedgwood chinaware; now occupied by Kent & Curwen (Gentleman's Club Sports wear). Another unusual shop is "The Armoury of St James" a seller of World Orders and toy soldiers.
There is yet another arcade on the south side of Piccadilly, The Princes Arcade. It is to the east of the Piccadilly Arcade, adjacent to St James's Church, Piccadilly and also runs through to Jermyn Street.
