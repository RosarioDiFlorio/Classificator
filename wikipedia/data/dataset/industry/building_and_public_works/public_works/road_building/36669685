Afton Station Packard Museum, a privately owned automotive museum on U.S. Route 66 in Afton, Oklahoma, is situated in a restored 1930s Eagle D-X filling station. It houses a showroom, 18 Packards & other vintage automobiles plus a collection of Route 66 memorabilia, including items from the now-demolished Buffalo Ranch Trading Post.
A restored set of historic D-X fuel pumps stands in the old station's forecourt and the red and white on blue "Approved Packard Service" dealership logo is proudly displayed atop a signpost.
As a Route 66 information stop for travelers, who come from as far afield as Europe, Australia, and Asia, the station/welcome center distributes maps, guidebooks and memorabilia as well as word-of-mouth information about The Mother Road.
