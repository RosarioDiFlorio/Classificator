The Gillioz Theatre is a historic theatre located at Springfield, Greene County, Missouri. It was built by M. E. Gillioz of Monett, Missouri. Mr. Gillioz was in the business of building bridges, and the theater was built with steel and concrete. Wood was only used for handrails, doors, and doorframes. The original cost of the building was $300,000. Renovation costs totaled approximately $1.9 million.
The theater opened on October 11, 1926, in Springfield, Missouri. Gillioz managed to secure a 100-year lease on one 16-foot (4.9 m) wide piece of property which bordered on U.S. Route 66, so that the theater could garner patrons who traveled on that historic highway. After many prosperous years, and many not-so-prosperous years, the "Gillioz, Theatre Beautiful" finally offered its last show in the summer of 1980, an opera.
The theater was originally a transition theater, with a pipe organ for silent movies and a stage for live performances, such as vaudeville acts. A sound system was installed in 1928 with the advent of talkies.
The Gillioz is mainly a concert venue. The Gillioz host a variety of entertainment such as Death Cab For Cutie, Switchfoot, Blue October, Gabriel Iglesias and more. Capacity for general admission is 1,300 and for reserved seating there is 1,015.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It is located in the Springfield Public Square Historic District.
