The Old Trails Bridge over the Colorado River, brought a now-abandoned portion of U.S. Route 66 across from Needles, California to Topock, Arizona. It is a brace-ribbed through arch bridge that was built in 1915-1916. It served as a highway bridge until 1947 when the Red Rock Bridge, formerly a railroad bridge, was modified for highway use. The Old Trails Bridge was later converted to a pipeline bridge.
It has also been known as Topock Bridge and as Needles Bridge. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.
