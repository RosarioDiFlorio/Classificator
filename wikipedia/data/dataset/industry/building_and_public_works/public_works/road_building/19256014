The First National Bank Building is a historic building located at 217-233 Central Avenue NW in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. The nine-story, L-shaped building was the city's first skyscraper. Built in 1922, the First National Bank Building was designed by Trost & Trost, an El Paso architecture firm that was well known in the region. At 43 m (141 ft), it was the tallest building in the city until the International Style Simms Building was built in 1954. The interior of the first floor is done almost entirely in grey streak marble, and features 28-foot-tall (8.5 m) vault ceilings.
The building was owned by First National Bank (later First Security Bank) until 1999, when it was purchased by a private developer with the intent to convert it into a luxury hotel. Plans later changed, and the building was instead remodeled into a high-end condominium project called The Banque Lofts, which opened in 2006.
