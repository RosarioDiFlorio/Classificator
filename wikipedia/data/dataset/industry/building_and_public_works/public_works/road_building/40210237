The Acoma Curio Shop is a former souvenir shop located on historic U.S. Route 66 in San Fidel, New Mexico. The store was built in 1916 by Abdoo Fidel, a Lebanese immigrant, and was originally a general store. In 1937, Fidel began to sell Native American curios to tourists passing through San Fidel on Route 66. Fidel's shop only sold curios crafted at the Acoma Pueblo, separating him from most souvenir shops at the time, which generally sold replica souvenirs or curios made by multiple tribes. In 1941, Fidel closed the curio shop and began selling general goods again. The building now houses an art gallery called Gallery 66.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 7, 2009.
