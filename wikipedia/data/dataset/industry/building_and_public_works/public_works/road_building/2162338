The Sunshine Building is a historic structure in downtown Albuquerque, in the U.S. state of New Mexico, at the intersection of Central Avenue and Second Street. The six-story building was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost and built in 1924, originally housing offices and a 920-seat movie theater. It is of reinforced concrete construction, with a facade of yellow brick.
The Sunshine Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and has been designated as a Historic Landmark by the city.
F. D. Fogg and Company, Jewelers, operated a fine jewelry store in the building from 1948 until the 1970s. The store's classic neon sign and pink marble facade were recognized downtown Albuquerque landmarks throughout that period.
The TV Show In Plain Sight filmed the exterior of this location, as the fictional office of the US Marshal's Witness Protection Service.
