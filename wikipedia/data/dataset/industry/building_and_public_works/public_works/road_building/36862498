Whiting Brothers was established in 1926 as a chain of gasoline stations based in St. Johns and Holbrook, Arizona. At its peak, it operated more than a hundred filling stations (including at least forty on the former U.S. Route 66), fifteen motels and various truck stops under a slogan of "quality gas for less".
The business began to decline in the 1970s due to fuel shortages and a drop in traffic at its locations on the US Highway system as these roads were bypassed by Interstate highways. Stations in still-viable locations were sold off individually by the 1980s while many locations on roads long bypassed were simply abandoned.
Some of the vacant stations with the original Whiting Brothers branding still remain, visible but abandoned, on long-bypassed stretches of US Route 66.
