The Midpoint Café, a restaurant, souvenir and antique shop on US Route 66 in Adrian, Texas, bills itself as geographically the midway point between Los Angeles and Chicago on historic Route 66. Signage in Adrian proudly declares a 1139-mile distance to each original US 66 endpoint; the café's slogan is "when you're here, you're halfway there".
Fran Houser, owner of the Midpoint Café from 1990 until 2012, is the basis for Flo of "Flo's V-8 Café" in Cars.
