The De Anza Motor Lodge is a historic motel located on former U.S. Route 66 in the Upper Nob Hill neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was built in 1939 by Charles G. Wallace, a local trader of Zuni art and pottery, who remained the owner until 1983. Wallace decorated the motel with a variety of Native American art, including a series of murals by Zuni artist Tony Edaakie in a basement room. Commissioned in 1951, these murals are one of the De Anza's most notable features. The motel was purchased by the city of Albuquerque in 2003.
