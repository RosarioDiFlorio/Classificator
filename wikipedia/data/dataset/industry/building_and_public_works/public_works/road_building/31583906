Castle Apartments was a historic apartment building in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States, which was destroyed by fire in 2009. It was located on the southeast corner of 15th Street and Central Avenue, roughly halfway between Downtown and Old Town.
Built in 1922, it was a two-story, U-shaped building with a central courtyard and 20 residential units ranging in size from 600 to 750 square feet. The name came from the Huning Castle mansion, which originally stood on the other side of 15th Street. The Castle Apartments were added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
