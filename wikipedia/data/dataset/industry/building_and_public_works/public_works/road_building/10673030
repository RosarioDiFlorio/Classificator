Standin' on the Corner Park (opened in 1999 in Winslow, Arizona). It is a public park, commemorating the song "Take It Easy" which was written by Jackson Browne and Glenn Frey, and, most famously, recorded by the Eagles. The song includes the verse "Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona and such a fine sight to see. It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford slowin' down to take a look at me." The park contains a two-story trompe-l'Å“il mural by John Pugh, and a bronze statue by Ron Adamson of a life-sized man with a guitar who is standing on a corner with the guitar by his side. The park is surrounded by a wall of bricks, with windows to peer in to; each brick has a donor's name on it, and a story by each of the donors describing their fondness for Winslow, Arizona.
