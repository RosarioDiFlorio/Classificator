Clarence House is a royal residence in London, situated on The Mall, in the City of Westminster. It is attached to St. James's Palace and shares the palace's garden. For nearly 50 years, from 1953 to 2002, it was home to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. It has since been the official residence of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.
Clarence House also served as the official residence for Prince William from 2003, until his marriage in April 2011, and for Prince Harry from 2003 until 2012. It is open to visitors for approximately one month each summer, usually August, and is one of many royal buildings in London.
The house has four storeys, not including attics or basements, and is faced in pale stucco. It has undergone extensive remodelling and reconstruction over the years, most notably after the Second World War, such that relatively little remains of the original structure as designed by John Nash.
Since 2003, the term "Clarence House" has often been used as a metonym for the Prince of Wales's private office. The term "St James's Palace" had been previously used.
Clarence House is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England.
