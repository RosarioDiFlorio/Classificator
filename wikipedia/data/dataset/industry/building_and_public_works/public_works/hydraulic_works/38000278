The A.M. Bohnert Rice Plantation Pump is located on Route 165 and Post Bayou Lane, near Gillett, Arkansas in Arkansas County, and is a rare surviving example of an early 20th-century pump engine built by the noted engine manufacturer Fairbanks, Morse & Company. The pumping engine was an important part of productive rice farming in the area to ensure enough water to flood the fields.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.
