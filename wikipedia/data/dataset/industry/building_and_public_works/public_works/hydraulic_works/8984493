"Ion pump" redirects here. For a protein that moves ions across a plasma membrane, see Ion transporter. An ion pump is not to be confused with an ionic liquid piston pump or an ionic liquid ring vacuum pump.
An ion pump (also referred to as a sputter ion pump) is a type of vacuum pump capable of reaching pressures as low as 10−11 mbar under ideal conditions. An ion pump ionizes gas within the vessel it is attached to and employs a strong electrical potential, typically 3–7 kV, which allows the ions to accelerate into and be captured by a solid electrode and its residue.
