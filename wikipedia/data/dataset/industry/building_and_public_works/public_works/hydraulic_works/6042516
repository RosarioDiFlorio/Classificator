The Kearny air pump is an expedient air pump used to ventilate a shelter. The design is such that a person with normal mechanical skills can construct and operate one. It is usually human-powered and designed to be employed during a time of crisis. It was designed to be used in a fallout shelter, but can be used in any situation where emergency ventilation is needed, such as after a hurricane.
It was developed from research performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by Cresson Kearny and published in Nuclear War Survival Skills.
The basic principle is to create a flat surface with vanes that close when moving air and open when going back to the starting position. The design was derived from the punkah.
