The Dunlop valve, (also called a Woods valve or an English valve) is a type of pneumatic valve stem in use in some countries, such as Japan, Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and a number of developing countries, mostly on bicycle inner tubes. It has a wider base than a Presta valve, similar enough in size to a Schrader valve to use identically drilled valve holes in rims, but it can be inflated with a Presta valve adapter. The inner mechanism of the valve can be replaced easily, without the need for special tools. The inventor was C. H. Woods. It superseded Dunlop's original valve for pneumatic tyres.
