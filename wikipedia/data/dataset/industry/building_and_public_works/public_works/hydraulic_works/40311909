A sinusoidal pump is a type of pump featuring a sine wave-shaped rotor that creates four moving chambers, which gently convey the duty ﬂuid from the inlet port to the higher pressure discharge port.
The gate prevents any ﬂuid passing back from the discharge side to the lower-pressure suction side of the pump.
