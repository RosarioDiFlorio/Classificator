Thermodynamic pump testing is a form of pump testing where only the temperature rise, power consumed, and differential pressure need to be measured to find the efficiency of a pump. These measurements are typically made with insertion temperature probes and pressure probes fitted to tapping points on the pump's inlet and outlet. From these measurements, the flow produced by a pump can be derived. The thermodynamic method was developed in the early 1960s, and since has been increasingly used. It is described in high precision hydraulic testing standards such as ISO 5198.
The thermodynamic method is used for performance testing of pumps, flow meter calibration, system curve tests, and other applications. It is capable of achieving results with uncertainties of less than 1% in pump efficiency and less than 1.5% in flow while being able to test piping configurations where other conventional pump testing methods cannot provide accurate results.
