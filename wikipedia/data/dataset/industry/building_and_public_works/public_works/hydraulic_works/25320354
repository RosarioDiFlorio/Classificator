A cable fairing is a structure attached to a towed cable designed to streamline the flow around the cable, primarily in marine environments.
Cables are faired primarily for two reasons: (1) to reduce normal drag and thus achieve more depth for a given cable scope and speed; and (2) to eliminate cable vibration caused by vortex shedding, commonly known as cable strum.
