Subsea valves are used to isolate or control the flow of material through an undersea pipeline (submarine pipeline) or other apparatus. Most commonly used to transport oil and gas, they are designed to function in a sub-marine environment, withstanding the effects of raised external pressure, salt-water corrosion, and bubbles or debris in the material carried. Subsea valves undergo stringent testing to ensure high reliability.
