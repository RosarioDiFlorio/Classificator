A Holweck pump is a type of vacuum pump that utilises the drag of air molecules against a rotating surface. The modern turbomolecular pump is a more advanced version based on similar operation, and a Holweck pump is often used as the backing pump for it. The Holweck pump can produce a vacuum as low as 1×10−8 mmHg (1.3×10−6 Pa).
