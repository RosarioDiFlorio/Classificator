The Eulerâ€™s pump and turbine equations are most fundamental equations in the field of turbomachinery. These equations govern the power, efficiencies and other factors that contribute in the design of turbomachines thus making them very important. With the help of these equations the head developed by a pump and the head utilised by a turbine can be easily determined. As the name suggests these equations were formulated by Leonhard Euler in the eighteenth century. These equations can be derived from the moment of momentum equation when applied for a pump or a turbine.
