In fluid dynamics, the conjugate depths refer to the depth (y1) upstream and the depth (y2) downstream of the hydraulic jump whose momentum fluxes are equal for a given discharge (volume flux) q. The depth upstream of a hydraulic jump is always supercritical. It is important to note that the conjugate depth is different from the alternate depths for flow which are used in energy conservation calculations.
