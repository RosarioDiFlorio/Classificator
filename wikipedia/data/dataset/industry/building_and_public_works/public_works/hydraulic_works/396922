China Airlines Flight 611 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the former Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport) in Taiwan to Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong. On 25 May 2002, the Boeing 747-209B operating the route disintegrated in mid-air and crashed into the Taiwan Strait 23 nautical miles (43 km) northeast of the Penghu Islands 20 minutes after takeoff, killing all 225 people on board. The in-flight break-up was caused by improper repairs to the aircraft 22 years earlier. As of 2017, the crash remains the deadliest in Taiwanese history.
The accident was particularly disturbing to the public as the Taipeiâ€“Hong Kong route was one of the most heavily traveled international air routes in the world; it was so profitable that it was even referred to as the "Golden Route."
