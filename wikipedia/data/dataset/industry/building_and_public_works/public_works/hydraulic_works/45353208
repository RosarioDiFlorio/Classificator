A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.
The primary purpose of gas cabinets is to contain potential leaks in piping and fittings at the cylinder connection. The cabinet must be exhausted by a specifically designed fan and exhaust system. The cabinet exhaust system draws leaking hazardous gasses out of the cabinet. In the case of a flammable gas the cabinet will contain the flame for a period of time. One can use a newly reconditioned cabinet as well as non-reconditioned used gas cabinets depending on their requirements.
