MOHID Land is the hydrology module within the three-dimensional MOHID Water Modelling System. MOHID is an integrated system for water flow, consisting of three main modules: Water for three-dimensional fluid dynamics, Land for hydrology and Soil for groundwater flow. The MOHID Land module is a watershed mathematical model — or hydrological transport model — designed to simulate the flow of water in a drainage basin and aquifer. The interactions between the different processes (like water exchange between aquifer and river) are calculated dynamically by the model, using the hydraulic gradients. The different processes occurring in a basin are programmed in different modules. The user can choose which modules to activate, allowing simulation of the desired ones only.
MOHID Land was developed within the framework of three EU-funded projects: EcoRiver, TempQsim and ICReW for the simulation of water flow in watersheds with pathways for river and groundwater flow. The porous media module was developed in close collaboration with soil scientists from EAN-INIA (Portuguese National Agronomic Station). Between 2009 and 2011 ESA financed Aquapath-Soil project to apply MOHID Land to support irrigation using Satellite LAI as input to the model, obtaining maps of Actual Evapotranspiration. Latter, through FIGARO project, a simillar aplications was made but at european level using AQUASAFE as the engine that joined models and data to produce forecasts on irrigation.
