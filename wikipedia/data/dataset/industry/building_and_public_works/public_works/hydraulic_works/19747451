A reciprocating pump is a class of positive-displacement pumps which includes the piston pump, plunger pump and diaphragm pump. When well maintained, reciprocating pumps will last for years or even decades; however, left untouched, they can undergo rigorous wear and tear. It is often used where a relatively small quantity of liquid is to be handled and where delivery pressure is quite large. In reciprocating pumps, the chamber in which the liquid is trapped, is a stationary cylinder that contains the piston or plunger.
