A rockbreaker is a machine designed to manipulate large rocks, including reducing large rocks into smaller rocks. They are typically used in the mining industry to remove oversize rocks that are too large or too hard to be reduced in size by a crusher. Rockbreakers consist of two major components, a hydraulic hammer (used to break rocks) and a boom (the arm). There are two major types of rock breakers, mobile and stationary - typically placed on a pedestal or slew frame.
