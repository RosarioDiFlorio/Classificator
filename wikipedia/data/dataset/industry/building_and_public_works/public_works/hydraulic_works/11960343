The Artificio de Juanelo was the name of two devices built in Toledo in the 16th century by Juanelo Turriano. They were designed to supply the city with a source of readily available water by lifting it from the Tagus (Tajo) river to the Alc√°zar. Now in ruins, the precise details of the operation of the devices are unknown, but at the time they were considered engineering wonders.
