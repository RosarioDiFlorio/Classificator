A zone valve is a specific type of valve used to control the flow of water or steam in a hydronic heating or cooling system.
In the interest of improving efficiency and occupant comfort, such systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while the upstairs bedrooms are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally to the main floor during the day and principally to the bedrooms at night, allowing the unoccupied areas to cool down.
This zoning can be accomplished in one of two ways:
Multiple circulator pumps, or
A single circulator pump and zone valves.
