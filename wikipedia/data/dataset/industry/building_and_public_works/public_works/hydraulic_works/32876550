A steam generator on a ship is an auxiliary boiler which draws high-pressure superheated steam from the vessel's propulsion system to generate low pressure saturated steam. This secondary steam is then used to power auxiliary shipboard engines driving winches or pumps, or to meet any steam requirement that does not require superheating, such as boiler feedwater and freshwater evaporators.
