The word "hydraulic" originates from the Greek word ὑδραυλικός (hydraulikos) which in turn stems from ὕδωρ (hydor, Greek for water) and αὐλός (aulos, meaning tube), and "containment" refers to the action of keeping something harmful under control or within limits. Thus, hydraulic containment is the attempt of confining the movement of any harmful fluid within a limit. In the pollution management sense, hydraulic containment is a technique used to control the movement of contaminated groundwater, preventing the continued expansion of the contaminated zone. It is the first step of pump and treat technology for environmental remediation.
