A pistol boiler is a design of steam boiler used in light steam tractors and overtype steam wagons. It is noted for the unusual shape of the firebox, a circular design intended to be self-supporting without the use of firebox stays.
The name "pistol boiler" derives from the smooth curve of the outer firebox flowing into the boiler barrel, and a supposed resemblance to the stock of an early 19th-century pistol.
