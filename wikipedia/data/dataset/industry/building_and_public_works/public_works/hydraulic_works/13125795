An angle seat piston valve is a pneumatically-controlled valve with a piston actuator providing linear actuation to lift a seal off its seat. The seat is set at an angle to provide the maximum possible flow when unseated. Angle seat piston valves are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flowrates are required, such as steam or water. When used in reverse some models of angle seat piston valve will eliminate water hammer when operated.
