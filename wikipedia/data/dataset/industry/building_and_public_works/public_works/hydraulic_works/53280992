HydroCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) program used by civil engineers for modeling the hydrology and hydraulics (H&H) of stormwater runoff. Its use as a tool has grown in the U.S. as rules for managing stormwater have become more stringent. Specifically, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), last updated in December 2016, regulates point source pollution by municipal governments, industrial facilities and agricultural facilities. The NPDES was introduced in 1972 as part of the Clean Water Act, and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in partnership with state environmental agencies.
H&H software such as HydroCAD is important in the implementation of the Low-Impact Development approach to stormwater management that is gaining popularity throughout the U.S. and Canada.
