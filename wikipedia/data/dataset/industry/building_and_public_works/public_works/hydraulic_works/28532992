An electromagnetic pump is a pump that moves liquid metal (or any electrically conductive liquid) using electromagnetism. A magnetic field is set at right angles to the direction the liquid moves in, and a current is passed through it. This causes an electromagnetic force that moves the liquid.
Applications include pumping liquid metal through a cooling system.
