A thermal expansion valve (often abbreviated as TEV, TXV, or TX valve) is a component in refrigeration and air conditioning systems that controls the amount of refrigerant released into the evaporator thereby controlling superheat. Thermal expansion valves are often referred to generically as "metering devices".
