North American, European, and other languages refer to hydropneumatic devices such as a hydropneumatic accumulator or pulsation damper using very different words. In many cases this can cause a great deal of word usage confusion. This article includes information about devices that prevent, but do not absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, or suppress a shock that already exists (these devices prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.
