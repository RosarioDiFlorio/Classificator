A heat-only boiler station generates thermal energy in the form of hot water for use in district heating applications. Unlike combined heat and power installations which produce thermal energy as a by-product of electricity generation, heat-only boiler stations are dedicated to generating heat.
The heat boiler station can use different fuels:
Natural gas
Heating oil
Woodchips
Straw
