An electric water boiler, also called a thermo pot, is a consumer electronics small appliance used for boiling water and maintaining it at a constant temperature. It is typically used to provide an immediate source of hot water for making tea, hot chocolate, coffee, instant noodles, or baby formula, or for any other household use where clean hot water is required. They are a common component of Japanese kitchens and the kitchens of many East Asian countries but are found in varying use globally. Some thermo pots are designed with a feature that can purify water.
Black tea is typically steeped at 95 째C (203 째F) while green tea is steeped at under 80 째C (176 째F). A number of thermo pot models offer an adjustable target temperature.
