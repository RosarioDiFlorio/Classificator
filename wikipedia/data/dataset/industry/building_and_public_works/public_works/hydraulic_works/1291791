A superheater is a device used to convert saturated steam or wet steam into superheated steam or dry steam. Superheaters are used in steam turbines for electricity generation, steam engines, and in processes such as steam reforming. There are three types of superheaters: radiant, convection, and separately fired. A superheater can vary in size from a few tens of feet to several hundred feet (a few metres to some hundred metres).
