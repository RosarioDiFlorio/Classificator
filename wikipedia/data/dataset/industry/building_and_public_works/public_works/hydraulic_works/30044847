A slurry pump is a type of centrifugal pump, lobe pump or peristaltic hose pump in physics principle that increases the pressure of liquid and solid particle mixture (aka slurry), through centrifugal force (a rotating impeller) and converts electrical energy into slurry potential and kinetic energy.
Slurry pumps are widely used to transport corrosive/abrasive and high concentration slurry in many industries such as Gold, Silver, Iron ore, Tin, Steel, Coal, Titanium, Copper, Mineral sands, Lead and Zinc. They are often designed to be suitable for heavy-wearing and heavy-duty uses. Various other industries include Molybdenum, Electric Utilities, Oil Shale, Water & Sewage Utilities, Building areas, Sand & Gravel, Tobacco and Agriculture (hog, poultry, dairy manure) and are grouped by:
impeller quantity: single stage and multistage slurry pump
shaft position from the horizontal: horizontal and vertical slurry pump
impeller suction way: single suction and double suction slurry pump
pump casing structure: solid casing, horizontal split-case, and vertical split-case slurry pump
The parameters determined before selecting an appropriate slurry pump include capacity, head, solids handling capacity, efficiency and power, speed and NPSH.
