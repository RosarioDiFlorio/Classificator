Sosrobahu is a road construction technique which allows long stretches of flyovers to be constructed above existing main roads with a minimum of disruption to the traffic. The technique was designed by Tjokorda Raka Sukawati and involves the construction of the horizontal supports for the highway beside the existing road, which is then lifted and turned 90 degrees angle before being placed on the top of the vertical supports to form the flyover pylons.
This technique is of considerable value in increasing road mileage in large cities where there is a restricted space for new roads and where the closure of existing roads for the length of time to build a flyover using normal construction techniques would impose significant economic costs.
