Chemical industry in Poland - one of the key branches of the processing industry which includes:
organic chemistry industry – manufactures products on the basis of carbohydrates, wood, rubber, fats and other organic substances,
non-organic chemistry industry – products manufactured on the basis of non-organic substances, e.g. minerals and ores.
Chemical industry in terms of tons of production can be divided into:
great chemistry - the name refers to the production size of millions tons a year; great chemistry includes the production of fertilisers, fuels, plastics (mainly plasticisers) and industrial gases;
small chemistry - production on a smaller scale - dozens of tons; this sector includes mainly chemistry with high added value and more expensive production, e.g. medicaments,cosmetics, cleaning agents;
chemical processing - processing finished half-products: by mixing, packing, thermal treatment and other methods.
Chemical industry is characteristic of the high capital intensity and low labour consumption, for this reason, the most of operations are automated.
