The All-Party Parliamentary Carbon Monoxide Group (APPCOG) is an official All-Party Parliamentary Group of the UK Parliament, co-chaired by Barry Sheerman MP, Jason McCartney MP, Baroness Finlay of Llandaff and Baroness Maddock. The group exists to raise awareness within Parliament of the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning, to inform policy making and help improve safety measures across the UK.
The APPG is composed of 20 MPs and Peers from across the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. Its official entry on the Houses of Parliament register can be found on the APPG Register.
Its secretariat services are provided by Policy Connect, an independent, not-for-profit think tank based in London.
