Medical gas supply systems in hospitals, and most other healthcare facilities, are essential for supplying piped oxygen, nitrous oxide, nitrogen/surgical air, carbon dioxide, oxygen/nitrous oxide 50/50, medical vacuum, anaesthetic gas scavenge/waste anesthetic gas disposal and medical air to various parts of the facility. Source equipment systems are monitored by central/source alarm systems, at the point of supply with multiplexed repeater alarms throughout the facility and for monitoring high and low gas pressure in particular areas such as general ward, operating theatres, ICU/ITU/CCU/NICU, recovery, major treatment rooms, etc. Equipment is connected to the medical gas supply system via station outlets. For emergency gas control area zone service valves are installed in order to prevent contaminated gas going to patient or to stop gas flowing to an area in the event of fire. Valves are positioned at the entrance to all departments and can be accessed via emergency pull out windows.
