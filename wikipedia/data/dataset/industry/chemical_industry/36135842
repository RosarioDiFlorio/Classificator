NOTT-202 is a two-part chemical compound, capable of selectively absorbing carbon dioxide. It is like a "framework of organic metal" that functions like a sponge, absorbing selected gases at high pressures. Its creation was announced by scientists in 2011. This structure is an entirely new class of porous material, as so the researchers claim.
