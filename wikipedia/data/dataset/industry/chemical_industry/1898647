Singlet oxygen is a high-energy form of oxygen. A gas with the formula O2, its physical properties differ only subtly from those of the more prevalent triplet ground state of O2. In terms of its chemical reactivity, however, singlet oxygen is far more reactive toward organic compounds. It is responsible for the photodegradation of many materials but can be put to constructive use in preparative organic chemistry and photodynamic therapy. Trace amounts of singlet oxygen are found in the upper atmosphere and also in polluted urban atmospheres where it contributes to the formation of lung-damaging nitrogen dioxide. It often appears and coexists confounded in environments that also generate ozone, such as pine forests with photodegradation of turpentine.
In spectroscopic notation, the singlet and triplet forms of O2 are labeled 1Δg and 3Σ−
g, respectively. The terms 'singlet oxygen' and 'triplet oxygen' refer to the quantum state of the molecules: singlet oxygen exists in the singlet state with a total quantum spin of 0, while triplet oxygen has a total quantum spin of 1.
