A Multi-evaporator system is a vapor-compression refrigeration system generally consisting of four major components:
1.Evaporator
2.Compressor
3.Condenser
4.Thermal expansion valve
Sometimes in a refrigerator several loads are varied. Refrigerators used to function at different loads operated under different condition of temperatures and pressures. There may be arrangements possible for multi evaporators on the basis of single or multi compressors. If refrigerant from each evaporator compressed in the same single compressor then it is called as Multi-evaporator single-compressor system.
