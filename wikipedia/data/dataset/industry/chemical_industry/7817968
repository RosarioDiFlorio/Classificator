Faxe Kondi is a Danish soft drink produced by Royal Unibrew.
Marketed as a sports drink, as it contains both glucose and sugar, as well as caffeine. Faxe Kondi has been produced since 1971. Originally it was sold in beer bottles, because Faxe Bryggeri was a beer company.
There is also a light-version, Faxe Kondi Free, and three energy drinks (sold in Denmark only), Faxe Kondi Booster, Faxe Kondi Booster Blue and Faxe Kondi Booster Red.
The Faxe drinks hold a particularly strong market position in Greenland, where it is bottled in Nuuk from concentrate shipped from Denmark. Faxe Kondi holds a 33 percent market share in the country (mean consumption: 42 litres (11 US gal) per capita per annum).
From 1996 to 2001, Faxe Bryggeri sponsored the Faxe Kondi name in the Danish Superliga (as Faxe Kondi Ligaen) and Danish 1st Division (as Faxe Kondi Divisionen).
