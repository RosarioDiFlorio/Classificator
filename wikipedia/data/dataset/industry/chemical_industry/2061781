Banta or Banta Soda also known as Fotash Jawl in Bengali, Goli Soda (Goli = spherical object in Hindi) or Goti Soda (Goti = marble in Hindi) is a colloquial term for a carbonated lemon or orange-flavoured soft drink in Codd-neck bottle popular in India. Though the origin of its name is from Punjabi word for marble (banta), Banta has been sold since the late 19th century, long before popular carbonated drinks arrived. The drink is often sold mixed with lemon juice, crushed ice, chaat masala and kala namak (black salt) as a carbonated variant of popular lemonades shikanjvi or jal-jeera. It is available at street-sellers known as bantawallahs at prices ranging from ₹5 (7.8¢ US) - ₹30 (47¢ US).
Similar to Ramune, a Japanese lemon drink, Banta is popular across North India and especially the capital Delhi. In fact, it is known as "Delhi’s local drink", nimbu (lemon) soda or kanchay waali drink (kancha = marble in Hindi), especially in Old Delhi and the Delhi University college campuses. In South India it is known as Goli Soda, due to the goli (marble) in neck of the bottle. The states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have a local variant known as panneer soda that is flavoured with rose essence.
