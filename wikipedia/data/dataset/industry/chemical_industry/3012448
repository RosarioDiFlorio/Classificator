Nitrogen balance is a measure of nitrogen input minus nitrogen output.
Nitrogen Balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen loss
Sources of nitrogen intake include meat, dairy, eggs, nuts and legumes, and grains and cereals. Examples of nitrogen losses include urine, feces, sweat, hair, and skin.
Blood urea nitrogen can be used in estimating nitrogen balance, as can the urea concentration in urine.
