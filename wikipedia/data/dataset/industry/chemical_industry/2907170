The iodine clock reaction is a classical chemical clock demonstration experiment to display chemical kinetics in action; it was discovered by Hans Heinrich Landolt in 1886. Two colourless solutions are mixed and at first there is no visible reaction. After a short time delay, the liquid suddenly turns to a shade of dark blue. The iodine clock reaction exists in several variations. In some variations, the solution will repeatedly cycle from colorless to blue and back to colorless, until the reagents are depleted.
