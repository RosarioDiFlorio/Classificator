The Carbon Monoxide All Fuels Action Forum (COAFAF) is an industry-led forum and campaign group comprising various individuals, organisations, charities and policy makers working to reduce death by carbon monoxide poisoning in the UK. The group acts as a sister group to the All-Party Parliamentary Carbon Monoxide Group (APPCOG), an official all-party parliamentary group of the UK Parliament.
The Carbon Monoxide All Fuels Action Forum is chaired by Steve Miller, President of the London region at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health.
Its secretariat services are provided by Policy Connect, an independent, not-for-profit think tank based in London.
