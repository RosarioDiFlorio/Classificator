Barlow's formula relates the internal pressure that a pipe can withstand to its dimensions and the strength of its material.

  
    
      
        P
        =
        
          
            
              2
              S
              t
            
            D
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P={\frac {2St}{D}}}
  
where
P = pressure
S = allowable stress
t = wall thickness
D = outside diameter
This formula figures prominently in the design of autoclaves and other pressure vessels.
The formula is named after Peter Barlow, an English mathematician.
