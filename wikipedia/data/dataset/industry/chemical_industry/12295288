The Hampson–Linde cycle is used in the liquefaction of gases, especially for air separation. William Hampson and Carl von Linde independently filed for patent of the cycle in 1895.
Hampson-Linde systems introduced regenerative cooling, a positive-feedback cooling system. The heat exchanger arrangement permits an absolute temperature difference (e.g. 0.27 °C/atm J-T cooling for air) to go beyond a single stage of cooling, and reach the low temperatures required to liquefy "fixed" gasses.
The Hampson-Linde cycle differs from the Siemens cycle only in the expansion step. Where the Siemens cycle has the gas do external work to reduce its temperature, the Hampson-Linde cycle relies solely on the Joule-Thomson effect. This has the advantage that the cold side needs no moving parts.
