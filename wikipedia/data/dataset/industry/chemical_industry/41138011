Nae Danger is an energy drink from Scotland. It is claimed to be the first and only carbonated energy drink to have been created, branded and manufactured in Scotland, which is contested with IrnBru32 which was release in 2006 by AG Barr. Released in August 2012, the drink is a creation of Ross Gourlay, a Scottish entrepreneur from Bishopbriggs. Gourlay hoped to gain a slice of the growing caffeinated drinks market and also encourage recognisable Scottish brands within the UK. There are two main flavours: Blue Raspberry and Red Blueberry.
The can design includes the words "Nae Danger", a popular Strathclyde phrase equivalent to the Australian "no worries", spanning the length of the can. The can also states that it's "an energy drink like nae other" and "it's only a quid", endorsing the Scottish theme of the product. The company is a new addition to the energy drink market which is worth over Â£790 million in the UK having risen 17% between 2012 and 2013. The drink competes with other highly caffeinated energy products such as Relentless, Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull. Nae Danger has culminated an assortment of 6 drinks since its release in mid-2012.
