Isobutane, also known as i-butane or methylpropane, is a chemical compound with molecular formula C
4H
10 and is an isomer of butane. It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon. Isobutane is used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane.
Concerns with depletion of the ozone layer by freon gases have led to increased use of isobutane as a gas for refrigeration systems, especially in domestic refrigerators and freezers, and as a propellant in aerosol sprays. When used as a refrigerant or a propellant, isobutane is also known as R-600a. Some portable camp stoves use a mixture of isobutane with propane, usually 80:20.
