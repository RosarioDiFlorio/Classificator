The Scottish Piping Society of London is a society of bagpipers, formed in 1932. In the same year, it held its first competition, consisting of the ceol mor, piobaireachd, and ceol beag, as well as two dancing events. It holds monthly recitals and competitions and its annual competitions are held at Glazier's Hall and Hampton Court. Its highest honour is the Bratach Gorm, which is only available to those who have won the Highland Society of London's Gold Medal at Oban or Inverness or winners of the Gillies Cup.
The society has over 200 members. Iverach McDonald was amongst its notable alumni.
