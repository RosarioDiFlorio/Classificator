Guaraná is a soft drink originated from guarana fruit.
The processing of the fruit syrup began in Brazil in 1905 by Fara, a physician from the city of Resende, Rio de Janeiro. A soft drink factory, Guaraná Cyrilla, was launched by F. Diefenthaller in 1906 in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul. The drink initially was astringent and markedly bitter and therefore did not spread. Antarctica developed a process to eliminate astringency and bitterness, emphasizing the characteristic flavor and aroma of the fruit, launching Guaraná Champagne Antarctica in 1921. Today there are several brands of guarana soda spread throughout Brazil.
Another guaraná soft drink was created accidentally in 1920 by the pharmacist Jesus Norberto Gomes, in the state of Maranhão. Jesus imported a gasification machine to produce a kind of magnesia fluida, a medicine famous at the time, with extracts of 17 ingredients from the Amazon rainforest, including guarana and cinnamon, but the business did not work. The pharmacist decided to make a drink for the grandchildren and pleased everyone. Over time, the pink drink has fallen in the taste of the people and to this day is quite popular in the state, maintaining the formula.
In 2001, Coca-Cola bought the brand.
In Serbia and other Eastern European countries, energy drinks based on guarana, marketed under this name, but without the same sweet flavor as the soda are produced - have a bitter taste and cardio-accelerating effect.
