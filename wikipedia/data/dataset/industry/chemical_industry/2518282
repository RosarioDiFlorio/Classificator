Although fluorine (9F) has 18 known isotopes from 14F to 31F and two isomers (18mF and 26mF), only one of these isotopes is stable, that is, fluorine-19; as such, it is a monoisotopic element. The longest-lived radioisotope is 18F with a half-life of 109.771 minutes. All other isotopes have half-lives under a minute, the majority under a second, making fluorine a mononuclidic element as well. The least stable known isotope is 14F, whose half-life is 500(60) × 10−24 seconds, corresponding to a spectral linewidth of about 1 MeV.
