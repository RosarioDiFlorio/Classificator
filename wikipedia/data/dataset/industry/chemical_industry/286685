Nitrogen oxide may refer to a binary compound of oxygen and nitrogen, or a mixture of such compounds:
Nitric oxide, also known as nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen(II) oxide
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen(IV) oxide
Nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen(−I,III) oxide
Nitrosylazide (N4O), nitrogen(−I,0,I,II) oxide
Oxatetrazole (N4O)
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), nitrogen(II,IV) oxide
Dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), nitrogen(IV) oxide
Dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), nitrogen(V) oxide
Trinitramide (N(NO2)3 or N4O6), nitrogen(0,IV) oxides
Dinitramide (N(NO2)3−)
Nitrite (NO−
2)
Nitrate (NO−
3)
Nitronium (NO+
2)
Nitrosonium (NO+)
peroxonitrite (ONO−
2)
The compounds NO and NO2 are radicals. In addition, there are several anions of nitrogen oxides. The most stable of these is the nitrate anion:
Nitrate (NO3−), trioxonitrate(V) ion
but other nitrogen oxoanions include hyponitrite, nitrite, peroxonitrite, trioxodinitrate (hyponitrate), and nitroxylate.
In atmospheric chemistry, air pollution, and related fields, nitrogen oxides refers specifically to NOx (NO and NO2).
Only the first three of these compounds can be isolated at room temperature. N2O3, N2O4, and N2O5 all decompose rapidly at room temperature. NO3, N4O, and N(NO2)3 are very reactive.
N2O is stable and rather unreactive at room temperature, while NO and NO2 are quite reactive but nevertheless quite stable when isolated.
