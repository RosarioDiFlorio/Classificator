In the chemical industry, chemical leasing is a business model in which the chemical company supplies a substance for a specific service, but retains ownership of the chemical. It is intended to shift the focus from increasing sales volume of chemicals towards a value added approach. It may lead to more efficient use of chemicals, and to quality, environmental, and economic benefits.
