Gas to liquids (GTL) is a refinery process to convert natural gas or other gaseous hydrocarbons into longer-chain hydrocarbons, such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Methane-rich gases are converted into liquid synthetic fuels either via direct conversion—using non-catalytic processes that convert methane to methanol in one step—or via syngas as an intermediate, such as in the Fischer-Tropsch, Mobil, and syngas to gasoline plus processes. It shares many similarities with indirect coal liquefaction) that full breaks down coal into hydrogen and carbon that can be reassembled into H-C-chains of a desired length.
