A gas evolution reaction is a chemical reaction in which one of the end products is a gas (such as oxygen or carbon dioxide). See also oxygen evolution. Acid-base reactions are a specific type of gas evolution reaction. There are also gas evolution reactions that are formed by the mixing of two aqueous solutions. These reactions are a sub-type of double replacement or double displacement reactions. Most of gas evolution reactions are done in a fume chamber because some of the gases are very poisonous when inhaled while other gases are explosive.
