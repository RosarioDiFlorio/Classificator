CARE 30 is a refrigerant consisting of a blend of isobutane (R-600a) and propane (R-290) developed to replace dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R-134a). It is primarily for use in small commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning systems that have traditionally used R-12.
