Domsjö Fabriker is a Swedish refinery located in Örnsköldsvik that converts raw forest materials into specialty cellulose, lignin, and bio-ethanol. In 2000 it was spun off from the forest company Mo och Domsjö AB (MoDo), of which it had been a part since the early 20th century, and sold to a private consortium. On April 18, 2011, it was announced that India's Aditya Birla Group had acquired the company for US$340 million.
