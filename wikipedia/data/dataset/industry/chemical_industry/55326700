AdvanSix is an American chemical company that comprised Honeywell's Resins and Chemicals division, and it traces its lineage to the H. W. Jayne Company, established 1884 in Frankford, Pennsylvania. It was spun-off from Honeywell in 2016.
AdvanSix has plants in Chesterfield and Hopewell, Virginia, and Frankford and Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The Hopewell plant is one of the world's largest single-site producer of caprolactam. It reports an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons of ammonia and 400,000 tons of caprolactam. For context, global annual demand for caprolactam is estimated at 5 million tons.
AdvanSix is an integrated chemical manufacturer. It produces phenol in Frankford through the cumene process, where it is converted to caprolactam in Hopewell, polymerized to nylon 6 in Chesterfield and made into film at Pottsville. In addition to internal use, AdvanSix sells acetone, phenol, and alpha-methylstyrene from the cumene process. They sell cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone made from phenol, caprolactam, as well as ammonium sulfate generated by the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime.
