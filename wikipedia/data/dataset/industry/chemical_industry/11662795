Kårstø is an industrial facility located near the village of Susort, along the Boknafjorden, in the municipality of Tysvær in Rogaland county, Norway. The site features a number of natural gas processing plants that refine natural gas and condensate from the fields in the northern parts of the North Sea, including the Åsgard, Mikkel, and Sleipner gas fields. The Kårstø processing complex is Europe's biggest export port for natural gas liquids (NGL) and the third largest in the world. The industrial site is also the location for the now-closed Kårstø Power Station.
