An alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) is a semipermeable membrane generally made from ionomers and designed to conduct anions while being impermeable to gases such as oxygen or hydrogen. This is their essential function when incorporated into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) or direct-ethanol fuel cell (DEFC): separation of reactants and transport of anions.
