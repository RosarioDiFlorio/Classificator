Edward D. Breen (born c. 1956) is an American business executive. He was named the CEO of DuPont on November 9, 2015. He also serves as a director of Comcast. Prior to his role at DuPont, Breen was the Chairman and CEO of Tyco International.
Upon taking up his CEO position, The Wall Street Journal called him a "breakup expert", as his arrival increased the chance of DuPont being broken up, as was demanded by Trian Fund Management, at the time DuPontâ€™s fifth-biggest shareholder.
In March 2016 it was reported that Dow Chemical Co. and the DuPont Co. agreed to pay $27 million to DuPont CEO Edward Breen leaves the company by early 2017.
