Chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) is a chlorofluorocarbon with chemical formula CF2CClF. It is commonly used as a refrigerant in cryogenic applications. CTFE has a carbon-carbon double bond and so can be polymerized to form polychlorotrifluoroethylene or copolymerized to produce the plastic ECTFE. PCTFE has the trade name Neoflon PCTFE from Daikin Industries in Japan, and used to be produced under the trade name Kel-F from 3M Corporation in Minnesota.
