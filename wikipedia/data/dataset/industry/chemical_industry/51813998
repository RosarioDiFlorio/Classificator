The nozzle and flapper mechanism is a displacement type detector which converts mechanical movement into a pressure signal, by covering the orifice of a nozzle with a flat plate called the flapper. This restricts the nozzle fluid flow and generates a pressure signal.
It is a widely used mechanical means of creating a high gain fluidic amplifier. In industrial control systems they played an important part in the development of pneumatic PID controllers and are still widely used today in pneumatic and hydraulic control and instrumentation systems.
