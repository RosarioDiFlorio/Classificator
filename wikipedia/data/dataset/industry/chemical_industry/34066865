1,3,3,3-Tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze) is a hydrofluoroolefin. It was developed as a "fourth generation" refrigerant to replace R-134a and as a blowing agent for foam and aerosol applications. The use of R-134a is being phased out because of its high global-warming potential. HFO-1234ze has zero ozone-depletion potential (ODP=0) and a very low global-warming potential (GWP < 1 ), even lower than CO2.
