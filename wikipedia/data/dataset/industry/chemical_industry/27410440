The Revelle factor (buffer factor) is the ratio of instantaneous change in carbon dioxide (CO2) to the change in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and is a measure of the resistance to atmospheric CO2 being absorbed by the ocean surface layer. The buffer factor is used to examine the distribution of CO2 between the atmosphere and the ocean, and measures the amount of CO2 that can be dissolved in the mixed surface layer. It is named after the oceanographer Roger Revelle, who was one of the first scientists to study global warming.
Revelle factor = (Δ[CO2] / [CO2]) / (Δ[DIC] / [DIC]) where DIC is dissolved inorganic carbon. Δ[CO2] / [CO2] is the instantaneous change in pCO2 and Δ[DIC] / [DIC] is the instantaneous change in DIC.
