Club-Mate (German pronunciation: [ˈklʊp ˈmaːtə]) is a caffeinated carbonated mate-extract beverage made by the Loscher Brewery (Brauerei Loscher) near Münchsteinach, Germany, which originated in 1924. Club-Mate has 20 mg of caffeine per 100 ml. Club-Mate has a relatively low sugar content of 5 g/100 ml, and low calories (20 kcal/100 ml of beverage) compared to other beverages such as Cola or most energy drinks.
Also available is Club-Mate IceT Kraftstoff, which is an ice-tea variant with slightly higher caffeine content (22 mg/100 ml) and with more sugar than original Club-Mate.
Club-Mate is available in 0.33-litre and 0.5-litre bottles.
Three examples of Club-Mate-based mixed drinks are vodka-mate, Tschunk (or "Chunk"), a combination of rum and Club-Mate, and Jaeger-Mate, a mix of Jägermeister and Club-Mate.
