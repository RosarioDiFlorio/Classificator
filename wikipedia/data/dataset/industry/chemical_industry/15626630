Launched into the UK market with a Â£4 million marketing budget in February 2008, SUSO is currently distributed to over 600 UK secondary schools and national supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose and Superdrug.
It comes in a 250ml can size available in a variety of flavours: Berry; Orange; Apple; Lemon; Tropical; Mango & Passion Fruit; Forest Fruits. The can is marked as supplying "One of your five-a-day", a reference to the UK government's programme to encourage people to consume five portions of fruit and/or vegetables per day.
