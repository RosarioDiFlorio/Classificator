The Kim reformer is a type of syngas plant invented by Dr. Kim, Hyun Yong. It is a high temperature furnace (as shown in figure 1), filled with steam and/or carbon dioxide gas and maintaining a thermal equilibrium at a temperature just above 1200 °C, in which the reforming reaction is at its thermodynamic equilibrium and carbonaceous substance is reformed with the highest efficiency.
Dr. Kim, Hyun Yong discovered, in December 2000, that the reforming reaction (C + H2O ↔ CO + H2) proceeds at a temperature just above 1200 °C, but not below it. This work was published in International Journal[1] and registered in KR patent[2], US patent[3], CN patent[4] and JP patent[5].
