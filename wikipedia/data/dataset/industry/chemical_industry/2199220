Aromatization is a chemical reaction in which an aromatic system is formed. It can also refer to the production of a new aromatic moiety in a molecule which is already aromatic. Theoretically, this can be achieved by dehydrogenation of existing cyclic compounds (such as in converting cyclohexane into benzene) or by formation of new cyclic system (such as in the cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene); practically, other moieties are typically required to carry out such conversion, and other approaches like applying condensation reactions are possible. Aromatization includes the formation of any aromatic system (including heterocyclic systems), and is not restricted to benzene and its derivatives.
