Universal Audio is a designer and importer of audio signal processing hardware and DSP software founded in 1958 by Bill Putnam. The current incarnation of the company was re-established in 1999 by brothers Jim Putnam and Bill Putnam, Jr. Universal Audio merged with Kind of Loud Technologies to "...reproduce classic analog recording equipment designed by their father and his colleagues," and "...research and design new recording tools in the spirit of vintage analog technology."
Universal Audio replicates modern versions of vintage UREI and Teletronix designs. Universal Audio also designs and imports DSP cards and audio plugins for music production on the UAD-2 platform. The company has won several TEC Award nominations and a FutureMusic Platinum award. The founder's son, Bill Putnam Jr. is CEO.
