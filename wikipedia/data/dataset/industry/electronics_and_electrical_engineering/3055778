Tagar is a national brand of desktop and laptop PC computers in Canada. Tagar systems are sold through major retailers such as The Source by Circuit City and The Brick, as well as independent dealers. Tagar Systems is fully owned and operated by McKinnon Micro Distributing, a Vancouver based IT equipment distributor.
Tagar's focus seems to lie in high end gaming and Media Center PCs, although their online configurators include options for "value series" systems as well.
