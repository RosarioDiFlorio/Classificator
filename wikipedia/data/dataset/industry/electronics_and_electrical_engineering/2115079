Shuttle Inc. (Chinese: 浩鑫股份有限公司; pinyin: Hàoxīn Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) (TAIEX:2405) is a Taiwan-based manufacturer of motherboards, barebone computers, complete PC systems and monitors. Throughout the last 10 years, Shuttle has been one of the world's top 10 motherboard manufacturers, and gained fame in 2001 with the introduction of the Shuttle SV24, one of the world's first commercially successful small form factor computers. Shuttle XPC small form factor computers tend to be popular among PC enthusiasts and hobbyists, although in 2004 Shuttle started a campaign to become a brand name recognized by mainstream PC consumers.
Shuttle XPC desktop systems are based on same PC platform as the XPC barebone (case+motherboard+power supply) Shuttle manufactures. More recently, the differentiation between Shuttle barebones and Shuttle systems has become greater, with the launch of system exclusive models such as the M-series and X-series.
