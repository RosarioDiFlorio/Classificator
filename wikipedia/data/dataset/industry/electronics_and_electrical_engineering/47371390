MagnaCom is a technology IP license provider based in Israel and Orange County, California. The company is focused on reducing the bandwidth needed in wired and wireless communications, via the WAM technology, an alternative to Quadrature amplitude modulation The business provides technology to carriers, handset providers, wired and wireless companies, and is embedded in semiconductor chips.
The WAM technology, property of MagnaCom, is aimed to substitute current QAM technology, present in cellular, Wi-Fi, fiber and wire-line broadband connections, which can gain 10 decibel on a signal and 400% in the range of Wi-Fi. The power consumption would also be down by 50%. This is achieved by a more efficient modulation scheme, carrying more info on the same space, improving speeds. These innovations are aimed towards a better connectivity on 5G cellular networks.
