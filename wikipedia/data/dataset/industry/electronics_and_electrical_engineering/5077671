Asia Commercial Co. Ltd. (ACC) was a Hong Kong-based computer company which manufactured the ACC 8000, a MOS 6502-based personal computer compatible with the Apple IIe. It could run Apple DOS 3.3, CP/M or FLEX. The ACC 8000 was built for business and professional use, and used a mechanical keyboard. It was not successful, and is today quite rare.
