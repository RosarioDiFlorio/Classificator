Infineta Systems was a company that made WAN optimization products for high performance, latency-sensitive network applications. The company advertised that it allowed application data rate to exceed the nominal data rate of the link. Infineta Systems ceased operations by February 2013, a liquidator was appointed, and its products will no longer be manufactured, sold or distributed. Riverbed Technology purchased some of Infineta's assets from the liquidator.
