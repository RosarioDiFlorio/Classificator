Institute of Robotics in Scandinavia AB (iRobis) is a privately owned company based on Gothenburg, Sweden, founded in 2009. It is one of several companies created from research and expertise of Peter Nordin. The company specializes in evolutionary robotics software. iRobis was created with financial support from the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration, a civilian governmental agency acting under the Ministry of Defense, based on an original proposal by Roger F. Gay. The proposal linked Peter Nordin's work in evolutionary robotics with the concept of a "high level logic" (HLL) framework. The proposed idea was to create a six layer artificial intelligence architecture with three layers related directly to Peter Nordin's work in genetic programming supplemented by three higher level control layers. The model combined first and third generation AI.
