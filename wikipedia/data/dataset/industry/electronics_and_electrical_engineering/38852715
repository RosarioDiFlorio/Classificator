Whiptail (styled as WHIPTAIL) was previously a privately held company that builds data storage systems out of solid-state drive components. Whiptail designed and commercialized the use of NAND flash memory as a replacement for hard disk drives in large-scale storage systems. The company is named after the whiptail racerunner, a fast lizard species indigenous to the southwestern United States.
On October 29, 2013,Whiptail (advised by Eric Mandl and Vikram Rao) was acquired by Cisco Systems for approximately US $415M.
