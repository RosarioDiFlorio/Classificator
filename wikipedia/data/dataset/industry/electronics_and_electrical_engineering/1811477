Established by Sir Peter Maire in 1986 as New Zealand-based Talon Technology, Navman (as the company became known in the 1990s) is a GPS systems company providing stand-alone GPS units, OEM GPS modules, GPS software for Palm handhelds and Pocket PCs, automotive navigation systems and navigation systems for use at sea.
Acquired by Brunswick Corporation in June 2004, the Navman PND (Portable Navigation Device) division was subsequently sold to MiTAC in the first half of 2007 and this business retains principal use of the Navman brand, including the navman.com website. Sales, marketing and support is primarily based in Gatwick, UK. At its height as a New Zealand owned company Navman employed 300 staff at its headquarters in Auckland though market pressures and cutbacks meant, as of 2015, the now Taiwanese-owned company has just two staff in New Zealand, with operations now transferred to an Australian affiliate.
The Navman Marine division designs and manufactures fish finders, sonar, VHF radios, autopilots and sailing instruments and was sold by Brunswick to the Norwegian company Navico in April 2007.
The remaining Navman divisions are Navman Wireless Vehicle Tracking Solutions and Navman Wireless OEM. These two business were sold by Brunswick in a single management buy out transaction in mid-2007. The company is doing business as Navman Wireless.
After being purchased by Brunswick and becoming part of Brunswick New Technology, the company struggled to turn a profit and a mass exodus of senior management staff ensued. The company was sold to MiTAC International Corporation in 2008.
Navman-branded devices are still sold in Australia, New Zealand and in key markets across Europe alongside devices from Mio.
Alongside is her sister company Magellan which sells fitness and outdoor adventure GPS devices including the Magellan Cyclo 100 series, Cyclo 500 series, Magellan Echo, Magellan Switch, eXplorist GC, 110, 310, 510, 610 and 710.
