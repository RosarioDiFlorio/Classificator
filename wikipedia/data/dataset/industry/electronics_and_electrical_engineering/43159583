SubPac is a tactile audio system, designed and developed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The SubPac consists of a combination of tactile transducers, vibro-tactile membranes, electronics and textiles, designed to deliver a physical dimension of sound. SubPac is available in a wearable and seatback format. The device was intended to move music hardware technologies in this area past simple 'vibrating devices' to deliver a complex and nuanced experience, to create an accurate tactile representation of whatever audio input is used. Outside of music production and enjoyment, the SubPac has a wide range of applications such as gaming, virtual reality (VR) and film enjoyment.
