Cymmetria, Inc. is a private American cyber security company that provides deception based cyber security solutions against advanced cyber threats, such as advanced persistent threats. The company uses proprietary deception technology to detect and disable hackers and cyber threats. Cymmetria's MazeRunner and ActiveSOC empower organizations to hunt attackers making lateral movement inside the perimeter. MazeRunner enables organizations to build effective deception stories, while ActiveSOC automates hunting and IR. With MazeRunner, attackers are unable to make lateral movement undetected. ActiveSOC automates the deployment of deception elements in response to SOC triggers, automatically verifying events; this reduces the number of events that require analyst review, and produces actionable intelligence from otherwise discarded events.
