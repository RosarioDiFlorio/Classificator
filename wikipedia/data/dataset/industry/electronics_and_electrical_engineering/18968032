IntervalZero, Inc. develops hard real-time software and its symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) enabled RTX and RTX64 software transform the Microsoft Windows general-purpose operating system (GPOS) into a real-time operating system (RTOS).
IntervalZero and its engineering group regularly release new software (cf its history).
Its most recent product, RTX64, focuses on 64-bit and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) to replace dedicated hardware based systems such as digital signal processors (DSPs) or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with multicore PCs.
For instance, an audio mixing surface manufacturer which largely deployed DSP based systems, switched to personal computer (PC) based systems, dedicating multi-core processors for the real time audio processing.
Founded in July 2008 by a group of former Ardence executives, IntervalZero is headed by CEO Jeffrey D. Hibbard. The firm has offices in Waltham, MA; Nice, France; Munich, Germany, and Taiwan, ROC.
This global presence is important because these solutions are deployed worldwide, primarily in industrial automation, military, aerospace, medical devices, digital media, and test and simulation software.
The corporate name, IntervalZero, comes from the firm's mission to deliver deterministic, hard real-time functionality. An "interval of zero" is the technical definition of the optimal experience between a system command and execution.
