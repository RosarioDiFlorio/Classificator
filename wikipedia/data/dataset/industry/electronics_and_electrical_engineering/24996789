PathScale Inc. was a company that developed a highly optimizing compiler for the x86-64 microprocessor architectures. It derives from the SGI compilers for the MIPS architecture R10000 processor, called MIPSPro.
After being acquired and re-sold, by March 24 2017, Pathscale was reported to be looking for another buyer of its assets. As of May 2017 its open source compiler has been removed from its GitHub account and the official company web site is down.
