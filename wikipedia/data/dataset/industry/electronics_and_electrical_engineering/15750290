Sitronics (Russian: Ситро́никс) is a microelectronics company based in Moscow, Russia and controlled by Sistema holding, that also manufactures mobile phones. Its main assets are the electronics fabs, research and development facilities NIIME and Mikron in Zelenograd, and other facilities elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
Despite losses in 2007, the company is planning to remain a part of Sistema and to expand its product portfolio, bidding for large telecommunications contracts such as a $1 billion deal to build a network in Saudi Arabia.
