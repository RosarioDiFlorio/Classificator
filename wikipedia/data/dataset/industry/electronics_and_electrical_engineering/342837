Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated. In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8 percent. As of 2014, Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996. Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone. It is one of the worldâ€™s biggest glassmakers. Corning won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation four times for its product and process innovations.
