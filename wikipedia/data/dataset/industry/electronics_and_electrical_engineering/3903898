Sham Shui Po Park (Chinese: 深水埗公園; Jyutping: sam1 seoi2 bou4 gung1 jyun4) is a park in Sham Shui Po, New Kowloon, Hong Kong. It comprises two physically discontiguous sites on either side of Lai Chi Kok Road. The larger site is more well-known as Sham Shui Po Park. The smaller site is located within Lai Kok Estate and was originally managed by the Housing Authority and became part of Sham Shui Po Park when it was transferred to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.
The park was built on reclaimed land originally home to the Sham Shui Po Barracks.
