Eden Amplification (previously known as Eden Electronics) is a bass amplification company that began in 1976. The company takes its name from Eden Prairie, where the idea for the company was conceived. Eden designs and manufactures high-end bass amplification systems. This includes bass amplifiers, pre-amplifiers, power amps, bass pedals, and bass cabinets. Its most famous series of products include World Tour Amplifiers and D-series Cabinets. Eden's reputation was founded on the fact that everything was designed and built "in-house", including the speakers (a very rare feat by any manufacturer).

Eden amplifiers are used by a variety of musicians but are primarily favored by those people who are defined as "player's players" including many session musicians and technical recording artists. Notable recording artists include bass players Mike Rutherford from the progressive rock band Genesis and the 1980s soft rock group Mike and the Mechanics, Phil Lesh formerly of the Grateful Dead, and Mike Gordon of Phish. Users of Eden equipment span a wide variety of musical style from jazz and country to heavy rock.
