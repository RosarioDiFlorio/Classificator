HECToR (High End Computing Terascale Resource) was a British academic national supercomputer service funded by EPSRC, Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and BBSRC for the UK academic community. The HECToR service was run by partners including EPCC, Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).
The supercomputer itself (currently a Cray XE6) was located at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The first phase came on line in October 2007, and, by the time it was decommissioned, it had been upgraded to Phase 3 configuration, with a peak performance of over 800 teraflops. Its successor is called ARCHER.
