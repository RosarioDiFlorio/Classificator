Binatone is a British telecommunications company. Binatone was started in the United Kingdom in 1958 by two brothers, Gulu Lalvani and Partap Lalvani, to import and distribute consumer electronics.
In 1983 Binatone was the first in Europe with fixed-line consumer products that could be bought at electronics retailers. This marked the beginning of a gradual change from Binatone's focus on audio and vision to telecom products.
In 2008, Dino Lalvani, son of Gulu Lalvani, purchased the company from his father and took over as chairman.
Binatone was the official shirt sponsor of Queens Park Rangers Football Club from 2003 to 2006.
