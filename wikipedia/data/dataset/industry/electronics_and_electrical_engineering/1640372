Sandial Systems developed optical networking hardware for backbones and other carrier networks. It was founded as Malachite Technology in 2000 and dissolved in 2004. With the collapse of the telecommunications market the company was reorganized, renamed Sandial Systems and refocused as a maker of Fibre Channel director class switches. The main differentiator of the Shadow 14000 switch was use of Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) to introduce Quality of Service (QoS) into Storage Area Networks (SANs).
