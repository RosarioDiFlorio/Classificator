Ambric architecture and processors were developed by Ambric, Inc. Its Am2045 Massively Parallel Processor Array (MPPA) chips were primarily used in high-performance embedded systems such as medical imaging, video, and signal-processing. Ambric was founded in 2003, developed and introduced the Am2045 and its software tools in 2007, and fell victim to the crash of 2008. Ambric's Am2045 and tools remained available through Nethra Imaging, Inc., which closed in 2012.
