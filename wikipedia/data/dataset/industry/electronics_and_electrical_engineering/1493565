Bang & Olufsen (B&O) (stylized as BANG & OLUFSEN) is a high-end Danish consumer electronics company that designs and manufactures audio products, television sets, and telephones. It was founded in 1925 by Peter Bang and Svend Olufsen, who designed a radio to work with alternating current, a product of significance at a time when most radios were still running on batteries. In 2004, the company opened a factory in the Czech Republic where it employed approximately 250 staff producing mainly audio products.
