Shaheen is a supercomputer owned and operated by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). It consists primarily of a 36-cabinet Cray XC40 supercomputer. Built in partnership with Cray, Shaheen is intended to enable KAUST Faculty and Partners to research both large and small-scale projects, from inception to realization.
Shaheen, named after the Peregrine Falcon, is the largest and most powerful supercomputer in the Middle East with a processing power of 5.54 petaflops with 196,608 cores. The first generation of Shaheen (2009-2015) was an IBM Blue Gene/P, originally built at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, and moved to KAUST in mid-2009. The second generation of Shaheen, project name "Shaheen II", was brought into service in the summer of 2015.
