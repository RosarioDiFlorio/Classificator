Founded in 1973, Raindirk Audio Ltd is a manufacturer of high-end, pro-audio equipment used in both recording studios and live sound reproduction. Raindirk's first console was sold to former Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan's Kingsway Studios. All products are designed by Cyril Jones.
Whilst not maintaining as high a profile as comptetitores like Solid State Logic, Automated Processes Inc and AMS Neve, Raindirk consoles have been used on artists as diverse as Pavarotti and Max Bygraves.
