The RAD Group is composed of independent companies that develop, manufacture and market solutions for diverse segments of the networking and telecommunications industry. Each company operates independently, without a holding company, but is guided by the group founders under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies share technology, engage in joint marketing activities and benefit from a common management structure.
Four RAD Group companies are traded on NASDAQ in the U.S.: Ceragon Networks, Radware , RADCOM, and Silicom. The others are privately held by the Group's founders and several venture capital firms.
