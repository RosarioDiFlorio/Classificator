Auzentech was a Korean computer hardware manufacturer that specialized in high-definition audio equipment and in particular PC sound cards.
Auzentech has its origins in March 2005, when under the company name HDA (HiTeC Digital Audio), the company launched the X-Mystique 7.1, the first consumer add-in sound card to feature Dolby Digital Live. Initially only a manufacturer, HDA's products were commercialized worldwide by a network of local distributors, including BlueGears as their vendor in the United States.
In 2006 the company took distribution into their own hands, ceasing relations with BlueGears, and subsequently changing their brand name to Auzen (a name which originates from "Audio" and "Zen") and their company name to Auzentech.
Since that time the company continued to incorporate new sound cards into their lineup in an effort to compete in a market dominated by Creative Labs. Auzentech seeks to provide customers with features not present in Creative's sound cards at that time, such as real time multi-channel audio encoding and built-in TOSLINK connections. These features enable users to have multichannel realtime audio (like that originating in PC games) over a single digital line, instead of the previously unavoidable three analog lines running from the PC to the speakers. Also present in all Auzentech sound cards are user-replaceable OPAMPs, which offer the possibility to further improve the out-of-the-box quality of analog outputs.
Eventually expansion led Auzentech to broaden their range of products to include items such as speakers, microphones and PC cases among others.
Auzentech has recently switched from the C-Media audio processors used in their earlier cards to the X-Fi audio DSP, licensed from their competitor, Creative Labs.
Since late 2013, Auzentech's official web site has been directing to a park page, and their technical support department ceased to provide any service.
