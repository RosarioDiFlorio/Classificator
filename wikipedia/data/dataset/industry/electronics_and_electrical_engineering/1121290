AST Research, Inc. was a personal computer manufacturer, founded in Irvine, California, in 1980 by Albert Wong, Safi Qureshey and Thomas Yuen (the name comes from the initials of their first names: Albert Safi Thomas). In the 1980s AST designed add-on expansion cards, before shifting to a major personal computer manufacturer towards the 1990s. By the late 1990s AST was acquired by Samsung, but was forced to close shortly after due to a series of losses.
