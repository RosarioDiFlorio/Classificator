Obi Worldphone, previously Obi Mobiles, is a Silicon Valley smartphone manufacturer founded in 2014 by former Apple Inc. and PepsiCo CEO John Sculley. Obi Worldphone manufactures smartphones aimed at the emerging markets rather than very competitive developed markets.
Obi Worldphone launched two of their pioneer low cost smartphones on August 27, 2015. Both models are based upon Android as their operating system. Their third phone, the MV1, was announced in February 2016, and was released to Asian, African, Latin American and European markets in March 2016.
