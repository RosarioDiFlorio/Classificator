Clear Audio Electronic GmbH of Germany is a manufacturer of high fidelity audio products. Formed in 1978, their primary focus is on vinyl turntables and related products such as cartridges. One of the particularly recognisable traits of a Clearaudio turntable are their transparent (or in some models translucent) acrylic components. The more expensive turntables showcase parallel tracking rather than pivot based tone arms.
