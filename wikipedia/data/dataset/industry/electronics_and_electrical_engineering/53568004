Capcom Coin-Op was a pinball manufacturer, a wholly owned subsidiary of Capcom USA, which was founded in June 1995 and closed in December 1996. It developed and sold pinball and arcade game machines and converted games for the US market. Based in Sunnyvale, California and Arlington Heights, IL, the company developed six pinball machines over the course of its short existence, though only four ever made it to release. Mark Ritchie and Python Anghelo were designers that Capcom Coin-Op managed to poach from Williams Electronics for their tables. Of the company's machines, Big Bang Bar acquired a legendary reputation because of its quality and the fact that its design was completed but the company folded before it was mass-produced. Gene Cunningham of Illinois Pin Ball acquired the rights to Big Bang Bar in 2000 and produced a limited run of the table in 2006 before it too went out of business.
