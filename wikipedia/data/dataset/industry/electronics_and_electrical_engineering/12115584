Dip soldering is a small-scale soldering process by which electronic components are soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) to form an electronic assembly. The solder wets to the exposed metallic areas of the board (those not protected with solder mask), creating a reliable mechanical and electrical connection.
Dip soldering is used for both through-hole printed circuit assemblies, and surface mount. It is one of the cheapest methods to solder and is extensively used in the small scale industries of developing countries .
Dip soldering is the manual equivalent of automated wave soldering. The apparatus required is just a small tank containing molten solder. PCB with mounted components is dipped manually into the tank when the molten solder sticks to the exposed metallic areas of the board.
