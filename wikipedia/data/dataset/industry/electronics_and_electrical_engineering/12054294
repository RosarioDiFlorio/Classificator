Behavior Tech Computer (BTC) manufactures many computer accessories including keyboards, webcams and mouse devices; they used to manufacture optical drives but decided to leave the market and sold their Optical Division to Foxconn.
The company was founded in 1982, launching a capacitance keyboard the following year. International expansion followed rapidly:
1986 BTC USA
1988 BTC Korea
1989 BTC Europe - a sales hub based in the Netherlands
1991 BTC France
1992 BTC Latin - based in Florida, USA
1993 BTC Germany - with a focus on Germany and Eastern Europe
The expansion has led to BTC being described by the Taiwanese Business Weekly magazine as the "third most internationalized" company in Thailand.
