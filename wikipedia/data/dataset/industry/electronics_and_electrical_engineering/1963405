HTC Corporation (Chinese: 宏達國際電子股份有限公司; pinyin: Hóngdá Guójì Diànzǐ Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī) is a Taiwanese consumer electronics company headquartered in Xindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. Founded in 1997, HTC began as an original design manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer, designing and manufacturing laptop computers. They re-entered the market in 2008, turning to devices such as mobile phones and tablets, releasing their first Smartphone, the HTC Dream.
After initially making smartphones based mostly on Windows Mobile, HTC became a co-founding member of the Open Handset Alliance, a group of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators dedicated to the development of the Android mobile operating system. The HTC Dream, marketed by T-Mobile in many countries as the T-Mobile G1, was the first phone on the market to run Android.
HTC later shifted to marketing its own devices, including the HTC One series. In 2011, HTC ranked as the 98th top brand on Interbrand's Best Global Brands report. A September 2013 media report stated that HTC's share of the global smartphone market is less than 3 percent. While rising back to 7.2 percent in April 2015 due to its strong sales of recent devices, its stock price had fallen by 90 percent since 2011, and the company experienced consecutive net losses.
In 2016, HTC expanded into virtual reality hardware with the release of HTC Vive.
In 2017, HTC announced a $1.1 billion deal with Google, wherein Google acquires a non-exclusive license to intellectual property of HTC as well as a transfer of 2000 employees, mainly tied to the Pixel phone lineup.
