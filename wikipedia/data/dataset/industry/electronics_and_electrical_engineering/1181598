GammaLink Inc. was founded in Sunnyvale, California by Dr Hank Magnuski and Dr Michael Lutz. The company was the first to invent the PC-to-fax communications technology, GammaFax.
The company was eventually sold to Dialogic Corporation which in turn was bought by Intel Corporation. It was then bought by Eicon and subsequently acquired by Open Media Labs, which now functions as Dialogic Media Labs.
