Studies of lunar seismology are used by scientists, engineers and artists for a number of purposes including:
Learning about the moon's and Earth's evolution
Understanding Earth's seismology with comparative studies
Gaining knowledge about tidal moonquakes or other origins of these forces (since the moon is thought to have no tectonic plates)
Advancing the field of selenography (the geography of the moon)
