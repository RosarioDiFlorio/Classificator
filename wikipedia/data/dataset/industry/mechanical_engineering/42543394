Charles Cadwell, was a professor at the Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University), in Cleveland, Ohio.
In 1938, he further developed the Exothermic welding system of Hans Goldschmidt around 1895.
The original use of the process was to weld signal bonds to railroad tracks, which previously had to be done with "pins" knocked into holes drilled into the web of the rail.
Later developments allows the rails themselves to be welded together.
