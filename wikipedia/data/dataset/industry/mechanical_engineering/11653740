AFGROW (Air Force Grow) is a Damage Tolerance Analysis (DTA) framework that allows users to analyze crack initiation, fatigue crack growth, and fracture to predict the life of metallic structures. Originally developed by The Air Force Research Laboratory, AFGROW is mainly used for aerospace applications, but can be applied to any type of metallic structure that experiences fatigue cracking. AFGROW is now being independently developed and maintained by LexTech, Inc.
