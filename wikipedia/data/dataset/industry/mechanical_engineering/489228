Tribology is the science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion. It includes the study and application of the principles of friction, lubrication and wear. Tribology is highly interdisciplinary in nature and draws upon several academic areas including: physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering.
The word tribology derives from the Greek root τριβ- of the verb τρίβω, tribo, "I rub" in classic Greek and the suffix -logy from -λογία, -logia "study of", "knowledge of". It was coined by Peter Jost in 1966, who produced an eponymous report which highlighted the cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the UK economy.
