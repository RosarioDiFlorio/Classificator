A Variable cycle three-stroke engine is a type of internal combustion engine, patented by Michael A. V. Ward, US patent 5454352 dated Oct 3, 1995. Although the engine runs on the four-stroke cycle, the cycle is completed in one revolution of the crankshaft, as in the Atkinson cycle engine. However, this is achieved by the use of an elliptical cam instead of the jointed linkage used in the Atkinson engine.The three stroke engine does not exist in reality but according to the patent this cycle can be termed as 3 stroke. In reality it is a 2 stroke engine. The term "three-stroke" indicates that, to quote from the patent, "total cycle displacement (of) the engine equals approximately three expansion ratios". Thermal engine wherein the firing of gases is provided by controlled ignition, by compression up to the self ignition temperature, by compression under controlled pressure comprising a head-cylinder, a cylinder and a crankcase of the same type as the two stroke engine
