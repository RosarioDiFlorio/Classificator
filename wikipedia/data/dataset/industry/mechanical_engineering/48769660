In mathematics, the Kadison–Singer problem, posed in 1959, was a problem in functional analysis about whether certain extensions of certain linear functionals on certain C*-algebras were unique. The uniqueness was proven in 2013.
The statement arose from work on the foundations of quantum mechanics done by Paul Dirac in the 1940s and was formalized in 1959 by Richard Kadison and Isadore Singer. The problem was subsequently shown to be equivalent to numerous open problems in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, engineering and computer science. Kadison, Singer, and most later authors believed the statement to be false, but, in 2013, it was proven true by Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava, who received the 2014 Pólya Prize for the achievement.
The solution was made possible by a reformulation provided by Joel Anderson, who showed in 1979 that his "paving conjecture", which only involves operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, is equivalent to the Kadison–Singer problem. Nik Weaver provided another reformulation in a finite-dimensional setting, and this version was proved true using random polynomials.
