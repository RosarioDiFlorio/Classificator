In statistical mechanics, the Rushbrooke inequality relates the critical exponents of a magnetic system which exhibits a first-order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit for non-zero temperature T.
Since the Helmholtz free energy is extensive, the normalization to free energy per site is given as
