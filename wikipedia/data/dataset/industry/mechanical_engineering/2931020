Pendulum-and-hydrostat control is a control mechanism developed originally for depth control of the Whitehead Torpedo. It is an early example of what is now known as proportional and derivative control
The hydrostat is a mechanism that senses pressure; the torpedo's depth is proportional to pressure. However, with only a hydrostat controlling the depth fins, the torpedo tends to oscillate around the desired depth rather than settling to the desired depth. The addition of a pendulum allows the torpedo to sense the pitch of the torpedo. The pitch information is combined with the depth information to set the torpedo's depth control fins. The pitch information provides a damping term to the depth control response and suppresses the depth oscillations.
