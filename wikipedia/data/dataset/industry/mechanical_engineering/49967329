Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is the passing of information from a vehicle to any entity that may affect the vehicle, and vice versa. It is a vehicular communication system that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure), V2V (Vehicle-to-vehicle), V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian), V2D (Vehicle-to-device) and V2G (Vehicle-to-grid).
The main push for V2X is safety, with energy savings also being important. However, there are still obstacles preventing the roll-out of this technology, mainly legal issues and the fact that, unless almost the totality of the existing vehicles adopt it, its effectiveness is rather limited. British weekly "The Economist" even argues autonomous driving is more regulatory than technology driven.
V2X communication is based on WLAN technology and works directly between vehicles or the infrastructure, which form a vehicular ad-hoc network, as two V2X senders come within each otherâ€™s range. Hence it does not require any infrastructure for vehicles to communicate, which is key to assure safety in remote or little developed areas. It is particularly well-suited for V2X communication, due to its low latency and the ability to communicate instantly. It transmits messages known as Common Awareness Messages (CAM) and Decentralised Notification Messages (DENM) or Basic Safety Message (BSM). The data volume of these messages is very low. The radio technology is standardised as part of the WLAN IEEE 802.11 family of standards and known in the US as WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) and in Europe as ITS-G5.
