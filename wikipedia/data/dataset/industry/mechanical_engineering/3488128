In differential calculus, the Reynolds transport theorem (also known as the Leibniz–Reynolds transport theorem), or in short Reynolds' theorem, is a three-dimensional generalization of the Leibniz integral rule which is also known as differentiation under the integral sign. The theorem is named after Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912). It is used to recast derivatives of integrated quantities and is useful in formulating the basic equations of continuum mechanics.
Consider integrating f = f(x,t) over the time-dependent region Ω(t) that has boundary ∂Ω(t), then taking the derivative with respect to time:

  
    
      
        
          
            d
            
              d
              t
            
          
        
        
          ∫
          
            Ω
            (
            t
            )
          
        
        
          f
        
        
        d
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{\Omega (t)}\mathbf {f} \,dV.}
  
If we wish to move the derivative within the integral, there are two issues: the time dependence of f, and the introduction of and removal of space from Ω due to its dynamic boundary. Reynolds' transport theorem provides the necessary framework.
