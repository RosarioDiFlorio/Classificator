The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions, also referred to as Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions or Rankine–Hugoniot relations, describe the relationship between the states on both sides of a shock wave in a one-dimensional flow in fluids or a one-dimensional deformation in solids. They are named in recognition of the work carried out by Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine and French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot. See also Salas (2006) for some historical background.
In a coordinate system that is moving with the shock, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions can be expressed as:

where us is the shock wave speed, ρ1 and ρ2 are the mass density of the fluid behind and inside the shock, u2 is the particle velocity of the fluid inside the shock, p1 and p2 are the pressures in the two regions, and e1 and e2 are the specific (with the sense of per unit mass) internal energies in the two regions. These equations can be derived in a straightforward manner from equations (12), (13) and (14) below. Using the Rankine-Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum to eliminate us and u2, the equation for the conservation of energy can be expressed as the Hugoniot equation:
