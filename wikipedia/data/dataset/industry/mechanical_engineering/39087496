In materials modeled by linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), crack extension occurs when the energy release rate G equals R, the material's resistance to crack extension. A plot of R versus crack extension is called a crack resistance curve, or R curve. The corresponding plot of energy release rate versus crack extension is called a driving force curve.
