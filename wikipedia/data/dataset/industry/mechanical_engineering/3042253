The Dirac equation, as the relativistic equation that describes spin 1/2 particles in quantum mechanics can be written in terms of the Algebra of physical space (APS), which is a case of a Clifford algebra or geometric algebra that is based in the use of paravectors.
The Dirac equation in APS, including the electromagnetic interaction, reads

  
    
      
        i
        
          
            
              ∂
              ¯
            
          
        
        Ψ
        
          
            e
          
          
            3
          
        
        +
        e
        
          
            
              A
              ¯
            
          
        
        Ψ
        =
        m
        
          
            
              
                Ψ
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i{\bar {\partial }}\Psi \mathbf {e} _{3}+e{\bar {A}}\Psi =m{\bar {\Psi }}^{\dagger }}
  
Another form of the Dirac equation in terms of the Space time algebra was given earlier by David Hestenes.
In general, the Dirac equation in the formalism of geometric algebra has the advantage of providing a direct geometric interpretation.
