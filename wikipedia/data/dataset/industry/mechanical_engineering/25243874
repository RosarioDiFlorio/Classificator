Magnetic translations are naturally defined operators acting on wave function on a two-dimensional particle in a magnetic field.
The motion of an electron in a magnetic field on a plane is described by the following four variables: guiding center coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ,
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X,Y)}
   and the relative coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        
          R
          
            x
          
        
        ,
        
          R
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (R_{x},R_{y})}
  .
The guiding center coordinates are independent of the relative coordinates and, when quantized, satisfy
  
    
      
        [
        X
        ,
        Y
        ]
        =
        −
        i
        
          ℓ
          
            B
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [X,Y]=-i\ell _{B}^{2}}
  ,
where 
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            B
          
        
        =
        
          
            ℏ
            
              /
            
            e
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell _{B}={\sqrt {\hbar /eB}}}
  , which makes them mathematically similar to the position and momentum operators 
  
    
      
        Q
        =
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q=q}
   and 
  
    
      
        P
        =
        −
        i
        ℏ
        
          
            d
            
              d
              q
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle P=-i\hbar {\frac {d}{dq}}}
   in one-dimensional quantum mechanics.
Much like acting on a wave function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        q
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(q)}
   of a one-dimensional quantum particle by the operators 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            a
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{iaP}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            b
            Q
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{ibQ}}
   generate the shift of momentum or position of the particle, for the quantum particle in 2D in magnetic field one considers the magnetic translation operators
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            (
            
              p
              
                x
              
            
            X
            +
            
              p
              
                y
              
            
            Y
            )
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{i(p_{x}X+p_{y}Y)},}
  
for any pair of numbers 
  
    
      
        (
        
          p
          
            x
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p_{x},p_{y})}
  .
The magnetic translation operators corresponding to two different pairs 
  
    
      
        (
        
          p
          
            x
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            y
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p_{x},p_{y})}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          p
          
            x

            y
          
          ′
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (p'_{x},p'_{y})}
