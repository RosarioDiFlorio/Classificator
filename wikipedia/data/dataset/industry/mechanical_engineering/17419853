In fluid dynamics, the Chézy formula describes the mean flow velocity of steady, turbulent open channel flow:

  
    
      
        v
        =
        C
        
          
            R
            
            i
          
        
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v=C{\sqrt {R\,i}},\,}
  
where

  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is average velocity [m/s],

  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   is Chezy's coefficient [m½/s],

  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   is the hydraulic radius (~ water depth) [m], and

  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is the bottom slope [m/m].
The formula is named after Antoine de Chézy, the French hydraulics engineer who devised it in 1775.
