In quantum mechanics, bra–ket notation is a standard notation for describing quantum states. It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals in mathematics. The notation begins with using angle brackets, ⟨ and ⟩, and a vertical bar, |, to denote the scalar product of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space. The scalar product or action is written as

  
    
      
        ⟨
        ϕ
        ∣
        ψ
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \phi \mid \psi \rangle .}
  
The right part is called the ket ; it is a vector, typically represented as a column vector and written

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle .}
  
The left part is called the bra, ; it is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a row vector and is written

  
    
      
        ⟨
        ϕ
        
          |
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \phi |.}
  
A combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using matrix multiplication. A bra and a ket with the same label are Hermitian conjugates of each other.
Bra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Dirac and is also known as the Dirac notation.
The bra-ket notation has a precursor in Hermann Grassmann's use of the notation 
  
    
      
        [
        ϕ
        ∣
        ψ
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [\phi \mid \psi ]}
   for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.
