In physics, a quantum instrument is a mathematical abstraction of a quantum measurement, capturing both the classical and quantum outputs. It combines the concepts of measurement and quantum operation. It can be equivalently understood as a quantum channel that takes as input a quantum system and has as its output two systems: a classical system containing the outcome of the measurement and a quantum system containing the post-measurement state.
