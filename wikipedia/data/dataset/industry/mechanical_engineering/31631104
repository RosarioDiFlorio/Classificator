Gas networks simulation or Gas Pipeline Simulation is a process of defining the mathematical model of the gas transport and distribution systems, which are usually composed of highly integrated pipe networks operating over a wide range of pressures. Simulation allows to predict the behaviour of gas network systems under different conditions. Such predictions can be effectively used to guide decisions regarding the design and operation of the real system.
