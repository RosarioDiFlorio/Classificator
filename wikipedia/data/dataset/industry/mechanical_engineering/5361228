An event data recorder or EDR, sometimes referred to informally as an automotive "black box" (by analogy with the common nickname for flight recorders), is a device installed in some automobiles to record information related to vehicle crashes or accidents. In the USA EDRs must meet federal standards, as described within the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.
In modern diesel trucks, EDRs are triggered by electronically sensed problems in the engine (often called faults), or a sudden change in wheel speed. One or more of these conditions may occur because of an accident. Information from these devices can be collected after a crash and analyzed to help determine what the vehicles were doing before, during and after the crash or event. The term generally refers to a simple, tamper-proof, read-write memory device.
