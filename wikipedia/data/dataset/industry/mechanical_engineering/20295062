A fundamental tool in statistical mechanics and probabilistic combinatorics (especially random graphs and the probabilistic method), the Ahlswede–Daykin inequality (Ahlswede & Daykin 1978), also known as the four functions theorem (or inequality), is a correlation-type inequality for four functions on a finite distributive lattice.
It states that if 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        ,

        ,
        
          f
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4}}
   are nonnegative functions on a finite distributive lattice such that

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            1
          
        
        (
        x
        )

        ≤

    {\displaystyle f_{1}(x)f_{2}(y)\leq f_{3}(x\vee y)f_{4}(x\wedge y)}
  
for all x, y in the lattice, then

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            1

for all subsets X, Y of the lattice, where

The Ahlswede–Daykin inequality can be used to provide a short proof of both the Holley inequality and the FKG inequality. It also implies the Fishburn–Shepp inequality.
For a proof, see the original article (Ahlswede & Daykin 1978) or (Alon & Spencer 2000).
