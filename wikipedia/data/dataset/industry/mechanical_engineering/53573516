FEATool Multiphysics (short for Finite Element Analysis Multiphysics Toolbox) is a physics and finite-element simulation toolbox with an easy-to-use GUI for Matlab and Octave. FEATool features the ability to model geometry, automatic grid generation, postprocessing, and physics solvers for heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and structural mechanics in 1D, 2D, or 3D, all within an easy-to-use GUI, and has been used in industrial simulation and in academic research. In addition, being written in the m-script language, models can be saved, written, and run directly on the Matlab command line. Moreover, FEATool features built-in direct integration with the external CFD solver FeatFlow and general FEM solver FEniCS, allowing high-performance CFD and multiphysics simulations to be set up and performed directly in Matlab.
