Vacuum cooling is known to be the most rapid cooling technique for any porous product which has free water and works on the principle of evaporative cooling. Vacuum cooling is generally used for cooling food products having a high water content and large porosities, due to its efficacy in losing water from both within and outside the products. This is the most widely used technique for rapid cooling of food product which has been proven to be one of the most efficient and economical method of cooling and storage of vegetables, fruits, flowers & more.
This cooling technology not only strongly improves the product quality, but also increases the shelf life of product and at the same time it reduces the cooling costs compared to the conventional cooling method available.
