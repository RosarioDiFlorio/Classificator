The principle of least constraint is another formulation of classical mechanics enunciated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1829.
The principle of least constraint is a least squares principle stating that the true motion of a mechanical system of 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   masses is the minimum of the quantity

Gauss's principle is equivalent to D'Alembert's principle.
The principle of least constraint is qualitatively similar to Hamilton's principle, which states that the true path taken by a mechanical system is an extremum of the action. However, Gauss's principle is a true (local) minimal principle, whereas the other is an extremal principle.
