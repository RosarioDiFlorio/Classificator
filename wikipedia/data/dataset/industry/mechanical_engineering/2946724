Prince Wilhelm of Urach, Count of Württemberg (27 September 1897 – 8 August 1957) was a member of the German princely House of Württemberg and a senior automotive production engineer.
Most of his professional career was spent working for Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart-Untertürkheim. Between 1941 and 1944, he was sent to France, however, and given responsibility over the technical division of the important Renault company. During these years, he successfully avoided knowing about the covert development of the Renault 4CV, which after 1945, proved crucial to the survival of what became France's largest automobile manufacturer.
