In statics, Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces. According to the theorem,

  
    
      
        
          
            A
            
              sin
              ⁡
              α
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            B
            
              sin
              ⁡
              β
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            C
            
              sin
              ⁡
              γ
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {A}{\sin \alpha }}={\frac {B}{\sin \beta }}={\frac {C}{\sin \gamma }}}
  
where A, B and C are the numerical values of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and α, β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the forces A, B and C respectively.

Lami's theorem is applied in static analysis of mechanical and structural systems. The theorem is named after Bernard Lamy.
