The Institution of Diesel and Gas Turbine Engineers is the professional association for engineers in the diesel and gas turbine industry in the UK and internationally.
Diesel engines and gas turbines are broadly related because they use a similar thermodynamic cycle, and both are often used (and interchangeable) for power generation for heating and electricity in large installations.
