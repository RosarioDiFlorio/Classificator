In mechanical engineering, many terms are associated into pairs called duals. A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging force (stress) and deformation (strain) in an expression.
Here is a partial list of mechanical dualities:
force — deformation
stress — strain
stiffness method — flexibility method
