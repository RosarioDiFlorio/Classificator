The Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid (sometimes wrongly referred to as LÃ¶hner-Porsche) was the first hybrid vehicle developed by Ferdinand Porsche. First prototypes were two-wheel drive, battery-powered electric vehicles with two front wheel hub-mounted motors. A later version was a series hybrid using hub-mounted electric motors in each wheel, powered by batteries and gasoline-engine generator.
