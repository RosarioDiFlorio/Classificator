In mathematics, a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations is defined to be a dynamic equation on a smooth fiber bundle 
  
    
      
        Q
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} }
   over 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  . For instance, this is the case of non-relativistic non-autonomous mechanics, but not relativistic mechanics. To describe relativistic mechanics, one should consider a system of ordinary differential equations on a smooth manifold 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
   whose fibration over 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   is not fixed. Such a system admits transformations of a coordinate 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   on 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   depending on other coordinates on 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  . Therefore, it is called the relativistic system. In particular, Special Relativity on the Minkowski space 
  
    
      
        Q
        =
        
          
            R
          
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q=\mathbb {R} ^{4}}
   is of this type.
Since a configuration space 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
   of a relativistic system has no preferable fibration over 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  , a velocity space of relativistic system is a first order jet manifold 
  
    
      
        
          J
          
            1
          
          
            1
          
        
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle J_{1}^{1}Q}
   of one-dimensional submanifolds of 
  
    
      
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
  . The notion of jets of submanifolds generalizes that of jets of sections of fiber bundles which are utilized in covariant classical field theory and non-autonomous mechanics. A first order jet bundle

        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle J_{1}^{1}Q\to Q}
   is projective and, following the terminology of Special Relativity, one can think of its fibers as being spaces of the absolute velocities of a relativistic system. Given coordinates
