In engineering, shear strength is the strength of a material or component against the type of yield or structural failure where the material or component fails in shear. A shear load is a force that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force. When a paper is cut with scissors, the paper fails in shear.
In structural and mechanical engineering, the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture or construction of the component (e.g. beams, plates, or bolts). In a reinforced concrete beam, the main purpose of reinforcing bar (rebar) stirrups is to increase the shear strength.
For shear stress 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   applies

  
    
      
        τ
        =

          σ
          
            1

   is major principal stress and

    {\displaystyle \sigma _{3}}
   is minor principal stress.
In general: ductile materials (e.g. aluminium) fail in shear, whereas brittle materials (e.g. cast iron) fail in tension. See tensile strength.
To calculate:
Given total force at failure (F) and the force-resisting area (e.g. the cross-section of a bolt loaded in shear), ultimate shear strength (
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
  ) is:

  
    
      
        τ
        =
        
          
            F

                  2
