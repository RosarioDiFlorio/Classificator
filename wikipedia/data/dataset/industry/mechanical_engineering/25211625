Electric dipole transition is the dominant effect of an interaction of an electron in an atom with the electromagnetic field.
Following, consider an electron in an atom with quantum Hamiltonian 
  
    
      
        
          H

        (
        
          
            r
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
        =

        )
        =

            0
          
        
        
          
            
              
                x

        (

    {\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }({\mathbf {r} },t)=E_{0}{\hat {\mathbf {z} }}\cos(ky-\omega t),\ \ \ {\mathbf {B} }({\mathbf {r} },t)=B_{0}{\hat {\mathbf {x} }}\cos(ky-\omega t).}
  
Write the Hamiltonian of the electron in this electromagnetic field as

  
    
      
        H
        (
        t
        )
         
        =
         
        
          H
          
            0
          
        
        +
        W
        (
        t
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle H(t)\ =\ H_{0}+W(t).}
  
Treating this system by means of time-dependent perturbation theory, one finds that the most likely transitions of the electron from one state to the other occur due to the summand of 
  
    
      
        W
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle W(t)}
   written as

        t
        )
        =
        
          
            
              q
              
                E
                
                  0
                
              
            
            
              m
              ω

        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{DE}(t)={\frac {qE_{0}}{m\omega }}p_{z}\sin \omega t.\,}
  
Electric dipole transitions are the transitions between energy levels in the system with the Hamiltonian 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            0

        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{0}+W_{DE}(t)}
  .
Between certain electron states the electric dipole transition rate may be zero due to one or more selection rules, particularly the angular momentum selection rule. In such a case, the transition is termed electric dipole forbidden, and the transitions between such levels must be approximated by higher-order transitions.

Even smaller contributions to transition rates are given by higher electric and magnetic multipole transitions.
