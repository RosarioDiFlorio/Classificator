Matrix product state (MPS) is a pure quantum state of many particles, written in the following form:

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        Ψ

          ∑
          
            {

        ⋯
        
          A
          
            N
          
          
            (
            
              s
              
                N
              
            
            )
          
        
        ]
        
          |
        
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        …
        
          s

        ⟩
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\Psi \rangle =\sum _{\{s\}}{\text{Tr}}[A_{1}^{(s_{1})}A_{2}^{(s_{2})}\cdots A_{N}^{(s_{N})}]|s_{1}s_{2}\ldots s_{N}\rangle ,}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
          
          
            (
            
              s
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{i}^{(s_{i})}}
   are complex, square matrices of order 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   (this dimension is called local dimension). Indices

    {\displaystyle s_{i}}
   go over states in the computational basis. For qubits, it is 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{i}\in \{0,1\}}
  . For qudits (d-level systems), it is 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        ,
        …
        ,
        d
        −
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{i}\in \{0,1,\ldots ,d-1\}}
  .
It is particularly useful for dealing with ground states of one-dimensional quantum spin models (e.g. Heisenberg model (quantum)). The parameter 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   is related to the entanglement between particles. In particular, if the state is a product state (i.e. not entangled at all), it can be described as a matrix product state with 
  
    
      
        χ
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi =1}
  .
For states that are translationally symmetric, we can choose:

  
    
      
        
          A
          
            1
          
          
            (
            s
            )
          
        
        =
        
          A
          
            2
          
          
            (
            s
            )
          
        
        =
        ⋯
        =
        
          A
          
            N
          
          
            (
            s
            )
          
        
        ≡
        
          A
          
            (
            s
            )
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{1}^{(s)}=A_{2}^{(s)}=\cdots =A_{N}^{(s)}\equiv A^{(s)}.}
  
In general, every state can be written in the MPS form (with 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   growing exponentially with the particle number N). However, MPS are practical when 
  
    
      
        χ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi }
   is small – for example, does not depend on the particle number. Except for a small number of specific cases (some mentioned in the section Examples), such a thing is not possible, though in many cases it serves as a good approximation.
MPS decomposition is not unique.
