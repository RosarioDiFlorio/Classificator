Platonic crystals are periodic structures which are designed to guide flexural wave energy through thin elastic plates.
The term platonic crystal is formed by analogy to photonic crystals, phononic crystals, and plasmonic crystals. The name emphasizes a thin plate formulation, which is governed by a fourth order partial differential equation, as opposed to a second order equation which governs other types of crystals. There are also strong connections between platonic crystals and metamaterials.
The study of platonic crystals is referred to as platonics and does not refer to the teachings of Plato or the Platonic solids. The term is now in common usage by multiple research groups in Australia, New Zealand, France, and the United Kingdom.
