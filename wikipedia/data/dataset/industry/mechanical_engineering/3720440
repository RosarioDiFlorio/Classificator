Backpressure refers to pressure opposed to the desired flow of gases in confined places such as a pipe. It is often caused by obstructions or tight bends in a confined space such as an exhaust pipe.
Because of air resistance, friction between molecules, the term backpressure is misleading as the pressure remains and causes flow in the same direction, but the flow is reduced due to resistance. For example, a stock car exhaust system with a particularly high number of twists, bends, turns and right angles could cause lots of backpressure to the gases escaping the car's engine therefore reducing the flow of the gasses.
