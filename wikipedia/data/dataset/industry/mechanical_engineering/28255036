A shock indicator is a mechanical device that detects and records mechanical shocks experienced by it. It is a common practice to attach shock indicators to expensive goods that are to be shipped. This way, the magnitude and the time of shocks are recorded to ensure that delicate and expensive instruments are not mishandled or exposed to inappropriate environmental conditions during shipping. The shock indicator provides a visual indication whether the shock threshold has been reached or exceeded, e.g. in the form of a broken spring or a digital display.
The shock indicator was invented to ensure safe shipment of expensive goods and to hold the right people liable for damage. As with other inventions, it has undergone various stages of development. The earliest shock indicators were simple mechanical devices with a spring-load assembly. Newer ones come integrated with a complex set of electronic circuits that detect, measure and record shocks. Many companies make these indicators and conduct active research.
