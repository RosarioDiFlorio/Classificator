In a bending beam, a point is known as a point of contraflexure if it is a location at which no bending occurs. In a bending moment diagram, it is the point at which the bending moment curve intersects with the zero line. In other words where the bending moment changes its sign from negative to positive or vice versa. Knowing the place of the contraflexure is especially useful when designing reinforced concrete or structural steel beams and also for designing bridges.
Flexural reinforcement may be reduced at this point. However, to omit reinforcement at the point of contraflexure entirely is inadvisable as the actual location is unlikely to realistically be defined with confidence. Additionally, an adequate quantity of reinforcement should extend beyond the point of contraflexure to develop bond strength and to facilitate shear force transfer.
