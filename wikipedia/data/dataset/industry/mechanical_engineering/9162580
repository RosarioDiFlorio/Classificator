The archer's paradox is the phenomenon of an arrow traveling in the direction it is pointed at full draw, when it seems that the arrow would have to pass through the starting position it was in before being drawn, where it was pointed to the side of the target. The bending of the arrow when released is the explanation for why the paradox occurs and should not be confused with the paradox itself. Flexing of the arrow when shot from a modern 'centre shot' bow is still present and is caused by a variety of factors, mainly the way the string is deflected from the fingers as the arrow is released.
The term was first used by E.J. Rendtroff in 1913, and as understanding was gained about the arrow flexing out of the way of the bow as it is shot (as first filmed by Clarence Hickman) and then experiencing oscillating back-and-forth bending as it travels toward the target, this dynamic flexing has incorrectly become a common usage of the term, causing misunderstanding by those only familiar with modern target bows, which often have risers with an eccentrically cutout "arrow window" and being "centre shot" do not actually show any paradoxical behaviour as the arrow is always pointing visually along its line of flight.
