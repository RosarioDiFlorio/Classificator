Rheological weldability (RW) is proposed as a criterion to determine reliably weldability of thermoplastics. In a practical manner, RW of thermoplastics is assessed through their rheological properties: viscosity (η) and activation energy (Ea). According to RW criterion, the lower the viscosity (η) during welding process and the lower the absolute value of activation energy (|Ea|), the better the weldability.
