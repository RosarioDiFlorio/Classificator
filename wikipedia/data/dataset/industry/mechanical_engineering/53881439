Gait is a form of bipedal locomotion requiring the alternating action of the lower limbs, which results in the translation of the center of mass (COM) in space in a way that elicit smallest energy expenditure. A normal gait pattern depends on a range of biomechanical features, controlled by the nervous system for increased energy conservation and balance. These biomechanical features of normal gait have been defined as key determinants of gait. It is therefore necessary for the refined neurological control and integration of these gait features for accuracy and precision with less energy expenditure. As a result, any abnormality of the neuromusculoskeletal system may lead to abnormality in gait and increased energy expenditure.
