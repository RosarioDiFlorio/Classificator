A Performance-Based Road Asset Management and Maintenance Contract or PAMMC is one in which services are provided not on a unit basis (e.g. a fee per pothole filled in a road) but based on an agreed-upon standard that the contractor is to maintain (e.g. all potholes bigger than 75 mm x 100 mm must be filled within a certain length of time) in order to collect the full fee.
