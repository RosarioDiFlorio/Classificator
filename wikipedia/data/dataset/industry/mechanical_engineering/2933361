Quantum calculus, sometimes called calculus without limits, is equivalent to traditional infinitesimal calculus without the notion of limits. It defines "q-calculus" and "h-calculus", where h ostensibly stands for Planck's constant while q stands for quantum. The two parameters are related by the formula

  
    
      
        q
        =
        
          e
          
            i
            h
          
        
        =
        
          e
          
            2
            π
            i
            ℏ
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=e^{ih}=e^{2\pi i\hbar }\,}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          ℏ
          =
          
            
              h
              
                2
                π
              
            
          
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \hbar ={\frac {h}{2\pi }}\,}
   is the reduced Planck constant.
