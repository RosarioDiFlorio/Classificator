EN 50436 is a series of European Standards for Ignition interlock devices (Syn.: Alcohol interlock called).
An alcohol interlock consists basically of an instrument measuring breath alcohol and a vehicle immobilizer. The installation is possible in different types of vehicles like passenger cars, buses, transporters, motorcycles or trains. A breath sample has to be delivered to the alcohol interlock before the vehicle motor can be started or the vehicle can be moved. The alcohol interlock will prevent the driver to start the motor if he/she has an alcohol concentration above a predetermined limit value.
An alcohol interlock consists of two main components: the breath alcohol measuring instrument with the measuring system and a mouthpiece located in the interior of the vehicle, and the control unit normally installed under the dashboard and unblocking, resp. blocking the current supply to the starter relay of the vehicle.
There are several areas in which alcohol interlocks may be used:
installed in a vehicle as a general preventive measure for the promotion of traffic safety, on a voluntary base or legally required in certain vehicles (for example vehicles for children transport), or
in vehicles as ordered by a court or an administrative authority as part of a drink-driving offender programme, or
for persons subject to a medical or rehabilitation programme.
