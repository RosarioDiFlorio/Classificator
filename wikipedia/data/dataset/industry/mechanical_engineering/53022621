The Rayleigh's quotient represents a quick method to estimate the natural frequency of a multi-degree-of-freedom vibration system, in which the mass and the stiffness matrices are known.
The eigenvalue problem for a general system of the form

  
    
      
        M
        
        
          
            
              
                q
              
              ¨
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        +
        C
        
        
          
            
              
                q
              
              ˙
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        +
        K
        
        
          
            q
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          
            Q
          
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M\,{\ddot {\textbf {q}}}(t)+C\,{\dot {\textbf {q}}}(t)+K\,{\textbf {q}}(t)={\textbf {Q}}(t)}
  
in absence of damping and external forces reduces to

  
    
      
        M
        
        
          
            
              
                q
              
              ¨
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        +
        K
        
        
          
            q
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle M\,{\ddot {\textbf {q}}}(t)+K\,{\textbf {q}}(t)=0}
  
The previous equation can be written also as

  
    
      
        K
        
        
          
            u
          
        
        =
        λ
        
        M
        
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle K\,{\textbf {u}}=\lambda \,M\,{\textbf {u}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          ω
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\omega ^{2}}
  , in which 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   represents the natural frequency, M and K are the real positive symmetric mass and stiffness matrices respectively.
For an n-degree-of-freedom system the equation has n solutions 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{m}}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}}
   that satisfy the equation

  
    
      
        K
        
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          λ
          
            m
          
        
        
        M
        
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle K\,{\textbf {u}}_{m}=\lambda _{m}\,M\,{\textbf {u}}_{m}}
  
By multiplying both sides of the equation by 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}^{T}}
   and dividing by the scalar 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
          
            T
          
        
        
        M
        
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}^{T}\,M\,{\textbf {u}}_{m}}
  , it is possible to express the eigenvalue problem as follow:

  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          ω
          
            m
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    u
                  
                
                
                  m
                
                
                  T
                
              
              
              K
              
              
                
                  
                    u
                  
                
                
                  m
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                    u
                  
                
                
                  m
                
                
                  T
                
              
              
              M
              
              
                
                  
                    u

    {\displaystyle \lambda _{m}=\omega _{m}^{2}={\frac {{\textbf {u}}_{m}^{T}\,K\,{\textbf {u}}_{m}}{{\textbf {u}}_{m}^{T}\,M\,{\textbf {u}}_{m}}}}
  
for m = 1,2,3,...,n.
In the previous equation it is also possible to observe that the numerator is proportional to the potential energy while the denominator depicts a measure of the kinetic energy. Moreover, the equation allow us to calculate the natural frequency only if the eigenvector (as well as any other displacement vector) 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}}
   is known. For academic interests, if the modal vectors are not known, we can repeat the foregoing process but with 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          ω
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\omega ^{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}}
   taking the place of 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          ω
          
            m
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{m}=\omega _{m}^{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}}
  , respectively. By doing so we obtain the scalar 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        
          
            u
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R({\textbf {u}})}
  , also known as Rayleigh's quotient:

  
    
      
        R
        (
        
          
            u
          
        
        )
        =
        λ
        =
        
          ω
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    u
                  
                
                
                  T
                
              
              
              K
              
              
                
                  u
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                    u
                  
                
                
                  T
                
              
              
              M
              
              
                
                  u
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R({\textbf {u}})=\lambda =\omega ^{2}={\frac {{\textbf {u}}^{T}\,K\,{\textbf {u}}}{{\textbf {u}}^{T}\,M\,{\textbf {u}}}}}
  
Therefore, the Rayleigh's quotient is a scalar whose value depends on the vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}}
   and it can be calculated with good approximation for any arbitrary vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}}
   as long as it lays reasonably far from the modal vectors 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{i}}
  , i = 1,2,3,...,n.
Since, is it possible to state that the vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            u
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}}
   differs from the modal vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              u
            
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textbf {u}}_{m}}
   by a small quantity of first order, the correct result of the Rayleigh's quotient will differ not sensitively from the estimated one and that's what makes this method very useful. A good way to estimate the lowest modal vector 
  
    
      
        (
        
          u
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (u_{1})}
  , that generally works well for most structures (even though is not guaranteed), is to assume 
  
    
      
        (
        
          u
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (u_{1})}
   equal to the static displacement from an applied force that has the same relative distribution of the diagonal mass matrix terms. The latter can be elucidated by the following 3-DOF example.
