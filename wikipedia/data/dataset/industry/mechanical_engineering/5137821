Dry weight is the weight of a vehicle without any consumables, passengers, or cargo.
It is one of the two common weight measurements included in road vehicle specifications, the other one being curb weight.
By definition, dry weight does not include any of the following:
Gasoline, diesel or any other fuel
Engine oil
Coolant
Brake fluid
Power steering fluid
Transmission fluid
Washer fluid
The difference between dry weight and curb weight depends on many variables such as the capacity of the fuel tank.
Over time, most domestic vehicle manufacturers have more commonly used the term 'shipping weight', which refers to the vehicle in as-built, no-option condition. This would include engine oil, coolant, brake fluid and at least some small quantity of fuel, as vehicles have traditionally been driven off the assembly line and these fluids were necessary to do so.
