In quantum mechanics, an antisymmetrizer 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
   (also known as antisymmetrizing operator) is a linear operator that makes a wave function of N identical fermions antisymmetric under the exchange of the coordinates of any pair of fermions. After application of 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
   the wave function satisfies the Pauli principle. Since 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}}
   is a projection operator, application of the antisymmetrizer to a wave function that is already totally antisymmetric has no effect, acting as the identity operator.
