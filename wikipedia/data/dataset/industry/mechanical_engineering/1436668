In mathematics, Voigt notation or Voigt form in multilinear algebra is a way to represent a symmetric tensor by reducing its order. There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: Mandel notation, Mandel–Voigt notation and Nye notation are others found. Kelvin notation is a revival by Helbig of old ideas of Lord Kelvin. The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application.
For example, a 2×2 symmetric tensor X has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed as the vector

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            11
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            22
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            12
          
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x_{11},x_{22},x_{12}\rangle }
  .
As another example:
The stress tensor (in matrix notation) is given as

  
    
      
        
          σ
        
        =
