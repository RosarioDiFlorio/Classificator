The inverse square root potential is a three-parametric quantum-mechanical potential for which the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is exactly solvable in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is defined as:

  
    
      
        V
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          V
          
            c
          
        
        +
        
          
            V
            
              x
              −
              
                x
                
                  0
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V(x)=V_{c}+{\frac {V}{\sqrt {x-x_{0}}}}}
