Non-autonomous mechanics describe non-relativistic mechanical systems subject to time-dependent transformations. In particular, this is the case of mechanical systems whose Lagrangians and Hamiltonians depend on the time. The configuration space of non-autonomous mechanics is a fiber bundle 
  
    
      
        Q
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} }
   over the time axis 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   coordinated by 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        ,
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t,q^{i})}
  .
This bundle is trivial, but its different trivializations 
  
    
      
        Q
        =
        
          R
        
        ×
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q=\mathbb {R} \times M}
   correspond to the choice of different non-relativistic reference frames. Such a reference frame also is represented by a connection 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
   on 
  
    
      
        Q
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} }
   which takes a form 
  
    
      
        
          Γ
          
            i
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma ^{i}=0}
   with respect to this trivialization. The corresponding covariant differential 
  
    
      
        (
        
          q
          
            t
          
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          Γ
          
            i
          
        
        )
        
          ∂
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (q_{t}^{i}-\Gamma ^{i})\partial _{i}}
   determines the relative velocity with respect to a reference frame 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
  .
As a consequence, non-autonomous mechanics (in particular, non-autonomous Hamiltonian mechanics) can be formulated as a covariant classical field theory (in particular covariant Hamiltonian field theory) on 
  
    
      
        X
        =
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} }
  . Accordingly, the velocity phase space of non-autonomous mechanics is the jet manifold 
  
    
      
        
          J
          
            1
          
        
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle J^{1}Q}
   of 
  
    
      
        Q
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} }
   provided with the coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        ,
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          q
          
            t
          
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},q_{t}^{i})}
  . Its momentum phase space is the vertical cotangent bundle 
  
    
      
        V
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle VQ}
   of 
  
    
      
        Q
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q\to \mathbb {R} }
   coordinated by 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        ,
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},p_{i})}
   and endowed with the canonical Poisson structure. The dynamics of Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics is defined by a Hamiltonian form 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        d
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        −
        H
        (
        t
        ,
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        )
        d
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{i}dq^{i}-H(t,q^{i},p_{i})dt}
  .
One can associate to any Hamiltonian non-autonomous system an equivalent Hamiltonian autonomous system on the cotangent bundle 
  
    
      
        T
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle TQ}

        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q}
   coordinated by 
  
    
      
        (
        t
        ,
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        ,
        p
        ,
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (t,q^{i},p,p_{i})}
   and provided with the canonical symplectic form; its Hamiltonian is 
  
    
      
        p
        −
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle p-H}
