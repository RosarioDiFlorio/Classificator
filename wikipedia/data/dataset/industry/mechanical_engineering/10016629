IT Grade refers to the International Tolerance Grade of an industrial process defined in ISO 286. This grade identifies what tolerances a given process can produce for a given dimension.
The specific tolerance for a particular IT grade is calculated via the following formula:

  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          10
          
            0.2
            ×
            (
            I
            T
            G
            −
            1
            )
          
        
        ⋅
        (
        0.45
        ×
        
          
            D
            
              3
            
          
        
        +
        0.001
        ×
        D
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle T=10^{0.2\times (ITG-1)}\cdot (0.45\times {\sqrt[{3}]{D}}+0.001\times D)}
  
where:
T is the tolerance in micrometres [µm]
D is the geometric mean dimension in millimeters [mm]
ITG is the IT Grade, a positive integer.
One thinks of 
  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
   as being the key dimension on the part and 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   as being the required tolerance on that key dimension. The larger the ITG, the looser the tolerance.
