In quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, loop integrals are the integrals which appear when evaluating the Feynman diagrams with one or more loops by integrating over the internal momenta.
There are two standard techniques for evaluating loop integrals:
Feynman parametrization
Schwinger parametrization
