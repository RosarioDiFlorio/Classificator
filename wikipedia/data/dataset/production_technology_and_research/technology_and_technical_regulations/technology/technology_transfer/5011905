The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing research to life by supporting and enhancing the global academic technology transfer profession through education, professional development, partnering and advocacy.
The association was founded in 1974 as the Society of University Patent Administrators to help move research from the lab and into the marketplace for public use and benefit. The association's first meeting in 1974 had 75 participants.
