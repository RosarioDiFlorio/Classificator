Creative Partnerships was the UK government's flagship creative learning programme, established in 2002 as part of the Council's SR2000 settlement to develop young people's creativity through artists' engagement with schools in nominated areas across England. Following the 2010 election of the coalition government, funding was cut by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Arts Council England in 2011, with activity in schools ending in summer 2011.
