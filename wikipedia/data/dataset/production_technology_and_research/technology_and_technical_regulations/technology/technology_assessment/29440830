The CESG Listed Adviser Scheme was a programme run by CESG, to provide a pool of information assurance consultants to government departments and other public-sector bodies in the UK.
CLAS consultants advised on systems that handle protectively marked information, up to and including SECRET; for instance, they may have advised on GSI accreditation. CLAS consultants held a security clearance, at least SC.
CLAS consultants developed risk assessments in line with IS1, and risk management and accreditation document sets (RMADS) in line with IS2.
In 2011, entry to CLAS was closed while a replacement system was being designed.
By 2013 'new' CLAS was implemented and open for membership. 'New' CLAS required that members were CESG Certified Professionals.
CLAS was closed in January 2016.
