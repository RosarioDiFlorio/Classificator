Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system. In the United States, computer fraud is specifically proscribed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which criminalizes computer-related acts under federal jurisdiction. Types of computer fraud include:
Distributing hoax emails
Accessing unauthorized computers
Engaging in data mining via spyware and malware
Hacking into computer systems to illegally access personal information, such as credit cards or Social Security numbers
Sending computer viruses or worms with the intent to destroy or ruin another party's computer or system.
Phishing, social engineering, viruses, and DDoS attacks are fairly well-known tactics used to disrupt service or gain access to another's network, but this list is not inclusive.
