An artificial uterus (or artificial womb) is a hypothetical device that would allow for extracorporeal pregnancy or extrauterine fetal incubation (EUFI) by growing an embryo or fetus outside the body of an organism that would normally internally carry the embryo or fetus to term. To date, no artificial uterus or incubator has yet given rise to the birth of any organism.
An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, would have many applications. It could be used to assist male or female couples in the development of a fetus. This can potentially be performed as a switch from a natural uterus to an artificial uterus, thereby moving the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. In this sense, it can be regarded as a neonatal incubator with very extended functions. Also, it can potentially be used for initiation of fetal development. Furthermore, it could avail for performing, for example, fetal surgery procedures at an early stage instead of having to postpone them until term of pregnancy.
A study published in 2017 described a working system used to successfully allow lamb fetuses (simulating premature babies) to continue to develop normally.
