Bhāskara's wheel was invented in 1150 by Bhāskara II, an Indian mathematician, in an attempt to create a hypothetical perpetual motion machine. The wheel consisted of curved or tilted spokes partially filled with mercury. Once in motion, the mercury would flow from one side of the spoke to another, thus forcing the wheel to continue motion, in constant dynamic equilibrium.
