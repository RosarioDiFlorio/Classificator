Interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS), formerly known as the spectral reflectance imaging biosensor (SRIB), is a system that can be used as a biosensing platform capable of high-throughput multiplexing of protein–protein, protein–DNA, and DNA–DNA interactions without the use of any fluorescent labels. The sensing surface is prepared by robotic spotting of biological probes that are immobilized on functionalized Si/SiO2 substrates. IRIS is capable of quantifying biomolecular mass accumulated on the surface.
