Backup-to-disk refers to technology that allows one to back up large amounts of data to a disk storage unit. The backup-to-disk technology is often supplemented by tape drives for data archival or replication to another facility for disaster recovery. Additionally, backup-to-disk has several advantages over traditional tape backup for both technical and business reasons explained later in this article. With continued improvements in storage devices to provide faster access and higher storage capacity, a prime consideration for backup and restore operations, backup-to-disk will become more prominent in organizations.
