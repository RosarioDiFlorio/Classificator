The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3 was a proposed update to the U.S. government computer security standard used to accredit cryptographic modules. The title of the standard is Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and FIPS 140-2 remains the currently approved version. Efforts to update FIPS 140-2 date back to the early 2000s. The FIPS 140-3 (2013 Draft) was scheduled for signature by the Secretary of Commerce in August 2013, however that never happened and the draft was subsequently abandoned. In 2014, NIST released a substantially different draft of FIPS 140-3, this version effectively directing the use of an International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) standard, 19790:2012, as the replacement for FIPS 140-2. The 2014 draft of FIPS 140-3 was also abandoned. On August 12, 2015, NIST formally released a statement on the Federal Register asking for comments on the potential use of portions of ISO/IEC 19790:2014 in the update of FIPS 140-2. The reference to a 2014-version of ISO/IEC 19790 was an inadvertent error in the Federal Registry posting, as 2012 is the most recent version.
The update process for FIPS 140 has been hamstrung by deep technical issues in topics such as hardware security  and apparent disagreement in the US government over the path forward. The now abandoned 2013 draft of FIPS 140-3 had required mitigation of non-invasive attacks when validating at higher security levels, introduced the concept of public security parameter, allowed the deference of certain self-tests until specific conditions are met, and strengthened the requirements on user authentication and integrity testing. It remains unclear whether these issues will be addressed in the ultimately approved release of FIPS 140-3.
