The Nano electrokinetic thruster is a theoretical space propulsion system based on the principle of electro-osmosis (also electroosmotic flow). It allows for a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio as well as a high final velocity which makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to difficulties in the production of the needed carbon nanotubes experimental testing has not yet started.
