The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a method for using specific standards to enable the automated vulnerability management, measurement, and policy compliance evaluation of systems deployed in an organization, including e.g., FISMA compliance. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government content repository for SCAP.
