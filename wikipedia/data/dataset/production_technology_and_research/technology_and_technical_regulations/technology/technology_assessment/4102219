Cathleen Ann O'Brien (born December 4, 1957, Muskegon, Michigan) is an American author and speaker who claims to be a victim of a government mind control program called Project Monarch which she alleges was part of the CIA's Project MKULTRA. O'Brien made these assertions in Trance Formation of America (1995) and Access Denied: For Reasons of National Security (2004) which she co-authored with her husband Mark Phillips. According to scholars, there is no credible evidence for O'Brien's claims and there are numerous inconsistencies with her story.
