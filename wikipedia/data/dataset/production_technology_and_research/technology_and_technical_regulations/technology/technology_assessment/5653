British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated three adages that are known as Clarke's three laws, of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited:
 When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.
 The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
 Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
