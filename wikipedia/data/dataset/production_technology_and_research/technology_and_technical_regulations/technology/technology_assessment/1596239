Clinistrip, also known as CLINISTIX or the brand name Diastix, are specific clinical sticks for the detection of glucose only and no other sugar as they consist of a section that contains glucose oxidase that has been dried onto the paper pad. This is an example of a biosensor-based test for glucose. This is similar to the glucose oxidase assay as the glucose in the urine, once the stick has been dipped into the urine, is oxidised to yield gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme peroxidase is also present on the pad and it utilises the hydrogen peroxide produced to oxidise a colour dye that results in a colour change. The intensity of the colour change on the pad reflects the amount of glucose present in the urine.
