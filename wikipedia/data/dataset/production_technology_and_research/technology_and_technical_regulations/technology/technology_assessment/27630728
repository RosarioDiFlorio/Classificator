The Global Strategic Trends Programme was established in 2001 to research and understand potential trends that shape and inform the future strategic context. It is undertaken at the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) which is under the UK's Joint Forces Command and based in Shrivenham, Wiltshire.
One of the main findings of "Global Strategic Trends out to 2040" is that the era out to 2040 will be a time of transition, characterised by instability both in the relations between states, and in the relations between groups within states. During this timeframe significant global trends will include; climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, a resurgence in ideology and a shift in global power from West to East. The struggle to establish an effective system of global governance, is likely to be a central theme of the era.
