Candy Jones, originally known as Jessica Arline Wilcox (December 31, 1925 â€“ January 18, 1990), was an American fashion model, writer and radio talk show hostess.
Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, she was raised and educated in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
In the 1940s and 1950s, she was a leading model and pin-up girl, and afterward, established a modeling school and wrote several books on modeling and fashion. In 1972, Jones married the popular radio show host Long John Nebel (he was her second husband), and became the co-host of his all-night talk-show on WMCA in New York City. The show dealt with paranormal, UFO, and conspiracy theory claims.
Jones controversially claimed to be a victim of Project MKULTRA, the CIA mind-control program, in the 1960s.
