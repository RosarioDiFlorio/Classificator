The CESG Claims Tested Mark (abbreviated as CCT Mark or CCTM), formerly CSIA Claims Tested Mark, is a UK Government Standard for computer security.
The CCT Mark is based upon framework where vendors can make claims about the security attributes of their products and/or services, and independent testing laboratories can evaluate the products/services to determine if they actually meet the claims. In other words, the CCT Mark provides quality assurance approach to validate whether the implementation of a computer security product or services has been performed in an appropriate manner.
