MicroVacuum Ltd. is a Hungarian high-tech company based in Budapest. MicroVacuum is a global supplier of label-free biosensor systems for the life-science research market to provide rapid, real-time, label free detection and characterization of surface adsorption, binding of molecules.
MicroVacuum develops, manufactures and markets the OWLS label-free, real-time biosensor system based on the grating coupler waveguide technology. The OW optical sensors and OWLS analytical system allow the determination of the affinity and kinetics of a wide variety of molecular interactions in real time, without the need for a molecular tag or label.
Applications include protein quantification, classification of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, drug screening, immunosensing and many more. MicroVacuum has customers all over the world including prominent universities in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia.
The main biosensing applications of the OWLS technology are as follows:
Adsorption of proteins at surfaces
Immunosensing
Drug screening
Ligand / receptor binding
Kinetics of adhesion, growth and spreading of living cells
Protein - lipid bilayer interactions
Protein - DNA interactions
Molecular self-assembly & nanoscience
Analysis of association and dissociation kinetics
