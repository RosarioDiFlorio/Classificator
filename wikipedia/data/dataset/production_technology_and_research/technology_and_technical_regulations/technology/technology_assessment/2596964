NDMP, or Network Data Management Protocol, is a protocol meant to transport data between network attached storage (NAS) devices and backup devices. This removes the need for transporting the data through the backup server itself, thus enhancing speed and removing load from the backup server. It was originally invented by the NetApp and PDC, acquired by Legato and then EMC Corporation. Currently, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) oversees the development of the protocol.
Most contemporary multi-platform backup software support this protocol, including:
Bacula
Bareos
Amanda
Arcserve
EMC NetWorker
EMC Avamar
Veritas NetBackup
Backup Exec (since v11d)
Commvault
Virtos S.O.S Backup,
IBM Tivoli Storage Manager
Hitachi Data Systems (HDS)
Quest Software NetVault Backup
Catalogic DPX
Zmanda
HP Data Protector
Unitrends and others support this protocol.
