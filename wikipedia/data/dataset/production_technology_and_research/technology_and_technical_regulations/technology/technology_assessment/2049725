Astrogation (a portmanteau of astronomical navigation), is the fictional navigation of spacecraft in interplanetary or interstellar travel. The term was first used by science fiction writers in the first half of the 20th century. An early usage is in the 1953 Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starman Jones.
