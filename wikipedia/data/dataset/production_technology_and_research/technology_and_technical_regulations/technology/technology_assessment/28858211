INR self-monitoring is used by patients on long-term and on lifetime anti-coagulation therapy to measure their INR (International Normalized Ratio) levels themselves, rather than at a clinic. People who self-monitor their INR levels use a portable INR monitor, as in a clinic, to take and test a drop of blood, drawn from a finger at scheduled times, and record the INR level measured by the monitor; moreover, the patient can either self-test or self-manage.
