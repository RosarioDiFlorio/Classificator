Relativistic rocket refers to any spacecraft that travels at a velocity close enough to light speed for relativistic effects to become significant. The meaning of "significant" is a matter of context, but generally speaking a velocity of at least 50% of the speed of light (0.5c) is required. The Lorentz factor - also known as the "gamma" factor, γ, and present in the equations for time dilation, relativistic mass, and length contraction - is equal to 1.15 at 0.5c. Above this speed special relativity is required to accurately describe motion, whereas below this speed sufficient accuracy is provided by Newtonian physics and the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.
In this context, a rocket is defined as an object carrying all of its reaction mass, energy, and engines with it.
Achieving relativistic velocities is difficult, requiring advanced forms of spacecraft propulsion that have not yet been adequately developed. Nuclear pulse propulsion could theoretically achieve 0.1c using current known technologies, but would still require many engineering advances to achieve this. The relativistic gamma factor (

  ) at 10% of light velocity is 1.005. The time dilation factor of 1.005 which occurs at 10% of light velocity is too small to be of major significance. A 0.1c velocity interstellar rocket is thus considered to be a non-relativistic rocket because its motion is quite accurately described by Newtonian physics alone.
Relativistic rockets are usually seen discussed in the context of interstellar travel, since most would require a great deal of space to accelerate up to those velocities. They are also found in some thought experiments such as the twin paradox.
