Stefan Marinov (Bulgarian: Стефан Маринов) (1 February 1931 – 15 July 1997) was a Bulgarian physicist, researcher, writer and lecturer who promoted anti-relativistic theoretical viewpoints, and later in his life defended the ideas of perpetual motion and free energy. In 1997 he self-published experimental results that confirmed classical electromagnetism and disproved that a machine constructed by Marinov himself could be a source of perpetual motion. Devastated by the negative results, he committed suicide in Graz, Austria on 15 July 1997.
