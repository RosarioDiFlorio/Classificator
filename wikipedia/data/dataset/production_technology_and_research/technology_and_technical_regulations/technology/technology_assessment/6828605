The Woodward effect, also referred to as a Mach effect, is part of a hypothesis proposed by James F. Woodward in 1990. The hypothesis states that transient mass fluctuations arise in any object that absorbs internal energy while undergoing a proper acceleration. Harnessing this effect could generate a reactionless thrust, which Woodward and others claim to measure in various experiments.
If proven to exist, the Woodward effect would be revolutionary, allowing field propulsion spacecraft engines that would not have to expel matter. Such an engine, sometimes called a Mach effect thruster (MET) or a Mach Effect Gravitational Assist (MEGA) drive, would be a breakthrough in space travel.  So far, no proof of the existence of this effect has been presented. Experiments to confirm and utilize this effect by Woodward and others continue. The anomalous thrust detected in some RF resonant cavity thruster (EmDrive/Cannae drive) experiments may be explained by the same type of Mach effect proposed by Woodward.
The Space Studies Institute was selected as part of NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts program as a Phase I proposal in April 2017 for Mach Effect research.
