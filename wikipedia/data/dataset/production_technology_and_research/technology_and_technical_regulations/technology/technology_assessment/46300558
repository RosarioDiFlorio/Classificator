Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) is a single page, standardized report for interpreting a patient's daily glucose and insulin patterns. AGP provides both graphic and quantitative characterizations of daily glucose patterns. First developed by Drs. Roger Mazze and David Rodbard, with colleagues at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1987, AGP was initially used for representation of episodic self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The first version included a glucose median and inter-quartile ranges graphed as a 24 hour day. Dr. Mazze brought the original AGP to the International Diabetes Center (IDC) in the late 1980's and since that time, IDC has built the AGP into the internationally recognized standard for glucose pattern reporting .
