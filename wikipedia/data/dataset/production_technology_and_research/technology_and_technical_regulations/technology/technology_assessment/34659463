D/CAS (Data/CASsette): An obsolete data backup technology that uses an upgraded version of the common audio tape cassette. It can hold as much as 0.6GB of data. It is closely related to ArVid technology. Unlike QIC, Travan and DAT it does not require a specialized Tape drive. It was superseded by the DDS data format stored on digital audio tape.
