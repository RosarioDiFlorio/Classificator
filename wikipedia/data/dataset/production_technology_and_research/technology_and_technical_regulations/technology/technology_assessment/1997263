Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity refers to an organizationâ€™s ability to recover from a disaster and/or unexpected event and resume operations. Organizations often have a plan in place (usually referred to as a "Disaster Recovery Plan" or "Business Continuity Plan") that outlines how a recovery will be accomplished. The key to successful disaster recovery is to have a plan (emergency plan, disaster recovery plan, continuity plan) well before disaster ever strikes. Often used together, the terms Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery are very different. Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, where as Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and data-centric functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity.
Given ever-changing business objectives, one common need in disaster recovery is to perform an audit of the disaster recovery capacity of an organization. The purpose of such audit is to discover how closely an organization's disaster recovery readiness aligns to actual organizational objectives. When conducting an audit of a disaster recovery plan, factors such as alternate site designation, training of personnel, and insurance issues are considered. In conducting a disaster recovery audit, the individual or team performing the audit uses a number of procedures and processes to achieve the objectives of the audit. Successful disaster recovery audits clear state their objectives in an audit plan.
