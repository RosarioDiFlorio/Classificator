Joseph Westley Newman (July 2, 1936 â€“ March 6, 2015) was an American inventor and author who claimed to have developed a perpetual motion machine. This device greatly influenced the "free energy movement" in America from the late nineteen seventies until his death in 2015. He described this device in a book, The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman. Newman alleged that he had a mechanical explanation for Albert Einstein's unified field theory of physics. After applying for patents on the perpetual motion motor, he battled for over seven years against what he claimed was a government conspiracy to suppress his supposed discoveries. As a result of this, he gained national attention.
