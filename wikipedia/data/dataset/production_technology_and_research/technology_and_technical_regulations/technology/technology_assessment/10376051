IT Service Continuity is a subset of Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and encompasses IT disaster recovery planning and wider IT resilience planning. It also incorporates those elements of IT infrastructure and services which relate to communications such as (voice)telephony and data communications.
It is a systematic process to prevent, predict and manage Information and Communications Technology (ICT) disruption and incidents which have the potential to disrupt ICT services and should result in a more resilient IT service capability aligned to wider organisational requirements.
