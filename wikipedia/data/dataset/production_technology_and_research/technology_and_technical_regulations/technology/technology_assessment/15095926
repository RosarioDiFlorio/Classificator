A web presence is a location on the World Wide Web where a person, business, or some other entity is represented (see also web property and point of presence).
Examples of a web presence for a person could be a personal website, a blog, a profile page, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g. a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook account, or a Twitter account). Examples of a web presence for a business or some other entity could be a corporate website, a microsite, a page on a review site, a wiki page, or a social media point of presence (e.g., a LinkedIn company page and/or group, a Facebook business/brand/product page, or a Twitter account).
Every web presence is associated with a unique web address to distinguish one point of presence from another.
