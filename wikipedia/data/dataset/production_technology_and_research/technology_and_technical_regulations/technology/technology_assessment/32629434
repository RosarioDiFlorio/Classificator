The Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense is a publication of best practice guidelines for computer security. The project was initiated early in 2008 as a response to extreme data losses experienced by organizations in the US defense industrial base and recently. The publication was initially developed by the SANS Institute, ownership was transferred to the Council on Cyber Security (CCS) in 2013 and then transferred to Center for Internet Security (CIS) in 2015. It was earlier known as the Consensus Audit Guidelines and it is also known as the CIS CSC, CIS 20, CCS CSC, SANS Top 20 or CAG 20.
