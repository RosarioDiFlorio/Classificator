A biointerface is the region of contact between a biomolecule, cell, biological tissue or living organism or organic material considered living with another biomaterial or inorganic/organic material. The motivation for biointerface science stems from the urgent need to increase the understanding of interactions between biomolecules and surfaces. The behavior of complex macromolecular systems at materials interfaces are important in the fields of biology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and medicine. Biointerface science is a multidisciplinary field in which (bio)chemists who synthesize novel classes of biomolecules (PNA, peptidomimetics, aptamers, ribozymes, and engineered proteins) cooperate with scientists who have developed the tools to position biomolecules with molecular precision (proximal probe methods, nano-and micro contact methods, e-beam and X-ray lithography, and bottom up self-assembly methods), scientists who have developed new spectroscopic techniques to interrogate these molecules at the solid-liquid interface, and people who integrate these into functional devices (applied physicists, analytical chemists and bioengineers).
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Neural interfaces
Cells in engineered microenvironments and regenerative medicine
Computational and modeling approaches to biointerfaces
Membranes and membrane-based biosensing
Peptides, carbohydrates and DNA at biointerfaces
Pathogenesis and pathogen detection
Molecularly designed interfaces
Nanotube/nanoparticle interfaces
Related fields for biointerfaces are biomineralization, biosensors, medical implants, and so forth.
