Wireless ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) is a type of ambulatory electrocardiography with recording devices that use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth and smartphones, for at-home cardiac monitoring (monitoring of heart rhythms). These devices are generally recommended to people who have been previously diagnosed with arrhythmias and want to have them monitored, or for those who have suspected arrhythmias and need to be monitored over an extended period of time in order to be diagnosed. Wireless Ambulatory ECGs work in a way similar to a regular ECG by measuring the electrical potential of the heart through the skin. The data is saved on an application on a Smart Phone, and then uploaded to a computer through Bluetooth or Cloud technologies. The information can also be sent through these technologies or through email to a doctor or cardiac technician. Wireless Ambulatory ECGs are able to provide voice alarm messages when cardiac abnormalities occur, such as bradycardia, and can record this information and provide a screen prompt for the patient to view the data. The devices can also store mass amounts of ECG data on the phone, replay the ECG readings at a high speed, and have a low voltage alarm function to not waste the battery life. These characteristics of the devices are seen as benefits in comparison to current ambulatory ECG monitoring equipment such as the Holter monitor.
