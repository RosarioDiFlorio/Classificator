Service 4.0 is a collective term for technologies and concepts of service and support function organizations, based on new disruptive technological concepts (big data, mobility), the Internet of Things and the Internet of Services. It is a similar concept to industry 4.0, applied to value chain. The proponents of Service 4.0 claim that it is a major opportunity for service companies to make a leap forward in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, and an opportunity for service users to discover and benefit from new features, impossible to be delivered before this disruption.
There is not much literature about Service 4.0.
