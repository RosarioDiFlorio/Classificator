A radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity thruster, also known as an EmDrive, is a controversial proposed type of electromagnetic thruster with a microwave cavity, designed to produce thrust from an electromagnetic field inside the cavity. Skeptics have deemed it to be impossible.
Such thrusters have been hypothesized since 2001 when British engineer Roger Shawyer published details of the concept. To date, there is no theoretical consensus as to how a resonant cavity could produce such thrust. As of 2017, a few tests of prototype drives have observed a small apparent thrust, while other prototypes did not show thrust, and no prototype has been successfully tested more than once. Due to apparent discrepancies with the laws of physics as they are currently understood and lack of reproducible evidence, many theoretical physicists and commentators have been led to label the device "impossible", explaining the observed thrust by measurement errors. The arising scepticism has led many media platforms to refer to the engine as the Impossible Drive or the Impossible Space Drive.
