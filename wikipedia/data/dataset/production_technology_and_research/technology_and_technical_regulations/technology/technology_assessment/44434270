A photonic laser thruster (PLT) is an amplified photonic propulsion thruster for space propulsion that works on the principle of a photon-pushed sail, generating thrust directly from the momentum of a photon from a laser reflected from a mirror. The thruster, invented by Young Bae differs from other solar sail and laser propulsion thrusters in that an amplification process is used, in which the incident beam is re-used by being reflected by a stationary mirror, with an amplification stage at each reflection.  Because of the recycling of energy, the photonic laser thruster has been demonstrated to be more energy efficient than other laser-pushed sail concepts.
The near-term usage of the photonic laser thruster the earth-orbit applications include propellant-free and thrust-plume-contamination-free spacecraft maneuvering for precision formation flying, large optical and RF synthetic aperture construction, and stationkeeping. The usage of the photonic laser thruster for main space propulsion would require scaling-up of the laser power and controlling laser diffraction over interplanetary and interstellar distances. Photonic laser thrusters have a very high specific impulse, and can permit spacecraft to reach much higher speeds that approach a fraction of the light speed, unlike conventional rockets, which are limited by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.
