The nano-tetherball sensor is one of newly discovered methods in detecting glucose in the human body. The nano-tetherball sensor for glucose has attracted attention of diabetic medical community due to its methods and high sensitivity in performance. The machineâ€™s name comes from the fact that its design is similar to a small cube-shaped tetherball. Nano machines have been in the biosensor industry for more than two decades, and they have performed a number of different beneficial roles for diabetic patients. Despite the many opto/electronic mechanisms on the market, from a physical and chemical point of view, the nanomachine optical fiber provides many advantages over the other types.
These advantages include its remote in-situ or actual detection; its wavelength has the highest degree of selectivity, with high information competence and analysis with multi-channels of wide capacity for detecting reagents that are non-responsive in electrical structures. The cubes rely on the tetherball structure and involve manipulation of tiny amounts of lasers in micro-channel using Nano-tetherballs. The Nano-tetherball process has the potential of being the most reliable in the accumulation of information. Medical statements that emphasize how the machine compares with other digital data storage and retrieval processes, to determine exactly how effective the machine is with processing the data detected and how to use said data. The information collected will be helpful for the formulation of treatments which are more practical than other digital bio-optical machines provide.
