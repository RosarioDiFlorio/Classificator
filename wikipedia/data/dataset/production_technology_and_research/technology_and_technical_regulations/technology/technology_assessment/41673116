Catlateral Damage is a first person video game in which the player plays as a cat. The only goal of the game is to knock as many of your owner's belongings onto the floor as possible. There are game modes in which the player can either race against the clock and get a certain number of items onto the floor as fast as they can, score as many points in a 2-minute time-frame, or a free play mode where there is no clock and there are no points.
