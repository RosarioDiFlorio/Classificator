"Domain-based security", abbreviated to "DBSy", is a model-based approach to help analyse information security risks in a business context and provide a clear and direct mapping between the risks and the security controls needed to manage them. A variant of the approach is used by the UK government's HMG Infosec Standard No.1 technical risk-assessment method. DBSy is a registered trade mark of QinetiQ Ltd.
DBSy was developed in the late 1990s by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). It is a model-based approach to information assurance that describes the requirements for security in an organisation, taking account of the business that needs to be supported. The model is based around the concept of a security domain, which represents a logical place where people work with information using a computer system, and which has connections with other security domains where this is necessary to support business activity. Hence the focus is on the information that needs protection, the people that work with it and the people they exchange information with. The model can also describe the physical environments where people work and the system boundaries where major system security measures are placed. A systematic method is then applied to the model to identify and describe the risks to which valuable information assets are exposed and specify security measures that are effective in managing the risks.
