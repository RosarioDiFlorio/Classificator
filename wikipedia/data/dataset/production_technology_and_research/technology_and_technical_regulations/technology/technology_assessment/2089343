EcoQuest is a series of two educational adventure games developed by Sierra On-Line. The original concept was developed by Sierra VP of Creative Development, Bill Davis. The authors of the series game design are Jane Jensen and Gano Haine, but Jane was not involved in creating the second game, having moved on to the Gabriel Knight series.
The last of Sierra's various "Quest" series, EcoQuest is designed to teach about the importance of environmental ethics. The games are considerably easier than most Sierra adventures and cannot be lost or rendered unwinnable. Both use a fully mouse-driven version of SCI, in the manner of Space Quest IV and King's Quest VI.
The protagonist is a 10-year-old boy named Adam Greene: the son of an ecologist, and an expert scuba diver.
