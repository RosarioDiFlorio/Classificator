The word destabilisation can be applied to a wide variety of contexts such as attempts to undermine political, military or economic power. In a psychological context it is used as a technique in brainwashing and abuse to disorient and disarm the victim. For example, in the context of workplace bullying, destabilisation applied to the victim may involve:
failure to acknowledge good work and value the victim's efforts
allocation of meaningless tasks
removal of areas of responsibility without consultation
repeated reminders of blunders
setting up to fail
shifting of goal posts without telling the victim
persistent attempts to demoralise the victim.
