Lion is an animal simulation game where the player plays the role of a lion. It is a follow-up to Wolf.
The gameplay is divided into two parts. The first is a sandbox simulation mode, where the player has no predetermined goal. The second is a scenario mode, where the player has to complete specific actions; this is comparable to quests given in RPGs.
As in the original, the player takes on the role of a lion chosen from a pool of 20 different animals, with varying attributes, in existing prides or handpicked groups made by the player. The player can control a single animal or all members of a pride.
Unlike Wolf, which takes place in three different locales, Lion is played only on the savannas and plains of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (though in four different seasons).
Also includes a "Lion Safari", an interactive tour of the leoline life on the Serengeti.
