An exocortex is a hypothetical artificial external information processing system that would augment a brain's biological high-level cognitive processes.
An individual's exocortex would be composed of external memory modules, processors, IO devices and software systems that would interact with, and augment, a person's biological brain. Typically this interaction is described as being conducted through a direct brainâ€“computer interface, making these extensions functionally part of the individual's mind.
Individuals with significant exocortices could be classified as cyborgs or posthumans.
