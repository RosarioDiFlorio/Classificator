Teracom, inspired by earlier research, introduced a new system concept dubbed "WiB", that aims to improve frequency reuse in the UHF band while at the same time enable savings in both operating power and capital expenditures costs.
Simulation results hint at an attainable spectral efficiency of at least 1.37-1.6bit/s/Hz and a capacity increase in the range of 37-60%, while outlining possibilities for further optimizations.
The concept also hints at possible methods of convergence and coexistence with future 5G mobile communication technologies, although this was not the main focus of the proposal.
