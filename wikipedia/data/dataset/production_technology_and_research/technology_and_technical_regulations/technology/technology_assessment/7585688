SHARE originally defined seven tiers of disaster recovery to help identify various methods of recovering mission-critical computer-systems as required to support business continuity. IBM also aided in the development of the model.
Although the original published concept dates back to the 1990s, specialists in business continuity planning (BCP) and in disaster recovery as of 2015 continue to use the seven tiers to illustrate continuity capabilities and costs at a very high level. The definitions for the various tiers have been updated as technology has evolved in support of business requirements and their associated Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
