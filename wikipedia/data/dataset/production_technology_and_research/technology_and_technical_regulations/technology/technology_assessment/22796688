In information technology, real-time recovery is the ability to recover a piece of IT infrastructure such as a server from an infrastructure failure or human-induced error in a time frame that has minimal impact on business operations. Real-time recovery focuses on the most appropriate technology for restores, thus reducing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) to minutes, Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) to within 15 minutes ago, and minimizing Test Recovery Objectives (TRO), which is the ability to test and validate backups have occurred correctly without impacting production systems.
Real-Time Recovery is a new market segment in the backup, recovery and disaster recovery market that addresses the challenges companies that have historically faced with regards to protecting, and more importantly, recovering their data.
