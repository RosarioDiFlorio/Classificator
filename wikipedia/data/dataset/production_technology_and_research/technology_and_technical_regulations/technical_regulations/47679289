Exposed.su was a website focused on the listing of personal information of celebrities and other high-profile figures.
The credit history information appears to have been obtained through the hacking of 3 US credit history databases, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, possibly by hackers based in a former Soviet Union country.
In April 2013 Brian Krebs linked his swatting incident to the coverage of this site.
The site was shut down on March 2013 before jumping to other domains and has since been mirrored on the Dark Web.
