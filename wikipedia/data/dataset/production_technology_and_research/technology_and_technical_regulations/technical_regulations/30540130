Comodo Dragon is a freeware web browser. It is based on Chromium and is produced by Comodo Group. Sporting a similar interface to Google Chrome, Dragon does not implement Chrome's user tracking and some other potentially privacy-compromising features, substituting them for its own user tracking implementations, and provides additional security measures, such as indicating the authenticity and relative strength of a website's SSL certificate.
