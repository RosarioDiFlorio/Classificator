In Chile, net neutrality is regulated by the Law Nº 20.453, known as the Chilean net neutrality law, issued on August 18, 2010, becoming the first country in the world to enact a law referred to the net neutrality principle.
The law modified the General Law of Telecommunications, adding three articles —24 H, 24 I and 24 J— that establish rights for the Internet users and obligations for Internet service providers, in addition to give powers to enforce this law to the Telecommunications Undersecretary (Subtel).
