Groklaw was a website that covered legal news of interest to the free and open source software community. Started as a law blog on May 16, 2003 by paralegal Pamela Jones ("PJ"), it covered issues such as the SCO-Linux lawsuits, the EU anti-trust case against Microsoft, and the standardization of Office Open XML.
Jones described Groklaw as ..."a place where lawyers and geeks could explain things to each other and work together, so they'd understand each other's work better." 
Its name derives from "grok", roughly meaning "to understand completely", which had previously entered geek slang.
Other topics covered included software patents, DMCA, the actions of the RIAA against alleged illegal file sharers, and actions against free and open software such as Android and Linux. Almost every article also attracted an "Off Topic" thread, where a diverse range of topics was discussed.
