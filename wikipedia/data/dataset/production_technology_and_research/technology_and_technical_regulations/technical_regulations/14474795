The Community Broadband Act S. 1853 was a bill (proposed law) that was never enacted into legislation by the U.S. Senate,110th Congress The act was intended to promote affordable broadband access by allowing municipal governments to provide telecommunications capability and services.  Supporters of the bill believed it would have encouraged widespread broadband development in the United States by overturning existing state bans on public broadband deployments and eliminating existing barriers to broadband development.
Acquiring municipal broadband for some communities is problematic because the laws of certain states prohibit local municipalities from installing their own broadband networks and private sector companies are unable to provide the electric services needed for broadband. As a result, many rural and remote communities are left with without broadband services. Some municipalities may find broadband service, but it may be limited to already available commercial options, which may fall short of community need.
