United States v. Nathaniel Solon was a lawsuit where Nathaniel Solon, a Casper citizen, was convicted for possession of child pornography. The case became known in the media by irregularities in the process, and suspicions (affirmed by the defendant) that the material was introduced by malware on the computer. There were other people accused of similar crimes, who were later acquitted, but Solon was never exonerated.
