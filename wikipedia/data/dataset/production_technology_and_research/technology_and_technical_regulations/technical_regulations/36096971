Bestgore.com is a Canadian shock site owned by Mark Marek, which provides highly violent real-life news, photos and videos, with authored opinion and user comments. The site received media attention in 2012, following the hosting of a video which showed a real-life murder being committed by Luka Magnotta. As a result, Marek was arrested and charged under Canada's obscenity law with corrupting public morals.
