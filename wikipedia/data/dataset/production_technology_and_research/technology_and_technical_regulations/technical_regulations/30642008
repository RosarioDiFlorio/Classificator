Censorship of Twitter occurs in many countries and is approved of and supported by Twitter. On processing a successful complaint from "government officials, companies or another outside party" about an illegal "tweet", Twitter will notify users from that country that they may not see it. In other cases the authorities may take unilateral action to block the site.
Access to Twitter is currently blocked in North Korea, China, and Iran.
