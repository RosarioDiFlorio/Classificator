Gates Rubber Company v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd., et al. is a decision by the U.S. district court for the District of Colorado from May 1, 1996. It is to be considered a landmark decision in terms of expert witness court testimony in questions of electronic evidence and digital forensics.
In a nutshell, the decision states that the authenticity of electronic evidence is accepted by courts only, if the party adducing the evidence complied with the newest technical standards of electronic evidence acquisition. Moreover, U.S. magistrate judge Schlatter commented on the factors he considered relevant in the process of weighing the qualifications of digital forensics experts when those present contrary opinions or conclusions to the court. Hence, Gates v Bando has set legal standards for examining electronic evidence that have remained relevant to this day.
