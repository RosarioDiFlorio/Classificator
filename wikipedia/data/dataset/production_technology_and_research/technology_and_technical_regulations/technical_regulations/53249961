Fileless malware is a variant of computer related malicious software that exists exclusively as a computer memory-based artifact i.e. in RAM. It is part of the family that has been defined as an Advanced Volatile Threat (AVT).
It does not write any part of its activity to the computer's hard drive meaning that it's very resistant to existing Anti-computer forensics strategies that incorporate file-based whitelisting, signature detection, hardware verification, pattern-analysis, time-stamping, etc., and leaves very little by way of evidence that could be used by digital forensic investigators to identify illegitimate activity.
As malware of this type is designed to work in-memory, its longevity on the system exists only until the system is rebooted. For this reason, the malware plants registry entries to aid it in its ongoing attacks by setting scripts to run even after a system has been restarted.
