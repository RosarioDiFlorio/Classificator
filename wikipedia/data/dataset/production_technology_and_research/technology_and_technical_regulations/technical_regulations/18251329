Kwangmyong (Chosŏn'gŭl: 광명; Hancha: 光明; English: Light) is a North Korean "walled garden" national intranet service opened in 2000. It may be accessed by web browsers, incorporates email services, news groups, and an internal web search engine. The network uses its own DNS service to use domain names that are not used on the global Internet. Sites are accessible by either a URL or an IP address.
Only a small number of government officials and tourists are allowed to use the global Internet, making Kwangmyong the only computer network available to most North Korean citizens. It is a free service for public use.
