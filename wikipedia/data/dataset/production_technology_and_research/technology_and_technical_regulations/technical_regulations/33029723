Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. 91 (2011), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the patent-in-reexamination is still valid without any exceptions under 35 USC 282, even if the suggested material is not considered in the process of patent application. To reverse the presumption of validity, the plaintiff should show clear and convincing evidence.
