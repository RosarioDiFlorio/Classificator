A cybersecurity regulation comprises directives that safeguard information technology and computer systems with the purpose of forcing companies and organizations to protect their systems and information from cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, phishing, denial of service (DOS) attacks, unauthorized access (stealing intellectual property or confidential information) and control system attacks.[1] There are numerous measures available to prevent cyber-attacks. Cyber-security measures include firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption and login passwords.[2] There have been attempts to improve cybersecurity through regulation and collaborative efforts between government and the private-sector to encourage voluntary improvements to cybersecurity. Industry regulators including banking regulators have taken notice of the risk from cybersecurity and have either begun or are planning to begin to include cybersecurity as an aspect of regulatory examinations.
