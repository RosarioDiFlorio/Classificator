The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) is a new United States federal government agency that will be a fusion center between existing agencies and the private sector for real-time use against cyber attacks. CTIIC was created due to blocked efforts in Congress that were stymied over liability and privacy concerns of citizens.
CTIIC was formally announced by Lisa Monaco February 10, 2015 at the Wilson Center. The agency will be within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
