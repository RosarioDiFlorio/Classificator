NetShade is an app for Mac OS X and iOS which provides access to anonymous proxy and VPN servers. These servers include public HTTP/HTTPS proxies, as well as Rayner Software's own subscription-based proxies. NetShade's VPN servers run IPSec, and the proxy servers act using the HTTP/HTTPS web proxy standard.
