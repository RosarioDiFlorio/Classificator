This is a list of articles about terms of service and privacy policies. These are also called terms of use, and are rules one must agree to, in order to use a service. The articles fall in two main categories: descriptions of terms used for specific companies or products, and descriptions of different kinds of terms in general. Articles on companies vary widely in the amount of detail they give on terms of service. Annotations show what is available in the article on each company, and need to be updated as those articles are improved.
Terms of service are regularly the subject of news articles throughout the English-language press, such as in the US, UK, Africa, India, Singapore, and Australia. Terms of service are also addressed in a widely-reviewed documentary, academic research, and legal research.
