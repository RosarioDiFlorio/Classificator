LokiTorrent was a BitTorrent indexing service operated by Edward Webber ("Lowkee") from 2004 until 2005. The domain name was originally registered on 24 February 2004.
In the beginning, LokiTorrent had been one of the least trafficked torrent sites, with operations like Suprnova.org leading the pack at the time. However, LokiTorrent gained international attention when it refused to comply with cease and desist orders sent out on 14 December 2004 by the MPAA. These same orders had caused dozens of other much larger sites, including SuprNova, to disappear overnight.
Webber began a drive to raise money to fight the MPAA in court, and over a couple of months, had accrued in excess of $40,000 in sheer member donations. The site peaked at 680,000 active registered members, and dealt with 1.8 million hits per day.
