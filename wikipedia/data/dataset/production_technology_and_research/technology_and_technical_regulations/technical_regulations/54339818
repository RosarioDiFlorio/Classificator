As of June 2017, the government in Egypt has blocked more than 60 websites, 48 of which are online news websites according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression.
Blocked sites are websites of opposition satellite channels that broadcast from outside Egypt, newspapers, online publishing platform, websites of political and youth groups,VPN and online proxy websites.
The government accuses those website of supporting "terrorism and extremism" and spreading fake news, which is usually done by the government to silence opposition without offering any evidence about those acquisitions.
The censorship was enforced by all internet service providers in Egypt, including Te-data, Etisalat and Vodafone.
