CONTU, or the Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, was established in 1974 by United States Congress to study issues associated with copyrighted works in computers and computer-related works. It has been argued that the Commission erred in recommending the extension of copyright to machine-readable computer programs, because of the utility rule.
CONTU is not to be confused with CONFU, a 1997 "conference on fair use" organized by Bruce Lehman, then Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.
