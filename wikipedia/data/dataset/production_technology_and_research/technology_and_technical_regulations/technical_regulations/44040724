Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp v. iCraveTV (2000 WL 255989 W.D.Pa.) was a court case in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania which enjoined iCraveTV, a Canadian TV streaming website, from operating within the US after finding it in violation of 20th Century Fox's, and several other motion picture studios and television networks, copyrights and trademarks. Granted January 1, 2000, this injunction, along with continued legal pressure, led to the iCraveTV's demise just 3 months after its debut.
