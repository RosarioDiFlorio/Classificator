In United States v. John, 597 F.3d 263 (2010)  United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit interpreted the term “exceeds authorized access” in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 U.S.C. §1030(e)(6)  and concluded that access to a computer may be exceeded if the purposes for which access has been given are exceeded.
In particular, the court ruled that an employee would exceed authorized access to a protected computer if he or she used that access to obtain or steal information as part of criminal scheme.
This case addresses the issue of the distinction between authorized access to information and subsequent use of information obtained through an authorized access for the purposes of CFAA.
