OpenMedia is a Canadian non-partisan, non-profit advocacy organization working to encourage open and innovative communication systems within Canada. Its stated mission is "to advance and support a media communications system in Canada that adheres to the principles of access, choice, diversity, innovation and openness." The organization employs online campaigns, participatory events, school presentations and workshops. Its online petition for the "StopTheMeter.ca" campaign became the largest online appeal of its kind in Canadian history. In 2013, OpenMedia launched campaigns aimed at ensuring accountability in the Canadian government's surveillance activities.
