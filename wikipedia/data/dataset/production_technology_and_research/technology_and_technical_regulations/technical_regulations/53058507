ATATool is freeware software that is used to display and modify ATA disk information from a Microsoft Windows environment. The software is typically used to manage Host protected area and Device configuration overlay features and is broadly similar to the hdparm for Linux. The latest version adds support for DCO restore and freeze operations.
