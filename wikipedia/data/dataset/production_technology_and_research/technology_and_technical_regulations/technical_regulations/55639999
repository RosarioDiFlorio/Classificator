Internet Universality is the concept that "the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and social interactions and relationships, which has the potential to enable human rights, empower individuals and communities, and facilitate sustainable development. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on Multistakeholder participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of Internet development, concerned with technology and public policy, rights and development."
Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights four separate but interdependent fields of Internet policy and practice that are considered a "key" to assess a better Internet environment; access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy, and ethical norms and behavior online.
A framework named ROAM was developed by UNESCO in order to investigate and evaluate the universality of Internet in different countries. The framework is based on four normative principles agreed by UNESCO Member States; human rights, openness, accessibility and multistakeholder participation, summarised in the acronym R-O-A-M. The principles represent a solid ground for UNESCO in order to create a tool to comprehend Internet governance: the Internet Universality indicators.
