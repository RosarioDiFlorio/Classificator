SpiderOak is a US-based collaboration tool, online backup and file hosting service that allows users to access, synchronize and share data using a cloud-based server, offered by a company of the same name. SpiderOak is accessible through an app for Windows, Mac and Linux computer platforms, and Android, N900 Maemo and iOS mobile platforms.
According to SpiderOak, the software uses encrypted cloud storage and client-side encryption key creation, so SpiderOak employees cannot access users' information. SpiderOak distinguishes itself from its competition in provision of encryption, in provision for syncing files and folders across multiple devices, and in automatic de-duplication of data.
Some components of SpiderOak are open-source, and as early as 2009 the company announced their intent for the client to be fully open-source in the future. As of 2016, SpiderOak ONE's source code is only available for mobile platforms, with no current plans to open source the desktop client. Encryptr and Semaphor, SpiderOak's password manager and group messaging applications, are open-source.
SpiderOak was rated "Awesome" by MacLife magazine in 2009 and also was made an Editor's Choice by Computer Shopper magazine in May 2009. In a July 2014 interview, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden recommended SpiderOak over Dropbox, citing its better protection against government surveillance.
