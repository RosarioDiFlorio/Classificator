The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network layer that allows for censorship resistant, peer to peer communication. Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world. Given the high possibility of paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely. The software that implements this layer is called an "I2P router" and a computer running I2P is called an "I2P node". I2P is free and open source and is published under multiple licenses.
