Internet Slowdown Day, part of the "Battle for the Net" initiative, was a series of coordinated protests to promote net neutrality and regulations for the equal treatment of Internet traffic, occurring on September 10, 2014. The official site explains: "On September 10th, sites across the web will display an alert with a symbolic 'loading' symbol (the proverbial 'spinning wheel of death') and promote a call to action for users to push comments to the FCC, Congress, and the White House."
"Contrary to what the name suggests, Internet Slowdown Day didn’t actually slow down the Internet, or even any of the Web sites involved. Instead, the sites displayed the spinning-wheel image with messages explaining that “slow lanes” were about to be imposed on parts of the Internet." Site visitors were then directed to click on the image which then brought them directly to the FCC page, allowing them to submit complaints in favor of Net Neutrality. Over one million comments were sent to the FCC before Internet Slowdown Day, and the majority indicate strong public support for the idea of net neutrality.
While many internet service providers endorse eliminating net neutrality, seeing this as an opportunity to increase their profits, critics worry that eliminating net neutrality is paramount to allowing service providers to differentiate Internet traffic into a "fast lane" (for those companies who can afford to pay to have their content delivered at premium speeds) and a "slow lane" (for everyone else's websites).
The Internet Slowdown Day protests have were compared to January 18, 2012, Protests against SOPA and PIPA, known as the "Internet Blackout Day," which succeeded in stopping that particular American legislation. According to the protesters, the proposed legislation endangered the future of the Internet.
