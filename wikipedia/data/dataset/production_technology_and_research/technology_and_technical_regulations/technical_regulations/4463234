xB Browser (formerly known as TorPark and Xerobank browser) was a web browser designed to run on both the Tor and XeroBank anonymity networks, and is available as component of the xB Machine and the xB Installer.
It is designed for use on portable media such as a USB flash drive, but it can also be used on any hard disk drive. As such, a secure and encrypted connection to any of the Tor or XeroBank routers can be created from any computer with a suitable Internet connection, and the browser clears all data that was created on the portable drive upon exit or on demand.
In March 2007 it was reported that the xB Browser was downloaded 4 million times and in February 2008 over 6.5 million downloads making xB Browser the most popular anonymous browser on the Internet.
