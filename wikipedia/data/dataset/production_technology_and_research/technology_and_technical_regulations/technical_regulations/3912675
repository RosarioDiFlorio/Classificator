The Small Arms Working Group(SAWG) is an alliance of US-based non-governmental groups working together to promote change in US and international policies on small arms. SAWG members believe that small arms proliferation must be countered by more responsible policies on legal sales and international co-operation to reduce illicit trafficking. Participation in SAWG is open to any organizations that support its objectives.
