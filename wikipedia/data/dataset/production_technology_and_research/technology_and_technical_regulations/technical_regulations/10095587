Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. v. John B. Thompson is a lawsuit filed by Take Two Interactive against Miami attorney Jack Thompson seeking to permanently enjoin him from filing a public nuisance suit under Florida law against Take Two to block the sales of the unreleased video games Grand Theft Auto IV and Manhunt 2. Thompson had previously filed just such a suit against Take Two to block the release of Bully, which Thompson lost.
Thompson filed a countersuit on March 21, 2007 charging Take Two with being at the center of a RICO conspiracy. Third parties named in the conspiracy were GamePolitics.com, Kotaku, Joystiq, GameSpot, IGN, Penny Arcade, EGM, Game Informer, Spong, the ESA, the ESRB and the ECA. On March 28, 2007 Thompson filed an amended counterclaim with no mention of RICO.
Thompson and Take Two settled the suits on April 18, 2007, filing with Federal District Court Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga. In the settlement Thompson agreed to:
Not sue to block the sale or distribution of any Take Two title.
Not communicate any alleged wrongdoings by Take Two to any party doing business with Take Two. He is not blocked from criticizing Take Two products or acting as counsel in any lawsuit brought against Take Two by a 3rd party.
Have all future contact with Take Two be through their attorneys.
Take-Two Interactive agreed to:
Dismiss their lawsuit against Thompson.
Drop the Bully contempt of court issue.
