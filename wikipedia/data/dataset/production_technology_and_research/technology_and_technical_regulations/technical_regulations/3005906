Information privacy law or data protection laws prohibit the disclosure or misuse of information about private individuals. Over 80 countries and independent territories, including nearly every country in Europe and many in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa, have now adopted comprehensive data protection laws. The United States is notable for not having adopted a comprehensive information privacy law, but rather having adopted limited sectoral laws in some areas.
These laws are based on Fair Information Practice that was first developed in the United States in the 1970s by the Department for Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). The basic principles of data protection are:
For all data collected there should be a stated purpose.
Information collected by an individual cannot be disclosed to other organizations or individuals unless specifically authorized by law or by consent of the individual
Records kept on an individual should be accurate and up to date
There should be mechanisms for individuals to review data about them, to ensure accuracy. This may include periodic reporting
Data should be deleted when it is no longer needed for the stated purpose
Transmission of personal information to locations where "equivalent" personal data protection cannot be assured is prohibited
Some data is too sensitive to be collected, unless there are extreme circumstances (e.g., sexual orientation, religion)
