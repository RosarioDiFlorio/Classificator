Bytecoin (BCN) is the first cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote technology and launched in July 2012 with an open source code designed for anonymous cash settlement. BCN protects the user's privacy with impassive and anonymous transactions.
This is a completely independent currency, developing separately from Bitcoin and its forks. The basis for the creation of Bytecoin was the unique CryptoNote technology.
