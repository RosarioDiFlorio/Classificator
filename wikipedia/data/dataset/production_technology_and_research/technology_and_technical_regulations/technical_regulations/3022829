Evidence Eliminator was a computer software program that ran on the Microsoft Windows operating system. The program deletes hidden information from the user's hard drive that normal procedures may fail to delete. Such "cleaner" or "eraser" programs typically overwrite previously allocated disk space, in order to make it more difficult to salvage deleted information. In the absence of such overwrite procedures, information that a user thinks has been deleted may actually remain on the hard drive until that physical space is claimed for another use (i.e., to store another file). When it was offered for sale, the program cost $149.99.
