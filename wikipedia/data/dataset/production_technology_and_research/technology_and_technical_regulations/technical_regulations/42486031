HTTPS Everywhere is a free and open source browser extension for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Firefox for Android, which is developed collaboratively by The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). It automatically makes websites use a more secure HTTPS connection instead of HTTP, if they support it.
