The British American Security Information Council (BASIC) is a small, but influential, non-partisan think tank based in London. BASIC takes an inclusive approach to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by working with politicians, civil society, and other people who share this vision, as well as with those who might oppose it.
