The Digital Imprimatur: How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle is an article about Internet censorship written in 2003 by John Walker, the co-founder of computer-aided design software company Autodesk. It was published in the magazine Knowledge, Technology & Policy.
In the article, Walker argues that there is increasingly pressure limiting the ability for Internet users to voice their ideas, as well as predicting further Internet censorship. Walker claims that the most likely candidate to usher what he calls "the digital imprimatur" is digital rights management, or DRM.
