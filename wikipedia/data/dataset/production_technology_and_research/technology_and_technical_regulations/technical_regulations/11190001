OneDrive (previously SkyDrive, Windows Live SkyDrive, and Windows Live Folders) is a file-hosting service operated by Microsoft as part of its suite of online services. It allows users to store files as well as other personal data like Windows settings or BitLocker recovery keys in the cloud. Files can be synced to a PC and accessed from a web browser or a mobile device, as well as shared publicly or with specific people.
OneDrive offers 5 GB of storage space free of charge; additional storage can be added either separately or through subscriptions to other Microsoft services including Office 365 and Groove Music.
