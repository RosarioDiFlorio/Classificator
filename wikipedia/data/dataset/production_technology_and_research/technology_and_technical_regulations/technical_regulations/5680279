The International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) is an international non-governmental organisation recognised by the United Nations. IANSA is the global movement against gun violence, linking civil society organisations working to stop the proliferation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and all ownership of firearms by anyone other than a government agency. IANSA supports efforts to make people safer by reducing demand for such weapons, improving firearms regulation and strengthening controls on arms transfers. The network has over 700 members that undertake research, advocacy and campaigning to promote local, national, regional and global measures to strengthen human security.
IANSA's Women's Network is the only international network focused on the connections between gender, women's rights, small arms and armed violence.
