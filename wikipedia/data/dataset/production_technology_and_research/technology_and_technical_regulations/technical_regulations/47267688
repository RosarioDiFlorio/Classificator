Conflict Armament Research is a UK-based organization that monitors the movement of conventional weapons, ammunition, and related military materiel (such as IEDs) internationally. The group monitors the chain of supply of weapons that are used illicitly in conflict zones to trace how arms shipments are diverted. The group has investigated the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war.
The group maintains a database funded by the EU and the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs that provides "a global reporting mechanism on illicit small arms and light weapons and other illicit conventional weapons and ammunition to reduce the risk of their illicit trade."
