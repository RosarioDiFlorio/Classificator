"The Cyphernomicon" is a document written by Timothy C. May in 1994 for the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list, outlining some ideas behind, and the effects of, crypto-anarchism. It constitutes one of the philosophy's founding documents, advocating anonymous digital currency and electronic privacy, and touching on more esoteric topics, such as assassination markets.
The document is written and formatted as a lengthy FAQ. It contains many short notes on ideas, questions and claims ordered in sections. It also contains May's 1992 essay "The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto", in section 16.4.2.
