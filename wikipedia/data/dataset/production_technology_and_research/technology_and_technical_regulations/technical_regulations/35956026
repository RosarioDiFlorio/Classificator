Wikipedia Zero is a project by the Wikimedia Foundation to provide Wikipedia free of charge on mobile phones via zero-rating, particularly in developing markets. The program was launched in 2012, and won a 2013 South by Southwest Interactive Award for activism. The objective of the program is to increase access to free knowledge: in particular without data-usage cost. With 68 operators in over 52 countries, it is estimated over 309 million people have access to Wikipedia Zero.
Facebook Zero has been cited as an inspiration for Wikipedia Zero.
