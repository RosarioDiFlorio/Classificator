The mug shot publishing industry is a niche market of tabloid journalism in the United States. The industry consists of companies that publish mug shots and booking details of individuals arrested by law enforcement agencies. These companies publish the arrest information in tabloids, through local and multi-jurisdictional search websites. More than 60 new mug shot websites were created in the two-year period ending March 2013. The related reputation management industry profits when individuals pay a fee to have their mugshot removed from one or more websites. Although there is criticism of the industry, legal experts say it is a legal business model.
