El Paquete Semanal ("The Weekly Package") or El Paquete is a one terabyte collection of digital material distributed since around 2008 on the underground market in Cuba as a substitute for broadband Internet. In 2015 it was the primary source of entertainment for millions of Cubans.
The most popular content is TV series, soap operas, music and the illegal classifieds but it also contains films, video clips, Spanish language news websites, computer technology websites, instructional videos and advertisements for local Cuban businesses. Most buyers request only certain parts of the Package which may sell for as little as $1 US.
Since a 2011 legal property reform regarding private enterprise, a Cuban advertising firm called Etres has used the new regulations surrounding advertising to legally charge local businesses a small fee to arrange for a short clip or poster promoting their establishment to feature in the Package.
In May 2016 it was still unknown who compiled the material or from where it was obtained. Some have theorized that the lack of pornographic material and lack of anti-government views in the package may indicate the Cuban government is involved in its production.
