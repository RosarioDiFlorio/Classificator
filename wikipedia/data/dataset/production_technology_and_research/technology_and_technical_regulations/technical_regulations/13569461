CIV or International Convention for the transportation of Passengers (French: Convention Internationale pour le transport des Voyageurs) in rail transport refers to a set of uniform rules shared by European railway operators, to cover international journeys. The acronym "CIV" is printed on the corner of tickets issued to show that they are covered under the terms of the contract—primarily providing compensation for lost baggage and a guarantee of onward transport, in the event of cancelled or missed connections.
Established by the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), article 3. The full current title is the Uniform Rules concerning the Contract for International Carriage of Passengers and Luggage by Rail (CGT-CIV, French: Conditions générales de transport pour le transport international ferroviaire des voyageurs).
It provides equivalent protection to the Warsaw Convention (now Montreal Convention) for international travel by air, and the Athens Convention covering international travel by sea.
