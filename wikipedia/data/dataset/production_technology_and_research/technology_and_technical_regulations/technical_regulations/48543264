Rawti Shax or Didi Nwe (Kurdish: ڕەوتی شاخ‎) ("new course" or "towards the mountain") is a Kurdish dark web-based offshoot of the Kurdish jihadist group Ansar al-Islam. In October 2015, seventeen members, including the suspected leader, Norway-based Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad "Mullah Krekar" (the original leader of Ansar al-Islam), were arrested or indicted in a coordinated, Italy-led multi-nation sweep by police across Europe. The operation dismantled an integrated cell in Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany, Finland and Switzerland.
The network was accused of radicalizing and recruiting fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), plotting attacks targeting Norwegian and British diplomats in the Middle East, and making preparations to establish a caliphate in Iraq's Kurdistan region. It was also suspected of operating its own military training camps. The Italian anti-terrorism chief Giuseppe Governale said that the operation was "the most important international police operation in Europe in 20 years".
