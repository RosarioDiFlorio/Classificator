The Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy was founded in 1995 by Dr. Rebecca Johnson, senior advisor to the United Nations' United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission chaired by Dr. Hans Blix from January 2000 to June 2003. It states as its goal "to promote effective approaches to international security, disarmament and arms control. ... Engaging with governments and civil society, Acronym provides reporting, analysis and strategic thinking on a range of issues relevant to peace and security, with special emphasis on treaties and multilateral initiatives."
The Acronym Institute has published the journal Disarmament Diplomacy since 1997 on a bi-monthly basis, with an overview of events relating to weapons proliferation and disarmament.
The Acronym Institute was founded by Dr. Johnson as continuation of her work for The Acronym Consortium (VERTIC, ISIS, BASIC and Dfax), which had dissolved into its constituent parts in October 1995.
