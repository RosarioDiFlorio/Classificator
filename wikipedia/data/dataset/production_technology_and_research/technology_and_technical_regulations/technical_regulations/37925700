A cyberattack is any type of offensive manoeuvre employed by nation-states, individuals, groups, or organizations that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, and/or personal computer devices by various means of malicious acts usually originating from an anonymous source that either steals, alters, or destroys a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system. These can be labelled as either a cyber campaign, cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism in different context. Cyberattacks can range from installing spyware on a PC to attempts to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations. Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous as the Stuxnet worm recently demonstrated. User behavior analytics and SIEM are used to prevent these attacks. Legal experts are seeking to limit use of the term to incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine data breaches and broader hacking activities.
