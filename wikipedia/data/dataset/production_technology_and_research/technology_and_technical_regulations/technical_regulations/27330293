The Global Internet Freedom Consortium is a consortium of organizations that develop and deploy anti-censorship technologies for use by Internet users in countries whose governments restrict Web-based information access. The organization was reportedly begun in 2001 by Chinese-born scientists living in the United States reacting against Chinese government oppression of the Falun Gong.
