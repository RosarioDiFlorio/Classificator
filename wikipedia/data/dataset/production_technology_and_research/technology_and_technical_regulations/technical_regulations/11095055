Routing Assets Database (RADb), also expanded as Routing Arbiter Database, run by Merit Network, is a lookup database designed to make fundamental information about networks available. The RADb is a public registry of routing information for networks in the Internet. It was developed in the early 1990s as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Routing Arbiter Project. The acronym is frequently seen written in all caps (RADB) but its official usage is the following mixed case (RADb).
Some Internet service providers require customers to be registered in some RADb prior to making BGP announcements.
Among other things, the registry validates the origin of each announcement.
