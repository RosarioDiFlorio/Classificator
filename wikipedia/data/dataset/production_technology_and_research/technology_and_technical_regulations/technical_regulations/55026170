The Public opinion brigades (Vietnamese: Dư luận viên), known as Communist's troll army, are known to be state-sponsored propaganda trolls by the Communist Party of Vietnam or linked to the Communist Government of Vietnam.
Same as Russia's Web brigades and China's 50 Cent Army, participants report that they are organized into teams and groups of commentators that participate in Vietnamese and international political blogs and Internet forums using sockpuppets and large-scale orchestrated trolling and disinformation campaigns to promote pro-Vietnamese communist propaganda. It has also been found that Wikipedia articles were targeted by Vietnamese communist internet propaganda activities, or even serving distortion for the regime.
