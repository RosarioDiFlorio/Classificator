An Internet kill switch is the cybercrime and countermeasures concept of activating a single shut off mechanism for all Internet traffic.
The concept behind having a kill switch is based on creating a single point of control (i.e. a switch) for a single authority to control or shut down the Internet in order to protect it or its users. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Nominet Trust have criticized proposals for implementing the idea so far.
