PLATINUM is the name given by Microsoft to a cybercrime collective active against governments and related organizations in South and Southeast Asia. They are secretive and not much is known about the members of the group. The group's skill means that its attacks sometimes go without detection for many years.
The group, considered an advanced persistent threat, has been active since at least 2009, targeting victims via spear-phishing attacks against government officials' private email addresses, zero-day exploits, and hot-patching vulnerabilities. Upon gaining access to their victims' computers, the group steals economically sensitive information.
PLATINUM succeeded in keeping a low profile until their abuse of the Microsoft Windows hot patching system was detected and publicly reported in April 2016. This hot patching method allows them to use Microsoft's own features to quickly patch, alter files or update an application, without rebooting the system altogether, this way, they can maintain the data they have stolen while masking their identity.
In June 2017, PLATINUM became notable for exploiting the serial over LAN (SOL) capabilities of Intel's Active Management Technology to perform data exfiltration.
