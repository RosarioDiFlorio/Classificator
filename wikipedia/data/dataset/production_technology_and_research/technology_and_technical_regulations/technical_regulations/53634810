On 28 March 2017 the United States' House of Representatives passed a resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res 34) to overturn the Broadband Consumer Privacy Proposal privacy law by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and is now expected to be approved by United States' President Donald Trump. It was passed with 215 Republican votes against 205 votes of disapproval.
The repealed privacy protections approved in 2016 sought to regulate what companies can do with data of customers' browsing habits, communication contents, app usage history, location data and social security numbers and safeguard customer data against hackers and thieves.
Supporters of the vote argue that the privacy regulations stifle innovation by forcing Internet providers to abide by unreasonably strict guidelines.
Due to the repealment Internet service providers (ISP) like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon may sell Web browsing histories and other sensitive data directly to marketers, financial firms and other companies without consumers' consent. Furthermore, the FCC will be forbidden from issuing similar rules in the future.
