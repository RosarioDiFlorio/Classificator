Annika Small is a social entrepreneur and documentary producer who explores how digital technologies can be used to address big social challenges. As Founder of CAST and former Chief Executive of Nominet Trust, Annika has used online tools to galvanize new approaches to social problems. Online peer mentoring for those experiencing bullying, the first online clinical research trial, the iDEA programme [1] for young digital entrepreneurs and new forms of micro-volunteering to help those suffering from social isolation are just some examples of how Annika has supported the use of digital technologies to mobilize new forms of knowledge and social action.
Prior to Nominet Trust, Annika founded and led the Tony Blair Institute's global education programme - Generation Global - where she used digital technologies to bring together young people of different cultures around the world to learn directly with, from and about each other. This programme is active in more than 25 countries and has been proven to enhance inter-cultural relationships, particularly in areas of conflict from Pakistan to Syria. Prior to this, Annika was Chief Executive of Futurelab, a leading educational R&D organisation chaired by Lord Puttnam,which develops radically new approaches to teaching and learning. Winner of multiple awards including the prestigious BETT award for special achievement in education and technology, Annika works to bring together policy, industry and academia to create imaginative digital resources and practices that mobilize positive social change.
As a member of BAFTA and a Fellow of the RSA, Annika is particularly interested in supporting young people to be active, informed participants in our digital society. To this end, she is a Trustee of Founders4Schools and the Design Council. She is also a Non-Exec Director of Lightful and a Trustee of the Access Foundation.
