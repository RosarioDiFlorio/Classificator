Network Sovereignty is the effort of a governing entity, such as a state, to create boundaries on a network and then exert a form of control, often in the form of law enforcement, over those boundaries. Much like states invoke sole power over their physical territorial boundaries, state sovereignty, these governing bodies also invoke sole power within the network boundaries they set, claiming network sovereignty. In the context of the internet, the intention is to govern the web and control it within the borders of the state. Often, this is witnessed as states seeking to control all information flowing into and within their borders.
The concept stems from questions of how states can maintain law over an entity such as the internet for which the infrastructure exists in real space, but the entity itself exists in the intangible cyberspace. Some Internet Scholars such as Joel R. Reidenberg argue that "Networks have key attributes of sovereignty: participant/citizens via service provider membership agreements, 'constitutional' rights through contractual terms of service, and police powers through taxation (fees) and system operator sanctions"  Indeed, many countries have pushed to ensure the protection of their citizens' privacy and of internal business longevity through data protection and information privacy legislation (see the EU's Data Protection Directive, the UK's Data Protection Act of 1998). Network Sovereignty has implications for state security, internet governance, and users of their national and international networks.
