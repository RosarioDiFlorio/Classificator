Move Your Domain Day is a domain name transferring initiative, initially in response to GoDaddy's support of the United States Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). It was first held on 29 December 2011, originating from a post on Reddit and spearheaded by domain registrar Namecheap. In 2012, Namecheap began an initiative to make Move Your Domain Day an annual event. The second event was held on 22 January 2013. The third time was held on 5 February 2014. The fourth was held on 27 January 2015. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reddit, and domain registrars Name.com and Hover have also participated. Namecheap has defined the initiative as "an annual protest and a commemoration of sorts that will continue to shine a light on the issue of a free and open internet."
