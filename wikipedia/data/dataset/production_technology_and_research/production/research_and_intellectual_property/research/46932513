Proto-Indo-European Lexicon (PIE Lexicon) is a generative etymological dictionary of Indo-European languages. PIE Lexicon is an academic open source database published online at the address http://pielexicon.hum.helsinki.fi.
PIE Lexicon is an etymological dictionary that will comprise the main bulk of the vocabulary of more than one hundred of the most ancient Indo-European languages when the first phase of the project has been accomplished. When ready, the project will expand to its second phase in which the later Indo-European languages will be added to the database.
The next-generation feature of the dictionary is the automatic generation of the Indo-European data, quoted in a stem form (i.e. without inflectional endings), on the basis of the digitised Indo-European sound laws and a primary phoneme inventory postulated for the Proto-Indo-European language. This stage will formalize the prediction of descendant forms from reconstructed Proto-Indo-European forms.
