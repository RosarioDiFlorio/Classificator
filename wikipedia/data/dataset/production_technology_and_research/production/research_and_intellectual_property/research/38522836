Collaborative pedagogy stems from the process theory of rhetoric and composition. Collaborative pedagogy believes that students will better engage with writing, critical thinking, and revision if they engage with others. Collaborative pedagogy pushes back against the Current-Traditional model of writing, as well as other earlier theories explaining rhetoric and composition; earlier theories of writing, especially current-traditional, emphasizes writing as a final product (completed individually). In contrast, collaborative pedagogy rejects the notion that students think, learn, and write in isolation. Collaborative pedagogy strives to maximize critical thinking, learning, and writing skills through interaction and inter-personal engagement. Collaborative pedagogy also connects to the broader theory of collaborative learning, which encompasses other disciplines including, but not limited to, education, psychology, and sociology.
In the rhetoric and composition discourse community, there exists much support for and debate about the use of collaborative learning in the classroom. Although collaborative pedagogy deals with the strategies associated with promoting engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity, these theorists underscore collaborative pedagogyâ€™s link to cultural studies, argumentation, community literacy, academic discourse, and university standards and policy connected with first-year composition.
Discussions of collaborative pedagogy also emerge in the technical communication field, a subset of rhetoric and composition. Technical communication incorporates collaborative pedagogy by attempting to bridge real work environments with university classrooms through group assignments.
