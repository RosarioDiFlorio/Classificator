Meta-research is a recent field of research that investigates research practices with the ultimate goal of finding evidence-based improvements. It is also known as "research on research" or "the science of science" as it uses research methods to study how research is done and where improvements can be made. It covers all fields of scientific research (including health and medical research) and has been described as "taking a birdâ€™s eye view of science". It aims to improve scientific practice as summed up by John Ioannidis, "Science is the best thing that has happened to human beings [...] but we can do it better".
