The Chanchlani Global Health Research Award is a Canadian health sciences award that recognizes a world leading scholar in the area of Global Health. Each year a discipline within Global Health (i.e. Determinants of Health, Policy Development, and Innovative Solutions) is chosen by the internal review committee at McMaster University. The review committee then selects the leading researcher based on interview and impact in the field. The award recipient receives a monetary prize of $25,000 and opportunity to present their research findings to researchers and students.
The award provides opportunities for informal scientific exchanges between the scientist/scholar and faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate medical students. The award was created by the Chanchlani Family through $1 Million endowment along with a $250,000 donation at the McMaster University in 2012.
