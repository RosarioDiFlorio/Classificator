It was established in May 2008 by its current editor-in-chief, Alexandre Noukhovitch and is published by the Foundation for Student Science and Technology. As of 2014, it has been renamed to the Journal of Student Science and Technology and is a joint program supported by the federal Science and Technology Cluster. It provides secondary school students with an opportunity to publish the results of their research. The journal is based in Toronto and is published twice per year. It works in close association with Youth Science Canada. The journal includes project reports, case studies, and science book reviews authored by high school students.

By providing various forms of research based education and a reach ahead experience into knowledge based professions the journal strives to influence high school studentsâ€™ career and postsecondary education decisions.
