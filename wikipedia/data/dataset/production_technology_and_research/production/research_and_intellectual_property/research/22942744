Pegasso's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. The name Pegasso is Spanish for Pegasus, a winged horse from the Greek mythology. He has also wrestled as "Hombre sin Nombre" ("man without name") and "Pegasso Xtreme".
