The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH) is an interdisciplinary project of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Within the framework of this Research Center social scientists and natural scientists study the effect that culture had on the successive expansions of humans out of Africa and across the Old World. The Research Center is located at the Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen and the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt am Main.
The project was initiated in 2008 by the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and is scheduled to continue for 20 years until 2027.
