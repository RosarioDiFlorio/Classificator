The Godard family disappearance (known as the affaire Godard ('Godard Affair') in France), involved the disappearance of French doctor Yves Godard, his second wife and their two children in September 1999. Clues to the mystery were gradually discovered. Firstly, traces of blood were found in the family home near Juvigny-sur-Seulles in Calvados, Lower Normandy. It was then established that Yves Godard and his two children departed on a sailing boat rented in Saint-Malo, in Brittany, a few days before the blood was discovered at their home. During the course of the next few years, various objects were found on the north coast of Brittany or at sea: a lifeboat, identity papers, credit cards, the skull of one of the children and finally the bones of Yves Godard. The case was closed on 14 September 2012.
