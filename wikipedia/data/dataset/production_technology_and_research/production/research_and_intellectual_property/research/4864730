De Munitionibus Castrorum ("About the Fortifications of Military Camps") is a work by an unknown author. Due to this work formerly being attributed to Hyginus Gromaticus, its author is conventionally called "Pseudo-Hyginus". This work is the most detailed description that survives about Roman military camps (Latin: castra) and dates most probably from the late 1st to early 2nd century AD.
