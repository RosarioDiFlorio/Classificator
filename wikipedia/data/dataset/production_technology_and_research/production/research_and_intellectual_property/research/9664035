CORDIS is the Community Research and Development Information Service. It is the European Commission's primary public repository and portal to disseminate information on all EU-funded research projects and their results in the broadest sense.
The website and repository include all public information held by the Commission (project fact-sheets, publishable reports and deliverable), editorial content to support communication and exploitation (news, events, success stories, magazines, multilingual "results in brief" for the broader public) and comprehensive links to external sources such as open access publications and websites.
Advisory services on conducting research using CORDIS is available at European Documentation Centres across the European Union.
