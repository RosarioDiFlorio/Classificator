Cognitive shifting is the mental process of consciously redirecting one's attention away from one fixation to another. In contrast, if this process happened unconsciously then it is referred to as task switching. Both are forms of cognitive flexibility.
In the general framework of cognitive therapy and awareness management, cognitive shifting refers to the conscious choice to take charge of one's mental habitsâ€”and redirect one's focus of attention in helpful, more successful directions. In the term's specific usage in corporate awareness methodology, cognitive shifting is a performance-oriented technique for refocusing attention in more alert, innovative, charismatic and empathic directions.
