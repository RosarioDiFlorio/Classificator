Design science is an outcome based information technology research methodology, which offers specific guidelines for evaluation and iteration within research projects.
Design science research focuses on the development and performance of (designed) artifacts with the explicit intention of improving the functional performance of the artifact. Design science research is typically applied to categories of artifacts including algorithms, human/computer interfaces, design methodologies (including process models) and languages. Its application is most notable in the Engineering and Computer Science disciplines, though is not restricted to these and can be found in many disciplines and fields. In design science research, as opposed to explanatory science research, academic research objectives are of a more pragmatic nature. Research in these disciplines can be seen as a quest for understanding and improving human performance. Such renowned research institutions as MIT’s Media Lab, Stanford's Centre for Design Research, Carnegie-Mellon's Software Engineering Institute, Xerox’s PARC and Brunel’s Organization and System Design Centre use the Design Science Research approach.
