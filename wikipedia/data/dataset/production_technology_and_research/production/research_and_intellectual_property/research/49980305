Joseph Newton Chandler III is the alias of an unidentified man who committed suicide in Eastlake, Ohio in July 2002. After his death, investigators were unable to locate his family and discovered that he had stolen the identity of Joseph Newton Chandler III, an eight-year-old boy who was killed in a car crash in Texas in 1945.
The lengths to which Chandler went to hide his identity have led to speculation that he was a fugitive.
In late 2016, U.S. Marshals announced that forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick had used Y-Chromosome genetic information to link the man to the surname "Nicholas".
