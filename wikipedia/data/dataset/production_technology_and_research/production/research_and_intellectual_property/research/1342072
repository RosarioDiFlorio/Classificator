King Edward Point (also known as KEP) is the capital of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, on the northeastern coast of the island of South Georgia. It is located at 54°17′S 36°30′W in Cumberland East Bay. It is sometimes confusingly referred to as Grytviken, which is the site of the disused whaling station, nearby at the head of King Edward Cove.
