ANVUR (Agenzia Nazionale di Valutazione del Sistema Universitario e della Ricerca) is the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Systems. ANVUR was established by a 2006 law with the objective of improving meritocracy in Italian academic research. It was based on Aeres in France and the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the United Kingdom.
ANVUR began to compile its assessment of Italian research, the "VQR" (eValuation of the Quality of Research) in November 2011, assessing 95 universities, 21 research agencies or institutes, and 17 inter-university consortia.
