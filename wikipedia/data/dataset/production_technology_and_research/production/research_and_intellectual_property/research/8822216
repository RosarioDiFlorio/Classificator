Uji Shūi Monogatari (宇治拾遺物語) is a collection of Japanese tales written around the beginning of the 13th century. The author is unknown, and it may have been revised several times.
The title means "gleanings from Uji Dainagon Monogatari", a book which no longer exists. The Dainagon of Uji was Minamoto no Takakuni.
The work is classified as setsuwa literature. Following in the footsteps of Konjaku Monogatarishū, it is the representative setsuwa work of the Kamakura period.
