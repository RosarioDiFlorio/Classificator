Knowledge translation (KT) is the umbrella term for all of the activities involved in moving research from the laboratory, the research journal, and the academic conference into the hands of people and organizations who can put it to practical use. The term is most often used relative to the health professions, including medicine, nursing, pharmaceuticals, rehabilitation, and public health.
Depending on the type of research being translated, the "practical user" might be a medical doctor, a nurse, a teacher, a school administrator, an occupational or physical therapist, a legislator, an epidemiologist, a community health worker, or a parent.
KT is not an action, but a spectrum of activities which will change according to the type of research, the time frame, and the audience being targeted.
