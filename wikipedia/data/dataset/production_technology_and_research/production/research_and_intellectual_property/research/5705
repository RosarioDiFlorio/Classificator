In mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (abbreviated CH) is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of infinite sets. It states:

Whether this statement is true or false is independent of ZFC set theory, so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent.
The continuum hypothesis was advanced by Georg Cantor in 1878. The name of the hypothesis comes from the term the continuum for the real numbers.
