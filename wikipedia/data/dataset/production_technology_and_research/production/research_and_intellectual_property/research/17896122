The First Master of the Bible Historiale of Jean de Berry was a French manuscript illuminator active between 1390 and 1400. Little is known about him; his name comes from a manuscript of the Historical Bible, now held by a library in Paris, in which he painted several miniatures. The manuscript was once owned by John, Duke of Berry, and with most books containing other work ascribed to the artist seems to have been produced in Paris. This would indicate that the artist lived and worked there, producing large secular works as well as religious treatises written in vernacular French.
