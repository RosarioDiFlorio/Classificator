The glacial survival hypothesis is the idea that cold tolerant plant and animal species (e.g. Norway spruce and Norwegian lemmings) survived in ice-free northern microrefugia during the last ice age. The alternative hypothesis of postglacial immigration of plant and animals is called the tabula rasa hypothesis.

Over the past plants and animals have persisted through long periods of climate change including several glacial and interglacial periods. There is a long-standing debate on what happened to the species that were inhabiting high-latitidue regions during the Pleistocene ice age. Two main scenarios are usually considered. The first scenario proposes a total extinction of species within glaciated areas with survival events in peripheral refugia in the south and successive massive postglacial migration into empty areas (tabula rasa hypothesis). The second scenario proposes long-term in situ survival within glaciated regions (glacial survival hypothesis), either in isolated northern ice-free micro-refugia at the edge of the ice sheet, or on exposed mountains not covered with ice within the ice sheet (nunatak hypothesis).
For boreal and cold-tolerant species the glacial survival hypothesis is credible, though controversial, and a growing body of molecular data is now supporting it. Several recent studies have shown that several northern regions (above latitudes >45Â° N) have supported low-density boreal and temperate tree populations during the late-glacial or Early Holocene [e.g. North America, Eurasia, Scandinavia].
