Rey Horus (born June 24, 1984) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, formerly known as the second El Hijo de Rey Misterio. His former ring name is Spanish for "The Son of the King of Mystery" or more correctly "The Son of Rey Misterio", and he was the second wrestler under that name. He mainly works on the independent circuit in the United States and in Mexico. His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.
