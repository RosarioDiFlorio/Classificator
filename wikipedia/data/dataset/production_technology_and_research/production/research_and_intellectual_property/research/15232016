Springer Protocols is a database of life sciences protocols published by Springer Science+Business Media. These "recipes" allow scientists to recreate experiments in their own laboratory. Springer Protocols contains more than 33,000 protocols, most of which are derived from the book series Methods in Molecular Biology, published under the Humana Press imprint. That book series, edited by John M. Walker since 1984, contains more than 1,100 volumes and has spawned several related book series. Springer Protocols replaced BioMed Protocols, a Humana Press database, in January 2008.
