Ángel de Oro (born August 8, 1988) is the ring name of a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, who works for the Mexican wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), where he is the current CMLL World Middleweight Champion and a former CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion, a former Mexican National Trios Champion and the winner of the only Forjando un Ídolo tournament held so far. His name is Spanish for "Angel of Gold" or "Golden Angel".
Ángel de Oro's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He is a second generation luchador, son of Apolo Chávez and the brother of the luchador Niebla Roja who also works for CMLL. For years Ángel de Oro was part of a group called Los Ángeles Celestiales ("The Celestial Angels") alongside his brother (then billed as Ángel de Plata) and Ángel Azteca Jr., but after his brother changed his ring persona that group has been phased out.
