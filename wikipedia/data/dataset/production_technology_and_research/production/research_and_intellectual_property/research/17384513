The Master of the Death of the Virgin was a Netherlandish painter active between 1507 and 1537. He is believed to be responsible for a large group of paintings; two of these are altarpieces of the Death of the Virgin, one in Cologne and one in Munich, from which his name is derived. He is sometimes, but not universally, identified with Joos van Cleve. Nothing further appears to be known about him.
