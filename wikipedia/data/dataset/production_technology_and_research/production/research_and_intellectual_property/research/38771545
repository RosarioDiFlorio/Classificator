The Fenn Treasure is a treasure reportedly worth over a million dollars supposedly hidden by art dealer and author Forrest Fenn in the Rocky Mountains. Fenn has said he is going to go back and get it when the value is inflated to 10 million dollars.
According to Fenn, many people have claimed to have found the treasure, but no one has provided any evidence to him supporting their claim. As of July 2017, Fenn has stated "The treasure remains where I hid it about 7 years ago". In May 2017, Fenn was asked: "Has anyone determined the nine clues and what they represent?" and his response was: "I don't know that anybody has told me the clues in the right order", leading to speculation all of the clues have been solved, but the chest remains hidden. Forrest reconfirmed searchers have been within 200 feet (60 m) of the treasure and many within 500 feet (150 m). The Thrill of the Chase and Too Far to Walk books chronicle Fenn's life as an adrenaline junkie and the treasure hunt has attracted many thrill seekers.
