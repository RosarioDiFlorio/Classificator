Dye 3 is an ice core site and previously part of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) line, located at (65°11′N 43°49′W, 2480 masl) in Greenland. As a DEW line base, it was disbanded in years 1990/1991.
An ice core is a core sample from the accumulation of snow and ice that has re-crystallized and trapped air bubbles over many years. The composition of these ice cores, especially the presence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, provides a picture of the climate at the time. Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information.
Inclusions in the snow, such as wind-blown dust, ash, bubbles of atmospheric gas and radioactive substances, remain in the ice. The variety of climatic proxies is greater than in any other natural recorder of climate, such as tree rings or sediment layers. These include (proxies for) temperature, ocean volume, precipitation, chemistry and gas composition of the lower atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity, desert extent and forest fires.
Typical ice cores are removed from an ice sheet such as the ice cap internal to Greenland. Greenland is, by area, the world's largest island. The Greenland ice sheet covers about 1.71 million km2 and contains about 2.6 million km3 of ice.
