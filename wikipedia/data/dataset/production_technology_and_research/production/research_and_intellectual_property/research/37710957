Robin is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, who works for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and portrays a tecnico ("Good guy") wrestling character. Robin's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He is a part of the extensive Alvarado wrestling family, the son of José Aarón Alvarado Nieves who wrestled as "Brazo Cibernético" and "Robin Hood", and grandson of Juan Alvarado Ibarra, better known as Shadito Cruz.
