The two-body problem is a dilemma for life partners (for e.g. spouses or any other couple) in academia, relating to the difficulty of both spouses obtaining jobs at the same university or within a reasonable commuting distance from each other. The central dilemma is thus a no-win situation in which if the couple wishes to stay together one of them may be forced to abandon an academic career, or if both wish to pursue academic careers the relationship may falter due to the spouses being constantly separated. Compromises the couple makes while trying to negotiate the two-body problem have implications for gender inequality. The term "two body problem" has been used in the context of working couples since at least the mid-1990s. It alludes to the insolvable three-body problem in classical mechanics.
More than 70 percent of academic faculty have a working partner, while more than a third of faculty have an academic partner.
