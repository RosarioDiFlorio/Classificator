Sonic Movement is a research project operated by the Swedish company Semcon. Premiered in September 2013, Sonic Movement proposes an "adaptive" system of warning sounds and noises for electric cars, which is in opposition to industry trend of replicating combustion engine noises for electric car sound effects.
Founders James Brooks and Fernando Ocaña are on the design team, as well as artists Holly Herndon and Matt Dryhurst. The project aims to meet a proposal for a US mandate which would require silent electric and hybrid vehicles to emit warning sounds, as well as legislation passed by the European parliament in April 2014, which states that all new electric cars sold in the EU must emit noise by 2019. However, Ocaña notes that while legislators are "looking at this from a technical point of view, [Sonic Movement is] looking at it from a user experience point of view."
