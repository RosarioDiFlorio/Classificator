Project Neptune is a water distribution project in the United Kingdom with the goal of establishing an optimized and more sustainable system for water distribution. The project was officially announced in April 2007, and received a budget of Â£2.7 million.In the UK, water service providers (WSPs) are legally obligated to provide drinking water to all of their customers. The difficulty in optimizing this service is the minimum water pressure and flow standards, as well as the strict regulations regarding water quality. The innovative technologies required to support the goal of Project Neptune are either partially evolved with no proven reliability or do not exist yet. The Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Cambridge is heading the work on integrating artificial intelligence and mathematical simulation technologies to create an efficient online reporting and analyzing system for monitoring performance of the water distribution system.
