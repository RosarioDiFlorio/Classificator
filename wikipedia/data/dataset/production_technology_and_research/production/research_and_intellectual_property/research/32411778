Virtual Portal for Impaired Groups Interaction (ViPi) is a project partially funded by the European Union (EU) under the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007â€“2013, subprogramme KA3 ICT. The project commenced on 1 January 2011 and has 36 months duration (until 31 December 2013). The main vision of the project is to provide alternative and creative solutions for the employment of People with Disabilities (PwD) by delivering a "one-stop-shop" interactive portal and learning environment comprising: 1) a multilingual platform, 2) an embedded social community, 3) accessible content (WCAG 2.0) for PwD and trainers, etc. The project will bring together key stakeholders and gatekeepers (VET, target groups, umbrella organizations) in order to address the lack of specific training support or material for PwD and their trainers by providing a set of applications and services that will be available via a complete educational framework, taking into account interaction possibilities offered by web 2.0 and localised, tested and assessed with different end-user communities (GR, BE, LT, UK and CY).
