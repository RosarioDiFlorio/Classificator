The Master of the Morrison Triptych is the name given to an unknown Early Netherlandish painter active in Antwerp around 1500-1510. He is named for the Morrison Triptych, now in Toledo, Ohio, which is described below.
The same master is attributed an Adoration of the Magi with donor portrait, in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, c. 1504, probably the side-wing of another triptych. It is dateable by the stage of progress reached in the construction of the new tower of Antwerp Cathedral in the background, a typical exhibition of civic pride. A triptych in the National Gallery, London (NG 1085) has been suggested as another work by the artist. In Lisbon's Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga there is yet another triptych believed to have been painted by this master with the Virgin Christa and Angels, and with St John the Baptist and St john the Evangelist in the side panels. Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht houses a small panel painting with an Adoration of the Shepherds (ABM s355) that is attributed to the master.
