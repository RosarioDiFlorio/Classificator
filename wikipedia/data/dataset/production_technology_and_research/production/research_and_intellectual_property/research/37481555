Acero (born August 4, 1984) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler currently working for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in their Mini-Estrella division. Working in the Mini-Estrellas division does not necessarily mean that Acero is a dwarf as several wrestlers who are just shorter in stature work in the "Mini" division. Acero is Spanish for "Steel" and is a shortened version of his previous ring name Ni√±o de Acero or "Boy of Steel". Acero's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.
