Stukita (born May 8, 1994) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, under contract with the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in their Mini-Estrella division. Working in the Mini-Estrellas division does not necessarily mean that Pequeño Halcón is a dwarf as several wrestlers who are just shorter in stature work in the "Mini" division. Stukita's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. His name is the diminutive form of "Stuka", as he portrays a smaller version of wrestlers Stuka and Stuka, Jr.. He is a third generation wrestler with both his father and grandfather being professional wrestlers before him.
