The Monster with 21 Faces (かい人21面相, Kaijin Nijūichi Mensō) was a name (originally of the villain in Edogawa Rampo's detective novels) used as an alias by the person or group responsible for the blackmail letters in the Glico Morinaga case in Japan. Variations of the name's translation, including “the Mystery Man with the 21 Faces” and “the Phantom with 21 Faces”, have also been used in articles and books featuring the case.
