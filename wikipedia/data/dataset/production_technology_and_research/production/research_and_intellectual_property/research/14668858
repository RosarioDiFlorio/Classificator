The Sister Study is a nationwide effort, conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, one of the National Institutes of Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to learn how the environment and genes may affect the chances of getting breast cancer. Over the next 10 years, the study will follow 50,000 sisters of women who have had breast cancer, in hopes of finding the environmental and genetic causes of the disease.
Sister Study participants are women ages 35 to 74. Women are eligible to participate if their sister (living or deceased), related to them by blood, had breast cancer; they have never had breast cancer themselves; and they live in the United States or Puerto Rico. The Sister Study is available in English and Spanish.
Organizations in partnership with the Sister Study include the American Cancer Society, the Intercultural Cancer Council, the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities of the National Institutes of Health, Sisters Network Inc., Susan G. Komen for the Cure, and Breast Cancer Network of Strength.
