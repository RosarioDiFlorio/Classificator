SimpleDL is digital collection management software that allows for the upload, description, management and access of digital collections and is UTF-8 compatible. SimpleDL is not limited by format and is capable of handling documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio files, and data only objects. In addition to simple digital files, SimpleDL can also connect content so multipage documents, scores, or books can be uploaded and organized into chapters, books or by page number. SimpleDL can also combine any number of images into one display object. SimpleDL is mostly used by libraries, archives, museums, government agencies, universities, corporations, historical societies, and other organizations that wish to host a digital collection.
