The Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information (CASRAI) is an international, non-profit "membership initiative led by research institutions and their partners.". Founded in 2006, it is a corporation registered in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and is overseen by a central Board of Directors and national Steering Committees in each country with a national chapter.
The CASRAI mission is to adapt the principles and best practices of open standards and data governance to lead and facilitate key stakeholders in annual deliberations to develop ‘standard information agreements’ that serve as bridges between research information users. CASRAI agreements cover all the key information requirements that relate to the management of research throughout its life cycle. This includes information requirements related to applications for funds, CVs, project and funds management, compliance requirements, reporting as well as research data management and scholarly communications. The CASRAI vision is for all stakeholders (institutions, funders, publishers and software providers) to adopt the resulting ‘invisible infrastructure’ in their local software and processes so we can collectively enable stable, predictable and comparable results when sharing research information throughout the life cycle.
