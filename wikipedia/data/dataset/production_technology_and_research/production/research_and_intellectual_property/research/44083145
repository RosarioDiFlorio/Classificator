A necessary evil is an unfavorable thing (an evil) that someone believes must be done or accepted because it is necessary to achieve a better outcomeâ€”especially because possible alternative courses of action or inaction would be worse. It is the "lesser evil" in the lesser of two evils (or lesser evil) principle, which provides that when given two bad choices, the one that is not as bad as the other is better than the one that is the greater threat.
