The Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) is a laboratory environment which utilizes a distributed Wide Area Network (WAN) as the vehicle to simulate training environments and to de-risk command and control (C2) and intelligence capabilities by conducting Research and Development, Training, Trials and Assessment (RDTT&A) on command, control, communication, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) initiatives and training events. Since 2001, membership has been established and represented by three core parties: USA (Joint Staff/J6), Combined Communications and Electronics Board (AUS, CAN, NZL, GBR, and USA), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (including NATO agencies and 28 member nations, not all of which actively participate). Besides the core parties to the CFBLNet Technical Arrangement, four nations (Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Switzerland) have become Guest Mission Partners under rules contained in CFBLNet governance documentation referred to as Publication 1. CFBLNet provides the main platform for conducting Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) events in the context of Federated Mission Networking.
