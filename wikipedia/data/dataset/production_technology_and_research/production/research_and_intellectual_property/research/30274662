The Master of Girart de Roussillon is an anonymous Burgundian illuminator whose fine illustrated manuscripts date between 1440 and 1465. During this period, he worked for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy; Philip I of Cro√ø, Governor of Luxembourg; and others. He decorated numerous works that survive, including the Roman de Girart de Roussillon from which his name is taken.
