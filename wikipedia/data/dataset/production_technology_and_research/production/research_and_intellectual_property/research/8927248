Jeanette Loff (born Janette Clarinda Lov; October 9, 1906 – August 4, 1942) was an American actress and singer. Born to Danish and Norwegian immigrants, Loff was raised throughout the Pacific Northwest, and began singing professionally as a lyric soprano and performing as an organist while a teenager in Portland, Oregon.
In 1927, she was signed to a film contract by Cecil B. DeMille, and worked as a contract player for Pathé Exchange and later, Universal Pictures. She appeared in over twenty films during the course of her seven-year career. Loff formally retired from acting in 1934, with her last screen credit in Joseph Santley's Million Dollar Baby (1934). She died on August 4, 1942 from ammonia poisoning in Los Angeles at the age of 35. Though law enforcement was unable to determine whether her death was an accident or a suicide, Loff's family maintained that she had been murdered.
