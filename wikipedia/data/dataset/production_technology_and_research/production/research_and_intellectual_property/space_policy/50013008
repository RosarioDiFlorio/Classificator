Electra is a satellite development project initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA) as the first partnership project under its ARTES-33 programme. In conjunction with satellite operator SES and satellite builder OHB Systems, the Electra project seeks to develop, launch and validate in orbit an electric-only propulsion platform for geostationary communications satellites of below 3 tonnes launch mass. Electra encompasses both a coordinated effort to develop a European full electric propulsion small geostationary satellite, and the implementation of a mission by SES providing flight heritage and in-orbit demonstration of the platform to gain market acceptance for the product.
At the time the project was initialised, it was hoped that the first of these next-generation spacecraft would be launched as an SES craft by the end of 2018. However, delays to the project have meant that the inaugural flight has been pushed to 2021.
