The colonization of the Moon is a proposed establishment of permanent human communities or robotic industries on the Moon.
Discovery of lunar water at the lunar poles by Chandrayaan-1 has renewed interest in the Moon. Polar colonies could also avoid the problem of long lunar nights – about 354 hours, a little more than two weeks – and take advantage of the Sun continuously, at least during the local summer (there is no data for the winter yet).
Permanent human habitation on a planetary body other than the Earth is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology has advanced, and concerns about the future of humanity on Earth have increased, the argument that space colonization as an achievable and worthwhile goal has gained momentum. Because of its proximity to Earth, the Moon has been seen as the most obvious natural expansion after Earth. There are also various projects in near future by space tourism startup companies for tourism on the Moon.
