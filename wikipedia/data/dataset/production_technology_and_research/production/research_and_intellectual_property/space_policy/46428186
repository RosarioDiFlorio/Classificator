The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is part of the Copernicus Programme and provides continuous data and information on atmospheric composition. The service describes the current situation, forecasts the situation a few days ahead, and analyses consistently retrospective data records for recent years. This service has around 10 years of developments, and its current precursor project, MACC-III (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate - Interim Implementation), is delivering the pre-operational Copernicus Atmosphere Service. The service is being implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
