Project Eagle is an interactive art demo of a colony on mars, it is not a game in the conventional sense. It was created by Blackbird Interactive Inc. in January 2017 for presentation at the 2017 D.I.C.E. Summit. In Project Eagle the Mars base titled "Eagle Base" is located at the foot of Mount Sharp, Aeolis Mons, in Quad 51 of Aeolis Palus in Gale Crater. This is near the site of the Curiosity Rover landing. Curiosity's landing site is marked with a plinth in Project Eagle.
