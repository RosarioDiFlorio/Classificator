The European Venus Explorer (EVE), known until 2007 as the Venus Entry Probe (VEP), is a proposed European Space Agency space probe to Venus. In the timeline of the 2005 TRS (technology reference study), the spacecraft was planned to be launched on a Soyuz-2/Fregat launch vehicle around 2013. However, submissions to act on the study in 2007 and 2010 have been rejected.
