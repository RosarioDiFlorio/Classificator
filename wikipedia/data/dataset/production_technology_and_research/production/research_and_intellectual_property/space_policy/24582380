The Open Concurrent Design Server (OCDS) is an initiative of the European Space Agency, ESA. The OCDS aimed to provide the building blocks of a Concurrent, Collaborative and Distributed Engineering for the European Space Industry, using Open Standards Information Models and Reference Libraries.
The OCDS aimed to be the vehicle to distribute ESA's Concurrent Design Facility Concurrent Design methodology and a set of tools to the Space industry, organisations and academia. At the same time it distributes an open data exchange standard for early phase space system engineering and design activities described in ECSS-E-TM-10-25.
The OCDS helps the European Space Community to:
Increase Data Management Capabilities, including Life Cycle Data Management
Support the information longevity objective
Achieve a hardware and software independent solution
Optimise the design process
Consolidate Design Models in a repository based on open standards
Improve communication to Contractors and partners, using Open and publicly available standards (e.g. ISO, ECSS, ....)
Streamline the communications to other ESA corporate applications using model based integration
Connect data to product assurance (PA/QA) activities.
