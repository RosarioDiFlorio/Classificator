An Orbital Replaceable Unit/Orbital replacement unit is a modular component of spacecraft that can be replaced upon failure by a robot or by an Extra-Vehicular Activity.
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was designed with 70 such parts. They include the scientific instruments and limited-life items such as batteries.
On HST some parts were designed from the start as ORUs (and all used captive bolts with a standard 7/16" double height hex head), later when it was decided to avoid returning HST to earth for repair, more systems and modules were designated as ORUs (but these use a wider variety of fasteners).
HST servicing mission 3A (SM3A) replaced (or added) 15 ORUs, e.g. it replaced the DF-224 computer with the Advanced Computer.
The electrical system of the International Space Station also has such subsystems that provide power generation, power distribution and energy storage.
