The European Physiology Module (EPM) is an International Standard Payload Rack for the Columbus Laboratory on board the International Space Station. The EPM rack was built by OHB-System in Bremen.
The EPM enables a better understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body. Research typically includes neuroscientific, cardiovascular, and physiological studies and investigations of metabolic processes.
The EPM performs physiological and biomedical tests and transmits the data to Earth for further analysis. The resulting data will provide insight into the human body's processes in a microgravity environment.
The EPM provides equipment for the study of the human body, including three science modules: two active modules, CARDIOLAB and MEEMM, and one module (sample collection kit, or SCK) that includes equipment to enable collection of biological samples (blood, urine, and saliva).
