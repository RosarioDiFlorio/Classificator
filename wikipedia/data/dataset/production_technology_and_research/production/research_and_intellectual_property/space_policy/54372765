NEM-1 is a module scheduled to arrive at the international space station somewhere around 2019/2020. It is going to dock to the Uzlovoy Module, which is scheduled to be attached to the Nauka Module after it is launched in 2018. If Nauka is canceled, then both the Uzlovoy module and NEM-1 would dock at the zenith port of Zvezda. It is also a required component for the OPSEK space station. The module is a new generation module which can replace the Zarya Functional Cargo Block (FGB) originally used in the TKS spacecraft which was the basis for the Zarya FGB module.
