The New Mexico Spaceport Authority is a non-governmental panel, appointed by the Governor of New Mexico, whose members represent the public sector in the development and construction of Spaceport America, a facility, under construction as of March 2012, that is expected to enter operation as the first privately operated active spaceport in the United States.
Spaceport America was built with State money and bond funding provided by county debt. Two-thirds of the $212 million used to build the spaceport was paid by the State of New Mexico with the rest provided by bonds backed by Do√±a Ana and Sierra county, which will be partially repaid by locally generated sales tax revenues. The state of New Mexico has privatized the operations of Spaceport America; the spaceport will be operated by Virgin Galactic, a component of the Virgin Group of global companies operated by Sir Richard Branson. While the Spaceport Authority will exercise public-sector oversight, Virgin Galactic will be the "anchor tenant" of the spaceport.
