Pays interdit (Forbidden Land) is a surrealist painting by Wolfgang Paalen, which in the final version of 1937 shows a drop-shaped stylized idol of femininity with tentacle-like arms, that stands in precarious proximity to an abyss opening unexpected in dark-crystalline forms to the observer. Three spherical space-bodies hover in front of them, two of which are shaped like falling, burning meteorites. The painting is the first oil painting by Paalen, that is artfully based on his surrealist technique of Fumage. It explores the theme of mortal fears and primordial femininity with a hermetical iconography. The painting is actually in a private collection.
