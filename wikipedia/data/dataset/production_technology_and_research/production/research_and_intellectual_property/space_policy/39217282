This is list of Mars analogs, which simulate aspects of the conditions human beings could experience during a future mission to Mars.
For example, in the 1960s the Soviets confined three cosmonauts for a year to prepare for longer space missions. Modern examples include an 120-day study in Hawaii to test a space food diet, and equipment tests inside Austrian mountain caves in 2012.
Mars analogs are sometimes chosen for their location, for example, Devon island is at 75Â°N latitude which provides solar radiance similar to the Martian Equator. Similarly, high altitudes can provide an equivalent to the low pressure of the Mars atmosphere
Among these are:
Mars-500, simulated a 520-day mission in Moscow.
Mars Analogue Research Station Program, simulated Mars habitats
Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station
Mars Desert Research Station
European Mars Analog Research Station
Australia Mars Analog Research Station

Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition, annual expeditions to remote sites
Concordia Station, multi-purpose Arctic base
HI-SEAS, crewed tests in Hawaiian mountains.
NEEMO, underwater base.
At about 28 miles (45 km) Earth altitude the pressure starts to be equivalent to Mars.
