The terraforming of Venus is the hypothetical process of engineering the global environment of the planet Venus in such a way as to make it suitable for human habitation. Terraforming Venus was first seriously proposed by the astronomer Carl Sagan in 1961, although fictional treatments, such as The Big Rain by Poul Anderson, preceded it. Adjustments to the existing environment of Venus to support human life would require at least three major changes to the planet. These three changes are closely interrelated, because Venus's extreme temperature is due to the greenhouse effect caused by its dense carbon-dioxide atmosphere:
Reducing Venus's surface temperature of 462 °C (864 °F).
Eliminating most of the planet's dense 9.2 MPa (91 atm) carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide atmosphere, via removal or conversion to some other form.
Addition of breathable oxygen to the atmosphere.
