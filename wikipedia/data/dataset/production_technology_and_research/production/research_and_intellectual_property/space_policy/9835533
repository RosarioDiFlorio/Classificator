This is a chronological list of expeditions to the International Space Station (ISS). All permanent ISS crews are named "Expedition n", where n is sequentially increased with each expedition. Resupply mission crews and space tourists are excluded (see List of human spaceflights to the ISS for details). ISS commanders are listed in italics. "Duration" refers to the crew and does not always correspond to "Flight up" or "Flight down".
