The Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex (Russian: Орбитальный Пилотируемый Сборочно-Экспериментальный Комплекс, Orbital'nyj Pilotirujemyj Sborochno-Eksperimental'nyj Kompleks) (ОПСЭК, OPSEK) is a Russian proposed third-generation modular space station in Low Earth orbit.
The proposal would use OPSEK to assemble components of manned interplanetary spacecraft destined for Mars, the Moon, and possibly Saturn. The returning crew would also recover on the station before landing on Earth. This OPSEK could form part of a future network of stations supporting manned exploration of the Solar System.
In early plans, the station would at first consist of modules from the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station (ISS). However in September 2017, the head of Roscosmos Igor Komarov said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied and there were now "no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS ... We keep the same position, that we should work on the ISS together with our partners.”
