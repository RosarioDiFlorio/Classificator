Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project concept to develop a reusable liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.
Additionally a family of derivative launch vehicles was proposed in order to take an advantage of economies of scale, further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like Vega and Arianespace Soyuz, the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit, and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.
German Aerospace Center studied Liquid Fly-back Boosters as a part of future launcher research program from 1999 to 2004. After the cancellation of the project, publications at DLR continued until 2009.
