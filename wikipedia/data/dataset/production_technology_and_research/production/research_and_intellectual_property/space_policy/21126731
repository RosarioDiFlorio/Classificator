Space Florida is the aerospace economic development agency of the State of Florida. The agency was created by consolidating three existing space entities into a single new organization via the Space Florida Act, enacted in May 2006 by the Florida Legislature. The predecessor entities were the Florida Space Authority, Florida Space Research Institute and Florida Aerospace Finance Corporation.
Space Florida is a "Preferred Partner" of the Google Lunar X PRIZE, and, as such, has offered an addition US$2 million bonus to teams that launch their Google Lunar X PRIZE-winning missions from the state of Florida.
