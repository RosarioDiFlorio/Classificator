Reginald George Turnill (12 May 1915 â€“ 12 February 2013) was the BBC's aviation (and space) correspondent for twenty years during the beginnings of manned space exploration and the early jet age in aviation, including the breakthrough in supersonic passenger flight represented by Concorde. He covered NASA's space missions and all the Apollo program moon missions for the BBC. Turnill's connection with the BBC, as a freelance, continued for some years after his official retirement.
