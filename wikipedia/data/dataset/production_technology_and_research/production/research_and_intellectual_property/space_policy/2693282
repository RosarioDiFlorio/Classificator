Australia Mars Analogue Research Station (MARS-Oz) is a station in Australia where the Mars Society will conduct geological exploration under constraints similar to those found on Mars. In 1998, the United States Mars Society agreed to work with Mars Society Australia, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the eventual human settlement on the Red Planet, which allowed this project to be administrated in Australia. Led by project manager David Willson, this will be the fourth Mars Analogue Research Station Program. The three previous stations were built in Devon Island in Arctic Canada in July 2000, a desert near Hanksville, Utah, and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The main objective behind the research is to anticipate and resolve conflicts that will arise on a Martian exploration by having a group of scientists and engineers work together and live in an analogue Mars environment.
