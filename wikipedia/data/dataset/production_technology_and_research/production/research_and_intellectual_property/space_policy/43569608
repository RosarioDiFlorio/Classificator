Villafranca Station (also known as VILSPA) is an ESTRACK satellite ground station in Spain, 30 kilometres (19 mi) north from the city of Madrid in a Villanueva de la Ca√±ada, within the area of European Space Astronomy Centre.
Station currently operates 15m S-band antenna marked VIL-1 capable of automatic tracking, ranging, frequency and timing measurements, monitoring, control and two-way communications. Additional facilities provide tracking, telemetry, telecommand and radiometric measurements.
In 2014 VIL-1 was upgraded to use SARAS (Spanish acronym for Fast Acquisition of Satellites and Launchers) system allowing easier estimation of the beam direction increasing tracking precision and accuracy.
In 2012 first antenna of the Villafranca Station, build in 1974 and designated VIL-1, was passed to the Cooperation through Education in Science and Astronomy Research project and currently is used as a radio telescope for educational purposes.
