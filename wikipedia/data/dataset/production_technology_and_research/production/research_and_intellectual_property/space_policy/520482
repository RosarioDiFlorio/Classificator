William Thomson Hay  (6 December 1888 â€“ 18 April 1949) was an English comedian, actor, author, film director and amateur astronomer who came to notice for his theatrical sketch as a jocular schoolmaster, known as Dr. Muffin. The acts in which Hay performed the schoolmaster sketch became known as "The Fourth Form at St. Michael's". Hay toured with act and appeared in America, Canada, Australia and South Africa. From 1934 to 1943, he was a prolific film star in Britain, and was ranked the third highest grossing star at the British Box Office in 1938, behind George Formby and Gracie Fields.
Hay worked with Gainsborough Pictures from 1935 to 1940, during which time he developed a partnership with Graham Moffatt, an insolent overweight schoolboy, and Moore Marriott, a toothless old man. Hay's 1937 film, with Moffatt and Marriott, Oh, Mr. Porter! was credited by The Times as being "a comic masterpiece of the British cinema", while the writer, Jimmy Perry, cited the film as an influence for developing the key characters in Dad's Army.
Hay often portrayed incompetent authority figures who attempted to conceal their incompetence but whose true traits were exposed by those around him. As well as being incompetent, his characters are often immoral, such as his portrayal of a vicar involved in horse betting in Dandy Dick, a fraudster who lies about his career as a distinguished sea captain in Windbag the Sailor and a prison warden, Dr Benjamin Twist, in Convict 99 who obtains his job by false pretenses. He is often compared to W. C. Fields, who portrayed characters similar to that of Hay, often being misanthropic, self-centered scoundrels who still remained sympathetic despite their characteristics.
Hay was also an amateur astronomer, and in 1933 gained fame for discovering a Great White Spot on Saturn. He built his own observatory, and was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
