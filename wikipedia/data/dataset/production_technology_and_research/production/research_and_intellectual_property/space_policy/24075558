The European Data Relay System (EDRS) system is a planned European constellation of state of the art GEO satellites that will relay information and data between satellites, spacecraft, UAVs, and ground stations. The designers intend the system to provide almost full-time communication, even with satellites in low Earth orbit that often have reduced visibility from ground stations. It will make on-demand data available to, for example, rescue workers who want near-real-time satellite data of a crisis region.
The system is being developed as part of the ARTES 7 programme and is intended to be an independent, European satellite system that reduces time delays in the transmission of large quantities of data. The programme is similar to the American Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System that was set up to support the Space Shuttleâ€”but EDRS will use a new generation Laser Communication Terminal (LCT) technology. The laser terminal transmits 1.8 Gbit/s across 45,000 km, the distance of a LEO-GEO link. Such a terminal was successfully tested during in-orbit verification between the German radar satellite TerraSAR-X and the American NFIRE satellite. It is also embarked on the commercial telecommunication satellite Alphasat to perform further system- and operational service demonstrations and in the operational sentinel satellites part of the European Copernicus Programme.
