The Jovian Europa Orbiter (JEO) was a feasibility study by the European Space Agency for a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. JEO would be capable of collecting information about Europa by orbiting it, and would have worked together with the Jovian Relay Spacecraft (JRS) and the Jovian Minisat Explorer (JME).
The Jovian Europa Orbiter was part of ESA's "Technology Reference Studies", which was superseded in 2007 by ESA's "Cosmic Vision", which includes the Europa Jupiter System Mission.
