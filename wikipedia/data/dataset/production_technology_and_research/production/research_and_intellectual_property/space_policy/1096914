Hopper was a proposed European Space Agency (ESA) orbital spaceplane and reusable launch vehicle.
Hopper was one of several proposals developed by the ESA to function as a European reusable launch vehicle (RLV), which was envisioned to be used for the inexpensive delivery of satellite payloads into orbit as early as 2015. A prototype of Hopper, known as Phoenix, was a German-led European project which involved the construction and testing of a one-seventh scale model of the larger Hopper. On 8 May 2004, a single test flight of the Phoenix was conducted at the North European Aerospace Test range in Kiruna, Sweden.
