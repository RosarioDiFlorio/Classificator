Human outposts are artificially-created, controlled human habitats located in environments inhospitable for humans, such as on the ocean floor, in space or on another planet.
The logistics and difficulties inherent in such ventures have been heavily explored in written science fiction, inspiring several scientists and governments around the world, some of whom have already started working toward small-scale trials.
In the future, Earth-like planets may be found, as popularly shown in science fiction films of current times, which are habitable for humans and other earthlings and hence human habitats there will not have to be artificially created or controlled and yet human outposts may be able to flourish just like cities here on Earth.
