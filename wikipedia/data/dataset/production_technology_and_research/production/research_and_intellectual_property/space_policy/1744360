Mars is the focus of much scientific study about possible human colonization. Mars' surface conditions and past presence of water, make it arguably the most hospitable planet in the Solar System besides Earth. Mars requires less energy per unit mass (delta-v) to reach from Earth than any planet, except Venus.
Permanent human habitation on other planets is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology advances, and concerns about humanity's future on Earth increase, arguments favoring space colonization gain momentum. Other reasons for colonizing space include economic interests, long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes, and sheer curiosity.
One of Elon Musk's stated goals, through his company SpaceX, is to make such colonization possible by providing transportation.
