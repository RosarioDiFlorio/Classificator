Francisco Javier "Frank" Duarte (born c. 1954) is a Chilean-born laser physicist and author/editor of several well-known books on tunable lasers and quantum optics. He introduced the generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory, has discovered various multiple-prism grating oscillator laser configurations, and introduced polymer-nanoparticle gain media. These contributions have found applications in a variety of fields including:
atomic vapor laser isotope separation
laser medicine
laser microscopy
laser pulse compression
laser spectroscopy
nonlinear optics
tunable diode lasers
Duarte's research has mainly focused on physical and laser optics and has taken place at a number of institutions in the academic, industrial, and defense sectors.
