A space station is a manned satellite designed to remain in low Earth orbit for a long period of time. In general, space stations have the ability for other spacecraft to dock to them. As of 2017, the International Space Station is the only operational manned space station currently in orbit. Previous stations include the Salyut and Almaz series, Skylab, and, most recently, Mir and Tiangong 1.
Space stations are used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body. They also serve as a platform for extended scientific studies. All space stations have been designed with the intention of rotating multiple crews, with each crew member staying aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. As of 2012, Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov, and Valeriy Polyakov have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard Mir.
Space stations have been used for both military and civilian purposes. The first military-use space station was Salyut 2, which was launched by the Soviet Almaz program in 1973. The Soviet Union also claimed the first civilian space station with the launch of Salyut 1. As of 2012, Russia, China, and private companies are building space stations.
