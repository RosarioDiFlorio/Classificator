Mars One is an organization that has proposed to land the first humans on Mars and establish a permanent human colony there by 2032.
Mars One consists of two entities: the not-for-profit Mars One Foundation, and the for-profit company Mars One Ventures. The Mars One Foundation, based in the Netherlands, implements and manages the mission. Mars One Ventures holds all monetization rights, including broadcasting rights.
The private spaceflight project is led by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, who announced the Mars One project in May 2012.
Mars One's original concept included launching a robotic lander and orbiter as early as 2020 to be followed by a human crew of four in 2024 and one in 2026.
Organizers plan for the crew to be selected from applicants to become the first permanent residents of Mars with no plan of returning to Earth.
Partial funding options include a proposed television documentary program documenting the journey.
The project's schedule, technical and financial feasibility, and ethics, have been criticized by scientists, engineers and those in the aerospace industry.
In February 2015, the primary contractors on the initial pre-Phase A contracts had completed all studies paid for by Mars One at that time. The current state of the Mission Plan Deliverables (either in the form of Studies or actual Hardware) will be tracked in Table 2 in the Technology section.
The Mars One organization is the controlling stockholder of the for-profit Interplanetary Media Group.
