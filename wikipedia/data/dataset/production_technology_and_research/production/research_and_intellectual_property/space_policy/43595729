The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) is a device to deploy CubeSats into orbit from the International Space Station.
Currently, there are two CubeSat deployers on board the International Space Station (ISS): The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD) and the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD). The J-SSOD is the first of its kind to deploy small satellites from the International Space Station. The NRCSD is the first commercially operated small satellite deployer from the ISS, maximizing full capabilities of each airlock cycle of deployments.
CubeSats belong to a class of research spacecraft called nanosatellites. The basic cube-shaped satellites measure 10 centimeters (3.9 in) on each side, weigh less than 3 pounds (1.4 kg), and have a volume of about 1 liter (0.22 imp gal; 0.26 U.S. gal), although CubeSats are built, and deployed, that are multiples of 10 cm in length.
As of 2014, one method of getting CubeSats to orbit is to transport them aboard a larger spacecraft as part of a cargo load to a larger space station. When this is done, deploying the CubeSats into orbit as a separate artificial satellite requires a special apparatus, such as the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer. The NRCSD is put into position to be grabbed by one of the ISSâ€™s robotic arms, which then places the CubeSat deployer into the correct position externally mounted to the ISS to be able to release the miniature satellites into proper orbit.
