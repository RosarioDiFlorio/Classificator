The Tethered Experiment for Mars inter-Planetary Operations (TEMPOÂ³) is a CubeSat-based satellite meant to demonstrate artificial gravity generation. After launch, the spacecraft will spin end over end to create gravity-like acceleration at both ends of a tether. The project is being run by the Mars Society, and will build from high-altitude tests to eventual orbital flight in 2011.
