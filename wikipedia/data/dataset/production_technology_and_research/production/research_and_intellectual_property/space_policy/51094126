The NanoSat MO Framework is an on-board software framework for nanosatellites based on CCSDS Mission Operation services. The NanoSat MO Framework introduces the well-known concept of "apps" existing in smartphones and tablets to on-board software for spacecraft. This allows an app to be easily developed, tested, deployed and updated on a spacecraft at any time without causing any major problem. Additionally the same “app” can be used on different spacecraft platforms. The NanoSat MO Framework apps are able to publish telemetry, receive telecommands or access the GPS device on OPS-SAT and on other nanosatellites without any change in the code.
