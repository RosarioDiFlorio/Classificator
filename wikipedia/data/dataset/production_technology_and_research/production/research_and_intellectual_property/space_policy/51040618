This is a list of manned and unmanned flights of Soyuz series spacecraft.
The Soyuz programme is a human spaceflight programme that was initiated by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok and Voskhod programmes. Since the 1990s, as the successor state to the Soviet Union, Russia has continued and expanded the programme, which became part of a multinational collaboration to ensure a permanent human presence in low Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS). Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, Soyuz spacecraft are the exclusive vessels ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS.
