The Student Space Exploration & Technology Initiative (SSETI) is a unique project put into execution by students from different universities spread over European countries. In collaboration with space industry they aim to build microsatellites together.
The main objective of this initiative is to create a network of students, educational institutions and organisations (on the Internet) facilitating the distributed design, construction and launch of (micro)-satellites and other spacecraft.
Most universities do not have capabilities to build their own complete satellite. The SSETI aims to combine different academic capabilities to realise pan-European student missions. Space projects, which are beyond the local existing capabilities, will be made possible through the fragmentation and redistribution of a large number of small, locally achievable tasks. Ambitious projects, such as a lunar lander, may be realised by this distributed development.
