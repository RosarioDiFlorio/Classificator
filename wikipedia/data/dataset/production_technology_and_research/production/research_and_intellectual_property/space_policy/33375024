IAR-111 Excelsior is a supersonic mothership project, designed by ARCA Space Corporation, intended to transport a rocket payload up to 18,000 m (59,000 ft) and for developing space tourism related technologies. The aircraft is to be constructed almost entirely from composite materials, and will be designed for take-off and landing from the sea surface.
