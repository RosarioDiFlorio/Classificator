ARCA Space Corporation is an aerospace company based in Las Cruces, New Mexico that builds space rockets and other manned and unmanned aircraft intended for space exploration. It was founded in 1999 as a non-governmental organization in Romania by Dumitru Popescu and other rocket and aeronautics enthusiasts. Since then ARCA launched two stratospheric rockets, four large scale stratospheric balloons including a cluster balloon and was awarded two governmental contracts with the Romanian Government and one contract with the European Space Agency. ARCA Aerospace is currently developing a Single Stage to Orbit rocket designed to be cost effective rather than re-usable.
