ISS wave started as a week-long expression of human solidarity which encouraged people, worldwide, to identify when the International Space Station passed over their homes, and wave to the passing astronauts. Participants shared their observations with others via Twitter.
It was set up by Dr Karen E James, Dr Lucy Rogers and Dr Richard P Grant
