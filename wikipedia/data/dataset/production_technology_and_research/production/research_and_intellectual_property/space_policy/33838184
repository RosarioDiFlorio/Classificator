The SeaOrbiter, also known as Sea Orbiter (two words), is an oceangoing research vessel. Construction is to begin in late 2014. Similar to a space ship, the SeaOrbiter is planned to allow scientists and others a residential yet mobile research station positioned under the oceans' surface. The station will have laboratories, workshops, living quarters and a pressurized deck to support divers and submarines.
SeaOrbiter is a project of the "Floating oceanographic laboratory" organisation. It is headed by French architect Jacques Rougerie, oceanographer Jacques Piccard and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien. The cost is expected to be around $52.7 million.
