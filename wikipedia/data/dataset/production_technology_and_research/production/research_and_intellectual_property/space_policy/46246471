The One-Year Mission was a scientific research project aboard the International Space Station, which studied the health effects of long-term spaceflight. Scott Kelly and Mikhail Korniyenko spent 342 days (11 months, 3 days) in space, with scientists performing medical experiments. Kelly and Kornienko launched on 27 March 2015 on Soyuz TMA-16M along with Gennady Padalka. The mission encompassed Expeditions 43, 44, 45 and 46. The pair safely landed in Kazakhstan on March 2, 2016, returning aboard Soyuz TMA-18M with Sergey Volkov. The mission supported the NASA Twins study, which helps shed light on the health effects of long duration spaceflight, which is of interest for Mars missions especially.
