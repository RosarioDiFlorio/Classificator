LightSail 2 is a project to demonstrate controlled solar sailing using a CubeSat developed by The Planetary Society, a global non-profit organization devoted to space exploration. The spacecraft core measures 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters, and its kite-shaped solar sail deploys into a total area of 32 square meters (340 sq ft).
LightSail2 is currently scheduled to be launched as part of a US Air Force Space Test Program package (STP-2) on a Falcon Heavy rocket in early 2018.
On May 20, 2015, a nearly identical demonstration spacecraft, LightSail 1 (formerly called LightSail-A), was launched, and deployed its solar sail on June 7, 2015.
