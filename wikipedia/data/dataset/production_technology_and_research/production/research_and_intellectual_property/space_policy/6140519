The Satellite Control and Operation System 2000 (SCOS-2000)  is the generic satellite Mission Control System (MCS) software infrastructure developed and maintained by the European Space Agency (ESA/ESOC) in collaboration with European industry and deployed for missions such as Radarsat 2, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, Cryosat, Mars Express, Venus Express, GOCE, Herschel, Planck, Rosetta, Cryosat-2, Galileo, MetOp (EUMETSAT Polar System), LISA Pathfinder, SWARM, Gaia, SENTINEL spacecrafts or EXOMARS orbiters. Upcoming missions that will deploy SCOS-2000 include MetOp-SG (EUMETSAT Polar System Second Generation), METEOSAT Third Generation, Aeolus, EarthCARE, BepiColombo, SOLO or EUCLID.
It is a generic system, tailored for the specific needs of each mission, being the main purpose to minimize the development of the MCS for each of the new upcoming missions, sharing between them as much of the functionality as possible in order to have common lines of software maintenance . The core of the system provides comprehensive telemetry processing, manual and automatic commanding, on-board software management, mission archive and web-based data distribution.
SCOS-2000 is part of ESA suite for mission control systems components (MICONYS) .
