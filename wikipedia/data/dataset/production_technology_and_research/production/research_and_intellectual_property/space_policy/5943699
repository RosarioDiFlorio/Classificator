Genesis I is an experimental space habitat designed and built by the private American firm Bigelow Aerospace and launched in 2006. It was the first module to be sent into orbit by the company, and is testing various systems, materials and techniques related to determining the viability of long-term inflatable space structures. Such structures, including this module and others built by Bigelow Aerospace, are based on the NASA TransHab design, which provides increased interior volume at a reduced launch diameter and potentially reduced mass compared to traditional rigid structures.
The spacecraft remains in orbit, which allows researchers to continue testing the long-term viability of expandable space structures.
