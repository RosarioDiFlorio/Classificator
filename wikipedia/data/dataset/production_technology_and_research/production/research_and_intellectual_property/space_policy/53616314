Archinaut is a technology project developing the necessary additive manufacturing technology to build large-scale structures in space. The two-year project started in 2016 and was funded by NASA to the tune of US$20 million; it is being performed by a partnership of Made In Space, Northrup Grumman, and Oceaneering Space Systems. Its formal name is "Versatile In-Space Robotic Precision Manufacturing and Assembly System".
The initial result will be a 3D printer capable of operating in-orbit, installed on a pod attached outside the International Space Station. Archinaut will include a robotic arm and will be able to fabricate, assemble and repair structures and machinery. Made In Space is building Archinaut's 3D printer, Oceaneering Space Systems its manipulator arm, and Northrop Grumman is in charge of control electronics, software, and integration with the space station.
The first structures to be built with Archinaut are antenna reflectors for communication satellites. Further expansion may involve three robotic arms enabling Archinaut to grab decommissioned satellites and recycle their components.
