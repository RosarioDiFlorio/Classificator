The Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission is a proposed space probe which would study and demonstrate the kinetic effects of crashing an impactor spacecraft into an asteroid moon. The mission is intended to test whether a spacecraft could successfully deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It would be composed of two spacecraft: Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), which would orbit the asteroid, and Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), which would impact its moon. Besides the observation of the change of orbital parameters of the asteroid moon, the observation of the plume, the crater, and the freshly exposed material will provide unique information for asteroid deflection, science and mining communities.
As of 2016, the mission is still in the conceptual phase with a proposed launch for AIM in October 2020, and for DART in July 2021. The impact of DART would be in October 2022 during a close approach to Earth. In December 2016 the AIM spacecraft portion of AIDA was not funded to help pay for ExoMars. However, NASA has said plans to continue with its portion of the mission. This works out well as in the early 2010s NASA planetary funding was reduced in favour of asteroid science to the point it could not fund its part of ExoMars.
