An orbital ring is a concept for a space elevator that consists of an artificial ring placed around the Earth that rotates at an angular rate that is faster than the rotation of the Earth. It is a giant formation of astroengineering proportions.
The structure is intended to be used as a space station or as a planetary vehicle for very high speed transportation or space launch.
The original orbital ring concept is related to the space fountain and launch loop.
