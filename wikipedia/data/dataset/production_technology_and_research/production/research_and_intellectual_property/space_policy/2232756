Geostrategy in space (also referred to as astrostrategy) deals with the strategic considerations of location and resources in outer space territory. Initial geostrategic concerns, as humans reach further outside Earth, are expected to focus on how strategic locations and resources relate to the Earth itself. Following further development of human presence in space, geostrategic concerns are expected to place greater focus on the relation of geostrategic locations and resources in space with one another.
An important aspect of the geopolitics of space is the prevention of a military threat to Earth from outer space.
International cooperation on space projects has resulted in the creation of new national space agencies. By 2005 there were 35 national civilian space agencies.
