Space and survival refers to the idea that the long-term survival of the human species and civilization requires proper use of the resources of outer space and the need for space colonization and space science. The concept posits that inaction could lead to human extinction. A related observation is that limited time and resources may be available for the colonization of space. Various scenarios for human survival have been discussed in science and popular culture, particularly humanity's prospects after catastrophic events in the solar system and factors that could help or hinder survival.
The earliest appearance of a connection between space exploration and human survival appears in Louis J. Halleâ€™s 1980 article in Foreign Affairs, in which he stated colonization of space will keep humanity safe should global nuclear warfare occur. This idea has received more attention in recent years as advancing technology makes cheap space travel more feasible.
