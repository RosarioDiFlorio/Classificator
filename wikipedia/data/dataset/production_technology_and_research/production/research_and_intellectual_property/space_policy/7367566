collectSPACE is an online publication and community for space history enthusiasts featuring articles and photos about space artifacts and memorabilia, information on past, current, and upcoming space events, space history collecting resources, and links to other space-related websites. It also provides an array of message boards where registered members can discuss various aspects of space history and the space collecting hobby; buy, sell, or trade items; or pose "what if?" historical questions. Users often abbreviate the website's name as "cS," and members often refer to each other as "cSers."
collectSPACE, founded and edited by Robert Pearlman, has published articles and reviews by authors Andrew Chaikin (A Man on the Moon), Kris Stoever (For Spacious Skies), James Oberg (Red Star in Orbit), Frederick Ordway III (Imagining Space), Francis French (In the Shadow of the Moon), David Hitt (Homesteading Space), Russell Still (Relics of the Space Race), Colin Burgess (Into That Silent Sea), Jay Gallentine (Ambassadors From Earth) and Apollo astronaut Walt Cunningham, among others.
