The International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) has been adopted by the International Space Station (ISS) program to support efficient integration and interchangeability of payload hardware â€“ and to maximize joint research among investigators. The 37 ISPR slots for science payloads on ISS provide a common set of interfaces regardless of location. Nonstandard services are also provided at selected locations to support specific payload requirements.
