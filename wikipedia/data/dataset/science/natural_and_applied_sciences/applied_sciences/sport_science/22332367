The Adelaide Super-Drome is located at Adelaide, South Australia's State Sports Park, Main North Road, Gepps Cross. The Super-Drome was designed by Architect Carlo Gnezda and was opened in 1993. From 1993 the venue was managed and promoted by 1984 Olympic Games Men's team pursuit gold medalist Michael Turtur. He was assisted by the venue's track designer Ron Webb in bringing out international competitors.
It is the headquarters for the Australian Institute of Sportâ€™s Track Cycling Program due to its fully accredited international-standard training and competition facilities, for Adelaide's mild climate, and for being a short distance to the Adelaide Hills.
