2,3-Butanediol fermentation is anaerobic fermentation of glucose with 2,3-butanediol as one of the end products. The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is
2 pyruvate + NADH --> 2CO2 + 2,3-butanediol.
Butanediol fermentation is typical for the facultative anaerobes Klebsiella and Enterobacter and is tested for using the Vogesâ€“Proskauer (VP) test.
The metabolic function of 2,3-butanediol is not known, although some have speculated that it was an evolutionary advantage for these microorganisms to produce a neutral product that's less inhibitory than other partial oxidation products and doesn't reduce the pH as much as mixed acids. .
