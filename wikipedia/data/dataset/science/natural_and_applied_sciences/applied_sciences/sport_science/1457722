FoxTrax, also referred to as the glowing puck, is an augmented reality system that was utilized by Fox Sports' telecasts of the National Hockey League (NHL). The system was intended to help television viewers visually follow the puck on the ice; it utilized modified hockey pucks containing shock sensors and infrared emitters, which were then read by sensors and computer systems to generate on-screen graphics to enhance vision of the puck for the television audience, such as a blue "glow" around the puck, and trails to indicate the hardness and speed of shots.
The system was first used during the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and was used until the end of the 1997-98 season. FoxTrax received mixed reviews from viewers and critics; although some viewers thought that FoxTrax helped them follow the game easier, the concept was criticized for distracting from the game and being a gimmick.
