SportVU is a camera system hung from the rafters that collects data at a rate of 25 times per second and follows the ball and every player on the court. SportVU provides in-depth statistics, including real-time player and ball positioning through sophisticated software and statistical algorithms. SportVU's speed, distance, and possession data provide key insights and analysis points.
SportVU player tracking delivers statistical information via real-time X, Y positioning of players and X, Y, Z positioning of the ball. By leveraging this data, STATS is able to present performance metrics for players and teams to leverage.
With a foundation in soccer, STATS expanded the core SportVU technology into basketball beginning with the 2010-2011 NBA season. Today, STATS is the Official Tracking partner of the NBA. The NBA is using these statistics captured by SportVU on NBA.com and NBATV as well as in arenas across the country to provide fans with insight. SportVU statistics are also being utilized by every team in the league to support their pro analytics and aid in player development.
