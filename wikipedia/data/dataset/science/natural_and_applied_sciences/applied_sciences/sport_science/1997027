Founded on April 3, 1973, by Barclay Harding Warburton III, the American Sail Training Association (ASTA), now known as Tall Ships America, is currently the largest sail training association in the world and a founding member of Sail Training International.
From her humble beginnings with only a handful of vessels sailing the New England waters, Tall Ships America has grown into an international institution with more than 250 tall ships and sail training vessels representing 25 different countries and navigating all the world's oceans.
ASTA was created by Barclay Harding Warburton III following his return from The Tall Ships' Races in Europe in 1972 where he joined the USCGC Eagle with his brigantine Black Pearl as the first US vessels to participate in the races.
A 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Tall Ships America's mission is to encourage character building through sail training, promote sail training to the North American public, and support education under sail.
Tall Ships America organizes the TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE Series, a series of sail training races, rallies and maritime festivals that rotate every three years around the Atlantic, Pacific and Great Lakes Coasts of North America. In 2016, the TALL SHIPS CHALLENGE series is in the Great Lakes. In 2015, the series was on the East Coast with stops in Cape Charles, VA, Philadelphia, PA/Camden, NJ, Greenport, NY and Portland, ME. Following that event, the organizer of the Portland event, Tall Ships Portland, became the first official chapter of Tall Ships America.
