Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which a portion of the heart becomes thickened without an obvious cause. This results in the heart being less able to pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications include heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and sudden cardiac death.
HCM is most commonly inherited from a person's parents. It is often due to mutations in certain genes involved with making heart muscle proteins. Other causes may include Fabry disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and certain medications such as tacrolimus. It is type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the heart muscle. Diagnosis often involves an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress testing. Genetic testing may also be done.
Treatment may include the use of beta blockers, diuretics, or disopyramide. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended in those with certain types of irregular heartbeat. Surgery, in the form of a septal myectomy or heart transplant, may be done in those who do not improve with other measures. With treatment, the risk of death from the disease is less than one percent a year.
HCM affects about one in 500 people. Rates in men and women are about equal. People of all ages may be affected. The first modern description of the disease was by Donald Teare in 1958.
