Grudge Training Center (GTC) was a mixed martial arts training center founded by coach Trevor Wittman in 2009. Originally located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, GTC relocated to Arvada, Colorado in 2013. The gym was an affiliate of Jackson's Submission Fighting. To devote more attention to his sports equipment company ONX Sports, Wittman closed Grudge in November 2016, with Grudge trainer Jake Ramos opening the Genesis Training Center to assume most of Grudge's former personnel, membership and operations.
