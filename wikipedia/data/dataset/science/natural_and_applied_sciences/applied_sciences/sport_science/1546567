An altitude tent is a sealed tent used to simulate a higher altitude with reduced oxygen. The basic concept of living or training at altitude is to cause the body to adapt to the lower oxygen content by producing more oxygen-carrying red blood cells and hemoglobin. Training or spending time at a higher altitude will cause the body to adapt to the higher altitude and provide enhanced performance when returning to a lower altitude. Mountain climbers can use them to avoid altitude sickness, and athletes can use them to enhance performance at lower altitudes.
