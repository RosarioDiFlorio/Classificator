Gracie Barra is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Association, with over 500 schools on six continents. The organization was founded by Carlos Gracie, Jr., (to the members of Gracie Barra, he is known as Master Carlos.) who was born on January 17, 1956 and grew up heavily influenced by his family, especially his father Carlos Gracie Sr. and his brother Rolls Gracie. While working as Roll's assistant instructor, Rolls suddenly died and Carlos was asked to assume the head instructor role. As one of the latest count from the organization, they have graduated more than 600 black belts all over the world.
The very first Gracie Barra school was first founded in the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro in 1986. In a few years Carlos Gracie Jr. was able to turn Gracie Barra into one of the most dominant teams in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu winning many consecutive world titles. Despite the outstanding results in tournaments, Carlos Gracie Jr. worked hard to create a positive learning environment where all kinds of people could learn the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At the school, people can see world champions training with lawyers, doctors, business men, etc. on a mutual supportive environment dedicated to development of the individual and strengthening of the team spirit.
