The Ring of Honor promotion also runs a professional wrestling school, the ROH Wrestling Academy in Bristol, Pennsylvania. Originally named the "ROH Wrestling Academy", ROH announced in July 2016 that the following month it was re-opening the school as the ROH Dojo. Delirious operates as the head trainer of the school with Cheeseburger and Will Ferrara as his assistants. previous head trainers of the academy include former ROH World Champions CM Punk, Austin Aries, and Bryan Danielson. From 2005 to 2008, ROH used a "Top of the Class" trophy to promote the students on the main show; while wrestlers win and lose the Trophy in matches, the School's head trainer chooses the winners.
