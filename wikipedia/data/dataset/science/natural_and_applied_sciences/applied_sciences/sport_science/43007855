Symbiotic fermentation is a form of fermentation in which multiple organisms (yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and others) interact in order to produce the desired product. For example, a yeast may produce ethanol, which is then consumed by an acetic acid bacterium.
Examples of traditionally fermented products that use symbiotic fermentation include:
Sake,
Lambic beer styles,
Shochu,
Vinegar
Soy sauce
