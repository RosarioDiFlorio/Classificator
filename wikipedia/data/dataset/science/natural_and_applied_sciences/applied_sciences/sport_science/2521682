Training effect refers to specific changes in muscular, cardiovascular, and neurohumoral systems that lead to improvement in functional capacity and strength due to regular endurance or resistance training. It has also been defined as a reaction to the adaptive responses of the body created by a training program or as "an elevation of metabolism produced by exercise".
Kenneth H. Cooper for the United States Air Force discovered this effect in the late 1960s and coined the term.
The measured effects were that muscles of respiration were strengthened, the heart was strengthened, blood pressure was sometimes lowered and the total amount of blood and number of red blood cells increased, making the blood a more efficient carrier of oxygen. VO2 Max was increased.
