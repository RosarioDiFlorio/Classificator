Charles Latham Gaines, Jr. (born January 6, 1942) is an American writer and outdoorsman, notable for numerous works in both the fiction and non-fiction genres. His writing most typically concerns the outdoors sports of fishing in general and fly fishing in particular, as well as upland bird hunting and mountaineering, often with an intellectual and philosophical bent, and an eye towards the various cultures and traditions surrounding different forms of fishing around the world.
In addition to his outdoors writings, Gaines covered the "Golden Age" of professional bodybuilding and is the author of Pumping Iron, considered the definitive journalistic work in that field, and credited in large part for bringing greater public awareness to what was formerly a little-known subculture, as well as helping to launch the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Gaines also narrated and contributed to the documentary film of the same name.
Gaines is active in the conservation movement and in particular the stewardship of the North American Atlantic Salmon fisheries. He has served on the board of directors of the Atlantic Salmon Federation.
