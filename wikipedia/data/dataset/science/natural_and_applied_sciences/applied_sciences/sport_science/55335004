Sports economics is a discipline of economics focused on its relationship to sports. It covers both the ways in which economists can study the distinctive institutions of sports, and the ways in which sports can allow economists to research many topics, including discrimination and antitrust law. The theoretical foundations of the discipline are heavily based on microeconomics. As of 2006, about 100 to 120 college professors taught sports economics courses.
