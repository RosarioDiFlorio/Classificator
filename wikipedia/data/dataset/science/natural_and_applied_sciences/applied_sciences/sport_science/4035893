1st & Ten is a computer system that generates and displays a yellow first down line that a television viewer sees during a live broadcast of a football game to make it easier for them to follow play on the field. The line is not physically present on the field, and is seen only by the television audience.
Some television football broadcasts change the color of the line from yellow to red on 4th down, or show a second computer-generated line (usually blue in color) that marks the line of scrimmage. Other lines are also projected to show other types of field position, including markings for the red zone and the optimum maximum distance for a placekicker's statistical field goal range. In extreme situations, such as snowstorm or blizzard conditions, an entire virtual field with yard and boundary markers can be projected onto the field in order to allow league officials, broadcasters and viewers some way to follow action when all field markings are obscured by snow, fog or mud.
The system makes use of a combination of motion sensors mounted on the broadcast cameras to record what they are viewing, and/or the use of match moving computer graphics technology and an enhanced version of chroma key or "green screen" technology.
(A competing system using different technology is called L-VIS for Live Video Insertion System.)
