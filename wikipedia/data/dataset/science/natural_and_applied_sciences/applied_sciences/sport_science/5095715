There are three National Sports Centres as part of Sport England's strategy to create an elite of English world class sporting talent:
Bisham Abbey
Lilleshall
Plas y Brenin
Each centre provides elite athletes with a range of specialist facilities, equipment, expertise and residential accommodation suitable for training and competition. The centres also offer full facilities for the general public including conferencing and banqueting, as well as beginners and improvers programmes in most of the activities that take place at each site.
Former centres were located at Crystal Palace and Holme Pierrepont.
