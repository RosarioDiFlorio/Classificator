The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is an American stadium complex located in the Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park in Queens, New York City, which has been the home of the US Open Grand Slam tennis tournament played every year in August and September since 1978. It is operated by the United States Tennis Association (USTA). The facility has 22 courts inside its 46.5 acres (0.188 km2; 0.0727 sq mi) and 11 in the adjoining park. The complex's three stadiums are among the largest tennis stadiums in the world, with Arthur Ashe Stadium topping the global list with a listed capacity of 23,200. All 33 courts have used the DecoTurf cushioned acrylic surface since the facility was built in 1978.
Located near Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets, the tennis center is open to the public for play 11 months out of the year (closed during inclement weather and in August/September due to the US Open), barring tournaments the USTA holds (such as junior and wood-racquet competitions).
On August 28, 2006, the USTA National Tennis Center was rededicated as the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
