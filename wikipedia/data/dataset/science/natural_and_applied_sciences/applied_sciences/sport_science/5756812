The Port Washington Tennis Academy, located in Long Island, New York, is the largest indoor tennis facility on the U.S. East Coast, with 17 indoor courts. Founded in 1966 as a non-profit tennis facility, it has an internationally acclaimed junior tennis development program. John McEnroe (under coaches Tony Palafox and Stanley Matthews) and Vitas Gerulaitis developed their games here, and famed Australian coach Harry Hopman worked at the facility late in his life.
