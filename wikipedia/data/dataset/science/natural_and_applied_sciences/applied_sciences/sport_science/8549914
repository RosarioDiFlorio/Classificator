The Sport Wales National Centre (Welsh: Canolfan Genedlaethol Chwaraeon Cymru) is a sports facility in Cardiff, Wales, set up to assist the development of elite athletes in Wales. The Centre, owned and operated by Sport Wales, was established by the then Sports Council for Wales in 1971 as the National Sports Centre for Wales. Renamed the Welsh Institute of Sport in 1994, it has been known as the Sport Wales National Centre since April 2010.
The Centre is located in Sophia Gardens, Cardiff and opened on 30 October 1971, with the official opening by Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne on 12 June 1972. The main building housing the indoor sports halls is by F. D. Williamson & Associates and is described in The Buildings of Wales as "An impressive piece of minimalism".
Several governing bodies of sports in Wales are based at the Centre. It hosts the Welsh International Badminton Championship every year in December. Welsh national teams that train at the Centre include badminton, netball, gymnastics, field hockey, shooting and judo.
