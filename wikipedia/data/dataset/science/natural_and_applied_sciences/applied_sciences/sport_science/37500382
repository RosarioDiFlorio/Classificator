Those involved in the care of athletes should be alert to the possibility of infectious disease for the following reasons:
There is the chance, or even the expectation, of contact or collision with another player, or the playing surface, which may be a mat or artificial turf.
The opportunities for skin breaks, obvious or subtle, are present and compromise skin defenses.
Young people congregate in dormitories, locker rooms, showers, etc.
There is the possibility of sharing personal toilet articles.
Equipment, gloves and pads and protective gear, is difficult to sanitize and can become contaminated.
However, in many cases, the chance of infection can be reduced by relatively simple measures.
