GrassMaster is a hybrid grass sports playing field surface composed of natural grass combined with artificial fibres. Desso patented this technology in 1993 and it is why a hybrid pitch can still be referred to as a Desso pitch or a Desso GrassMaster.
This hybrid grass system is now developed by Tarkett Sports after a takeover of Desso Sports and has been rebranded since as GrassMaster.
