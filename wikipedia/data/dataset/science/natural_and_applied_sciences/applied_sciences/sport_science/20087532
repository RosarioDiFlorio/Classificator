Jake Watson (December 5, 1973 â€“ March 12, 1999) was an American cyclist. He assisted in the development of the sport of downhill mountain biking, making contributions to industry marketing, bike design and riding techniques.
Known for his massive frame, Watson was given the nickname "Earthquake" early into his cycling, carrying the name to the top on podiums throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. Watson lost his life during downhill practice for California's Keysville Classic as a result of injuries sustained in a crash. As a tribute to Watson's contributions, a major bicycle manufacturer released a frame series in 1999, entitled "Quake".
