Annonacin is a chemical compound with toxic effects, especially in the nervous system, found in some fruits such as the paw paw (custard apple), soursop, and others from the family Annonaceae. It is a member of the class of compounds known as acetogenins. Although annonacin-containing fruit products are regularly consumed throughout the West Indies for their traditional medicine uses, there is evidence linking annonacin to the development of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and atypical Parkinsonism in elderly men of Guadeloupe.
