Sea Cadets is a national youth charity, working with 14,000 young people between 10 and 18 years old across the UK. It has 400 units across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run by 9,000 volunteers. Cadets follow similar rates and ranks, traditions, values and ethos as the Royal Navy.
Young people who join follow a cadet training programme which sees them learn a range of subjects including engineering, first aid, catering and music as well as sailing, rowing, kayaking and many more. For many of the subjects, cadets gain nationally recognised qualifications from organisations such as the RYA, BCU and St Johns Ambulance.
As well as weekly meetings and boating at their individual units, cadets can go on residential courses at five national training centres, six regional boating stations plus on week-long voyages sailing around the UK on one of five Sea Cadets offshore vessels. The Sea Cadets offshore fleet includes one tall ship, two yachts and two power vessels.
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the patron of Sea Cadets and HRH The Duke of York is the Admiral of Sea Cadets.
