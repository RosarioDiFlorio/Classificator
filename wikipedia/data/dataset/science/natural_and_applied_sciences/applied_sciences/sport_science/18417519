Carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) is an ionophore that is a mobile ion carrier. It is referred to as an uncoupling agent because it disrupts ATP synthesis by transporting hydrogen ions through a cell membrane before they can be used to provide the energy for oxidative phosphorylation. It is a nitrile and hydrazone. FCCP was first described in 1962 by Heytler.
