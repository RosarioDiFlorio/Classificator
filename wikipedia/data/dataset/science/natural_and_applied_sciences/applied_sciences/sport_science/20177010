A patellar dislocation is a knee injury in which the patella (kneecap) slips out of its normal position. Often the knee is partly bent, painful and swollen. The patella is also often felt and seen out of place. Complications may include a patella fracture or arthritis.
A patellar dislocation typically occurs when the knee is straight and the lower leg is bent outwards when twisting. Occasionally it occurs when the knee is bent and the patella is hit. Commonly associated sports include soccer, gymnastics, and ice hockey. Dislocations nearly always occur away from the midline. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by X-rays.
Reduction is generally done by pushing the patella towards the midline well straightening the knee. After reduction the leg is generally splinted in a straight position for a few weeks. This is than followed by physical therapy. Surgery after a first dislocation is generally of unclear benefit. Surgery may be indicated in those who have broken off a piece of bone within the joint or in which the patella has dislocated multiple times.
Patellar dislocations occur in about 6 per 100,000 people per year. They make up about 2% of knee injuries. It is most common in those 10 to 17 years years old. Rates in males and females are similar. Recurrence after an initial dislocation occurs in about 30% of people.
