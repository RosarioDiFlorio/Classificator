The Hit Squad, formerly known as Finney's HIT Squad under Jesse Finney and originally as H.I.T. Squad, is a mixed martial arts gym based out of Granite City, Illinois. Founded in 2007 by UFC Hall of Fame inductee Matt Hughes, it was purchased in 2011 by MMA veteran Jesse Finney after he retired from professional competition. Hughes departed from Miletich Fighting Systems in order to start the team, alongside then-current EliteXC Middleweight Champion Robbie Lawler, longtime boxing coach Matt Pena, and wrestling/conditioning teacher Marc Fiore.
