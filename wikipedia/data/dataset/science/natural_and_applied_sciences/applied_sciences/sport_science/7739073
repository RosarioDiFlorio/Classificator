The Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) is an elite sports institute set up in 1983 by the Government of Western Australia to support athletes in Western Australia. Previously, if elite athletes from Western Australian needed to train or receive coaching at an international level they had to move to one of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) campuses which were generally based in the eastern states. The founding director was Wally Foreman who held the position for 17 years until 2001.
The institute is based at the WAIS High Performance Service Centre (next door to HBF Stadium) and has sport programs including athletics, baseball, canoeing, cycling, gymnastics, men and women's hockey, netball, rowing, sailing, softball, swimming and men and women's water polo.
