Sport Pedagogy is the academic field of study, which is located at the intersection between sport and education. As a discipline, sport pedagogy is concerned with learning, teaching and instruction in sport, physical education and related areas of physical activity. Whilst sport pedagogy is mostly regarded as a sub-discipline of sport science (in North America frequently referred to as kinesiology), its theoretical grounding is also underpinned by the general education sciences. As a scientific subdiscipline sport pedagogy is therefore allied to both fields, sport science and education.
