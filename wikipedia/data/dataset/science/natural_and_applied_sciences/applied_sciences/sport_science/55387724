The chondriome is the whole set of intracellular organelles constituted by chondriosomes, contained in the cytosol, and bounded by the envelope that constitutes the plasma membrane. Chondriosomes comprise globular, spherical or ellipsoidal intracytoplasmic elements, the mitochondria, as well as elongated rod-shaped structures, the chondriocontes. In electron microscopy, they appear delimited by a double membrane, the interior of which is folded to form cristae and incomplete divisions.
The term chondriome is generally used to designate the population of all mitochondria in a given cell.
The chondriome is involved in the respiratory and energetic functions of the eukaryotic cell.
