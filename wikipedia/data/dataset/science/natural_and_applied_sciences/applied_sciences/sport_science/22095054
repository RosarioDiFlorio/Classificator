Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes. HCM is frequently asymptomatic until SCD, and thus its prevention requires screening. Screening by medical history and physical exam are mostly ineffective, indicating heart abnormalities in only 3% of patients who subsequently suffered SCD. However, HCM can be detected with 80%+ accuracy by echocardiogram (ECHO), which may be combined with pre-screening by electrocardiogram (ECG). Routine cardiac screening of athletes has been implemented in Italy since 1982, and has resulted in an 89% drop in the incidence of SCD among screened athletes, from an unusually high starting rate. In the United States, citing cost concerns and low incidence, the American Heart Association has consistently opposed such routine screening. For rare conditions like HCM, the rate of false positive testing is also a significant concern. However, certain chapters of the American College of Cardiology are backing screening models provided by private entities and nonprofit organizations. Screen-positive individuals who are conclusively diagnosed with cardiac disease are usually told to avoid competitive athletics.
