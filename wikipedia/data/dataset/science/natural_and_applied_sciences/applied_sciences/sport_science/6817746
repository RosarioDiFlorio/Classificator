The Morning Star Trust is a Christian sail training charity with the primary objective of providing personal development to young people through the adventurous experience of sailing at sea on the 62 ft, traditionally rigged sailing vessel Morning Star of Revelation.
The boat was built by Tim Millward, a physics teacher at Dulwich College, over a period of nine years and was completed in 1981. He originally took pupils from the school to sea in small dinghies, but saw the potential to expand his work with a larger, purpose built vessel. She is built of ferro-cement, and originally had wooden keel stepped masts, though the main was replaced with aluminium in the winter of 2015.
Although Morning Star came first in its first Tall Ships race it was disqualified because one of the crew members was too young. Morning Star has competed in all of the Tall Ships' Races since including Tall Ships Race 2000 when she crossed the Atlantic. In July 2013 the vessel won the Aarhus to Hesinki Tall Ships race, coming in as the overall winner on corrected time.
The sail training organisation, based in Chatham Historic Dockyard on the River Medway in Kent, England. They are a Royal Yachting Association training centre and member of the Association of Sail Training Organisations. The Trust is a Christian organisation, offering personal and spiritual development aboard their two vessels, Morning Star of Revelation (a 62 ft gaff-rigged ketch) and Dayspring (a 36 ft Bermuda sloop).
In a typical activity in 2004 a crew including five teenagers who had been given bursaries to allow them to take part, sailed Morning Star to Denmark from Chatham in the Tall Ships Race.
