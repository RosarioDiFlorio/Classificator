Microbial production of Succinic acid can be performed with wild bacteria like Actinobacillus succinogenes, Mannheimia succiniciproducens and Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens or genetically modified Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Saccharomyces cerevisia. Understanding of the central carbon metabolism of these organisms is crucial in determining the maximum obtainable yield of succinic acid on the carbon source employed as substrate.
