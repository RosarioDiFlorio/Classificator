Paris Saint-Germain Boxing, commonly known as Paris Saint-Germain (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi sɛ̃ ʒɛʁmɛ̃]) and familiarly as PSG Boxing, was a French professional boxing club founded in 1992, and based in the city of Paris in France. The club was the boxing department of Paris Saint-Germain until 1997.
An initiative from former French professional boxer Jean-Claude Bouttier, PSG boxers trained at a boxing gym located inside the Parc des Princes. PSG Boxing consisted of club president Bouttier, managers René Acquaviva and Gilbert Delé, and boxers Philippe Desavoye, Djamel Lifa, Julien Lorcy, Hacine Cherifi, Patrice Aouissi, Ludovic Proto, Philippe Michel, Jean-Claude M'Biye and Khalid Rahilou.
In only five years, PSG boxers won six French Championships, three European Championships and one World Championship. However, René Acquaviva's departure in 1997 and the lack of support from the French Boxing Federation saw parent club Paris Saint-Germain dissolve PSG Boxing later that same year.
