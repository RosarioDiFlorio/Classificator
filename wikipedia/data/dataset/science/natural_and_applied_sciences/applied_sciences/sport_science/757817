John Wells (born 12 May 1963) is a former captain and coach of the Leicester Tigers rugby union team and presently head coach for Newcastle.
Wells was born in Driffield, Yorkshire. He attended Magnus Grammar School and Loughborough University, where he studied sports science and recreation management.
Playing at blindside flanker, he played for England U-16, U-18, Students, U-23 and England 'A'. He was not capped for England, though he did play in a non-cap international against Italy.
Wells made his debut for Leicester Tigers in 1982 away against Harlequins, and he went on to play for them over 360 times, captaining the side from 1991-93. He is particularly noted for playing in a back row with England internationals Dean Richards at number eight and Neil Back at openside.
After Director of Rugby Bob Dwyer was ousted in a coaching coup, Wells was appointed forwards' coach, and deputy to Dean Richards. When Richards was sacked in 2004 after a poor run of results, Wells took over as head coach. He retained this role until the end of the 2004/2005 season, when he left to take up a coaching role at the National Academy.
In 2006 he was appointed as England forwards' coach to assist then head coach Andy Robinson, alongside attack coach Brian Ashton and defence coach Mike Ford. He remained in this position after first Brian Ashton and then Martin Johnson took charge of the team.
In 2012 Wells joined Newcastle Falcons on a short term contract until the end of the season, taking a permanent role as forwards coach under new Director of Rugby Dean Richards that summer. He was promoted to head coach in the summer of 2014.
