PointTracker, created by IBM, is an application featured in Grand Slam tennis tournaments that presents an animated 3D view of each shot played in a singles match.
A menu to the right of the application displays all points played and allows users to select a point to view from each set. Points may also be grouped according to forehand winners, backhand winners, forehand unforced errors, backhand unforced errors, aces and challenged points.
