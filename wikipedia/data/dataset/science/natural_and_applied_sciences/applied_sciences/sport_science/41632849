Modern biological research has revealed strong evidence that the enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain assemble into larger, supramolecular structures called respirasomes or supercomplexes, instead of the traditional fluid model of discrete enzymes dispersed in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These supercomplexes are functionally active and necessary for forming stable respiratory complexes.
Respirasomes have been found in a variety of species and tissues, including rat brain, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, bovine heart, human skin fibroblasts, fungi, plants, and C. elegans.
