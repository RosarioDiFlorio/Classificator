Side-by-side is a split-screen television presentation format originally introduced by sports network ESPN which allows the broadcast to show commercials and live sports simultaneously. It is primarily associated with ABC's telecasts of the IndyCar Series and ESPN's coverage of NASCAR. When used for NASCAR, it goes by the name of NASCAR Nonstop.
While primarily associated with sports telecasts, the format has been used on other forms of broadcasting. CNN has also used a similar arrangement for commercial breaks during live news events.
