FEDOR or Feodor (Russian: Фёдор) (an acronym of "final experimental demonstration object research") is the name of a Russian humanoid that is being trained to stay balanced while it shoots guns. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, insisted they are not creating a Terminator. This AI robot creation was originally developed for rescue missions. It has been reported that the FEDOR is designed to make "colonies" on the moon and is being prepared for a solo space mission in 2021.
At the same time, a "robotic army" is a controversial part of Russian military plans, especially after Vladimir Putin stated that "the country that perfects AI will be 'ruler of the world'". However, he retains his position that he doesn't want to see anyone "monopolize" the field, and that Russia will share the technology with the "entire world", as with nuclear technology.
