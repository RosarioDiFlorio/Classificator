Morris Light Reconnaissance Car (LRC) was a British light armoured car for reconnaissance use produced by Morris Motors Limited and used by the British during the Second World War.
The Nuffield Group had been brought in to supplement production of light reconnaissance cars by Standard Motor Company (Beaverette) and Humber (Humber LAC, also known as "Humberette").
The vehicle had an unusual internal arrangement, with three-man crew sitting side by side by side with the driver in the middle, a crewman manning a small multi-sided turret mounting Bren light machine gun at the right side, and another with Boys .55 inch anti-tank rifle (mounted in brackets in the hatches on the hull roof) and access to radio set at the left. From 1940 to 1944 over 2,200 were built.
The vehicle was used in North African, Italian and in North-West Europe campaigns. Some served with the RAF Regiment. Some were given to Polish units.
One of the surviving vehicles is on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, another at The Tank Museum, Bovington.

There is also a surviving example at the Military Museum at Port Dickson, Malaysia
