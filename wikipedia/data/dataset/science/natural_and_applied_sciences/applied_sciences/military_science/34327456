McCurdy’s Armor is a patented portable armored wall system that protects against small arms, mortars, rockets, artillery, armor-piercing rounds and suicide bombs. Constructed of aluminum frames that unfold and connect to one another using steel connector pins, McCurdy’s Armor can be deployed into a full guard post by a three-person team in less than ten minutes, using no hand tools or heavy equipment. The system can be dismantled and redeployed in a similar amount of time. McCurdy’s Armor includes bullet proof glass windows that provide full situational awareness and, when necessary, can be opened and used as gun ports.
