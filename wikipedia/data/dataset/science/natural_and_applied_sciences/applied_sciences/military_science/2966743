The Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) (Danish: Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste, short FE (often but incorrectly: FET)), is a Danish intelligence agency, responsible for Denmark’s foreign intelligence, as well as being the Danish military intelligence service. DDIS is a department under the Ministry of Defence and works under the responsibility of the Defence Minister of Denmark. It is housed at Kastellet in Copenhagen.
The DDIS gathers, analyses, and disseminates information concerning conditions of importance to Denmark’s security, and to the security of Danish military units deployed on international missions. Intelligence activities include collection of information of political, financial, scientific and military interest.
DDIS works closely with the Danish Security Intelligence Service, which is the intelligence arm of the Danish police, and the signals intelligence unit of the Danish signal regiment.
