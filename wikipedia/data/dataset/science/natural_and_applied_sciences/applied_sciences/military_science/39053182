Initiated in 2013 by the 38th Chief of Staff of the Army, Raymond T. Odierno, regionally aligned forces (RAF) provide combatant commands (CCMDs), scalable and tailorable Army capabilities for all requirements, including operational missions, bilateral and multilateral military exercises and security cooperation activities. Army regional alignment is an organizing principle that improves the Armyâ€™s ability to provide units and capabilities. Regional alignment provides focus and direction for unit training and preparation. RAFs are drawn from the Army Total Force, which includes active United States Army, the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve. Corps and divisions are aligned to ensure joint task force capability to every GCC. Through regional alignment, the Army maintains its war-fighting skills and complements these skills with language, regional expertise and cultural awareness training.
