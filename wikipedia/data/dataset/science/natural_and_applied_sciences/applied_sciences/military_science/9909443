The Commercial Joint Mapping Toolkit, or CJMTK (also referred to as C/JMTK) is the DoD standard mapping toolkit for C2I software. It is a replacement for the previous United States Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Mapping Toolkit (JMTK) that utilizes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
The primary component of CJMTK is ESRI's complete ArcGIS system, with additional functionality for military analysis, overlays, sensors and data.
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is the U.S. Government program manager for CJMTK with Northrop Grumman IT TASC as the prime contractor. Team members include: ESRI (for the foundation technology utilizing the ArcGIS architecture), Leica Geosystems (for image processing), and Analytical Graphics (for satellite modeling).
Organizations creating C2I software for the DoD can obtain, develop on, and deploy to the DoD through the CJMTK package free of charge. Non-C2I DoD programs may use the CJMTK under the Extended User Community (EUC) licensing option, for which the EUC program is responsible for the funding.
