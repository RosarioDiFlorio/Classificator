The Baltic Project was a plan promoted by the Admiral Lord Fisher to procure a speedy victory during the First World War over Germany. It involved landing a substantial force, either British or Russian soldiers, on the flat beaches of Pomerania on the North German coast, less than 100 miles from Berlin.
To support this, a large specialist fleet would be required. Submarines and extensive mining would, it was proposed, keep the invasion force safe from the Imperial German Navy. More than 600 special vessels would be required, including landing craft, minesweepers, destroyers, light cruisers, monitors, and some heavy shallow draft support ships. The latter were built in the form of the three "battlecruisers"; HMS Glorious, HMS Furious, and HMS Courageous.
The plan was never placed into action.
