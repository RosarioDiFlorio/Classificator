Command by negation is a military command and control doctrine - a hybrid of command by direction and command by influence. Commonly found in the United States Navy, particularly in independent commands at sea, the doctrine is based on the idea of allowing individual officers to show their own initiative in executing actions, freeing up their superiors to focus on the bigger picture.
