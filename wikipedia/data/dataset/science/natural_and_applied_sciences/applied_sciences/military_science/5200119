The Chorrillos Military School (Spanish: Escuela Militar de Chorrillos) is the institution in charge of the undergraduate education of officers of the Peruvian Army.
The school was opened in 1898 and is located at Chorrillos, Lima, Peru, hence its name.
As of December 2012, its director was Brigade General Augusto Villarroel Rossi, of the same graduating class (1984) as President Ollanta Humala.
It was also the alma mater of Manuel Noriega and Hugo Chávez Frías (1974).
It contains the Escuela de Comandos (Commando School). In 1997, a replica of the Japanese Diplomatic Residency was secretly built there. Tunnels were dug and the rescue plan was practiced again and again until perfect for the Operation Chavin de Huantar that ended the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. As of 2008 it still exists and is considered a monument to those who took part in the rescue, and sometimes still used in training.
