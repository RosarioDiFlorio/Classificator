The Sri Lanka Military Academy (SLMA), commonly known simply as SLMA, is the Sri Lanka Army's officer initial training centre located in the garrison town of Diyatalawa in the central highlands of Sri Lanka.
SLMA is much like Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for it is not a university, unlike some other national military academies such as West Point in the United States, National Defence Academy (India) or the Australian Defence Force Academy. General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University is the university-type defence academy in Sri Lanka, which sends its cadets to SLMA for their final year.
