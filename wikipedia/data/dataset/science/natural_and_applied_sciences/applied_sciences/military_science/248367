Infantry Attacks (German: Infanterie Greift An) is a classic book on military tactics written by Erwin Rommel about his experiences in World War I. At the time of the book's writing in the mid-1930s, Rommel's rank was lieutenant colonel. Rommel had planned to write a successor called Panzer greift an (in English: Tank Attacks) about tank warfare, and gathered much material during the North Africa Campaign. However, he was forced to commit suicide before completing this work.
