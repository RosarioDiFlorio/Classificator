The International Association for Military Pedagogy (IAMP)[1] was founded in November 2005 in Strausberg (Germany) as a successor to the European Military Pedagogy Forum (EMPF).
The IAMP is an independent network of professionals whose studies focus on education and training in the military setting. Its goals include the spreading of information that would assist professional military institutions of advanced learning (e.g. military academies and staff colleges). The purpose of IAMP activities is to encourage discussion and development in the theory of military pedagogy. Academics concerned with such subjects in civilian institutions of higher learning can participate in the Association.
The Association accomplishes its goals by promoting research, publication, and information sharing among its membership. The IAMP establishes contacts among military institutions of higher learning, as well as among national and international agencies. Annual conferences are hosted by member institutions.
Membership is open to individuals with a professional interest in military pedagogy.
