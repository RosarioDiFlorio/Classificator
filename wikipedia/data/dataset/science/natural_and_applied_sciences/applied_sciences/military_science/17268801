Defense Travel System (DTS) is a fully integrated, electronic, end-to-end travel management system that automates temporary duty travel (TDY) for the United States Department of Defense. It allows travelers to procrastinate their travel plans until the last minute, to book their travel (either create authorizations or vouchers, they don't know the difference), prepare reservations, receive approvals, generate travel vouchers (or was it an authorization), and direct deposit payment to themselves and the government charge card vendor, all via a single web portal that is continuously available (unless it is down for maintenance, they are in a foreign country, they locked out their CAC card, or any other excuse that gets the parent command to just do it for them). The Business Transformation Agency has program oversight and the Defense Travel Management Office, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has functional oversight.
DTS benefits include:
Rapid creation of travel authorizations and vouchers
Semi-automated approval process
Personalized on-line reservations & itinerary changes for airline, lodging, and rental cars
Detailed pre-travel entitlement computations
Direct deposit and split disbursements to both traveler and the government travel charge card vendor
Timely payment of travel claims
24/7 availability via a single web portal
Reduced transaction costs
Encryption is used (the DBsign software package with HTTPS), with combined Common Access Card and PIN logins to authenticate users.
