Manhunting is the deliberate identification, capturing, or killing of senior or otherwise important enemy combatants, classified as high-value targets, usually by special operations forces and intelligence organizations.There have been over a dozen confirmed manhunts in present U.S. military There are many famous one manhunts in recent memory, one of the more recent being the manhunt in search of the Boston Marathon Bombers. One of the earliest recorded manhunts was that of Ned Kelly, a brush ranger, in Australia Manhunt is not to be confused with assassination, assassination is defined as the murdering of a person usually of power or authority for political or governmental gains. A manhunt can also be defined as an organized search for a person or persons of interest that have usually been charged with a crime. A manhunt can end with the capture of the person or persons of interest, it does not have to end with them being killed. According to a 2008 study, since 1968, 40% of armed non-state groups met their end because local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members.
A response to asymmetric tactics adopted by terrorists, insurgents, pirates, narco-traffickers, arms proliferators, and other non-state actors, manhunting has been adopted by military and intelligence organizations to reduce collateral damage that would occur during a conventional military assault.
The most visible such operations conducted today involve counterterrorist activities. Some involve government-sanctioned targeted killing or extrajudicial execution. Operations to capture terrorists have drawn political and legal controversy. See Legal Issues below. Other military operations, such as hostage rescue or personnel recovery, employ similar tactics and techniques. The primary difference in hostage rescue or personnel recovery is that the person being rescued or recovered wants to be found; while high-value targets want to avoid being found.
