A zero-defects mentality exists when a command-and-control structure does not tolerate mistakes. This atmosphere is now widely acknowledged to be ineffective in both military and corporate life.
The results of a zero-defects mentality can include careerism, reduced motivation and stifled innovation. Soldiers or employees will feel neither empowered by their successes nor accountable for their failures.
Eliminating a zero-defects mentality is one of the primary goals of lean manufacturing, specifically through the application of Kaizen and Andon in the Toyota Production System.
