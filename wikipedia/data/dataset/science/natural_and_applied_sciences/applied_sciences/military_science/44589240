An offset is some means of asymmetrically compensating for a disadvantage, particularly in a military competition. Rather than match an opponent in an unfavorable competition, changing the competition to more favorable footing enables the application of strengths to a problem that is otherwise either unwinnable or winnable only at unacceptable cost. An offset strategy consequently seeks to deliberately change an unattractive competition to one more advantageous for the implementer. In this way, an offset strategy is a type of competitive strategy that seeks to maintain advantage over potential adversaries over long periods of time while preserving peace where possible.
The term is used officially to characterize the capabilities of the U.S. military in comparison to possible opponents. Two periods from the Cold War are treated as canonical cases. In the 1950s, President Eisenhower emphasized nuclear deterrence to avoid the larger expenditures necessary to conventionally deter the Warsaw Pact. In a second period from about 1975 to 1989 the term “Offset Strategy” returned, again referring to technological superiority to offset quantitative inferiority in conventional forces.
A proposed Third Offset Strategy is associated with the Defense Innovation Initiative announced by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at the 2014 Reagan Defense Forum, and U.S. strengths in particular technologies and warfighting domains to offset growing disadvantages U.S. forces face against anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) systems.
