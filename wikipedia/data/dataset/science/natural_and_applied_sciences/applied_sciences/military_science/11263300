Krakatoa is a modular explosive device used for explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) or demolitions developed by the British company Alford Technologies. The device is designed to fire a number of different projectiles, operates both in air and underwater, and can be used in a vertical or horizontal orientation.
The device was featured during the second season of Discovery Channel's television series Future Weapons, in which it was shown penetrating an inch of steel plate at 25 yards. The device's casing is made of plastic which is packed with plastique (C4) and capped with an inverted copper cone.
The device itself is "no bigger than a standard can of coke."
It is named after the famous 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which resulted in the loudest sound ever heard and was the second deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history.
