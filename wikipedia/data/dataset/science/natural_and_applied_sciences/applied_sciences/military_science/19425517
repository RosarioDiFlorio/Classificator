The Murai Urban Training Facility (MUTF) is the Singapore Armed Forces' latest training facility created to hone the urban operations capability of its soldiers.
The facility is located within an existing training area in Lim Chu Kang, in the vicinity of Jalan Murai. The MUTF is built to resemble a typical town, and has features such as single-level houses; a commercial district comprising multi-function, multi-storey buildings; a residential district; as well as an industrial district. To provide added realism, the training facility also has bus-stops, traffic lights and over-head bridges. West of the MUTF is the live-firing area, and Murai Reservoir.
The MUTF allows the SAF's "urban warriors" experience a range of training scenarios from tactical engagements to combined arms manoeuvres.
