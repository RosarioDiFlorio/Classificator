This article is about NATO Combined Air Operations Centre, it should not be confused with the Air and Space Operations Center as a type of command center used by the United States Air Force.
Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) is a multinational headquarters for tactical and operational control of NATO Air Forces below the Joint Force Command level.
Within the European NATO command structure it is subordinated to the Component Command â€“ Air, and is superior to Control and Reporting Centres. NATO may operate in Europe static and deployable CAOCs.
Predecessor organizations of the CAOC were Air Tactical Operations Centre (ATOC) and Air Defence Operations Centre (ADOC). Until 1980 the two HQs for air attack and air defence operated autonomously.
