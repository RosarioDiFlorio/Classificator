A salient, also known as a bulge, is a battlefield feature that projects into enemy territory. The salient is surrounded by the enemy on multiple sides, making the troops occupying the salient vulnerable. The opponent's front line that borders a salient is referred to as a re-entrant â€“ that is, an angle pointing inwards. A deep salient is vulnerable to being "pinched out" through the base, and this will result in a pocket in which the forces in the salient become isolated. On the other hand, a breakout of the forces within the salient through its tip can threaten the rear areas of the opposing forces outside it, leaving them open to an attack from behind.
