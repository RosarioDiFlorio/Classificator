The Black Code (more formally, Military Intelligence Code No. 11) was a secret code used by US military attach√©s in the early period of World War II. The nickname derived from the color of the superencipherment tables/codebook binding. The code was compromised by Axis intelligence, the information leak costing a great many British lives.
