No. 16 Operational Training Unit RAF (16 OTU) was formed at RAF Upper Heyford on 8 April 1940 from the No. 4 Group RAF (4 Gp) Pool, which comprised No 7 and No 76 Squadron, within No. 6 Group RAF (6 Gp), to train night bomber crews, for which it was equipped with Handley Page Hampdens and Herefords. Transferred to No. 7 Group RAF (7 Gp) on 15 July 1940 until 11 May 1942 when No 7 Group was renumbered No. 92 Group RAF (92 Gp), 16 OTU converted to Vickers Wellington bombers in April 1942 and from March to December 1942 its headquarters moved to RAF Barford St John whilst runways were laid at Upper Heyford, disbanding on 1 January 1945.
The unit re-formed within 92 Group the same day when the Mosquito Training Unit RAF (formerly No. 1655 (Mosquitio) Conversion Unit) was re-designated as No. 16 Operational Training Unit RAF, remaining at Upper Heyford until 1 March 1946 when it moved to RAF Cottesmore, where it finally disbanded on 15 March 1947, its aircraft and personnel being used to create No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit RAF (231 OCU) and No. 204 Advanced Flying School (204 AFS).
