Reconnaissance regiment (Sōsaku-rentai (搜索聯隊) or Sōsaku-tai (搜索隊)) in Japanese language, was the type of the military establishment within Imperial Japanese Army in the 1940-1945 period. Reconnaissance regiment was the type of unit derived from Cavalry regiment, tasked with combat scouting. In Japanese military literature reconnaissance regiment is usually abbreviated by SO letters. These regiments were attached to the large number of the Japanese division at the opening stages of the Pacific War. In modern Japan, these regiments are equivalent to Reconnaissance battalion in the divisions of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.
