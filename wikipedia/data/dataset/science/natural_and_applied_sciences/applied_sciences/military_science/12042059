The V-hull is a type of vehicle armor design used on wheeled armored personnel carriers (APC), infantry mobility vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) and MRAPs. The design originated in the 1970s with vehicles such as the iconic Casspir used extensively during the South African Border War, Leopard security vehicle used in the Rhodesian Bush War and South African armored vehicle company Land Systems OMC's Ratel IFV and Buffel.
