The National Military College (Spanish: Colegio Militar de la Nación) is the institution in charge of the undergraduate education of officers of the Argentine Army. It is located at El Palomar, Buenos Aires.
Established on October 11, 1869, by President Domingo Sarmiento at the height of the Paraguayan War, its original quarters were opened in where the Parque Tres de Febrero stands today, with Col. Juan F. Czetz as the first superintendent. It was transferred to San Martín in 1892, and to its present location, the site of the 1852 Battle of Caseros that deposed mid-19th century strongman Juan Manuel de Rosas, in 1938.
Its present facilities were inaugurated in 1937. El Palomar and La Casa de Caseros, installations involved in the Battle of Caseros, were declared a National Historic Monument.
Traditionally, most cadets belonged to high- or middle-class families, with many of them having a long military tradition. This has changed in recent years, the Corps of Cadetes becoming more representative of lower-class families.
Women were first admitted in the College in 1999, and allowed into Infantry and Cavalry arms in 2013.
