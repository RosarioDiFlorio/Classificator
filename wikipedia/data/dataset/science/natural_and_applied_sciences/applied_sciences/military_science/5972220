An Apache scout was a member of the Apache tribe who engaged in scouting, either for game or during time of war. Only Lipan, Chiricahua and Mescaleros had scout societies. The scouts' original purpose was to protect the clanspeople from enemies, and to locate game and new campsites. It is important to distinguish between these scouts, and the Apache Scouts hired by the United States Army during the Indian Wars.
