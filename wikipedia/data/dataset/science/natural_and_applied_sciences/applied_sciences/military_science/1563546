Use of interior lines is a strategy of warfare based on the fact that lines of movement and communication within an enclosed area are shorter than those on the outside. As the area held by a defensive force shrinks, the advantages increase.
Using the strategy of interior lines, a partially surrounded or more centrally disposed force can more easily resupply and redeploy its units, and thus more easily mount a series of quick attacks at multiple locations.
