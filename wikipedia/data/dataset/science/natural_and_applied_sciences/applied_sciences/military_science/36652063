Lightening holes are holes in structural components of machines and buildings used by a variety of engineering disciplines to make structures lighter. The edges of the hole may be flanged to increase the rigidity and strength of the component. The holes can be circular, triangular, elliptical, or rectangular and should have rounded edges, but they should never have sharp corners, to avoid the risk of stress risers, and they must not be too close to the edge of a structural component.
Drilling out components was a popular way to lighten racing bicycle components in the 1970s. Eddy Merckx's hour record-winning bike has heavily-drilled handlebars and chainring. Cyclists jokingly refer to the incorporation of "drillium" in the machine, as if it were an exotic metal which confers lightness.
