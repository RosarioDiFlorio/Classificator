The Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle is an armoured car built by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada for the Canadian Forces, for use in the light reconnaissance (scout) role. It was also initially used in the role of medium tank trainer within armoured cavalry squadrons in the same way as the AVGP it replaced. Its eight-wheeled design is a licensed version of the Swiss MOWAG Piranha 8x8. In service since 1996, the Coyote is a later generation of the six-wheeled Canadian AVGP, also developed from the Piranha. It is of a similar family and similar generation as the, Bison APC, USMC LAV-25 and the Australian ASLAV.
