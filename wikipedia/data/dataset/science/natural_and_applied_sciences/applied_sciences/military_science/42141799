The Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM) is used by the United States Army and foreign militaries for live simulated weapons training on military platforms. The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation.
TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the AH-64 Apache to support force-on-force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations. TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective opposing force participation in live training.
The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilotâ€™s live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback.
Designed and manufactured by Inter-Coastal Electronics, Inc (ICE), "The SMODIM is fully compatible with the multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES) and laser-based direct fire weapons. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements".
