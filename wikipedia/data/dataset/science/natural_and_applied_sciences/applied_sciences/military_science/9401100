The Manstein Plan is one of the names used to describe the war plan of the German Army during the Battle of France in 1940. The original invasion plan was a compromise devised by Franz Halder and satisfied no-one. Some documents containing details of the plan fell into Belgian hands during the Mechelen incident of 10 January 1940 and the plan was revised several times. The versions of the plan increased the emphasis of an attack by Army Group A through the Ardennes, which progressively reduced an offensive by Army Group B through the Low Countries to a diversion.
By coincidence, in the eventual version of the plan, the main effort of the German invasion was made against the Ardennes, the weakest part of the Allied line, where defence was left to second-rate French divisions, while the Seventh Army, the most powerful part of the French strategic reserve, was committed to an attempt to join with the Dutch Army far to the north, in the Breda variant of Plan D, the Allied deployment plan.
