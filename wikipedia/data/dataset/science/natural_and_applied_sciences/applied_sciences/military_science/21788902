The Virtual Army Experience (VAE) is a mobile US Army simulator created by the Army development team with the digital development handled by Zombie Studios. The interactive exhibit brings the army’s popular computer game, America’s Army: Special Forces (Overmatch), to a life-size, networked environment to provide visitors with an experience of soldiering. Using computers, LAN based scenarios, motion simulators, and videos, the VAE is a display of technological invention.
The VAE was greeted with enthusiasm by the public for its design, use of measurement technology, and its ability to engage visitors through an entertaining and educational experience. The dual use of the virtual environment with tracking technology is a combination that commercial marketers could learn from, say experts, especially those marketers who target young adults.
The VAE is managed by the Army’s Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA) at the United States Military Academy, West Point. OEMA director Colonel Casey Wardynski is the originator of the Army Game Project. The army spent about $9 million building four versions of the Virtual Army Experience, Col. Wardynski said. Col. Wardynski envisioned "using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining."
