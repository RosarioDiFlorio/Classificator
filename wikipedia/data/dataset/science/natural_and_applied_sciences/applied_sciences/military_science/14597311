Passing out is the completion of a course by military or other service personnel or the graduation from a college. Soldiers sometimes take part in a passing out parade upon completion of a basic training course.
The parade may also be referred to as a 'Marching out' parade as it is at the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka in Australia.
