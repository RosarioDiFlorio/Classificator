The Schwarze Kapelle (German for Black Orchestra) was a term used by the Gestapo to refer to a group of conspirators within the German military who plotted to overthrow Adolf Hitler. It included many senior officers within the Wehrmacht. Unlike the Rote Kapelle (Red Orchestra), the name given by the Gestapo to the Soviet spy network within the Third Reich, the members of the Black Orchestra were of aristocratic background, felt contempt for the ideological fervor of the Nazi Party and were politically closer to the Western Allies.
