The United States Armed Forces defines personnel recovery as "The sum of military, DOD civilian, DOD contractor personnel, or other personnel designated by the President or Secretary of Defense, who are isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) in an operational environment. Also called PR." The Joint Personnel Recovery Agency is the Chairman's Controlled Activity and is designated as DoD's office of primary responsibility for DoD-wide personnel recovery (PR) matters, less policy.
The European union has set up the European personnel recovery centre by developing harmonizing PR policy, doctrine and standards through clear lines of communications with partners stakeholders (nations and international organizations).
