The Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN) is the primary Coalition, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) network for NATO-led missions in Afghanistan (ISAF, RSM). By providing a common network over which to share critical information, the AMN enabled a shift in information-sharing posture from “need to know” to “need to share,” resulting in an increase in situational awareness among coalition partners. AMN establishes a common information sharing platform that provides standardised services such as email, instant messaging or chat, Common Operational Picture service, VTC, Voice over IP and Web Services for document sharing and application integration to all coalition participants. The effort generated invaluable lessons in how to approach coalition networking in future operations. Based on those lessons learned with AMN, NATO is institutionalising this approach under the Federated Mission Networking initiative.
