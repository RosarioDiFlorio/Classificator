Leibgarde (also life-guard, or household troops) has been, since the 15th century, the designation for the military security guards who protected Fürsten (royal and noble ranks) — usually members of the highest nobility who ruled over states of the Holy Roman Empire and later its former territory — from danger. The Leibgarde should not be mixed up with bodyguard (de: Leibwächter), which may refer also to a private or single individual.
The France Garde du Corps was established (with reference to the „Sargeants d'Arms“) in 1440. It was abolished after the French Revolution, 1815 re-established, and 1830 finally dissolved. Finally, Napoleon III set up the so-called Centgardes.
