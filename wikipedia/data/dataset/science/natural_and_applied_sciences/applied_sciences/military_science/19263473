MASS (Multi Ammunition Softkill System) is a naval self-defence system produced by Rheinmetall of Germany. It is connected to the ship's sensors and protects ships from attacks by advanced, sensor-guided missiles by launching decoys that operate in all relevant wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum: ultraviolet, electro-optical, laser, infrared, and radar. MASS can be either plugged into the command and control module of a naval vessel, or operate autonomously.
Rheinmetall Defence has stated that "MASS has attracted orders from 9 nations, for 130 launchers, on 15 different classes of naval vessels" as of 31 March 2009. As of 3 March 2011, this has been expanded to a total order of at least 172 units. Roughly one year later, on the 17 April 2012, the total was 186 launchers for 22 different classes of vessels in 11 different nations.
