A weighting pattern for a linear dynamical system describes the relationship between an input 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   and output 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
  . Given the time-variant system described by

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ˙
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        A
        (
        t
        )
        x
        (
        t
        )
        +
        B
        (
        t
        )
        u
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {x}}(t)=A(t)x(t)+B(t)u(t)}
  

  
    
      
        y
        (
        t
        )
        =
        C
        (
        t
        )
        x
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y(t)=C(t)x(t)}
  ,
then the output can be written as

  
    
      
        y
        (
        t
        )
        =
        y
        (
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        )
        +
        
          ∫
          
            
              t
              
                0
              
            
          
          
            t
          
        
        T
        (
        t
        ,
        σ
        )
        u
        (
        σ
        )
        d
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle y(t)=y(t_{0})+\int _{t_{0}}^{t}T(t,\sigma )u(\sigma )d\sigma }
  ,
where 
  
    
      
        T
        (
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle T(\cdot ,\cdot )}
   is the weighting pattern for the system. For such a system, the weighting pattern is 
  
    
      
        T
        (
        t
        ,
        σ
        )
        =
        C
        (
        t
        )
        ϕ
        (
        t
        ,
        σ
        )
        B
        (
        σ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle T(t,\sigma )=C(t)\phi (t,\sigma )B(\sigma )}
   such that 
  
    
      
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi }
   is the state transition matrix.
The weighting pattern will determine a system, but if there exists a realization for this weighting pattern then there exist many that do so.
