The Bellman pseudospectral method is a pseudospectral method for optimal control based on Bellman's principle of optimality. It is part of the larger theory of pseudospectral optimal control, a term coined by Ross. The method is named after Richard E. Bellman. It was introduced by Ross et al. first as a means to solve multiscale optimal control problems, and later expanded to obtain suboptimal solutions for general optimal control problems.
