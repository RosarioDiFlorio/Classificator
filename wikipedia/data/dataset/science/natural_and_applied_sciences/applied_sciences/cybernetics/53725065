Fuzz Academy (fuzzacademy.com) was a virtual pet website and social media outlet targeted to a younger audience. Users could create fuzzy animal 'cadets', feed them, dress them up, and play minigames to earn the site's currency, 'hairballs'. The game mimicked a college setting, allowing the user to place their cadet into one of four houses: House Optimus, House Tempesto, House Pacifica, and House Rogue.
The site was created by Marie Lu in 2008 as a personal project which grew exponentially until its eventual hacking and closing in 2011.
