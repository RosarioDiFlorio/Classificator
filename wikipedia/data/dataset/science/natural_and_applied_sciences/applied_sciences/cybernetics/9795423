In mathematics, the no-wandering-domain theorem is a result on dynamical systems, proven by Dennis Sullivan in 1985.
The theorem states that a rational map f : Ĉ → Ĉ with deg(f) ≥ 2 does not have a wandering domain, where Ĉ denotes the Riemann sphere. More precisely, for every component U in the Fatou set of f, the sequence

  
    
      
        U
        ,
        f
        (
        U
        )
        ,
        f
        (
        f
        (
        U
        )
        )
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        U
        )
        ,
        …
      
    
    {\displaystyle U,f(U),f(f(U)),\dots ,f^{n}(U),\dots }
  
will eventually become periodic. Here, f n denotes the n-fold iteration of f, that is,

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                f
                ∘
                f
                ∘
                ⋯
                ∘
                f
              
              ⏟
            
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{n}=\underbrace {f\circ f\circ \cdots \circ f} _{n}.}
  

The theorem does not hold for arbitrary maps; for example, the transcendental map 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        z
        +
        2
        π
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=z+2\pi \sin(z)}
   has wandering domains. However, the result can be generalized to many situations where the functions naturally belong to a finite-dimensional parameter space, most notably to transcendental entire and meromorphic functions with a finite number of singular values.
