Enterprise Cognitive Systems (ECS) are part of a broader shift in computing, from a programmatic to a probabilistic approach, called Cognitive computing. An Enterprise Cognitive System makes a new class of complex decision support problems computable, where the business context is ambiguous, multi-faceted, and fast-evolving, and what to do in such a situation is usually assessed today by the business user. An ECS is designed to synthesize a business context and link it to the desired outcome. It recommends evidence-based actions to help the end-user achieve the desired outcome. It does so by finding past situations similar to the current situation, and extracting the repeated actions that best influence the desired outcome.
While general-purpose Cognitive Systems can be used for different outputs, prescriptive, suggestive, instructive, or simply entertaining, an Enterprise Cognitive System is focused on action, not insight, to help in assessing what to do in a complex situation.
