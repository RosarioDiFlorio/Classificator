The Sensorium Project was initiated by ROBOTmaker to broaden the IRCF360 sensor's audience beyond its typical robot sensor usage.
To demonstrate the BETA functionality, ROBOTmaker uses opensource Java based Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as Arduino and Processing (programming language) and has released all the prototyping sketches on their website for advanced developers to expand the functionality and write their own Java interface apps. They also provide a low cost self-assembly PCB kit to allow developers to make a sensor and to reprogramme the embedded micro-controller with own firmware if desired.
The sensor is based on ROBOTmaker's Infrared Control Freak 360 (IRCF360) which is a 360 degree proximity sensor and a motion sensing devices, developed by ROBOTmaker. Their goal is to provide low costs configurable sensors & solutions for use within technical projects such as maker and Maker Faire type projects, micro robotic, kinetic art / art, crafts, engineering, science, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mindset and alternative music type of projects.
