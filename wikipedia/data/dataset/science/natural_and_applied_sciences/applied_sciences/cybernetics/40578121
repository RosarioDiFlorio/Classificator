Impedance control is an approach to the control of dynamic interaction between a manipulator and its environment. This type of control is suitable for environment interaction and object manipulation.
We are interested in controlling the mechanical impedance of a mechanism. Using the analogy to electrical impedance where impedance is the ratio of voltage output to current input (e.g. resistance is voltage divided by current), mechanical impedance is the ratio of force output to motion input. A "spring constant" defines the force output for a tension or compression of the spring. A "damping constant" defines the force output for a velocity input. If we control the impedance of a mechanism, we are controlling the force of resistance to external motions that are imposed by the environment.
Mechanical admittance is the inverse of impedance - it defines the motions that result from a force input. If a mechanism applies a force to the environment, the environment will move, or not move, depending on its properties and the force applied. For example, a marble sitting on a table will react much differently to a given force than will a log floating in a lake.
The key theory behind the method is to treat the environment as an admittance and the manipulator as an impedance. It assumes the postulate that "no controller can make the manipulator appear to the environment as anything other than a physical system." Hogan's rule can also be stated as: "in the most common case in which the environment is an admittance (e.g. a mass, possibly kinematically constrained) that relation should be an impedance, a function, possibly nonlinear, dynamic, or even discontinuous, specifying the force produced in response to a motion imposed by the environment."
