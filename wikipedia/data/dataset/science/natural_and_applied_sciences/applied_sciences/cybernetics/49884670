In control theory, multiple models is an approach to improve efficiency of adaptive system or observer system. It uses large number of models, which are distributed in the region of uncertainty, and based on the responses of the plant and the models. One model is chosen at every instant, which is closest to the plant according to some metric. The method offers satisfactory performance when no restrictions are put on the number of available models.
