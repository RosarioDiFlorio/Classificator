A process variable, process value or process parameter is the current measured value of a particular part of a process which is being monitored or controlled. An example of this would be the temperature of a furnace. The current temperature is called the process variable, while the desired temperature is known as the set-point. The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.
