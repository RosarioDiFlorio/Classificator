In control theory, it is often required to check if a nonautonomous system is stable or not. To cope with this it is necessary to use some special comparison functions. Class 
  
    
      
        
          
            K
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}}
   functions belong to this family:
Definition: A continuous function 
  
    
      
        β
        :
        [
        0
        ,
        a
        )
        ×
        [
        0
        ,
        ∞
        )
        →

    {\displaystyle \beta :[0,a)\times [0,\infty )\rightarrow [0,\infty )}
   is said to belong to class 
  
    
      
        
          
            K
            L

   if:
for each fixed

    {\displaystyle s}
  , the function

        ,
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta (r,s)}
   belongs to class kappa;
for each fixed 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  , the function

        ,
        s
        )

   is decreasing with respect to 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and is s.t.
