A shift invariant system is the discrete equivalent of a time-invariant system, defined such that if y(n) is the response of the system to x(n), then y(n–k) is the response of the system to x(n–k). That is, in a shift-invariant system the contemporaneous response of the output variable to a given value of the input variable does not depend on when the input occurs; time shifts are irrelevant in this regard.
