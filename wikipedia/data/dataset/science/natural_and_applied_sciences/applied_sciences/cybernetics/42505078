Moon Ribas (born 24 May 1985) is a Spanish avant-garde artist and cyborg activist best known for developing and implanting an online seismic sensor in her elbow that allows her to feel earthquakes through vibrations. Her choreography works are based on the exploration of new movements developed by the addition of new senses or sensory extensions to the dancer. She is the co-founder of the Cyborg Foundation, an international organisation that encourages humans to become cyborgs and promotes cyborgism as an art movement.
