The unscented transform (UT) is a mathematical function used to estimate the result of applying a given nonlinear transformation to a probability distribution that is characterized only in terms of a finite set of statistics. The most common use of the unscented transform is in the nonlinear projection of mean and covariance estimates in the context of nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter. Its creator Jeffrey Uhlmann explained that "unscented" was an arbitrary name that he adopted to avoid it being referred to as the “Uhlmann filter.”
