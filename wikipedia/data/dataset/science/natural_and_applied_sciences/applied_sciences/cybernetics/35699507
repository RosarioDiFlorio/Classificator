Learning rule or Learning process is a method or a mathematical logic which improves the artificial neural network's performance and usually this rule is applied repeatedly over the network. It is done by updating the weights and bias levels of a network when a network is simulated in a specific data environment. A learning rule may accept existing condition ( weights and bias ) of the network and will compare the expected result and actual result of the network to give new and improved values for weights and bias.  Depending on the complexity of actual model, which is being simulated, the learning rule of the network can be as simple as an XOR gate or Mean Squared Error or it can be the result of multiple differential equations. The learning rule is one of the factors which decides how fast or how accurate the artificial network can be developed. Depending upon the process to develop the network there are three main models of machine learning:
Unsupervised learning
Supervised learning
Reinforcement learning
