A PLL multibit or multibit PLL is a phase-locked loop (PLL) which achieves improved performance compared to a unibit PLL by using more bits. Unibit PLLs use only the most significant bit (MSB) of each counter's output bus to measure the phase, while multibit PLLs use more bits. PLLs are an essential component in telecommunications.
Multibit PLLs achieve improved efficiency and performance: better utilization of the frequency spectrum, to serve more users at a higher quality of service (QoS), reduced RF transmit power, and reduced power consumption in cellular phones and other wireless devices.
