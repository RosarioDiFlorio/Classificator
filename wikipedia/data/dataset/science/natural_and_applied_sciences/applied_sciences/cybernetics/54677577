Extreme: Personal assistant is a virtual personal assistant developed and published by Multiverse app for Android in May 2016.
Unlike most Android assistants, Extreme has a different, more nerdy looking User Interface. The application was primarily developed to mimic the functionality of Tony Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man, giving a unique experience to the users. Users can interact with the app via natural voice or keyboard. In the current form, Extreme is able to search the Internet, narrate a joke, read important notifications, open applications and carry out other simple as well as complex tasks.
