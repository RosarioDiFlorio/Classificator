Symmetry breaking of escaping ants is a phenomenon that happens when ants are constrained into a cell with two equivalent exits, and perturbed with an insect repellent. Contrary to intuition, ants tend to use one door more than the other on average (i.e., there is a symmetry breaking in the escape behavior), so they crowd on one of the doors, which decreases the evacuation efficiency.
