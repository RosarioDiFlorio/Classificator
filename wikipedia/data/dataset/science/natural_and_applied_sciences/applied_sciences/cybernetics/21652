Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language data.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.
