Stochastic diffusion search (SDS) was first described in 1989 as a population-based, pattern-matching algorithm [Bishop, 1989]. It belongs to a family of swarm intelligence and naturally inspired search and optimisation algorithms which includes ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms; as such SDS was the first Swarm Intelligence metaheuristic. Unlike stigmergetic communication employed in ant colony optimization, which is based on modification of the physical properties of a simulated environment, SDS uses a form of direct (one-to-one) communication between the agents similar to the tandem calling mechanism employed by one species of ants, Leptothorax acervorum.
In SDS agents perform cheap, partial evaluations of a hypothesis (a candidate solution to the search problem). They then share information about hypotheses (diffusion of information) through direct one-to-one communication. As a result of the diffusion mechanism, high-quality solutions can be identified from clusters of agents with the same hypothesis. The operation of SDS is most easily understood by means of a simple analogy â€“ The Restaurant Game.
