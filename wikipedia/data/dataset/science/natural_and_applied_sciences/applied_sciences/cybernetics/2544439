Coherent control is a quantum mechanical based method for controlling dynamical processes by light. The basic principle is to control quantum interference phenomena typically by shaping the phase of a laser pulses. The basic ideas have proliferated finding vast application in spectroscopy mass spectra, quantum information processing, laser cooling, ultracold physics and more.
