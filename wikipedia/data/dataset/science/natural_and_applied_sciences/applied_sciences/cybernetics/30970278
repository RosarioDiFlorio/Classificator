Hans Diedrich Henatsch served as the Head of the Department of Neurophysiology of the Medical School of the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen from the early sixties to the mid nineties.
He was a long-standing friend and colleague of Ragnar Granit and John Eccles. He became known in the sixties for recordings from spinal cord cells in anesthetized cats and his research in spinal cord physiology and spasticity.
On June 5 (Henatsch's birthday) 1997, after his death, Prof. Diethelm Richter (Henatsch's successor) organized a little memorial in the institute, on which occasion Eike Schomburg gave the laudatio.
