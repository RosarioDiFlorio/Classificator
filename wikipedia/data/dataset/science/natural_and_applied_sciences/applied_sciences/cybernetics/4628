The bilinear transform (also known as Tustin's method) is used in digital signal processing and discrete-time control theory to transform continuous-time system representations to discrete-time and vice versa.
The bilinear transform is a special case of a conformal mapping (namely, a Möbius transformation), often used to convert a transfer function

        )
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{a}(s)\ }
   of a linear, time-invariant (LTI) filter in the continuous-time domain (often called an analog filter) to a transfer function

        )
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{d}(z)\ }
   of a linear, shift-invariant filter in the discrete-time domain (often called a digital filter although there are analog filters constructed with switched capacitors that are discrete-time filters). It maps positions on the

    {\displaystyle Re[s]=0\ }
  , in the s-plane to the unit circle, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        z

    {\displaystyle |z|=1\ }
  , in the z-plane. Other bilinear transforms can be used to warp the frequency response of any discrete-time linear system (for example to approximate the non-linear frequency resolution of the human auditory system) and are implementable in the discrete domain by replacing a system's unit delays 
  
    
      
        
          (
          
            z
            
              −
              1
            
          
          )
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(z^{-1}\right)\ }
   with first order all-pass filters.
The transform preserves stability and maps every point of the frequency response of the continuous-time filter, 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            a
          
        
        (
        j
        
          ω
          
            a
          
        
        )
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{a}(j\omega _{a})\ }
   to a corresponding point in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter, 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            d
          
        
        (
        
          e
          
            j
            
              ω
              
                d
              
            
            T
          
        
        )
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{d}(e^{j\omega _{d}T})\ }
   although to a somewhat different frequency, as shown in the Frequency warping section below. This means that for every feature that one sees in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding feature, with identical gain and phase shift, in the frequency response of the digital filter but, perhaps, at a somewhat different frequency. This is barely noticeable at low frequencies but is quite evident at frequencies close to the Nyquist frequency.
