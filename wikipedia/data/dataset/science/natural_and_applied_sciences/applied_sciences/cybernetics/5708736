Feedback linearization is a common approach used in controlling nonlinear systems. The approach involves coming up with a transformation of the nonlinear system into an equivalent linear system through a change of variables and a suitable control input. Feedback linearization may be applied to nonlinear systems of the form

        ∈

        v
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u=a(x)+b(x)v\,}
  
that renders a linear input–output map between the new input 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   and the output. An outer-loop control strategy for the resulting linear control system can then be applied.
