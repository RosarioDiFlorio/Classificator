Generative systems are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences. When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperative indirectly and contribute to innovation.
Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable. One of the more well-known examples is Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. Another example is Boids. More examples can be found in generative music, generative art, and, more recently, in video games such as Spore.
