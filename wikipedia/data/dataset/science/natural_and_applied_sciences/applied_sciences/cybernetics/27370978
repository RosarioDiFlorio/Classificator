In futurology, a singleton is a hypothetical single decision-making agency at the highest level, capable of exerting effective control over its domain, and permanently preventing both internal and external threats to its supremacy. If there were Independent space colonies or alien civilisations "within reach of Earth" it would not count as a Singleton. The term was first been defined by Nick Bostrom.
An artificial general intelligence having undergone an intelligence explosion could form a singleton, as could a world government armed with mind control and social surveillance technologies. A singleton need not directly micromanage everything in its domain; it could allow diverse forms of organization within itself, albeit guaranteed to function within strict parameters. A singleton need not support a civilization, and in fact could obliterate it upon coming to power.
A singleton doesn't necessarily need to be an organisation, government or AI. It could form through all people accepting accepting the same values or goals. These people coming together would form an "agency" in the broad sense of the term according to Bostrom.
