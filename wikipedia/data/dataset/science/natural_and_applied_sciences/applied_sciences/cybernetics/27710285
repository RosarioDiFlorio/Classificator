In structural semantics, the actantial model, also called the actantial narrative schema, is a tool used to analyze the action that takes place in a story, whether real or fictional. It was developed in 1966 by semiotician Algirdas Julien Greimas.
The model considers an action as divided into six facets, called actants. Those actants are a combined framework inspired mainly between Vladimir Propp's and Étienne Souriau's actantial theories.
Greimas took the term actant from linguist Lucien Tesnière, which coined in his discussion of the grammar of noun phrases.
