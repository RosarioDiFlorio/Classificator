Inferential theory of learning (ITL) is an area of machine learning which describes inferential processes performed by learning agents. ITL has been developed by Ryszard S. Michalski in 1980s. In ITL learning process is viewed as a search (inference) through hypotheses space guided by a specific goal. Results of learning need to be stored, in order to be used in the future.
