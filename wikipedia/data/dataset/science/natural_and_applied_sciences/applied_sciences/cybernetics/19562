The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   for which the function 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            c
          
        
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
        +
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}
   does not diverge when iterated from 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=0}
  , i.e., for which the sequence 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            c
          
        
        (
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            c
          
        
        (
        
          f
          
            c
          
        
        (
        0
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}
  , etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

Its definition and name are due to Adrien Douady, in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. The set is connected to a Julia set, and related Julia sets produce similarly complex fractal shapes.
Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and determining, for each sample point 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
  , whether the result of iterating the above function goes to infinity. Treating the real and imaginary parts of 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   as image coordinates 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        +
        y
        i
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x+yi)}
   on the complex plane, pixels may then be colored according to how rapidly the sequence 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            n
          
          
            2
          
        
        +
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{n}^{2}+c}
   diverges, with the color 0 (black) usually used for points where the sequence does not diverge. If 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is held constant and the initial value of 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  —denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{0}}
  —is variable instead, one obtains the corresponding Julia set for each point 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   in the parameter space of the simple function.
Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications. The "style" of this repeating detail depends on the region of the set being examined. The set's boundary also incorporates smaller versions of the main shape, so the fractal property of self-similarity applies to the entire set, and not just to its parts.
The Mandelbrot set has become popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules. It is one of the best-known examples of mathematical visualization.
