FIFO is an acronym for first in, first out, a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first. It is analogous to processing a queue with first-come, first-served (FCFS) behaviour: where the people leave the queue in the order in which they arrive.
FCFS is also the jargon term for the FIFO operating system scheduling algorithm, which gives every process central processing unit (CPU) time in the order in which it is demanded.
FIFO's opposite is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or 'top of the stack' is processed first.
A priority queue is neither FIFO or LIFO but may adopt similar behaviour temporarily or by default.
Queueing theory encompasses these methods for processing data structures, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.
