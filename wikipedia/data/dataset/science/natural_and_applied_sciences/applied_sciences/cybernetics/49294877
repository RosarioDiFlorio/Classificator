Meca Sapiens (from the Latin words mÄ“chanicus, which means "mechanical", and sapiens which means "wise", i.e. "wise machine ") is a framework, in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), whose aim is to implement synthetic consciousness. The framework is based on an understanding of consciousness as a system capability; its design stages followed a top-down development process; and it utilizes standard software engineering tools, structures and techniques.
A complete system architecture based on the Meca Sapiens framework  and suitable for design and implementation was published in late 2015. The creator of the Meca Sapiens architecture is J.E. Tardy.
