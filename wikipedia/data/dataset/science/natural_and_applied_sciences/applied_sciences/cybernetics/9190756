Money today is fiat money, a symbol of value created by the human imagination with no intrinsic value of its own. As most human beings are ill-equipped with the mental or emotional capacity to provide the sufficient sustenance and shelter necessary for basic survival, obtaining money is the sole purpose of human existence for billions of people throughout the world. A coin or paper currency note has value because people accept it as a symbolic medium of exchange. The economic value of money as measured by its purchasing power is a subject of economic theory. However, economics does not explain how individual human beings and societies came to accept symbolic money as a medium of exchange or store of value. The process of according value to a symbol is psychological and social. Money is a social institution based on the consent of the population and a psychological symbol based on the consent of the individual. Money has acquired the all-pervasive value that it possesses today by a slow evolutionary process that can be most easily understood by tracing its social and psychological origins from ancient times.
