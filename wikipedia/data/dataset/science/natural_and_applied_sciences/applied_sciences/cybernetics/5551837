A quality storyboard is a method for illustrating the quality control process (QC story). Some enterprises have developed a storyboard format for telling the QC story, for example at Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard in Japan, the story is told using a flip chart which is 6 feet by 6 feet (2 x 2 meters). The project team uses colored markers to show the PDSA cycle (Shewhart cycle) plus the SDSA cycle (SDSA = Standardize, Do, Study, Act). A QC story is an element of policy deployment. After each manager writes an interpretation of the policy statement, the interpretation is discussed with the next manager above to reconcile differences in understanding and direction. In this way they play "catchball" with the policy and develop a consensus.
