Baby Pals is a simulation-style video game for the Nintendo DS that released in North America and in the PAL region in late 2007 and early 2008. The objective of the game is to take care of a virtual baby through certain tasks as feeding, bathing, and teaching just like a real father or mother would do. Players can choose the gender of the baby.
