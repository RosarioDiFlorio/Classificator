System Simulation (SSL) is a software engineering company now specialising in text and multimedia information systems, based in Covent Garden, central London, England, and founded in 1970.
Under the chairmanship of John Lansdown, following collaborative research work at the Royal College of Art, System Simulation carried out pioneering computer animation work, applying computer graphics techniques in TV and film creating many advertising sequences, the flight deck instrumentation readouts on the Nostromo spaceship for Ridley Scott's Alien, and the animation of Martin Lambie-Nairn's original Channel 4 logo.
More recently System Simulation has specialised in museum information systems, commercial and archival image library systems, information management and delivery for publishers, news services and professional and commercial organisations. MuseumIndex+, the museum information management system, supports collections management, digital archives and interactive public access. Clients include the British Museum, London Transport Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Getty Images, SCRAN (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network) and Culture24. They develop content management systems, and CD-ROM/Web products and services for the publishing sector and for information service providers. The company provides technical support for the online services of Culture24, the UK's leading virtual museum resource.
The company has often hosted meetings of the Computer Arts Society.
