The application Barcode Scanner is an Android app, from the open-source project ZXing (short for Zebra Crossing), that allows an Android device with imaging hardware (camera) to scan barcodes or 2-D "graphical barcodes" and retrieve the data encoded. Information encoded often includes web addresses, geographical coordinates, and small pieces of text, in addition to commercial product codes. The Android-based system is given similar functionality to a hardware barcode reader.
This application supports many different types of barcode, including those used to identify products in commerce. The Barcode Scanner can automatically search the Web to identify a product with a barcode and use, for example, price-comparison information.
The application can decode several 2-D codes including the widely-used QR and Data Matrix codes. QR codes are often embedded in websites; Barcode Scanner can open a browser at the encoded site, for example, facilitating the download of an application.
This is one of the most popular overall Android applications, as listed by Google Play, with over 600,000 ratings and over 126 million user installs as of May 2016.
