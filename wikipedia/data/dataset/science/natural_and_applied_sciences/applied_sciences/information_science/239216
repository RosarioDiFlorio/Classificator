The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is an American public research university in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada. The 332-acre (134 ha) campus is about 1.6-mile (2.6 km) east of the Las Vegas Strip. The university includes the Shadow Lane Campus, just east of the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, which houses the School of Dental Medicineâ€” the only dental school in Nevada. In addition, UNLV's law school, the William S. Boyd School of Law, is also the only law school in the state.
The university is classified a "research-intensive university" by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration is annually ranked among the top hospitality programs in the United States due to the university's proximity to the Las Vegas Strip. Its Thomas & Mack Center hosted the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, concerts, as well as lectures by Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev as part of various UNLV-affiliated lecture series.
