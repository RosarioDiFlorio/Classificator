HIV Resistance Response Database Initiative (RDI) is a not-for-profit organisation established in 2002 with the mission of improving the clinical management of HIV infection through the application of bioinformatics to HIV drug resistance and treatment outcome data. The RDI has the following specific goals:
To be an independent repository of HIV resistance and treatment outcome data
To use bioinformatics to explore the relationships between resistance, other clinical and laboratory factors and HIV treatment outcome
To develop and make freely available a system to predict treatment response, as an aid to optimising and individualising the clinical management of HIV infection
The RDI consists of a small executive group based in the UK, an international advisory group of leading HIV/AIDS scientists and clinicians, and an extensive global network of collaborators and data contributors.
