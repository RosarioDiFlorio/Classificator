The Short Title Catalogus Flanders (STCV) is an online retrospective bibliography of books that were printed prior to 1801 within the current boundaries of Flanders (including Brussels). The project is executed by Flanders Heritage Library.
Given the large scope, the bibliography is created step by step. The final goal is to describe all printed publications prior to 1801 in one database. However, the majority of copies described so far are from the seventeenth and eighteenth century, since printed bibliographies of fifteenth and sixteenth century printed books from the Southern Netherlands already exist. The database is freely accessible via the internet and offers many possibilities to study the history of the handpress book in the Southern Netherlands.
