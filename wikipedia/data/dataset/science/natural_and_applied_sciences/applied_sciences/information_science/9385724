AARLIN (Australian Academic Research Library Network) was a successful Australian project to develop "a national virtual research library system that will provide unmediated, personalized and seamless end-user access to the collections and resources of Australian libraries and document delivery services" and the federated search service and consortium that was the project outcome. It ceased operation at the end of 2010.
