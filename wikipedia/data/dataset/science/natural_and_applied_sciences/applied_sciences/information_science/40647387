The Steam Controller is a game controller developed by Valve Corporation to be used with personal computers running Steam on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux or Steam OS. The controller is designed not only for games developed for controller users, but also for games traditionally played with keyboard and mouse controls so that they can be played through the controller.
