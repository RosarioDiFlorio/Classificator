The Magnum Light Phaser is a light gun created in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum computer. A version was also released for the Commodore 64/128. It was Amstrad's last peripheral for the video game console. The Magnum Light Phaser in many ways resembles the Light Phaser, the Sega Master System light gun, released in 1986. It was a Sinclair-branded Far Eastern product which was included in promotional bundles such as the "James Bond 007 Action Pack", along with a small number of lightgun-compatible games.
It was also available separately in a Â£29.95 pack along with six games. Only a few games bothered with lightgun compatibility (Operation Wolf, the original arcade gun game, was the most notable) and fewer still were produced specifically for use with the Magnum. Even so, the lightgun was widely available, largely because Amstrad's bundling policy ensured wide distribution.
Software Creations created five exclusive games for the Commodore 64 package.
