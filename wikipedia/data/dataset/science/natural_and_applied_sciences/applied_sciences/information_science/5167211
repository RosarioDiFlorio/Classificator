Oxford Libraries Information System (OLIS) is an online union catalog of books held by the libraries of the University of Oxford, England, which include the Bodleian Libraries group, and also those faculty libraries which are not members of the group, and the libraries of individual colleges. It currently operates the Geac ADVANCE integrated library system (ILS). Prior to 1996 it operated DOBIS/LIBIS software (which itself replaced the LS/2000 system). Oxford University Library Services (OULS) issued a tender for new software in 2005 which culminated in the selection of the Virtua system from VTLS, but in August 2008 Oxford announced that the implementation would not go forward. In 2010 it was confirmed that Aleph from Ex Libris would replace Geac ADVANCE.
