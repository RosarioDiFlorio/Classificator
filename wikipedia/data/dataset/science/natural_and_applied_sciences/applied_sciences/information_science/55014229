The Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino (est. 1931) of Portugal preserves archives related to the Portuguese Empire. It is located in the Palácio da Ega on Calçada da Boa-Hora in the city of Lisbon, near the Rua da Junqueira in the parish of Alcântara. The Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical of the governmental Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education administers the archives. Prior to 1973, the Overseas Ministry oversaw it.
Among its holdings are records created in 15th-20th century related to colonial Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea, India, Macau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Timor, Uruguay, and other locales. As of 1970 the materials were grouped as pre-1833 (mostly from the Arquivo do Conselho Ultramarino) and post-1833 (from the Arquivo do Ministerio das Colonias).
Directors have included Alberto Iria (circa 1970).
