A head-mounted display (or helmet-mounted display, for aviation applications), both abbreviated HMD, is a display device, worn on the head or as part of a helmet, that has a small display optic in front of one (monocular HMD) or each eye (binocular HMD). A HMD has many uses including in gaming, aviation, engineering, and medicine.
There is also an optical head-mounted display (OHMD), which is a wearable display that can reflect projected images and allows a user to see through it.
