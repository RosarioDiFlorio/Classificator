A bokode is a type of data tag which holds much more information than a barcode over the same area. They were developed by a team led by Ramesh Raskar at the MIT Media Lab. The bokode pattern is a tiled series of Data Matrix codes. The name is a portmanteau of the words bokeh (a photographic term) and barcode. Rewritable bokodes are called bocodes. They are circular with a diameter of 3mm. A bokode consists of an LED covered with a mask and a lens. They are readable from different angles and from 4 meters (13 feet) away by any standard digital camera. Powered bokodes are relatively expensive because of the LED and the power it requires, but there are prototypes which manage with reflected light.
Bokodes convey a privacy advantage compared to Radio-frequency identification tags: bokodes can be covered up with anything opaque, whereas RFID tags must be masked by material opaque to radio frequencies, such as the sleeve provided by the NYSDMV when issuing enhanced State IDs.
