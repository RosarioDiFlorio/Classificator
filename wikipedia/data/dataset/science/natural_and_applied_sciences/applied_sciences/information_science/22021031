Social translucence is a term that was proposed by Thomas Erickson and Wendy Kellogg to refer to "design digital systems that support coherent behavior by making participants and their activities visible to one another".
Social translucence represents a tool for transparency, which function is to
stimulate online participation
facilitate collaboration (via collaborative filtering but also by helping the construction of trust)
facilitate navigation (social navigation)
Social translucence is in particular a core element in online social networking such as Facebook or LinkedIn, in which they intervene in the possibility for people to expose their online identity, but also in the creation of awareness of other people activities, that are for instance present in the activity feeds that these systems make available.
Social translucence mechanisms have been made available in many web 2.0 systems such as:
Online communities
Online social networking
Wikis (McDonald et al.) (Chi, Suh & Kittur 2008)
