The Patterson-Crane Award, previously the Austin M. Patterson Award, is an award for contributions to chemical information. It is awarded every two years, in odd-numbered years, and sponsored by the Columbus and Dayton sections of the American Chemical Society but not restricted to members of the ACS.
The Austin M. Patterson award was established in 1949 and its first recipient was Austin M. Patterson, in recognition of his work on chemical nomenclature and as editor of Chemical Abstracts. In 1975 the award was renamed to commemorate also E. J. Crane, who edited Chemical Abstracts 1915-1958, and who had received the award in 1953.
