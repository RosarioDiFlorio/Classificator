The Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (abbreviated as ThLL or TLL) is a monumental dictionary of Latin founded on historical principles. It encompasses the Latin language from the time of its origin to the time of Isidore of Seville (died 636).
The project began in 1894 and it was scheduled to be completed around the year 2050. The last fascicle of the P-volume appeared in 2010, and work is currently under way on both N and R. The institution that carries out the work of the dictionary is located in Munich, in the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
