The Board of Certification in Professional Ergonomics (BCPE) was established in 1990 as an independent nonprofit organization, and is the certifying body for individuals whose education and experience indicate broad expertise in the practice of human factors/ergonomics. To date, over 1,000 professionals have successfully met BCPEâ€™s certification criteria and been awarded one of the following distinguished credentials: Certified Professional Ergonomist (CPE), Certified Human Factors Professional (CHFP), Certified User Experience Professional (CUXP), Associate Ergonomics Professional (AEP), Associate Human Factors Professional (AHFP), or Associate User Experience Professional (AUXP).
The BCPE also adheres to the criteria and policies for competency assessment set by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies Accreditation (NCCA), which is the accrediting body of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE), and has been endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association (IEA), as an accredited ergonomics certifying body.
