Withings (pronounced "with-things"), now defunct as a result of an acquisition by Nokia Technologies, was a French consumer electronics company headquartered in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, and Hong Kong, distributing products worldwide. Withings was known for design and innovation in connected devices, such as the first Wi-Fi scale on the market (introduced in 2009), an FDA-cleared blood pressure monitor, a high-definition wireless security camera, a smart sleep system, and a line of automatic activity tracking watches. Having received numerous awards for its products and innovation, including CES awards, Withings was a flagship company of the French Tech community until it was purchased by Finnish company Nokia on 26 April 2016. The deal closed on 31 May, with Withings having been absorbed into Nokia Technologies' new Digital Health unit led by the former Withings CEO. The Withings brand continued to be used until June 2017, when it was replaced by the Nokia brand.
