AGROVOC (a portmanteau of agriculture and vocabulary) is a multilingual controlled vocabulary covering all areas of interest to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and the environment. The vocabulary consists of over 32,000 concepts with up to 40,000 terms in different languages (see SKOSMOS). It is a collaborative effort, edited by a community of experts and coordinated by FAO.
AGROVOC is made available by FAO as an RDF/SKOS-XL concept scheme and published as a linked data set aligned to 16 other vocabularies.
