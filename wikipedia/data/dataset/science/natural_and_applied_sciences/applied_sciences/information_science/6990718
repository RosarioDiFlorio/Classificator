Audio visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a technique that uses image processing capabilities in lip reading to aid speech recognition systems in recognizing undeterministic phones or giving preponderance among near probability decisions.
Each system of lip reading and speech recognition works separately, then their results are mixed at the stage of feature fusion.
