According to surveys and studies done in the 2000s, there is a lack of diversity in librarianship. Librarianship is the management, organisation, collecting and preserving of information, often in libraries. The 2003 US Census showed that Hispanic people had the lowest proportion of librarians in their population while American Indians had the lowest number of librarians. Most librarian jobs were occupied by elderly Caucasian males. Library associations affected by this lack of ethnic diversity have put several measures in place to attempt to correct this issue.
It has been suggested that the lack of diversity in librarianship is because most people are not aware of the job opportunities in the librarianship sector. Others suggest that a lack of diversity in university graduates makes it harder for there to be diversity in librarianship as the job is often held by people who hold university degrees.
