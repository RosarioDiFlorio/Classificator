The Four Square Writing Method is a way for teaching writing to children in school. While primarily used to teach persuasive writing, it has also been used to help teach deconstruction. The method was developed by Judith S. Gould  and Evan Jay Gould.
It was developed initially for primary school students, but it has also been used in high school classes.
