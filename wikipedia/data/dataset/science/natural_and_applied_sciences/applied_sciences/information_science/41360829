Agile usability engineering is a method created from a combination of agile software development and usability engineering practices. Agile usability engineering attempts to apply the principles of rapid and iterative development to the field of user interface design.
Early implementations of usability engineering in user-centered design came into professional practice during the midâ€“late 1980s. Early implementations of agile software development evolved in the mid-1990s. It has only been within the past few years that the human-computer interaction community have seen widespread acceptance of agile usability engineering.
