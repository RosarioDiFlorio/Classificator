Social presence theory was developed by John Short, Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie, although its main thesis and major points would appear to have been first described twenty years previously in the 1956 Isaac Asimov novel The Naked Sun. Social Presence Theory is defined as "The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction."
