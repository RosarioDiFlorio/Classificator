In anomaly detection, the local outlier factor (LOF) is an algorithm proposed by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and JÃ¶rg Sander in 2000 for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbours.
LOF shares some concepts with DBSCAN and OPTICS such as the concepts of "core distance" and "reachability distance", which are used for local density estimation.
