JSGF stands for Java Speech Grammar Format or the JSpeech Grammar Format (in a W3C Note). Developed by Sun Microsystems, it is a textual representation of grammars for use in speech recognition for technologies like XHTML+Voice. JSGF adopts the style and conventions of the Java programming language in addition to use of traditional grammar notations.
The Speech Recognition Grammar Specification was derived from this specification.
