Sticky keys is an accessibility feature of some graphical user interfaces to assist users who have physical disabilities or help users reduce repetitive strain injury (or a syndrome called the Emacs Pinky). It serializes keystrokes instead of pressing multiple keys at a time, allowing the user to press and release a modifier key, such as Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or the Windows key, and have it remain active until any other key is pressed.
Sticky keys functionality is available on Microsoft Windows as StickyKeys, on macOS as Sticky Keys, and on Unix/X11 systems as part of the AccessX utility.
