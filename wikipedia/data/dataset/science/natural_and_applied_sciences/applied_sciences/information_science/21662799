Sensacell is an interactive interface technology developed by the Sensacell Corporation. Described by the company as a “Modular Sensor Surface,” Sensacell was designed to provide a wide variety of large-scale interactive display applications.
A Sensacell surface functions as an interactive touchscreen display, but on a large-scale framework. Individual, tile-like modules—each containing LED (Light-emitting diode) lighting and capacitive sensors—are connected in an open-ended array. As the sensors can read through solid materials, Sensacell networks may be installed within common structural and architectural components, enhancing its configurative flexibility and durability.
