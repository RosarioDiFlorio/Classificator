Vivification is an operation on a description logic knowledge base to improve performance of a semantic reasoner. Vivification replaces a disjunction of concepts 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            1
          
        
        ⊔
        
          C
          
            2
          
        
        …
        ⊔
        
          C
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{1}\sqcup C_{2}\ldots \sqcup C_{n}}
   by the least common subsumer of the concepts 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          C
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        
          C
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{1},C_{2},\ldots C_{n}}
  .
The goal of this operation is to improve the performance of the reasoner by replacing a complex set of concepts with a single concept which subsumes the original concepts.
For example, consider the example given in (Cohen 92): Suppose we have the concept 
  
    
      
        
          
            PIANIST(Jill)
          
        
        ∨
        
          
            ORGANIST(Jill)
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textrm {PIANIST(Jill)}}\vee {\textrm {ORGANIST(Jill)}}}
  . This concept can be vivified into a simpler concept 
  
    
      
        
          
            KEYBOARD-PLAYER(Jill)
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\textrm {KEYBOARD-PLAYER(Jill)}}}
  . This summarization leads to an approximation that may not be exactly equivalent to the original.
