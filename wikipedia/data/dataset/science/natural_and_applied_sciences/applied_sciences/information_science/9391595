A referatory is the name given to a web application system (also known as a database-driven website). It provides information such as the name and description, reviews, and hyperlinks (metadata) to resources or learning objects in a repository. The repository provides the actual resource files, while the referatory is a website pointing at the resources. Generally the idea of a referatory is derived from the domain of education.
