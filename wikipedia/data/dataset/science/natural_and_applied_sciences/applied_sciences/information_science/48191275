Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time via timestamped transactions in the bitcoin blockchain.
It was launched in 2013 as an open source project. It was developed by Manuel Araoz and Esteban Ordano.
On May 21, 2017, the "Blockchain Notary Service" was acquired by Canaan.
"I'm really happy to close this deal with Canaan. First and foremost because they understand blockchain technology," Araoz said in a statement. "They've been around for years, and they expend hard dollars to build the chips that secure the blockchain. I'm looking forward to enhancing the product, and exploring other blockchain services."
