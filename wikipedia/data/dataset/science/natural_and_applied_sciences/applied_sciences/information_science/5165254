Digimask is an avatar technology that allows a user to input a front and (optional) side digital photo of their head which then automatically creates a fully articulated 3D model of that head. This 3D model can then be used in digital applications such as computer and video games and mobile phones. Digimask technology is the core of the EyeToy: Cameo system for the PlayStation 2 video game console.
In 2001, Digimask was nominated for a BAFTA for Technical Innovation.
At E3 2006 it was announced that Digimask face-mapping technology would be available using the Xbox Live Vision Camera and featured in the Xbox 360 titles World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas.
