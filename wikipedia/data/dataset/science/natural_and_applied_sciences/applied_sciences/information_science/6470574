The Polar Libraries Colloquy is an international organization of librarians and others concerned with the collection, preservation, and dissemination of information dealing with the Arctic and Antarctic regions. This organization grew out of the Northern Libraries Colloquy, which first met in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in June, 1971. The Colloquy meets biennially, by tradition alternating between Europe and North America. PLC is governed by an international Steering Committee and publishes a newsletter, Polar Libraries Bulletin, as well as Proceedings of the Colloquies.
PLC is a member of the University of the Arctic.
