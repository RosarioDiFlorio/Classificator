Protégé is a free, open source ontology editor and a knowledge management system. Protégé provides a graphic user interface to define ontologies. It also includes deductive classifiers to validate that models are consistent and to infer new information based on the analysis of an ontology. Like Eclipse, Protégé is a framework for which various other projects suggest plugins. This application is written in Java and heavily uses Swing to create the user interface. Protégé recently has over 300,000 registered users. According to a 2009 book it is "the leading ontological engineering tool".
Protégé is being developed at Stanford University and is made available under the BSD 2-clause license. Earlier versions of the tool were developed in collaboration with the University of Manchester.
