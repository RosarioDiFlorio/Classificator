The Text Services Framework (TSF) is a COM framework and API in Windows XP and later Windows operating systems that supports advanced text input and text processing. The Text Services Framework is designed to offer advanced language and word processing features to applications. It supports features such as multilingual support, keyboard drivers, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, as well as spell checking and other text and natural language processing functions. It is also downloadable for older Windows operating systems.
The Language Bar is the core user interface for Text Services Framework. The language bar enables text services to add UI elements to the toolbar and enables these elements when an application has focus. From the Language Bar, users can select the input language, and control keyboard input, handwriting recognition and speech recognition.
The language bar also provides a direct means to switch between installed languages, even when a non-TSF-enabled application has focus.
Starting with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 and Windows Vista, the RichEdit control supports the Text Services Framework. Windows Speech Recognition in Windows Vista is also implemented using the Text Services Framework.
