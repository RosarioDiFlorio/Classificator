Radio audiobook is a radio programming format for audiobooks. The programming is usually in series format due the length of the books. The books may be abridged or unabridged, sometimes as dramatisations. The productions may be for radio only, or also distributed through other media such as vinyl record, cassette tape, CD-ROM and digital download. Books include all genres such as fiction and non-fiction. They are read by an actor, the author or a full-cast.
Channels which have regular audiobook programming include BBC Radio 4, BBC 6Music, Oneword and BBC World Service in the UK, RTÃ‰ Radio 1 in Ireland, National Public Radio in the US, and ABC local radio and ABC Radio National in Australia.
