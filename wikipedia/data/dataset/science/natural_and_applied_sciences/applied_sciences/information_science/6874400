The Michigan eLibrary, or MeL, is a service of the Library of Michigan. It is supported by the State of Michigan as well as by federal funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
MeL is Michigan's 24/7 digital library and is one of the oldest online libraries on the Internet, beginning in 1992 with the gopher GoMLink.
MeL provides statewide access to nearly 40 subscription based eResources, contains vetted Web sites on topics such as business, jobs, legal, health, government, books and literacy, kids, and teens. Other components of the Michigan eLibrary include: MeLCat, a statewide borrowing system over 430 libraries—public, academic, school and special—that allows users to place their own interlibrary loan requests if they belong to a participating library, Michigana, a portal for discovering primary resources in digital format such as photographs, diaries, maps, and more on Michigan history or Michigan's place in American History, and the Michigan Online Resources for Educators (M.O.R.E.), a portal linking to tens of thousands of curricular based resources such as lesson plans, interactives, videos and more that are aligned to the state and national standards (CCSS).
