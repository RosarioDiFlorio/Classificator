Emotiv Systems is an Australian electronics innovation company developing technologies to evolve human computer interaction incorporating non-conscious cues into the human-computer dialog to emulate human to human interaction. Developing brainâ€“computer interfaces based on electroencephalography (EEG) technology, Emotiv Systems produced the EPOC near headset, a peripheral targeting the gaming market for Windows, OS X and Linux platforms. The EPOC has 16 electrodes and was originally designed to work as a brain-computer interface (BCI) input device.
The company was founded in 2003 by technology entrepreneurs Tan Le, Nam Do, Allan Snyder, and Neil Weste. However, doing a search of business entity name on Emotiv Systems at the business entity registry of the California Secretary of State http://kepler.sos.ca.gov reveals Emotiv Systems has ceased to exist, and, therefore, it should not be mixed up or confused with the currently active U.S. bioinformatics company Emotiv founded by Tan Le in 2011 http://emotiv.com/about-emotiv/ in which Nam Do, Allan Snyder, and Neil Weste have no ownerships nor roles.
