On July 10, 1971, at the founding of the National Women's Political Caucus, co-founder Gloria Steinem delivered an Address to the Women of America, which would become one of the era's most memorable speeches. The speech, delivered at the height of the women's movement, is considered one of the 20th century's greatest.
Not only did the speech address the issues of sexism and misogyny, but also those of racism and social class. The speech is mostly remembered for the following quotation:

This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy, visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups, and into the cheap labor on which this system still depends. We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those chosen, or those earned. We are really talking about humanism.

In Jennifer Lopez's 2016 music video for her song "Ain't Your Mama", Steinem can be heard saying part of this speech, specifically, "This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution."
