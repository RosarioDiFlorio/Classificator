The Hyper Reality Experience is a mixed reality, multi-player game experience, which opened to the public in Leeds, England on the 22nd April 2017. It utilises a combination of virtual reality, motion tracking, haptic feedback and theatrical special effects to create an immersive experience where players can interact as a team within a virtual environment, with other senses such as touch provided by a specially designed physical space and props the player can feel and utilise.
The games (Currently "MineForce: The Rebellion", with others under development) are designed for groups ranging from 4 to 10 players, with games lasting for 15 minutes.
