William Lawrence Kocay is a Canadian professor at the department of computer science at St. Paul's College of the University of Manitoba and a graph theorist. He is known for his work in graph algorithms and the reconstruction conjecture and is affectionately referred to as "Wild Bill" by his students. Bill Kocay is a former managing editor (from Jan 1988 to May 1997) of Ars Combinatoria, a Canadian journal of combinatorial mathematics, is a founding fellow of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications.
His research interests include algorithms for graphs, the development of mathematical software, the graph reconstruction problem, the graph isomorphism problem, projective geometry, Hamiltonian cycles, planarity, graph embedding algorithms, graphs on surfaces, and combinatorial designs.
