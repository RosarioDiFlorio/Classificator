Michael Howard Harris (born 1954) is an American mathematician who deals with number theory and algebra. He made notable contributions to the Langlands program, for which he (alongside Richard Taylor) won the 2007 Clay Research Award. In particular, he (jointly with Taylor), proved the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) over a p-adic local field in (Harris & Taylor 2001), and was part of the team that proved the Satoâ€“Tate conjecture.
