Taylor diagrams are mathematical diagrams designed to graphically indicate which of several approximate representations (or models) of a system, process, or phenomenon is most realistic. This diagram, invented by Karl E. Taylor in 1994 (published in 2001) facilitates the comparative assessment of different models. It is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modeled and observed behavior in terms of three statistics: the Pearson correlation coefficient, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) error, and the standard deviation.
Although Taylor diagrams have primarily been used to evaluate models designed to study climate and other aspects of Earthâ€™s environment, they can be used for purposes unrelated to environmental science (e.g., to quantify and visually display how well fusion energy models represent reality).
Taylor diagrams can be constructed with a number of different open source and commercial software packages, including: GrADS, IDL, MATLAB, NCL, Python, R, and UV-CDAT.
