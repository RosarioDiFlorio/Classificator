Walter Trump is a German mathematician. He is known for discovering results in recreational mathematics.
He has made contributions working on both the square packing problem and the magic tile problem. In 1979 he discovered the optimal known packing of 11 equal squares in a larger square, and in 2003, along with Christian Boyer, developed the first known magic cube of order 5. In 2009 he pioneered work on water retention on mathematical surfaces. In 2010 he placed first in Al Zimmermann's programming contest which asked contestants to find the maximum water retention for magic squares order 4 - 28. This specific work found a more general application in statistical physics with the resulting 2012 Physical Review Letter " Retention Capacity of Random Surfaces" which he coauthored . In 2014 he and Francis Gaspalou were able to calculate all bimagic 8x8 squares.
Walter Trump works as a teacher for mathematics and physics at Gymnasium Stein (retired 2016).
