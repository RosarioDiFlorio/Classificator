In the study of the arithmetic of elliptic curves, the j-line over any ring R is the coarse moduli scheme attached to the moduli problem Γ(1)]:

  
    
      
        M
        (
        [
        Γ
        (
        1
        )
        ]
        )
        =
        
          S
          p
          e
          c
        
        (
        R
        [
        j
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M([\Gamma (1)])=\mathrm {Spec} (R[j])}
  
with the j-invariant normalized a la Tate: j = 0 has complex multiplication by Z[ζ3], and j = 1728 by Z[i].
The j-line can be seen as giving a coordinatization of the classical modular curve of level 1, X0(1), which is isomorphic to the complex projective line.
