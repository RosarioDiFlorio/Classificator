Dwijendra Kumar Ray-Chaudhuri (born November 1, 1933) is a professor emeritus at Ohio State University. He and his student R. M. Wilson together solved Kirkman's schoolgirl problem in 1968.
He received his M.Sc. (1956) in mathematics from the University of Calcutta and Ph.D. in combinatorics (1959) from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
He is best known for his work in design theory and the theory of error-correcting codes, in which the class of BCH codes is partly named after him and his Ph.D. advisor Bose. Ray-Chaudhuri is the recipient of the Euler Medal by the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications for his career contributions to combinatorics. In 2000, a festschrift appeared on the occasion of his 65th birthday. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
