In mathematics, D'Alembert's equation is a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation, named after the French mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The equation reads as

  
    
      
        y
        =
        x
        f
        (
        p
        )
        +
        g
        (
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=xf(p)+g(p)}
  
where 
  
    
      
        p
        =
        d
        y
        
          /
        
        d
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle p=dy/dx}
  . After differentiating once, and rearranging we have

  
    
      
        
          
            
              d
              x
            
            
              d
              p
            
          
        
        +
        
          
            
              x
              
                f
                ′
              
              (
              p
              )
              +
              
                g
                ′
              
              (
              p
              )
            
            
              f
              (
              p
              )
              −
              p
            
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dp}}+{\frac {xf'(p)+g'(p)}{f(p)-p}}=0}
  
The above equation is linear.
