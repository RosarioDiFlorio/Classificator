Charles Alexander Weibel (born October 28, 1950 in Terre Haute, Indiana) is an American mathematician working on algebraic K-theory, algebraic geometry and homological algebra.
Weibel studied physics and mathematics at the University of Michigan, earning bachelor's degrees in both subjects in 1972. He was awarded a master's degree by the University of Chicago in 1973 and achieved his doctorate in 1977 under the supervision of Richard Swan (Homotopy in Algebraic K-Theory). From 1970 to 1976 he was an "Operations Research Analyst" at Standard Oil in Indiana, and spent 1977–78 at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1978 he became an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and in 1980 an assistant professor at Rutgers University, where he was promoted to professor in 1989.
He joined Vladimir Voevodsky and Markus Rost in proving the (motivic) Bloch–Kato conjecture (2009). It is a generalization of the Milnor conjecture of algebraic K-theory, which was proved by Voevodsky in the 1990s. He was a visiting professor in 1992 in Paris and 1993 in Strasbourg. Since 1983 he has been an editor of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.
In 2014, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
