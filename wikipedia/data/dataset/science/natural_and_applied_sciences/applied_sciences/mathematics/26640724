He is also a retired Fellow and Associate at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is known for his contributions to the development of numerical methods for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations. The Laxâ€“Wendroff method for the solution of hyperbolic PDE was named after Peter Lax and him.
