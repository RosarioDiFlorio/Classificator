Mojżesz Presburger (1904–1943?) was a Polish Jewish mathematician, logician, and philosopher. He was a student of Alfred Tarski and is known for, among other things, having invented Presburger arithmetic as a student in 1929.
He was born in Warsaw on 27 December 1904 and died in the Holocaust, probably 1943.
In 2010, the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science began conferring the annual Presburger Award (named after Mojżesz Presburger) to a young scientist (in exceptional cases to several young scientists) for outstanding contributions in theoretical computer science. Mikołaj Bojańczyk was the first recipient.
