In mathematics and computer science, the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and gives as output the greatest integer 
  
    
      
        
          floor
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        ⌊
        x
        ⌋
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{floor}}(x)=\lfloor x\rfloor }
   that is less than or equal to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . Similarly, the ceiling function maps 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to the least integer 
  
    
      
        
          ceiling
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        ⌈
        x
        ⌉
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{ceiling}}(x)=\lceil x\rceil }
   that is greater than or equal to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  .
