Graciela Beatriz Salicrup López (7 April 1935 – 29 June 1982) was a Mexican architect, archaeologist and mathematician. In the 1970s and 1980s she was a pioneer in the field of categorical topology. Most of her work was published in Spanish, and her original contributions were not widely recognised until after her premature death.
