In mathematics, the indefinite product operator is the inverse operator of 
  
    
      
        Q
        (
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        
          
            
              f
              (
              x
              +
              1
              )
            
            
              f
              (
              x
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q(f(x))={\frac {f(x+1)}{f(x)}}}
  . It is a discrete version of the geometric integral of geometric calculus, one of the non-Newtonian calculi. Some authors use term discrete multiplicative integration
Thus

  
    
      
        Q
        (
        
          ∏
          
            x
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        )
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q(\prod _{x}f(x))=f(x)\,.}
  
More explicitly, if 
  
    
      
        
          ∏
          
            x
          
        
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        F
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \prod _{x}f(x)=F(x)}
  , then

  
    
      
        
          
            
              F
              (
              x
              +
              1
              )
            
            
              F
              (
              x
              )
            
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {F(x+1)}{F(x)}}=f(x)\,.}
  
If F(x) is a solution of this functional equation for a given f(x), then so is CF(x) for any constant C. Therefore each indefinite product actually represents a family of functions, differing by a multiplicative constant.
