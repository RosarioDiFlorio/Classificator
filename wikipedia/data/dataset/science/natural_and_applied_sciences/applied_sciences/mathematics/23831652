Not to be confused with Paul Erdős Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences or Paul Erdős Award of the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions

The Anna and Lajos Erdős Prize in Mathematics is a prize given by the Israel Mathematical Union to an Israeli mathematician (in any field of mathematics and computer science), "with preference to candidates up to the age of 40." The prize was established by Paul Erdős in 1977 in honor of his parents, and is awarded annually or biannually. The name was changed from "Erdős Prize" in 1996, after Erdős's death, to reflect his original wishes.
