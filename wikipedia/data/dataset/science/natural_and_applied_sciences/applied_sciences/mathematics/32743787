Michèle Audin is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the University of Geneva, the University of Paris-Sud and most recently at l'Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) in University of Strasbourg, where she performed research notably in the area of symplectic geometry.
Born in 1954, she is a former student of l'École normale supérieure de jeunes filles within the École Normale Supérieure. She became a member of the Oulipo in 2009.
She is the daughter of mathematician Maurice Audin, who died under torture in 1957 in Algeria, after having been arrested by parachutists of General Jacques Massu. On January 1, 2009, she refused to receive the Legion of Honour, on the grounds that the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father.
