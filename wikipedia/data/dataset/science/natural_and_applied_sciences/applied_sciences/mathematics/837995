A protractor is a measuring instrument, typically made of transparent plastic or glass, for measuring angles. Most protractors measure angles in degrees (Â°). Radian-scale protractors measure angles in radians. Most protractors have 2 sets of numbers, the bottom set is for angles that open to the right and the upper set of the protractor is used to measure angles that open to the left.
They are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering-related applications, but perhaps the most common use is in geometry lessons in schools.
Some protractors are simple half-discs. More advanced protractors, such as the bevel protractor, have one or two swinging arms, which can be used to help measure the angle.
