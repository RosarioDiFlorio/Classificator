Jean Morlet (French: [mɔʁlɛ]; January 13, 1931 – April 27, 2007) was a French geophysicist who pioneered work in the field of wavelet analysis around the year 1975. He invented the term wavelet to describe the functions he was using. In 1981, Morlet worked with Alex Grossman to develop what is now known as the Wavelet transform.
