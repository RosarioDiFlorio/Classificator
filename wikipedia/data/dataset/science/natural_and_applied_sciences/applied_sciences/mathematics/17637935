Stephen Arthur Jennings (May 11, 1915 â€“ February 2, 1979) was a mathematician who made contributions to the study of modular representation theory (Jennings 1941). His advisor was Richard Brauer, and his student Rimhak Ree discovered two infinite series of finite simple groups known as the Ree groups. Jennings was an editor of Mathematics Magazine and an acting president of the University of Victoria.
