The Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT) is the Toulouse Mathematics Institute, a CNRS Research Laboratory which federates the mathematics community of the Toulouse area in France. The IMT is constituted by three main teams (in 2008):
Partial differential equations, numerical analysis, optimization (formerly MIP)
Pure mathematics (formerly Laboratoire Émile Picard)
Statistics & Probability (formerly LSP)
The IMT is one of the largest French research centers in mathematics, and its scientific activities cover almost all domains of mathematics. It comprises approximately 180 permanent researchers and 100 PhD students (in 2008), belonging to various institutions of the University of Toulouse.
The main buildings of the IMT are located on the Paul Sabatier University campus.
The IMT is responsible for the Fermat Prize and the Annales de la Faculté des Sciences de Toulouse.
