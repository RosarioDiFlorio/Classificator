Yum-Tong Siu (蕭蔭堂; born May 6, 1943 in Guangzhou, China) is the William Elwood Byerly Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University.
Siu is a prominent figure in the mathematics of several complex variables. His research interests involve the intersection of complex variables, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. He has resolved various conjectures by applying estimates of the complex Neumann problem and the theory of multiplier ideal sheaves to algebraic geometry.
