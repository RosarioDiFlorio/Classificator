Marta Lewicka is a professor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in mathematical analysis.
Lewicka earned bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics in 1996 from the University of Gdańsk, and a second bachelor's degree in computer science in 1998 from Częstochowa University of Technology. She completed her Ph.D. in 2000 from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy under the supervision of Alberto Bressan. After postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany and a term as L.E. Dickson Instructor at the University of Chicago, she joined the University of Minnesota faculty in 2005. She moved in 2010 to Rutgers University, and again in 2011 to Pittsburgh.
In 2016, she gave an invited address at the AMS/MAA Joint Mathematical Meetings, based on her joint work with Mohammad Reza Pakzad in the area of nonlinear elasticity and geometry of prestrained materials.
