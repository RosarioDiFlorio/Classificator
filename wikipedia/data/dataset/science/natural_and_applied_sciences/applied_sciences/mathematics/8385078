One of the main tools for determining the existence of (or non-existence of) chaos in a perturbed Hamiltonian system is Melnikov theory. In this theory, the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of the perturbed system is calculated up to the first-order term. Consider a smooth dynamical system 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ¨
            
          
        
        =
        f
        (
        x
        )
        +
        ϵ
        g
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}=f(x)+\epsilon g(t)}
  , with 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon \geq 0}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(t)}
   periodic with period 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
  . Suppose for 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon =0}
   the system has a hyperbolic fixed point x0 and a homoclinic orbit 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (t)}
   corresponding to this fixed point. Then for sufficiently small 
  
    
      
        ϵ
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon \neq 0}
   there exists a T-periodic hyperbolic solution. The stable and unstable manifolds of this periodic solution intersect transversally. The distance between these manifolds measured along a direction that is perpendicular to the unperturbed homoclinc orbit 
  
    
      
        ϕ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi (t)}
   is called the Melnikov distance. If 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(t)}
   denotes this distance, then 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        t
        )
        =
        ϵ
        (
        M
        (
        t
        )
        +
        O
        (
        ϵ
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(t)=\epsilon (M(t)+O(\epsilon ))}
  . The function 
  
    
      
        M
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M(t)}
   is called the Melnikov function.
