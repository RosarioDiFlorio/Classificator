Élie Joseph Cartan, ForMemRS (French: [kaʁtɑ̃]; 9 April 1869 – 6 May 1951) was an influential French mathematician who did fundamental work in the theory of Lie groups and their geometric applications. He also made significant contributions to mathematical physics, differential geometry, differential equations, group theory and quantum mechanics. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century.
He successfully defended his thesis on Lie groups at École Normale Supérieure de Paris in 1894. The originality and importance of Cartan's work have only been appreciated since quite recently. Hence, his work was only recognised lately in his life. He received honorary degrees from Harvard University in 1936 and many other universities. He was also elected President of the French Academy of Sciences in 1946 and Foreign Member of the Royal Society one year later.
In addition, he was the father of another influential mathematician, Henri Cartan, the physicist Louis Cartan, the mathematician Hélène Cartan and the composer Jean Cartan.
