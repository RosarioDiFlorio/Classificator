In mathematics, the Kronecker delta (named after Leopold Kronecker) is a function of two variables, usually just positive integers. The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise:

  
    
      
        
          δ
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  0
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  i
                  ≠
                  j
                  ,
                
              
              
                
                  1
                
                
                  
                    if 
                  
                  i
                  =
                  j
                  .
                
              
            
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta _{ij}={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}i\neq j,\\1&{\text{if }}i=j.\end{cases}}}
  
where the Kronecker delta δij is a piecewise function of variables i and j. For example, δ1 2 = 0, whereas δ3 3 = 1.
The Kronecker delta appears naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering, as a means of compactly expressing its definition above.
In linear algebra, the n × n identity matrix I has entries equal to the Kronecker delta:

  
    
      
        
          I
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        
          δ
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I_{ij}=\delta _{ij}}
  
where i and j take the values 1, 2, ..., n, and the inner product of vectors can be written as

  
    
      
        
          a
        
        ⋅
        
          b
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            ,
            j
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          a
          
            i
          
        
        
          δ
          
            i
            j
          
        
        
          b
          
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} =\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}a_{i}\delta _{ij}b_{j}.}
  
The restriction to positive integers is common, but there is no reason it cannot have negative integers as well as positive, or any discrete rational numbers. If i and j above take rational values, then for example

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  δ
                  
                    (
                    −
                    1
                    )
                    (
                    −
                    3
                    )
                  
                
              
              
                
                =
                0
              
              
                
                
                  δ
                  
                    (

                    )

                      )

                          2
                        
                      
                      )

This latter case is for convenience.
