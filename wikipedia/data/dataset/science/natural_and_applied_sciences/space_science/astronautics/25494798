A magnetorquer or magnetic torquer (also known as torque rod) is a satellite system for attitude control, detumbling, and stabilization built from electromagnetic coils. The magnetorquer creates a magnetic field that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually Earth's, so that the counter-forces produced provide useful torque.
