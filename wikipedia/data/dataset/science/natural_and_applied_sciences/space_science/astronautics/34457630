List of large reentering space debris is a list of man made objects reentering Earth's atmosphere by mass (see space debris). They are typically destroyed by reentry heating, but some components can survive. Most of these objects are relatively small but larger objects have survived but usually break up into smaller pieces during reentry.
The STS program brought 134 external tanks into space, they could weigh empty 78,100 pounds (35,425.6 kg), although they were not necessarily completely empty when discarded. There was several different tanks with different weights, including the Standard weight, Lightweight, and Super Lightweight Tank. In general the heavier tanks were early, and over the decades new materials and removal of unnecessary features brought the mass down. The tanks fueled the spacecraft's acceleration to orbital velocity, after which they could be discarded and the STS then used its Orbital Maneuvering System which used a different fuel and engines
Standard weight tank used for first few missions with variations such if they were painted and the anti-geyser line.
Lightweight tank used primarily until 1983 1998, about 30,000 kg (66,000 lb) (Ranged from 68k to 66k lbs over the years)
Super Lightweight Tank, used after 1998, about 58,000 lb
Many other launch systems have discarded spent stages into space, but not all stages go into orbit or even space. For comparison the STS boosters did not reach space.
