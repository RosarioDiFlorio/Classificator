The Eye Tracking Device (ETD) is a headmounted device, designed for measurement of three-dimensional eye and head movements under experimental and natural conditions. The tracker permits comprehensive measurement of eye movement (three degrees of freedom) and optionally head movement (six degrees of freedom). It represents an important tool for the investigation of sensorimotor behaviour, particularly of the vestibular and oculomotor systems in both health and disease.
