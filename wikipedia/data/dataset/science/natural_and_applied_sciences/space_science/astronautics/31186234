Chroococcidiopsis is one of the most primitive cyanobacteria known. It is a photosynthetic, coccoidal bacterium and while a diversity of species and cultures exist within the genus, with a diversity of phenotypes, some members of the genus are known for their ability to survive harsh environmental conditions, including both high and low temperatures, ionizing radiation, and high salinity. Organisms capable of living in such harsh conditions are referred to as extremophiles.
