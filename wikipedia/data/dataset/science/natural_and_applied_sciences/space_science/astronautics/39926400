The Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) effort is an international consortium formed in 2001. Its mission is to define standards and services to enable the establishment and operation of discipline specific Virtual Observatories. The main focus of the consortium is to define and maintain a standard data model to enable data sharing and interoperability within the Space and Solar Physics community. Another goal of the consortium is to facilitate data search and retrieval across the Space and Solar Physics data environment by providing conventions, tools and services to assist data providers, researchers and general users. The SPASE consortium also encourages collaboration between agencies and groups interested in sharing space and solar physics data.
