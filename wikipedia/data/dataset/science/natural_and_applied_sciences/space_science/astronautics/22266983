Federation (Russian: Федерация, Federatsiya), formerly called PPTS (Prospective Piloted Transport System, Перспективная Пилотируемая Транспортная Система, Perspektivnaya Pilotiruemaya Transportnaya Sistema) is a project by Roscosmos to develop a new-generation, partially reusable piloted spacecraft.
Until 2016 its official name was Пилотируемый Транспортный Корабль Нового Поколения, Pilotiruemyi Transportny Korabl Novogo Pokoleniya or PTK NP meaning "New Generation Piloted Transport Ship". The goal of the project is to develop a new-generation spacecraft to replace the aging Soyuz spacecraft developed by the former Soviet Union to support low Earth orbit and lunar operations. It is similar in function to the American Orion spacecraft.
The PPTS project was started following the failed attempt by Russia and the European Space Agency to co-develop the Crew Space Transportation System (CSTS), which until the middle of 2006 was known as the ACTS. Following this the Russian Federal Space Agency ordered the local space industry to finalize proposals for the new manned spacecraft. A firm development contract was awarded to RKK Energia on December 19, 2013.
