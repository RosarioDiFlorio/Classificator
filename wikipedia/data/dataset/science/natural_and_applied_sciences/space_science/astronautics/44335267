Emory is a feature on Earth's Moon, a crater in Taurus-Littrow valley. Astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt landed north of it in 1972, on the Apollo 17 mission, but did not visit it.
Emory is south of Steno crater and Geology Station 1. To the southwest are Mackin and Hess.
The crater was named by the astronauts after explorer and surveyor William H. Emory.
