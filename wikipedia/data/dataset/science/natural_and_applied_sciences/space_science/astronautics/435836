These chronological lists include all crewed spaceflights that reached an altitude of at least 100 km (the FAI definition of spaceflight, see Kármán line), or were launched with that intention but failed. The USA has adopted a slightly different definition of spaceflight, requiring an altitude of only 50 miles (80 km). During the 1960s, 13 flights of the US X-15 rocket plane met the US criteria, but only two met the FAI's. These lists include only the latter two flights; see the list of highest X-15 flights for all 13. As of 24 September 2017, there have been 317 manned spaceflights that reached 100 km or more in altitude (319 including two failed attempts), 8 of which were sub-orbital spaceflights.
To date, there have been four fatal missions in which 18 astronauts died.
