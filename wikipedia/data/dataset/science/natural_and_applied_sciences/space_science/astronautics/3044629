Turkish Technic (Turkish Airlines Maintenance Center), is the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) center of Turkish Airlines. Third party airlines are also served. Turkish Technic is headquartered at Istanbul Ataturk International Airport (IST) on the European side of Istanbul. However, a new complex built at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport (SAW) on the Asian (Anatolia) side of Istanbul, formerly named Turkish Habom (Habom being short for "aviation MRO"), is poised to become the main center of operations.
