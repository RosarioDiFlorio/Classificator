A low-energy transfer, or low-energy trajectory, is a route in space that allows spacecraft to change orbits using very little fuel. These routes work in the Earthâ€“Moon system and also in other systems, such as between the moons of Jupiter. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take longer to complete than higher-energy (more-fuel) transfers, such as Hohmann transfer orbits.
Low-energy transfers are also known as weak stability boundary trajectories, or ballistic capture trajectories.
Low-energy transfers follow special pathways in space, sometimes referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network. Following these pathways allows for long distances to be traversed for little change in velocity, or delta-v.
Missions that have used low-energy transfers include:
Hiten, from JAXA
SMART-1, from ESA
Genesis, from NASA.
GRAIL, from NASA.
Proposed missions using low-energy transfers include:
European Student Moon Orbiter (ESMO)
Mars Direct
