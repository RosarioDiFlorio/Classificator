Delta Mariner is a cargo ship operated by Foss Maritime for United Launch Alliance (ULA). Her primary role is transporting components for the ULA Atlas V and Delta IV rockets from the manufacturer, located in Decatur, Alabama, to launch facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
The ship is designed for shallow inland waterways as well as the open ocean and is capable of carrying up to three 160-foot (49 m) long Delta IV Common Booster Cores. Some cargos carried by Delta Mariner were formerly transported by an Antonov An-124 Ruslan from the manufacturer to the launch site.
