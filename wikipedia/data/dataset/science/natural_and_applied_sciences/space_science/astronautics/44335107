Victory is a feature on Earth's Moon, a crater in Taurus-Littrow valley. Astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt visited it in 1972, on the Apollo 17 mission, during EVA 2. The astronauts stopped at the south rim of Victory on their way back to the Lunar Module from Shorty crater.
To the west of Victory is Shorty crater and to the east are Camelot and Horatio, as well as the landing site itself. To the south is BrontÃ«.
The crater was named by the astronauts honoring Winston Churchill, who delivered the famous 'Victory' speech in 1940.
