G-jitter references forms of periodic or quasisteady residual acceleration encountered in a spacecraft floating through the micro-gravity confines of space. Such variations slightly change the orientation and magnitude of a body force in a low-gravity testing environment, which can either marginally or gravely affect the result of precision-heavy dependent experiments conducted on board a space station. These accelerations are often the result of routine crew activity and equipment operation and the aerodynamic and aeromechanical forces on the spacecraft itself. Using current theoretical methods and previously collected experimental data, it is impossible to predict the exact behavior of a g-jitter acceleration, but with the aforementioned data, it is possible to notice and account for qualitative trends that hold true for most scenarios pertaining to material science testing on board a space station.
