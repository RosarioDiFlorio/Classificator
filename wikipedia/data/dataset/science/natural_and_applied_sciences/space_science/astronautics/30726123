The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 is a U.S. law which authorizes NASA appropriations for fiscal years 2011â€“2013 with the same top-line budget values as requested by President of the United States Barack Obama. It resulted from the Augustine Commission's review of then-current manned space flight plans.
The law supports an overall growth in science, aeronautics, and space technology and defines a long-term goal for human spaceflight to expand a permanent human presence beyond low Earth orbit. Key objectives of this goal include full utilization of the International Space Station (ISS), determining the ability of humans to live in outer space for extended periods of time, maximizing the role of space exploration and space technology in current and future missions, advancing knowledge and inspiring young people into higher education, and building upon international partnerships.
The act was signed into law by President Obama on October 11, 2010. A total of $58 billion in funding is called for, spread across three years.
