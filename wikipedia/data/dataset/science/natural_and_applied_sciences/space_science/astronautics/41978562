Isoinertial denotes a type of resistance used in exercise training which maintains a constant inertia throughout the range of motion, facilitating a constant resistance and maximal muscle force in every angle.
The term isoinertial derives from the words iso (same) and inertial (resistance), which in one terminology describes the primary concept of the isoinertial system, or expressing the same inertia in both the concentric and the eccentric phases of muscle contraction.
