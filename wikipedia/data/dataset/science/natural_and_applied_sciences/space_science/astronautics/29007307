SpaceCollective is a community driven website where information and ideas are being exchanged about the current state of our species, our planet and the universe. The website, founded by film-maker Rene Daalder in collaboration with interactive designer Folkert Gorter, went public at the end of 2007, and is now occupied by more than 2500 contributors. Gorter is besides the site's interaction designer also the main curator of the SpaceCollective Gallery, a showcase of images and texts. The system architecture and technology of the website is created by Josh Pangell. A series of videos is presented on the website called "The Future of Everything". These episodes are edited by Aaron Ohlmann and produced by American Scenes Inc; executive producer: Joseph Kaufman. The website's slogan is "Where forward thinking terrestrials exchange ideas and information about the state of the species, their planet and the universe, living the lives of science fiction today".
