In celestial mechanics the specific relative angular momentum 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              h
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {h}}}
   plays a pivotal role in the analysis of the two-body problem. One can show that it is a constant vector for a given orbit under ideal conditions. This essentially proves Kepler's second law.
It's called specific angular momentum because it's not the actual angular momentum 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              L
              →
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {L}}}
  , but the angular momentum per mass. Thus, the word "specific" in this term is short for "mass-specific" or divided-by-mass:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              h
              →
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                L
                →
              
            
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\vec {h}}={\frac {\vec {L}}{m}}}
  
Thus the SI unit is: m2·s−1. 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   denotes the reduced mass 
  
    
      
        
          
            1
            m
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              m
              
                1
              
            
          
        
        +
        
          
            1
            
              m
              
                2
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{m}}={\frac {1}{m_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{m_{2}}}}
  .
