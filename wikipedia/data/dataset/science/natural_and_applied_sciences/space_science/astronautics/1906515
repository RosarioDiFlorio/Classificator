This is a chronological list of principal expeditions to Mir, a Soviet/Russian space station in low Earth orbit from 1986â€“2001. All principal Mir crews (those that were resident long-term on the station) were named "Mir EO-n", where n is sequentially increased with each expedition. Visiting expeditions, which made short-term visits to the station during handovers between principal expeditions were named "Mir EP-n", and are excluded from this list (see List of human spaceflights to Mir for details). Mir commanders are listed in italics. "Duration" refers to the crew and does not always correspond to "Flight up" or "Flight down".
