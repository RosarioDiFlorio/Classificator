Small Payload Quick Return (SPQR) is a NASA Ames Research Center concept to return small payloads from orbit.
The system uses an Exo-Brake, a parachute-like drag device for use in the low-pressure exosphere of Low Earth Orbit. This is the first part of a three part return system, operating from 350 to 100 km.
