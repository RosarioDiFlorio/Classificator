These are tables of space probes (typically orbiters or components thereof) which have been deliberately destroyed at their objects of study, typically by hard landings or crash landings at the end of their respective missions and/or functionality. This suicidal endeavor not only precludes the hazards of orbital space debris and planetary contamination, but also provides the opportunity in some cases for terminal science given that the transient light released by the kinetic energy may be available for spectroscopy; the physical ejecta remains in place for further study.
In addition, several rocket stages were utilized during the Apollo space program were deliberately crashed on the Moon in order in aid in seismic research, and the Deep Impact mission had its own purpose-built impactor which hit Comet 9P/Tempel 1. Terminal approaches to gas giants which result in the destruction of the space probe count as crash landings for the purposes of this article.
The crash landing sites are of interest to space archeology.
Luna 1, not itself a lunar orbiter, was the first spacecraft to date designed as an impactor. It failed to hit the Moon in 1959, however, and thus inadvertently became the first man-made object to leave geocentric orbit and enter a heliocentric orbit, where it remains to this day.
