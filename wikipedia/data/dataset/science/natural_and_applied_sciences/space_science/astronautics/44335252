Horatio is a feature on Earth's Moon, a crater in Taurus-Littrow valley. Astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt drove along its south rim in 1972, on the Apollo 17 mission, but did not stop.
The larger Camelot crater is to the northeast. Geology Station 5 is along the south rim of Camelot. Victory is to the northwest, and BrontÃ« is to the southwest.
The crater was named by the astronauts after the fictional Horatio Hornblower from the works of C. S. Forester.
