    {\displaystyle \epsilon \,\!}
   (or vis-viva energy) of two orbiting bodies is the constant sum of their mutual potential energy (

    {\displaystyle \epsilon _{k}\,\!}
  ), divided by the reduced mass. According to the orbital energy conservation equation (also referred to as vis-viva equation), it does not vary with time:

        r

        a
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\,\!}
   is the semi-major axis.
It is expressed in J/kg = m2·s−2 or MJ/kg = km2·s−2. For an elliptic orbit the specific orbital energy is the negative of the additional energy required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram to escape velocity (parabolic orbit). For a hyperbolic orbit, it is equal to the excess energy compared to that of a parabolic orbit. In this case the specific orbital energy is also referred to as characteristic energy.
