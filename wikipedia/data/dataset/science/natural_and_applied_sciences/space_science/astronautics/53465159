The SpaceX lunar tourism mission (not an official name) is a planned private mission to fly two space tourists around the moon aboard SpaceX's Dragon 2 spacecraft. SpaceX aims for a launch sometime late 2018, after the Dragon 2 is tested and flown under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The Space X lunar tourism mission could fall around the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 flight, which flew astronauts around the moon for the first time, as part of the Apollo program. The announcement for this mission was made on February 27, 2017.
