Astronautical hygiene evaluates and mitigates hazards and health risks to those working in low-gravity environments. The discipline of astronautical hygiene includes such topics as: the use and maintenance of life support systems, the risks of the extravehicular activity, the risks of exposure to chemicals or radiation, the characterization of hazards, human factor issues and the development of risk management strategies. Astronautical hygiene works side by side with space medicine to ensure that astronauts will be healthy and safe when working in space.
