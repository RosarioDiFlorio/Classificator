Nexcelle is a joint venture between GE Aviation’s Middle River Aircraft Systems and Safran Nacelles – both of which are suppliers of engine nacelles, thrust reversers and aerostructures.
Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Nexcelle has teamed with its parent companies to develop, produce and support integrated propulsion systems for jet engine applications on single-aisle jetliners and business aircraft.
With its initial program win, Nexcelle is positioned as a key partner on the world’s first truly integrated propulsion system, the CFM International LEAP-1C engine on China’s COMAC C919 jetliner. The joint venture subsequently was selected to provide the nacelle and thrust reverser for GE’s Passport integrated propulsion system, which powers the Bombardier Global 7000 and Global 8000 business jets.
