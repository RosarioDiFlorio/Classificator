Eurostar is a satellite bus made by Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium, and before 1994, formerly United Satellite, a consortium of British Aerospace, and Matra Marconi Space (the former Marconi Space merged with Matra's former Matra Espace)) which has been used for a series of spacecraft providing telecommunications services in geosynchronous orbit (GEO). More than 70 Eurostar satellites have been ordered to date, of which more than 55 have been successfully launched since October 1990 and have proven highly reliable in operational service. In December 2013, the Eurostar satellites accumulated 500 years of successful operations in orbit. The Eurostar spacecraft series is designed for a variety of telecommunications needs including fixed services and broadcast, mobile services, broadband and secured communications.
