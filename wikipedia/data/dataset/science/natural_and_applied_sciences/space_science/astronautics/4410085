The Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) is a European Space Agency (ESA) experimental suborbital re-entry vehicle. It was developed to serve as a prototype spaceplane to validate the ESA's work in the field of reusable launchers.
The IXV was developed specifically for evaluation and technology-proving purposed for the ESA within the frame of the Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP). The programme inherited the valuable data and principles from previously conducted studies, such as CNES's Pre-X and the ESA's AREV (Atmospheric Reentry Experimental Vehicle), and the successful Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator (ARD), which had flown during 1998. The IXV was developed under the leadership of the NGL Prime SpA company.
On 11 February 2015, the IXV conducted its first 100-minute space flight, successfully completing is mission upon landing intact on the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The vehicle holds the distinction of being the first ever lifting body to perform full atmospheric reentry from orbital speed. The successor of IXV will be the PRIDE spaceplane (Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe).
