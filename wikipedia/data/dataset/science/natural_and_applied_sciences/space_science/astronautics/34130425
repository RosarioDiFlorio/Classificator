This article documents expected notable spaceflight events during the year 2019.
During the first quarter, China plans to launch Tianhe-1, the core module of the Chinese Space Station (CSS), which will comprise three large modules when completed. China also intends to launch Chang'e 5, the first sample-return mission to the Moon since Luna 24 in 1976. Both of these missions will use the recently-developed Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket.
The trend towards cost reduction in access to orbit is expected to continue. United Launch Alliance plans to debut their Vulcan rocket, which was designed to gradually replace Atlas V at lower costs. Khrunichev is scheduled to launch the two-stage Proton Light and Medium derivatives of their Proton-M workhorse, to accommodate lighter payloads at reduced costs.
The long-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, the largest space telescope ever built, will be launched to the Earth-Sun L2 point by a European Ariane 5 rocket.
