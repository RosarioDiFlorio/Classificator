Space Infrastructure Servicing (SIS) is a spacecraft being developed by Canadian aerospace firm MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates to operate as a small-scale in-space refueling depot for communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Intelsat is a requirements and funding partner for the initial demonstration satellite which, as of March 2011, was planned to be launched in approximately 2015. MDA put the launch plans on hold in November 2011 pending finding a second launch partner, beyond Intelsat. Such a customer was not found, and Intelsat dropped out of the collaboration in January 2012.  In February 2012, MDA indicated that it was waiting on a possible DARPA contract before shelving the project. In February 2017, DARPA selected MDA's Palo Alto, California company, SSL, as their commercial partner for the Agencyâ€™s Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program.
