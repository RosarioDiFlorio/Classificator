"Houston, we have a problem" is a popular but erroneous quote from the radio communications between the Apollo 13 astronaut John Swigert and the NASA Mission Control Center ("Houston") during the Apollo 13 spaceflight, as the astronauts communicated their discovery of the explosion that crippled their spacecraft. The erroneous wording was popularized by the 1995 film Apollo 13, a dramatization of the Apollo 13 mission, in which actor Tom Hanks, portraying Mission Commander Jim Lovell, uses that wording, which became one of the film's taglines.
The words actually spoken, initially by Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert, were "Ok, Houston, we've had a problem here" (emphasis added). After being prompted to repeat the transmission by CAPCOM Jack R. Lousma, Lovell responded, "Uh, Houston, we've had a problem."
Since then, the phrase has become popular, being used to account, informally, the emergence of an unforeseen problem.
