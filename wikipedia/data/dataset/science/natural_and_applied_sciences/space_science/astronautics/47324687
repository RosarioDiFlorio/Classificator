Manfred Memorial Moon Mission (4M) was the first commercial mission to the Moon. It was led by LuxSpace, a child company of German OHB System, in honor of OHB Systems founder, professor Manfred Fuchs, who died in 2014, and was carried on the Chinese Chang'e 5-T1 test spacecraft. The Moon flyby took place on 28 October 2014, after which the spacecraft entered the elliptical earth orbit and continued transmission until 11 November 2014, exceeding its designed lifetime by four times.
