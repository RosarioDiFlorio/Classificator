This is a list of visitors to the Salyut space stations in alphabetical order. The names of stations to the right of crew members indicate which stations they visited. If they were a member of an Expedition crew aboard that station, the station name is in bold, and if they commanded the station, the station name is in italics. All cosmonauts were citizens of the Soviet Union unless otherwise noted.
