The Deep Space Gateway (DSG) is a crew-tended cislunar space station concept proposed for possible partnership between NASA and Roscosmos  for construction in the 2020s. The station would be used as a staging point for the proposed Deep Space Transport, which is a concept of a reusable vehicle that uses electric and chemical propulsion and would be specifically designed for crewed missions to destinations such as Mars. If funded, the Gateway will be developed, serviced, and utilized in collaboration with commercial and international partners for use as a staging ground for robotic and crewed lunar surface missions and for travel to Mars.
