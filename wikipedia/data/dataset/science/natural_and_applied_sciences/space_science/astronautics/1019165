The Dream Chaser Cargo System is a planned American reusable automated cargo lifting-body spaceplane being developed by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) Space Systems. The Dream Chaser is designed to resupply the International Space Station with both pressurized and unpressurized cargo. The vehicle will launch vertically on an Atlas V, Ariane 5 or Falcon Heavy rocket, and autonomously land horizontally on conventional runways. Further development of the spaceplane includes a crewed version, the Dream Chaser Space System, which would be capable of carrying up to seven people to and from low Earth orbit.
