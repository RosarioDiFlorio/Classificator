A geosynchronous transfer orbit or geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is a Hohmann transfer orbit used to reach geosynchronous or geostationary orbit using high thrust chemical engines.
Geosynchronous orbits (GSO) are useful for various civilian and military purposes, but demand a great deal of Delta-v to attain. Since, for station-keeping, satellites intended for this orbit typically carry highly efficient but low thrust engines, total mass delivered to GSO is generally maximized if the launch vehicle provides only the Delta-v required to be at high thrust—i.e., to escape Earth's atmosphere and overcome gravitational losses—and the satellite provides the Delta-v required to turn the resulting intermediate orbit, which is the GTO, into the useful GSO.
