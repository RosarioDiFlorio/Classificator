2018 is expected to bring a number of milestones in spaceflight. The first crewed missions of both CST-100 Starliner and Dragon 2 capsules to the ISS are scheduled to restore American manned spaceflight capabilities, which stopped with the last Space Shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX plans to send two space tourists on a free return trajectory around the Moon in late 2018, with a Dragon 2 riding a Falcon Heavy rocket. Falcon Heavy, with an expected maiden flight in January, will have the largest payload to Low Earth orbit of all operational rockets. The maiden flight of NASA's Space Launch System has slipped to 2019.
In planetary exploration, the NASA InSight seismology probe is expected to launch and land on Mars within 2018. ESA and JAXA will launch BepiColombo to Mercury, on a 10-year mission featuring several flybys and eventually deploying two orbiters in 2025 for local study. Two asteroid sampling missions Hayabusa 2 and OSIRIS-REx will reach their respective targets Ryugu and Bennu during summer.
China will launch its Chang'e 4 lander/rover in the latter part of the year. The mission was originally designated as a backup of its Chang'e 3 mission but later re-purposed to attempt the first ever soft landing on the far side of the Moon. China will also launch the core module Tianhe-1, which is the first of three large modules that will make up the completed Chinese Space Station (CSS).
