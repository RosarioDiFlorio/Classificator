The Armstrong limit, often called Armstrong's line, is the altitude that produces an atmospheric pressure so low (0.0618 atmosphere or 6.3 kPa (47 mmHg)) that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 36,6 °C (98.6 °F). It is named after Harry George Armstrong, who founded the U.S. Air Force's Department of Space Medicine in 1947 at Randolph Field, Texas. Armstrong was the first to recognize this phenomenon, which occurs at an altitude beyond which humans absolutely cannot survive in an unpressurized environment. Above Earth, this begins at an altitude of approximately 18 km (60,000 ft) to about 19 km (62,000 ft).
