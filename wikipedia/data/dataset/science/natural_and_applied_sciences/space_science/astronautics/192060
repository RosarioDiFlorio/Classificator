Soyuz 7K-T No.39, (also named Soyuz 18a or Soyuz 18-1 by some sources and also known as the April 5 Anomaly) was an unsuccessful launch of a manned Soyuz spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1975. The mission was expected to dock with the orbiting Salyut 4 space station, but due to a failure of the Soyuz launch vehicle the crew failed to achieve orbit. The crew consisted of commander Vasili Lazarev, and flight engineer Oleg Makarov, a civilian. The crew, who feared initially they had landed in China, were successfully recovered.
The accident was disclosed by the normally secretive Soviets as it occurred during preparations for their joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project with the United States which flew three months later. While Lazarev never flew to space again and never fully recovered from the accident, Makarov made two more flights on board a Soyuz (both of which were to the Salyut 6 space station).
