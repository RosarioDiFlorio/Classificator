The International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC) is an annual summer camp for young people with an interest in astronomy. Established in 1969, the IAYC has taken place in over 30 different places in Europe, North Africa and the Near East. The main goals of the camp are for participants to have fun collaborating in astronomical explorations, and to bring people together from different regions of the world by encouraging them to work together and learn more about science and its methods. Participants work on astronomical projects in working groups. Since 1969 more than 1500 young people have taken part in the IAYC. Nowadays, between 60 and 75 people participate in each camp.
The IAYC attracts all kinds of participants: those who enjoy astronomy as a general interest to those make it their job. Some participants have later on gained astronomy related jobs that brought them fame. Examples are Erich Karkoschka, a German astronomer and Govert Schilling, a Dutch science journalist.
Recent camps have seen participants organizing so called Preunions in advance of the camp. These events are used to get to know each other and see a little bit more of the neighbourhood, as most of the camp will take place in an isolated area.
Throughout the year, many reunions take place. A returning tradition is the so-called New Year's Reunion, which is organized by a participant, anywhere in Europe. Successful reunions have seen more than 30 participants. Recent locations have been England, Hungary, Belgium, Serbia and Macedonia.
