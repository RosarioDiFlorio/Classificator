Brorfelde Observatory (Brorfelde Observatoriet) is an astronomical observatory (IAU code 054) home to the Brorfelde Schmidt Telescope. It was run as a branch of the Copenhagen University Observatory until 1996. It still has telescopes that are used by University of Copenhagen students, but the staff that manned them moved to the Rockefeller Complex in Copenhagen. It is located near Holb√¶k, Denmark.
The Hungaria main-belt asteroid 3309 Brorfelde was discovered at, and named for the observatory. It was its first minor planet discovery. Naming citation was published on 7 September 1987 (M.P.C. 12210).
