The Terebellum, by Ptolemy called τετράπλευρον (/tetrápleuron/), is a quadrilateral of stars in the constellation Sagittarius. It is formed of four 4th magnitude stars, all within two degrees of each other:
Omega Sagittarii, at the northeast corner.
59 Sagittarii or b Sagittarii, at the southeast corner.
60 Sagittarii or A Sagittarii, at the northwest corner.
62 Sagittarii or c Sagittarii, at the southwest corner.
The stars are not gravitationally bound to each other as they are at different distances from the Earth.
