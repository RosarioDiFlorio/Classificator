An extrasolar object (from Latin extra, meaning "outside or beyond", and solaris, meaning "of the Sun") is an astronomical object that exists outside the Solar System. It is not applied to stars, or any other celestial object that is larger than a star or the Solar System, such as a galaxy. The terms for extrasolar examples of Solar System bodies are:
Extrasolar planet, also called an "exoplanet"
Extrasolar moon, also called an "exomoon"
Exocomet, an extrasolar comet
Extrasolar asteroid, with one identified as of 2013, orbiting GD 61
Some Solar System object classes, such as minor planets, dwarf planets and Trans-Neptunian objects have not been detected outside the Solar System.
