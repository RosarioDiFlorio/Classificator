Xuntian (Chinese: 巡天; pinyin: Xún Tiān; literally: "Heavenly Cruiser") is a planned Chinese space telescope currently in the designing stages. It is to feature a 2-meter diameter primary mirror and is expected to have a field of view 300 times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. The launch of the telescope is planned for around 2022 and its orbit is planned to be near the upcoming Chinese large modular space station.
