Astronomy Ireland is an astronomy association based in Ireland (including the Republic and Northern Ireland). It is a non-profit educational organisation, separate but connected to its parent company 'Astronomy & Space Ltd.', owned by its director David Moore. The club does not hold annual general meetings nor allow its membership to elect its officers. It does not publish annual accounts, despite publicly aired concerns about its close relationship with the chairman's commercial interests.
