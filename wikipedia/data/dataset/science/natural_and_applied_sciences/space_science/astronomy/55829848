ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics) is a miniaturized space telescope meant as a technology demonstrator to advance the capabilities for astrophysical measurements. Its bus is a nanosatellite of the 6U CubeSat format. It was designed in collaboration between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
ASTERIA was launched on 14 August 2017 and deployed into low Earth orbit from the International Space Station on 20 November 2017. The primary mission will last 90 days, but an extended mission is likely. The Principal Investigator is Canadian-American astronomer and planetary scientist Sara Seager, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
