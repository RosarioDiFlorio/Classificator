Multi-messenger astronomy is astronomy based on the coordinated observation and interpretation of disparate "messenger" signals. The four messengers are electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. They are created by different astrophysical processes, and thus reveal different information about their sources.
The main multi-messenger sources outside the heliosphere are expected to be compact binary pairs (black holes and neutron stars), supernovae, irregular neutron stars, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and relativistic jets.
Detection from one messenger and non-detection from a different messenger can also be informative.
