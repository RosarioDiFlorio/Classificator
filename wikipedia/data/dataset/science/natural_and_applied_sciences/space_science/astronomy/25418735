The Prairie Meteorite Network was a system of sixteen camera stations in Midwestern United States, run by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1964 to 1975. The network used surplus aerocameras with 6.3â€“12 inch focal length wide angle metrogon lenses that covered a format of 9 x 18 inches on aero roll film. During ten years of network activity only one meteorite fall was recorded, the Lost City meteorite in 1970.
