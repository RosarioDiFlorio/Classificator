MASCARA (Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA) is a Exoplanet experiment by Leiden University. It has two stations, one in each hemisphere, each of which use cameras to make short exposure photographs of most of the visible sky to observe stars to a magnitude of 8.4. The northern hemisphere station at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, started observations in February 2015. The southern hemisphere station at La Silla Observatory, Chile, saw first light in July 2017.
On 17 July 2017, the discovery of MASCARA-1b, a confirmed exoplanet, was reported by the survey team. MASCARA-1b is a hot Jupiter transiting its parent A-type star; its orbit is misaligned with the star's rotation. A second planet, MASCARA-2b, was also announced, also a hot Jupiter orbiting an A-type star.
