The Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope, better known simply as MOST, is Canada's first space telescope. Up until nearly 10 years after its launch it was also the smallest space telescope in orbit (for which its creators nicknamed it the “Humble Space Telescope”, in reference to one of the largest, the Hubble). MOST is the first spacecraft dedicated to the study of asteroseismology, subsequently followed by the now-completed COROT and Kepler missions. It was also the first Canadian science satellite launched since ISIS II, 32 years previously.
