The International Astrostatistics Association (IAA) is a non-profit professional organization for astrostatisticians. Astrostatistics as a discipline is composed of astrophysicists, statisticians, and those in computer information sciences who have an interest in the statistical analysis and data mining of astronomical data. The Association was founded as an independent organization in August 2012 by the Astrostatistics Committee and Network of the International Statistical Institute (ISI).
The foremost objective of the IAA is to foster collaboration between statisticians and astrophysicists. The Association is managed by the IAA Council, composed of representatives from the ISI Astrostatistics Committee and the Astrostatistics Working Groups of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and American Astronomical Society (AAS). The IAA has its convention in association with the biannual ISI World Statistics Congress.
In April 2014, an independent group was created within the IAA, the Cosmostatistics Initiative (COIN). Whose objective is to create a friendly environment where hands-on collaboration between astronomers, cosmologists, statisticians and machine learning experts can flourish.
