Lynx X-ray Surveyor is a concept study for the next X-ray space telescope mission. Still a preliminary concept in formulation, it will be presented to the United States Decadal Survey in 2019 for a possible selection to NASA's Flagship Program. If funded and developed, Lynx will be able to detect and characterize extremely faint objects and study physical processes in a very wide range of astrophysical settings.
The name lynx was chosen because the animal is "a symbol of great insight with the ability to see through solid objects to reveal the true nature of things."
