The astrolabe of Barcelona is considered the most ancient astrolabe with Carolingian characters that has survived in the Christian Occident. The French researcher Marcel Destombes founded the astrolabe, and left it as legacy to the Institute of the Arab World of Paris in 1983.
The Academy of Sciences of Barcelona asked the astrolabe in loan to the Mus√©e of l'Institut du Monde Arabe, to make a replica, today this replica is on display at the Academy of Sciences in the Ramblas.
