Jupiter radius or Jovian radius (RJ or RJup) is the distance equal to the radius of planet Jupiter. It has a value of 71,492 km (44,423 mi), or 11.2 Earth radii (R⊕) (one Earth radius equals 0.08921 RJ). Jupiter radius is a unit of length used in astronomy to describe the radii of gas giants and some extrasolar planets. It is also used in describing brown dwarfs.
In 2015, the International Astronomical Union defined the nominal equatorial Jovian radius to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of RJ. This constant is defined as exactly:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              R
            
          
          
            
              e
              J
            
          
          
            
              N
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}_{\mathrm {eJ} }^{\mathrm {N} }}
   = 7.1492×107 m
Similarly, the nominal polar Jovian radius is defined to be exactly:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              R
            
          
          
            
              p
              J
            
          
          
            
              N
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}_{\mathrm {pJ} }^{\mathrm {N} }}
   = 6.6854×107 m
These values correspond to the radius of Jupiter at 1 bar of pressure. The common usage is to refer to the equatorial radius, unless the polar radius is specifically needed.
