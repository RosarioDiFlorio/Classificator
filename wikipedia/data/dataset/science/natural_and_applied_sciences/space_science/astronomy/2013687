Vixen is a Japanese company that makes telescopes, binoculars, spotting scopes and accessories for their products.
Among many other more mainstream products they have created two unusual varieties of catadioptric telescopes with an open tube design instead of the full-aperture corrector plate of the Schmidt–Cassegrain and most Maksutov–Cassegrain designs.
