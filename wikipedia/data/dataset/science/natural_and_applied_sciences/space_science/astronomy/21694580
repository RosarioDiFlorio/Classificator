An interstellar object is a body other than a star or substellar object located in interstellar space, and not gravitationally bound to a star. They may include asteroids or comets (or exocomets). Besides known comets within the Solar System, or known extrasolar comets, at present, an interstellar comet can only be detected if it passes through the Solar System, and could be distinguished from an Oort cloud comet by its strongly hyperbolic trajectory (indicating that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun). Until 2017, the most eccentric known object, C/1980 E1, only had an eccentricity of 1.057, far less eccentric than an interstellar comet would be expected to be.
The first discovered, and only known interstellar object to date, is ʻOumuamua (previously C/2017 U1 and A/2017 U1). The object has an eccentricity of about 1.20. It was initially named C/2017 U1 because it was assumed to be a comet, but was renamed to A/2017 U1 after no cometary activity was found. After its interstellar nature was confirmed, it was renamed to 1I/ʻOumuamua – 1 because it is the first such object to be discovered, I for interstellar, and 'Oumuamua' is a Hawaiian word meaning "a messenger from afar arriving first".
