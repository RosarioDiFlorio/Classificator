EURONEAR, the European Near Earth Asteroids Research, is a research project which aims to develop a research network which will search, discover and monitor near-Earth objects and potentially hazardous asteroids using two automated dedicated 1â€“2 metre telescopes located in both hemispheres and other facilities available to the members of the network. The Minor Planet Center directly credits EURONEAR with the discovery of several minor planets in 2008.
