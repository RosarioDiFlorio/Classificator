The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is a consortium of consortia, comprising the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), and the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). The goal of the IPTA is to detect gravitational waves using an array of approximately 30 pulsars. This goal is shared by each of the participating consortia individually, but they have all recognized that their goal will be achieved more quickly in collaboration, and by combining their respective resources.
