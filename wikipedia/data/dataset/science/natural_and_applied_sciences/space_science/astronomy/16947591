A Copyscope is type of refracting telescope that can be made by hand rather than bought in which the objective lens comes from an old photocopy machine, hence the origin of the name. The lenses usually come from defective or old photocopiers, allowing for the objective to be obtained for free or low cost They are usually modest aperture lenses, ranging from 50mm to 60mm, of short focal length, good for use in a portable, wide-field telescope, but unsuitable for higher magnifications.
