Recessional velocity is the rate at which an astronomical object is moving away, typically from Earth. It can be measured by shifts in spectral lines or estimated by general reddening of a galactic spectra.
Galaxies outside our galaxy often have their recessional velocity calculated relative to the cosmic microwave background.
