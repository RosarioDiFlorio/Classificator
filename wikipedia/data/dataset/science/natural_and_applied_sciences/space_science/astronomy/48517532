The CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) is a space telescope being mainly used to perform high precision observations of electrons and gamma rays. It tracks the trajectory of electrons, protons, nuclei, and gamma rays and measures their direction, charge and energy, which may help understand the nature of dark matter or nearby sources of high-energy particle acceleration.
The mission was developed and sponsored by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy and USA. CALET launched aboard JAXA's H-II Transfer Vehicle Kounotori 5 (HTV-5) in August 2015 and was placed on the International Space Station's Japanese Kibo module.
