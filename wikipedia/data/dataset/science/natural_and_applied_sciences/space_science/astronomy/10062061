The SSPSF (stochastic self-propagating star formation) model of star formation was proposed by Mueller & Arnett in 1976, generalized afterward by Gerola & Seiden in 1978 and Gerola, Seiden, & Schulman in 1980. This model proposes that star formation propagates via the action of shock waves produced by stellar winds and supernovae that compose the interstellar medium.
In 1999, the prevailing density wave model for the generation of spiral arms in galaxies was combined with SSPSF in an doctoral thesis by Auer.
SSPSF processes were demonstrated in an early prototype ("Gaslight") of the 2008 video game Spore.
