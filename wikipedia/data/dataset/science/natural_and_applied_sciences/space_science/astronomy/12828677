The Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy (MIRA) is a privately established, non-profit, professional organization for astronomical education and research, near Monterey, California. It is located adjacent to the campus of the California State University, Monterey Bay, within the city limits of Marina, California. (MIRA is not affiliated with CSUMB.)
MIRA was founded in 1972. The acronym "MIRA" was chosen because of the unusual star of that name.
MIRA maintains two observatories: the Weaver Student Observatory adjacent to the in-town offices of MIRA, and the Oliver Observing Station in the Los Padres National Forest.
