Turdus Solitarius (Latin for solitary thrush) was a constellation created by French astronomer Pierre Charles Lemonnier in 1776 from stars of Hydra's tail. It was named after the Rodrigues solitaire, an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Rodrigues East of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It was replaced by another constellation, Noctua (the Owl), in A Celestial Atlas (1822) by the British amateur astronomer Alexander Jamieson. Neither constellation is in current use.
