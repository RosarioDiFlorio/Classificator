The Space Observatory (Observatoire de l’Espace) is an art-science laboratory created in 2000 by CNES (the French Space Agency) to promote a new vision of outer space, different from that of popular science. Space has a major influence on people’s perceptions and imagination. The Observatoire de l’Espace introduces artists to the activities of the CNES and paves the way for any kind of space-inspired creations. Those creations strongly connected to space art are thereafter shared with the wider audience.
