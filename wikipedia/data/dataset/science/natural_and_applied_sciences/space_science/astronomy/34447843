This list contains proposals for space telescopes, space-based (situated in space) astronomical observatories. The list of proposed space observatories is a list containing examples of past and present space observatory plans, concepts, and proposals. For observatories in orbit, see list of space telescopes. Unlike that list, this list includes concept and proposals that were not and in all likelihood will not ever be launched as they may have been cancelled or were only ever proposals.
