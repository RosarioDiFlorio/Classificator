The OVRO 40 meter Telescope is part of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory located near Big Pine, California, US. The telescope was dedicated in 1968 and since then it has been used to conduct interferometric observations along with the other telescopes in the observatory, as a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) station and as a single dish instrument. Its main focus today is on the monitoring of blazars.
