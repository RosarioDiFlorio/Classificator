Telescope for Habitable Exoplanets and Interstellar/Intergalactic Astronomy (THEIA) is a NASA-proposed 4-metre optical/ultraviolet space telescope that would succeed the Hubble Space Telescope and complement the infrared-James Webb Space Telescope. THEIA would use a 40-metre occulter to block starlight so as to directly image exoplanets.
It was proposed with three main instruments and an occulter:
eXoPlanet Characterizer (XPC)
Star Formation Camera (SFC),
Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS)
A separate occulter spacecraft
