Quadrans Muralis (Latin for mural quadrant) was a constellation created by the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande in 1795. It depicted a wall-mounted quadrant that he and his nephew Michel Lefrançois de Lalande had charted the celestial sphere with. It was between the constellations of Boötes and Draco, near the tail of Ursa Major, containing stars between β Bootis and η Ursae Majoris (Alkaid). This constellation is not recognized by the IAU. However, the Quadrantid meteor shower is named after it.
Johann Elert Bode converted its name to Latin as Quadrans Muralis and shrank the constellation a little in his 1801 Uranographia star atlas, to avoid it clashing with neighboring constellations.
