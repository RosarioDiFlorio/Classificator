The Yorkshire Planetarium was a planetarium in the grounds of Harewood House, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, from May 2007 until October 2009. The Yorkshire Planetarium organisation has announced that it is laying plans for a permanent base in Bradford and until that is developed it will be touring various locations during International Year of Astronomy 2009.
The planetarium at Harewood consisted of three linked 16 metre geodesic domes designed by Amelia Y'Mech, one of which one was dedicated to the planetarium itself while the others were used as the main entrance with an 10m high climbing frame and a 3D theatre featuring a 'A Poets Journey through Space', a locally made 3D production with poetry by Ian Macmillan, graphics by Vex films and produced by Richard Everiss.
The planetarium was privately funded until it was sold to Bradford College, funded by the Regional Development Fund in April 2008.
