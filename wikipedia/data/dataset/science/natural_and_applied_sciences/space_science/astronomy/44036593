The International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (or ICRAR) is an international centre of excellence in astronomical science and technology, launched in 2009 as a joint venture between Curtin University and the University of Western Australia. ICRAR attracts some of the world's leading researchers in radio astronomy, contributing to Australian and international scientific and technical programs for the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, the world's biggest ground-based telescope array which is in its design phase and the two Australian SKA precursors, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), both located at Murchison, Western Australia. The headquarters of ICRAR are located in Crawley, Western Australia.
