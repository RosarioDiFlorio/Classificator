A star trail is a type of photograph that utilizes long-exposure times to capture the apparent motion of stars in the night sky due to Earth's rotation. A star-trail photograph shows individual stars as streaks across the image, with longer exposures resulting in longer arcs. Typical exposure times for a star trail range from 15 minutes to several hours, requiring a "Bulb" setting on the camera to open the shutter for a period longer than usual.
Star trails have been used by professional astronomers to measure the quality of observing locations for major telescopes.
