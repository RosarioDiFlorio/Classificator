The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, is among the largest astrophysics groups in the UK. It includes the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility, and the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre. The Centre was formed after the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST which brought two astronomy groups together. The Jodrell Bank site also hosts the headquarters of the SKA Organisation (SKAO) - a global entity that is set to become an International Governmental Organisation (IGO). The SKA  will be the largest telescope in the world - construction is expected to start at the end of this decade.
The JBCA is part of the School of Physics and Astronomy. The current Director is Professor Michael Garrett.
