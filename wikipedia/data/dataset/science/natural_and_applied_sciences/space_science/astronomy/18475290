GRB 070125 is a gamma-ray burst that occurred on 2007 January 25. It is unique in that it did not occur in a galaxy, but in intergalactic space. This is unusual, since GRBs are caused by hypernovae of young massive stars, which usually means having to reside in a galaxy, as almost all stars are formed in galaxies, particularly high mass ones.
It is theorized that the star formed in the tidal tail resulting from the interaction of two nearby galaxies, deep in intergalactic space.
A month after it was detected, the Large Binocular Telescope observed a 26th magnitude optical afterglow from the gamma ray burst
