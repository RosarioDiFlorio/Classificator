Origins Space Telescope (OST) is a concept study for the Far-Infrared Surveyor space telescope mission. Still a preliminary concept in formulation, it will be presented to the United States Decadal Survey in 2019 for a possible selection to NASA's Flagship Program. The OST would provide an array of new tools for studying star formation and the energetics and physical state of the interstellar medium within the Milky Way using infrared radiation and new spectroscopic capabilities.
Study groups, primarily composed of international community members, will prioritize the science identification and science drivers of the mission architecture. The study groups draw upon input from the international astronomical community; such a large mission will need international participation and support to make it a reality.
