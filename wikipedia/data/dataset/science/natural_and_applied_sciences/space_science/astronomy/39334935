The Astronomer's Telegram (ATel) is an internet service for quickly disseminating information about events relevant for astronomers. Examples include gamma-ray bursts, microlenses, supernovae, novae, or X-ray transients, but there are no restrictions on content matter.
The Astronomer's Telegram was launched on 17 December 1997 by Robert E. Rutledge with the goal of rapidly (<1 s) sharing information of interest to astronomers. Telegrams are sent out daily by email, but especially time sensitive events can be transmitted instantly. Since 2013, information is also broadcast over Twitter and Facebook.
To publish, astronomers request credentials. Credentials are issued to professional astronomers and graduate students, after verification by personal contact. Once credentials have been supplied and telegrams authorized, astronomers can publish telegrams directly, with no further editing.
As of June 2017, over 10500 telegrams have been published.
