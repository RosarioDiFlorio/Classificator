Cold Camera Photography is a technique used by astrophotographers to avoid noise when taking shots with very long exposures using DSLRs or traditional film cameras. This is achieved through a variety of methods, but the two most popular are using cameras with self-cooling sensors, or running dry ice over the film before using it. By cooling the cameras sensor one can take longer shots without the worry of the chip heating up, thereby reducing thermal, shot and read noise. This technique was invented by Jack B. Netwon.
