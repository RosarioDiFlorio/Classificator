The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) is one of a number of instruments aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory satellite (SOHO). LASCO consists of three solar coronagraphs with nested fields of view:
C1 - a Fabry–Pérot interferometer coronagraph imaging from 1.1 to 3 solar radii
C2 - a white light coronagraph imaging from 1.5 to 6 solar radii (orange)
C3 - a white light coronagraph imaging from 3.7 to 30 solar radii (blue)
The first principal investigator was Dr. Guenter Brueckner. These coronagraphs monitor the solar corona by using an optical system to create, in effect, an artificial solar eclipse. The white light coronagraphs C2 and C3 produce images of the corona over much of the visible spectrum, while the C1 interferometer produces images of the corona in a number of very narrow visible wavelength bands.
