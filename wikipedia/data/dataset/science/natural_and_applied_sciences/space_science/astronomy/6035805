Meteorite falls, also called observed falls, are meteorites collected after their fall from space was observed by people or automated devices. All other meteorites are called "finds". There are more than 1,100 documented falls listed in widely used databases, most of which have specimens in modern collections. As of early 2017, the Meteoritical Bulletin Database has 1,149 confirmed falls (excluding rocks found nearby on the ground which turn out to not be associated with the fall and those with doubtful status).
