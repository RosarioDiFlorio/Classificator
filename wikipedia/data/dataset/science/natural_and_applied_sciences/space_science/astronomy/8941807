The Lunar Explorers Society is an organisation dedicated to achieving permanent presence of humanity on the Moon. The Society is open to all people in the world with an interest in Lunar exploration. It hopes to bring the best of humanity to the Moon, and to bring the benefits of the Moon to all people on Earth.
The Moon has not been visited by man since 1972, and though the first manned exploration efforts provided a huge scientific return, no further human Exploration of the Moon has been done. However, several robotic Lunar exploration missions have been conducted since the beginning of the 1990s. These missions fuelled the desire to return to the Moon among many Lunar enthusiast, and this was the background for the establishment of the Lunar Explorers Society in 2000. The founding members saw the need for an organisation where the members could share knowledge, join forces and pursue their ultimate goal: To establish a permanent human presence on the Moon to the benefit of all people on Earth.
