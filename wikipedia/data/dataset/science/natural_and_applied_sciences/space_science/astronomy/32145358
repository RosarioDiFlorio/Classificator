Eclipse seasons are the only times during a year eclipses can occur, due to the inclination of the Moon's orbit. Each season lasts for approximately 34 days and repeats just short of six months, thus there are always two full eclipse seasons each year. Two to three eclipses always occur in each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon is low, hence the Sun, Moon and Earth become close enough in alignment (syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.
The type of solar eclipse that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon (which is a function of the elliptical distance in the Earth from the Sun and the Moon from the Earth, respectively, as seen from the Earth's surface).
If the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit around the Sun, and the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular around the Earth, and if both orbits were in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen each and every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon, and each solar eclipse would be the same type every time.
