The Institute of Atmospheric Physics AS CR, also designated as the IAP, is part of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (AS CR). Within the IAP research institutions are combined in order to cover the whole field of science and humanities.
The IAP was established in 1964, developed from a previously existing institute. This former institute's main focus was observation, and interpretation of data of tropospheric processes. In 1994 another former institute joined the IAP which then extended its research purview to the entire atmosphere, from the boundary layer up to interplanetary space. In 2007-2008 the IAP organized several international workshops and meetings.
The institute is staffed by 111 persons (2008) and forty percent of those hold the PhD degree or its equivalent. Throughout the years staff members have published research in a variety of international and national peer reviewed journals, as well as various books, chapters in books, and monographs. Also, the IAP participates in international research programs, and many international research projects. For example it participates in the Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System (CAWSES) program, and the GEO-6 (Galileo for Scientific User Community) research project.
