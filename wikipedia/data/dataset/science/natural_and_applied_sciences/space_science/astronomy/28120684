The Killarney Provincial Park Observatory is a small observatory located in Killarney Provincial Park at the George Lake Campground (near Killarney, Ontario, Canada). Opened on July 17, 2010, the site was chosen for its exceptionally dark skies (sky meter reading of 21.8 last recorded in 2012). The observatory and telescope were donated by the Waters family to celebrate 25 consecutive years of astronomy lectures by Bruce Waters to over 5,000 park visitors. It is the first public observatory running in any Ontario Provincial Park.
The Killarney Provincial Park Observatory utilizes a SkyShed GPOD XL3 with two doors and houses a 10" Meade 2080 LX3 telescope. The dome is made completely from Re-Cycled plastic (Re-HDPE) and the telescope sits on a steel pier. The telescope and observatory sit on a deck with two ramps (to ease the movement of people) donated by the Friends of Killarney Park. On January 29, 2011 the Gardner family, donated and installed a Losmandy G11 mount. This generous donation has greatly augmented the capability of the system; especially making it easier for first time observers to use the facility.
While the Observatory will be used for special large audience presentations (with upwards of 200 people) and by the Natural Heritage Education (NHE) park interpreters, the real beauty of the facility is that it has been optimized for self serve use. This allows anyone visiting the park free access to a high quality amateur observatory and, in this regard, the Killarney Provincial Park Observatory may be the first free, public, self use facility in North America.
