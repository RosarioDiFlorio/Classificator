The Gravitational Wave International Committee (or GWIC) is a panel of gravitational wave detection Laboratory or Observatory directors that promotes cooperation and collaboration between the gravitational wave detector projects and provides direction and advice on the future development of the field. Barry Barish founded the GWIC in 1997 and served as the chair from 1997-2003.
