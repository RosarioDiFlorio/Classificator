The Nininger Meteorite Award awarded by the Center for Meteorite Studies recognizes outstanding student achievement in the “Science of Meteoritics” as embodied by an original research paper.[1] In 1965, Dr. Harvey H. Nininger and Mrs. Addie D. Nininger endowed the Nininger Science of Meteoritics Fund to the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University in order to promote interest in meteorite-related topics among young scientists. A number of prominent planetary scientists and meteoriticists have won this award including William K. Hartmann, Hap McSween, and Dante Lauretta.
