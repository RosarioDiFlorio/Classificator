A fine guidance sensor (FGS) is an instrument on board a space telescope that provides high-precision pointing information as input to the observatory's attitude control systems. FGSs have been deployed on the Hubble Space Telescope, and will be deployed with a different technical approach on the James Webb Space Telescope. The system on Hubble uses an interferometric instrument
In some specialized cases, such as astrometry, FGSs can also be used as scientific instruments.
