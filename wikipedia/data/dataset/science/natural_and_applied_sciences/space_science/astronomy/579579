The Commission for Dark Skies (CfDS) (Formerly the Campaign for Dark Skies. The name was changed on March 29th 2015.) is the United Kingdom's largest anti-light-pollution campaign group forming part of the international dark-sky movement.
It is run by the British Astronomical Association (BAA) and affiliated with the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), and composed of a network of local officers (and other members) who try to improve lighting in their areas and advise local people.
The campaign was founded in 1989 by amateur astronomers as a sub-section of the BAA specialising in combatting skyglow. It is now open to non-members of the BAA, includes lighting engineers and environmentalists, and campaigns on the wider effects of light pollution.
