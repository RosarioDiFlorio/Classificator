The X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (XARM, pronounced "charm") is an X-ray astronomy satellite project of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and dark matter. As the only international X-ray observatory project of its period, XARM will function as a next generation space telescope in the X-ray astronomy field, similar to how the James Webb Space Telescope, Fermi Space Telescope, and the ALMA Observatory are placed in their respective fields. The mission will crosslink X-ray telescopes of the present (Chandra, XMM-Newton) with that of the future (ATHENA, Lynx/X-Ray Surveyor), thus preventing the formation of a blank period in X-ray astronomy in the early 2020s resulting from the loss of Hitomi. During its formulation, XARM was also known as the "ASTRO-H Successor", "ASTRO-H2".
