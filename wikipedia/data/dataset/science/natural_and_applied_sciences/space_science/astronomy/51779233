Cosmic wind, also called galactic wind, is a powerful cosmic force that can push interstellar dust clouds of low density into intergalactic space. Although it easily pushes low density gas and dust clouds, it can not easily push high density clouds. As the cosmic winds start to push the clouds, they start to separate and start looking like taffy being pulled apart. It has a primary composition of photons ejected from large stars and sometimes thermal energy from exploding stars. It can be caused by orbital motion of gas in the cluster of a galaxy, or can be ejected from a black hole. Because new stars and planets form from gases, the cosmic winds that push the gases away are preventing new stars from forming.
