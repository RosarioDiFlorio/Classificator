Foothill Observatory is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by Peninsula Astronomical Society and Foothill College. It is located on the college's campus in Los Altos Hills, California (US). The observatory is used by students enrolled in the introductory astronomy lab on campus, which is part of the college's thriving astronomy for non-scientists program, serving over 800 students per year. It is also used for public viewing one evening a week. A new 16-inch (410 mm) telescope was donated to the observatory and went into operation in 2007. The observatory is generally open to the public without charge every clear Friday night from 9 to about 11 pm.
