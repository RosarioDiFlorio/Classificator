This is a complete list of soil science licensing boards. State licensing in this context refers to any state regulatory program which limits the professional practice of soil science within state jurisdiction to individuals qualified by the state.
Registration and certification of professional soil scientists required by law is treated as licensure in the context of this list even when the term licensing is not utilized provided that the state uses that registration or certification to restrict professional practice of soil science.
