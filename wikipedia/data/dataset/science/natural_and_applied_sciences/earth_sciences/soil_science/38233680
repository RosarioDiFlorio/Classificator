A mire or quagmire, sometimes called a peatland, is a wetland type, dominated by living, peat-forming plants. For botanists and ecologists, the term peatland is a more general term for any terrain dominated by peat to a depth of at least 30 cm (12 in), even if it has been completely drained (i.e., a peatland can be dry, but a mire by definition must be wet).
There are three types of mire: bog, fen and swamp. A bog is a landform that due to its location relative to the surrounding landscape obtains most of its water from rainfall (ombrotrophic), while a fen is located on a slope, flat, or depression and gets its water from both rainfall and surface water (minerotrophic). Also, while a bog is always acidic and nutrient-poor, a fen may be slightly acidic, neutral, or alkaline, and either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich. Swamps are characterized by their forest canopy and, like fens, are typically of higher pH and nutrient availability than bogs. Some bogs can support limited shrub or tree growth on hummocks. Mires are distinguished from marshes by their active formation of peat: marshes typically have little or no peat.
Mires arise because of incomplete decomposition of organic matter, due to waterlogging and subsequent anoxia. Mires are a kind of "...living relic... [A] living skin on an ancient body" in which successive layers of regular plant growth and decay are preserved stratigraphically with a quality of preservation unknown in other wetland environments.
