The sand equivalent test quantifies the relative abundance of sand versus clay in soil. It is measured by standardized test methods such as ASTM D2419, AASHTO T176, and EN 933-8. The test is used to qualify aggregates for applications where sand is desirable but fines and dust are not. A higher sand equivalent value indicates that there is less clay‚Äêlike material in a sample.
During the test, material from the test specimen that can pass through a No. 4 sieve is mixed with solutions of calcium chloride, formaldehyde and glycerin in a cylinder. The content is then left for sedimentation. After about 20 minutes, the level of clay suspension and the sand level is read on the cylinder scale.
