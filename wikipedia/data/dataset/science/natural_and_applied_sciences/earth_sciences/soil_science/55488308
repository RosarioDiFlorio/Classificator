The soil carbon feedback concerns releases of carbon from soils, in response to global warming, known as a positive climate feedback. Soil carbon contains three times as much carbon as Earth's atmosphere, which makes them crucial to understand related carbon fluxes. Measurements imply that 4Â°C of warming increases annual soil respiration by up to 37%. Climate models do not account for effects of biochemical heat release associated with microbial decomposition.
