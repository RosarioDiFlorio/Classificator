Fertigation is the injection of fertilizers, soil amendments, and other water-soluble products into an irrigation system.
Fertigation is related to chemigation, the injection of chemicals into an irrigation system. The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably however chemigation is generally a more controlled and regulated process due to the nature of the chemicals used. Chemigation often involves pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, some of which pose health threat to humans, animals, and the environment.
