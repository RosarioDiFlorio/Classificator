Soil management concerns all operations, practices, and treatments used to protect soil and enhance its performance (such as soil fertility or soil mechanics). It includes soil conservation, soil amendment, and optimal soil health. In agriculture, some amount of soil management is needed both in nonorganic and organic types to prevent agricultural land from becoming poorly productive over decades. Organic farming in particular stresses optimal soil management, because it uses soil health as the exclusive or nearly exclusive source of its fertilization and pest control.
