A bevameter is a device used in terramechanics to measure the mechanical properties of soil.Bevameter technique was developed to measure terrain mechanical properties for the study of vehicle mobility  Bevameter test consists of penetration test to measure normal loads and shear test to determine shear loads exerted by vehicle.  Bevameter area size need to be the size of the wheel or track. DEM analysis can take data from one size and simulate bevameter performance for a different size.
