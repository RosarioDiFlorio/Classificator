In USDA soil taxonomy, entisols are defined as soils that do not show any profile development other than an A horizon. An entisol has no diagnostic horizons, and most are basically unaltered from their parent material, which can be unconsolidated sediment or rock. Entisols are the second most abundant soil order (after inceptisols), occupying about 16% of the global ice-free land area.
In Australia, most entisols are known as rudosols or tenosols, whilst arents are known as anthroposols. In the FAO soil classification, because of the diversity of their properties, suborders of entisols form individual soil orders (e.g. fluvisols, lithosols).
