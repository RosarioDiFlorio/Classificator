Nitrosylation is the covalent incorporation of a nitric oxide moiety into another (usually organic) molecule. This is often accomplished by exposure to nitrous acid or to an effective equivalent (a solution of sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid).
This type of modification is not found for DNA molecules. Nitrosylation helps in DNA repair mechanism and regulation of cellular processes.
