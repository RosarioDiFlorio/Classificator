Nitrogen-15 (15N) tracing is a technique to study the nitrogen cycle using the heavier, stable nitrogen isotope 15N. Despite the different weights, 15N is involved in the same chemical reactions as the more abundant 14N and is therefore used to trace and quantify conversions of one nitrogen compound to another. 15N tracing is applied in biogeochemistry, soil science, environmental science and environmental microbiology.
