Hypouricemia is a level of uric acid in blood serum that is below normal. In humans, the normal range of this blood component has a lower threshold set variously in the range of 2 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL, while the upper threshold is 530 micromol/L (6 mg/dL) for women and 619 micromol/L (7 mg/dL) for men. Hypouricemia usually is benign and sometimes is a sign of a medical condition.
