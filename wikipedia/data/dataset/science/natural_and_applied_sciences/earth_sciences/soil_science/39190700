Emil Truog was born on a farm near Independence, Wisconsin. He received his B.S. Degree (Agriculture), University of Wisconsin,1909 and his M.S. (Chemistry) in 1912. It was in 1912 when he became an instructor in Soil Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an Assistant Professor in 1916, Associate professor in 1917, Professor in 1921 and Emeritus professor in 1954. He was a chairman for the Department of Soil Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1939â€“1953. Much of his research during his early years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was focused on discovering the processes by which plants obtain nutrients from the soil. With the help from his colleagues and graduate students, he pioneered many practical soil tests. His research culminated into over 100 scientific papers, three books and around 50 popular articles. Along with his work with soil and plants, he teamed up with George J. Barker, a Professor of Mining and Metallurgy to develop a treatment of clay in brick manufacture that cut production costs and improved quality. Emil was a very well known and admired teacher of graduate, undergraduate and short course students. During his career he guided over 100 students to their doctorate degree and almost as many to their masters. Truog was known to be an inspiring worker, leader of strong character and a person of deep concern for family and friends. He served as 1954 President of the Soil Science Society of America.
