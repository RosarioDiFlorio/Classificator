The Storie index is a method of soil rating based on soil characteristics that govern the land's potential utilization and productivity capacity. It is independent of other physical or economic factors that might determine the desirability of growing certain plants in a given location.
The evaluation is easy to be realized, being this an advantage of this method.
A variety of categories are comprised in few categories.
Four or five parameters are evaluated:
A: Soil depth and texture;
B: Soil permeability;
C: Soil chemical characteristics;
D: Drainage, Surface runoff;
E: Climate (only if it is not homogeneous, if so than it should not be included in the formula);
The index is calculated from the multiplication of these parameters, that is: Sindex = A x B x C x D x E
The disadvantage of this method is that if we have a value of zero in any category, than the result will be zero and won't be suitable for using.
