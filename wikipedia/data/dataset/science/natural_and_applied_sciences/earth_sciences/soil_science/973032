The International Committee on Anthropogenic Soils (ICOMANTH) defines its mission as follows. "ICOMANTH is charged with defining appropriate classes in soil taxonomy for soils that have their major properties derived from human activities. The committee should establish which criteria significantly reflect human activities, or when a soil's properties are dominantly the result of human activities."
