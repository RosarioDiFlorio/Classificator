Fech fech (Arabic: فش فش‎) is a very fine powder caused by the erosion of clay-limestone terrain and it is most commonly found in deserts. It consists of a surface horizon of pulverized soil with low particle cohesion protected under a thin crust. It is not determinable from the surface and can therefore pose a significant transportation hazard acting as a surprise "trap" as the ground collapses beneath a vehicle miring it in a quicksand-like substance.
Fech-fech is classified into two types:
Fech-fech that developed during the Holocene, in lake mud or fluvio-lacustrine sediments.
Fech-fech that developed from shale.
Fech fech is common in the Qattara Depression, making that portion of the Sahara Desert impassable by most vehicles.
