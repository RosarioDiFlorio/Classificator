In Precision agriculture, Variable Rate Application refers to the application of a material, such that the rate of application is based on the precise location, or qualities of the area that the material is being applied to.
Variable Rate Application can be, Map Based or Sensor Based.
Map Based VRA is pre-planned, and applications are based on VRA Prescription Maps that an Agronomist or Advisor prepares based on data sources.
Sensor Based VRA is calculated realtime, based on sensors that are local to the Variable Rate Applicator.
