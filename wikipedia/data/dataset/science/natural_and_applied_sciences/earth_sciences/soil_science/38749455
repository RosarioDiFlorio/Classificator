A Catena in soil science (pedology) is a series of distinct but co-evolving soils arrayed a slope.[5] Each soil type or "facet" differs somewhat from its neighbours, but all occur in the same climate and on the same underlying parent material. A mature catena is in equilibrium as the processes of deposition and erosion are in balance.
