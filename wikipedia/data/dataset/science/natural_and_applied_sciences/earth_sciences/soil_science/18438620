Urosolvine, introduced in 1949, is widely available without prescription in the Middle East today for uric acid diathesis in gout. Urosolvine contains, in the form of effervescent salts, piperazine (0.128 grams) (increases the solubility of urates), colchicine (0.3 milligrams) (brings rapid relief in cases of acute gout attacks), atropine (0.128 milligrams) (relieves spasms of the urinary tract) and sodium citrate (an alkalinizing agent). The usual dosage is one packet three times per day with meals.
