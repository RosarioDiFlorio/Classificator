Milorganite is a brand of biosolids fertilizer produced by treating sewage sludge by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. The term is a contraction (or portmanteau) of the term Milwaukee Organic Nitrogen. The sewer system of the District collects municipal sewage from the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The collected sewage is treated at the Jones Island sewage treatment plant (also called "Water Reclamation Facility") in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a side product, sewage sludge is produced. This sewage sludge is heat-dried to remove pathogens. The resulting treated sewage sludge (also called biosolids) is then marketed under the name of milorganite. The treated wastewater is discharged to Lake Michigan.
The recycled pelletized fertilizer is branded as milorganite and sold throughout North America. It can reduce the amount of manufactured fertilizer applied as it contains nitrogen and phosphorus which plants need for growth. The fertilizer is marketed throughout the United States and Canada, and in parts of the Caribbean.
After more than 90 years, the milorganite production and use is a long-term and large-scale example of a municipality-run nonprofit environmental program.
