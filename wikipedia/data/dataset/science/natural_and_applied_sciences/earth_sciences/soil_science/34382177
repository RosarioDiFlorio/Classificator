Sterling Brown Hendricks (April 13, 1902 â€“ January 4, 1981) was an American agriculturist notable for his research on the structural aspects of organic and inorganic chemistry, soil chemistry and plant physiology and nutrition. Hendricks was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the National Medal of Science from President Gerald Ford. The citation given to him at the medal ceremony said: "For the initiation of basic research in the physical and chemical properties of soils and proteins that have profoundly influenced agricultural practices and the production of food plants." Hendricks also was Chief Chemist, Beltsville Plant Industry Station, chief scientist of the Mineral Nutrition Laboratory, and a recipient of the Award for Distinguished Civilian Service.
Hendricks was also an accomplished mountaineer. The Sterling's Crack climb at Carderock Recreation Area is named for him. He accompanied an expedition to Denali in 1942, and accomplished at least fifty first ascents in British Columbia and Alaska.
