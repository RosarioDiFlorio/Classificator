Kerogen is a solid organic matter in sedimentary rocks. It is insoluble in normal organic solvents and it does not have a specific chemical formula. By heating kerogen forms liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons such as oil and gas. Based on its origin, kerogen may be classified as algal, mixed terrestrial and marine.
