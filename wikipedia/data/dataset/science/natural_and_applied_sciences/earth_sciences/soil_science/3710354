Agrogeology is the study of the origins of minerals known as agrominerals and their applications. These minerals are of importance to farming and horticulture, especially with regard to soil fertility and fertilizer components. These minerals are usually essential plant nutrients .
Scientists who specialize in agrogeology are termed agrogeologists.
A course on agrogeology has been established at the University of Guelph by Professor Peter van Straaten of the Land Resource Science department.
