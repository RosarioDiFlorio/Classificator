Fertilizer burn is defined as leaf scorch resulting from over-fertilization, usually referring to excess nitrogen salts.
Fertilizer burn is the result of desiccation of plant tissues due to osmotic stress, creating a state of hypertonicity.
Fertilizers vary in their tendency to burn roughly in accordance with their salt index.
