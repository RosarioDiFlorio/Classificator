Tree box filters are typically filtration systems installed under a street or sidewalk which have trees planted in them. The systems collect stormwater runoff through methods such as permeable pavers or curb cuts. The runoff is then filtered by soil, microbes and vegetation before either being utilized by the tree or discharged into a storm drain system.
