Sand-based athletic fields are sports turf playing fields constructed on top of sand surfaces. It is important that turf managers select the most suitable type of sand when constructing these fields, as sands with different shapes offer varied pros and cons. Regular maintenance of sand-based athletic fields is just as important as the initial construction of the field. As water and other aqueous solutions (fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides) are added, a layer of thatch may accumulate on the surface of the turf. There are different ways to manage this level of thatch, however the most common are aeration and vertical mowing.
Sand-based athletic fields are utilized by many professional sporting facilities as they provide efficient drainage, thus allowing games and matches to be played during rainfall. Improved filtration is also imperative to the prevention of common fungal diseases that occur in sports turf. An excess of availability of nutrients can expedite the occurrence of these diseases, as well as increase the severity of the disease. Diseases such as;
Dollar Spot (Sclerotinia homeocarpa)
Summer Patch (Magnaporthe poae)
Red Thread (Laetisaria fuciformis)
are commonly associated with prolonged periods of precipitation, followed by warm temperatures. Improving the speed at which water can filter through the soil, minimizes the time that pathogens have to accumulate in the turf. A turf manager must be able to identify the speed of water filtration, as timely irrigation patterns are essential in water management.
