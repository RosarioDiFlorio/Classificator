Maxicrop is a company that sells seaweed-based liquid or powdered organic fertiliser, promoted as a "bio-stimulant".
Doug Edmeades, a New Zealand scientist and agricultural consultant, was sued by Maxicrop when he said that their product was useless.
The resulting case Bell-Booth Group Ltd v Attorney-General reviewed evidence provided by the Ministry of Agriculture established that Maxicrop did not materially improve the growth of plants and supported Dr. Edmeades' claims of inefficacy.
