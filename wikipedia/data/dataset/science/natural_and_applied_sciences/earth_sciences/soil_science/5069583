Inceptisols are a soil order in USDA soil taxonomy. They form quickly through alteration of parent material. They are more developed than entisols. They have no accumulation of clays, iron oxide, aluminium oxide or organic matter. They have an ochric or umbric horizon and a cambic subsurface horizon.
