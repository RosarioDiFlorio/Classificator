  |EntrezGe is a ligase enzyme located in the mitochondria involved in the production of urea.  Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1 or CPSI) transfers an ammonia molecule from glutamine or glutamate to a molecule of bicarbonate that has been phosphorylated by a molecule of ATP.  The resulting carbamate is then phosphorylated with another molecule of ATP.  The resulting molecule of carbamoyl phosphate leaves the enzyme.
