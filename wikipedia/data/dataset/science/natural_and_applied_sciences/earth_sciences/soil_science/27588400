Occupation earth is the set of deposits believed to represent in-situ settlement at an archeological site. Typically, it may contain domestic refuse, pot sherds, tools, animal remains, and ash/charcoal from hearths and ovens.
This may become layered, where more than one period of inhabitation is represented.
Earthworms are believed to play an important role in the creation of occupation earth. The worms penetrate floors of buildings and leave a layer of castings on the surface, this layer is then colonised by more worms whose action buries coins and other archaeological artefacts.
