Soil acidification is the buildup of hydrogen cations, also called protons, reducing the soil pH. Chemically, this happens when a proton donor gets added to the soil. The donor can be an acid, such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid (these acids are common components of acid rain). It can also be a compound such as aluminium sulfate, which reacts in the soil to release protons. Many nitrogen compounds, which are added as fertilizer, also acidify soil over the long term because they produce nitrous and nitric acid when oxidized in the process of nitrification.
Acidification also occurs when base cations such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium are leached from the soil. This leaching increases with increasing precipitation. Acid rain accelerates the leaching of these alkali (or base) elements. Plants utilize all these alkali elements as they grow, each important to some aspect of cell tissue development and growth. Where plant material is removed, as when a forest is logged or crops are harvested, the base elements they have taken up are permanently lost from the soil.
