It is proposed by Minasny and McBratney (2003) as alternative to available water capacity. (AWC) The AWC concept assumes equal availability of water between two potentials and does not consider the path along the water retention curve. Integral energy takes into the account the path or energy (characterised by water retention curve) required to dry a soil at particular soil moisture content
