Liquid manure is manure in a liquid form. Manure is changed into a liquid form by mixing the manure with water. Generally, liquid manure is used as a convenient alternative to manure, which cannot be spread as evenly as its liquid form. Manure in both states is used as a nutrient-enriched fertilizer for plants.
