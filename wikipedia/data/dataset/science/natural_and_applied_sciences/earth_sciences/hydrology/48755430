Tobernalt is a holy well in north County Sligo, Ireland near the southwest corner of Lough Gill. It is an ancient natural spring dating back to the 5th century as a pagan meeting place and later a Penal Law mass site.
As of 2016 it is maintained by St John's Parish, Carraroe, Sligo. Masses are conducted at the site. The devoted from surrounding counties and elsewhere make pilgrimages to the site on Garland Sunday when a day-long schedule of devotions is held.
It is associated with St. Patrick whose fingerprints are said to be in the stones of one of the altars.
