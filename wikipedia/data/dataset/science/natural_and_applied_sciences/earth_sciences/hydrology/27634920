Ein Gedi Spa is a wellness center along the Dead Sea, Israel, fed by the waters of the Dead Sea. It provides health by the four elements of the area: water, air, sun, and mud. The spa has hot pools that are filled with sulphur water. It is a famous attraction on the shore of the Dead Sea.
The spa is known for its unpleasant odor resulting from the sulphur springs. However, it still draws large crowds who believe in its health benefits.
The spa is run by the Ein Gedi Kibbutz.
Initially built directly along the shoreline of the Dead Sea, due to the sea's shrinkage, the spa is now found at quite a distance from the lake.
The annual Ein Gedi Race starts off at the spa's location.
