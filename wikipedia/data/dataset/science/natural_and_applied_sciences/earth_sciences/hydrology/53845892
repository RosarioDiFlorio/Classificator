The Fosse Dionne, is a karst spring, is located in downtown Tonnerre (Yonne Department). It is driven by the infiltration of precipitation on the plateau as well as drainage from at least one river. The Fosse Dionne is remarkable because of its outflow (reportedly at least 100 litres per second on average).
Its presence is at the center of the creation story of Tonnerre. An elaborate wash basin was built around the spring in the 18th century.
