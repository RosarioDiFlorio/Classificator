The head (German: Stauwurzel) is the point on a watercourse, up to which it has been artificially changed by an impoundment. Above the head of the reservoir, for example, natural conditions prevail; below it the water level above the riverbed has been raised by the impoundment and its flow rate reduced.
In principle, a distinction must be drawn between the head of a reservoir impounded by a dam, and the head of a works resulting from a barrage or canal locks.
