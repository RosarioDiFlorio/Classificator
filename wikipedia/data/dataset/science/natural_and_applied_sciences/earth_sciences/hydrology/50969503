In plumbing, a standpipe is a vertical vented pipe attached to a trap that permits rapid wastewater discharge without disrupting the water seal of nearby traps.
The most common use of standpipes in houses is for clothes washing machines, which rapidly dispense a large volume of wastewater while draining the wash and rinse cycles.
