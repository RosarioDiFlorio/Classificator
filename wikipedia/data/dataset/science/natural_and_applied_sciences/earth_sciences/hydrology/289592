Surface-water hydrology is a field that encompasses all surface waters of the globe (overland flows, rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, oceans, etc.). This is a subset of the hydrologic cycle that does not include atmospheric, and ground waters. Surface-water hydrology relates the dynamics of flow in surface-water systems (rivers, canals, streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, marshes, arroyos, oceans, etc.). This includes the field measurement of flow (discharge); the statistical variability at each setting; floods; drought susceptibility and the development of the levels of risk; and the fluid mechanics of surface waters.
In-depth analysis of surface-water components of the hydrologic cycle: hydrometeorology, evaporation/transpiration, rainfall-runoff relationships, open-channel flow, flood hydrology, fluid mechanics, and statistical and probabilistic methods in hydrology. Surface-water hydrology includes the relation between rainfall and surface runoff; this relationship is an important aspect of water resources for sewerage (wastewater or sewage), drinking water, agriculture (irrigation) environmental protection, and for flood control.
The relationships between groundwater and surface water includes baseflow needs for instream flow, and subsurface water levels in wells.
A stormwater engineer is a civil engineer who manages the flow, filtering, and release of stormwater.
