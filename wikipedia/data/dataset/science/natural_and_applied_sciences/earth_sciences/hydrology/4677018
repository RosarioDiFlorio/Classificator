The Daiō Wasabi Farm (大王わさび農場, Daiō Wasabi Nōjō) is a wasabi farm established in 1915 and located in Azumino, Nagano Prefecture near the center of Honshū, the main island of Japan. It is a popular tourist spot due to its beautiful watermills and for the river that runs through it.
A restaurant offers wasabi-flavoured ice cream and other wasabi-themed products.
Outside Japan, the site is best known for its appearance in the 1990 film Dreams by world-famous director Akira Kurosawa in the segment called "Village of the Watermills".
Daiō is one of Japan's largest farms—and its largest wasabi farm—covering 15 hectares.
