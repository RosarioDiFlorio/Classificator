George H. Dury (1919â€“1996) was a hydrologist who devised a model showing the relationship between river discharge and other stream variables. His model is an extension of the Bradshaw model which shows how river characteristics will change from the upper course to the lower course of a river. Dury used a line graph and a logarithmic scale, plotting the discharge along the x-axis and the other stream variables along the y-axis. Other 'stream variables' included depth, width, velocity, slope (gradient) and friction (Manning formula). His most widely read book was The Face of the Earth (1959), published by Penguin Books.
