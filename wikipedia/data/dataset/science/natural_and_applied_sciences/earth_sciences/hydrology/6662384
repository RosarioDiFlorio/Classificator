Septage or septic tank sludge is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a septic tank. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater (sewage) in a septic tank where it accumulates over time.
Septage is pumped out of a septic tank or onsite sewage facility with a vacuum truck. Septic tanks can be for residential or non-residential use. Non-residential sources can include wastewater from commercial/industrial development, grease interceptor as well as other sources such as portable toilet, RV, and boat waste.
The term "fecal sludge management" includes the management of septage as well as the management of fecal sludge from pit latrines.
Historically, the term "night soil" was used for fecal sludge.
