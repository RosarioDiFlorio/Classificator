Tauragat Well is a disused well in the Australian state of South Australia located approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north east of Coonalpyn along the Coonalpyn-Lameroo Road.
The well was built in 1876 to water stock on route either to the greater South East or up north east to the Mallee. A plaque was unveiled in 1976, on its Centenary by the Chairman of the District Council of Peake (now the Coorong District Council).
A few kilometres east of Tauragat Well along the Coonalpyn-Lameroo Road is Tauragat Hill. It has a trig point on top of it.
