MOHID is short for Modelo Hidrodin√¢mico which is hydrodynamic model in Portuguese. The MOHID water-modelling system is a modular (see Modular programming) finite volumes (Finite-volume method) water-modelling system written in ANSI-Fortran95 using an Object-oriented programming philosophy, integrating diverse mathematical models and supporting graphical user interfaces that manage all the pre- and post-processing. It is an integrated modelling tool able to simulate physical and biogeochemical processes in the water column as well as in the sediments, and is also able to simulate the coupling between these two domains and the latter with the atmosphere.
The development of MOHID started back in 1985. Since that time a continuous development effort of new features has been maintained. Model updates and improvements were made available in a regular basis were used in the framework of many research and engineering projects.
