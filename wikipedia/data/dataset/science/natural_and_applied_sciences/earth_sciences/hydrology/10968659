Serra Springs are a pair of springs located on the campus of University High School in Los Angeles, California, USA. They are designated by California Historical Landmark #522. The springs, called Kuruvungna by the native Gabrieleno Tongva people, were used as a source of natural fresh water by the Tongva people since at least the 5th century BC and continue to produce 22,000-25,000 gallons of water a day. The springs are also sometimes referred to as the Gabrieleno Tongva Springs, the Tongva Holy Springs, and the Sacred Springs. The springs are found at two separate locations on the high school campus. The larger is now closed off from the rest of the campus and is under the care of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation. The other spring is located on the northeastern edge of the so-called Girls' Field. A third spring was located farther north, near Texas Avenue, but it ceased to flow during the 1940s when a local water company began drawing from the aquifer.
The springs have a UCLA Archaeological designation of CA-LAN-382.
