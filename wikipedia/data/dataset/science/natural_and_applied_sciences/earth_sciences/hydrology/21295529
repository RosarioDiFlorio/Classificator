Grey's Spring, sometimes called Grey's Well, is a historical site in Kalbarri, Western Australia. It is a stone-lined well dating from after 1848, named after Lieutenant (later Sir) George Grey whose boats were wrecked in the surf of Gantheaume Bay on 1 April 1839, during his second disastrous exploration expedition along the Western Australian coast. It has a grid cover installed for safety reasons, and a commemorative plaque. It is located at Kalbarri Lions Park, located off Walker Street.
