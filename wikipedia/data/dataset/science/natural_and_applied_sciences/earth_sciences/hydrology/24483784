A current, in a river or stream, is the flow of water influenced by gravity as the water moves downhill to reduce its potential energy. The current varies spatially as well as temporally within the stream, dependent upon the flow volume of water, stream gradient, and channel geometrics. In tidal zones, the current in rivers and streams may reverse on the flood tide before resuming on the ebb tide.
