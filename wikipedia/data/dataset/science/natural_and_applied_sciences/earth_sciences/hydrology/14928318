The Coachella Canal is a 122-mile (196 km) aqueduct that conveys Colorado River water for irrigation northwest from the All-American Canal to the Coachella Valley north of the Salton Sea in Riverside County, California.
The canal was completed in 1949 and is currently operated by the Coachella Valley Water District.
Construction of the Coachella Canal began in the 1930s by the Six Companies, Inc., but was interrupted by World War II. After the war, work was resumed on the canal and deliveries of water began in the late 1940s.
