The Daryan Dam, also spelled Darian, is an embankment dam currently under construction on the Sirvan River just north of Daryan in Paveh County, Kermanshah Province, Iran. The primary purpose of the dam is to supply up to 1,378,000,000 m3 (1,117,000 acreÂ·ft) of water annually to the 48 km (30 mi) long Nosoud Water Conveyance Tunnel where it will irrigate areas of Southwestern Iran. The dam will also have a 210 MW hydroelectric power station. Construction on the dam began in 2009 and the dam began to fill its reservoir in late November 2015. The power station is expected to be operational at the end of 2016. All works are expected to be complete by 2018. The dam's diversion tunnel was completed in June 2011. The dam was designed by Stucky of France and consultation was provided by Mahab Ghodss, International Consulting Engineering Co. In August 2010 Farab Co. won the contract to build the power station. In 2011, workers on the project held a protest against unpaid wages. The dam is also the subject of protest due to the forced relocations and ecological/cultural impact its reservoir will have.
