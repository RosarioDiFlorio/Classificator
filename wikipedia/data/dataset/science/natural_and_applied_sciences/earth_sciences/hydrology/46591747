The finite water-content vadose zone flux method represents a one-dimensional alternative to the numerical solution of Richards' equation  for simulating the movement of water in unsaturated soils. The finite water-content method is an ordinary differential equation alternative to the Richards partial differential equation. The Richards equation is difficult to approximate in general because it does not have a closed-form analytical solution except in a few cases. The finite water-content method, is perhaps the first generic replacement for the numerical solution of the Richards' equation. The finite water-content solution has several advantages over the Richards equation solution. First, as an ordinary differential equation it is explicit, guaranteed to converge  and computationally inexpensive to solve. Second, using a finite volume solution methodology it is guaranteed to conserve mass. The finite water content method readily simulates sharp wetting fronts, something that the Richards solution struggles with. The main limiting assumption required to use the finite water-content method is that the soil be homogeneous in layers.

The finite water-content vadose zone flux method is derived from the same starting point as the derivation of Richards' equation. However, the derivation employs a hodograph transformation to produce an advection solution that does not include soil water diffusivity, wherein

This equation was converted into a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  using the Method of Lines to convert the partial derivatives on the right-hand side of the equation into appropriate finite difference forms. These three ODEs represent the dynamics of infiltrating water, falling slugs, and capillary groundwater, respectively.
