A paddle wheel is a form of waterwheel or impeller in which a number of paddles are set around the periphery of the wheel. It has several uses, some of which are:
Very low-lift water pumping, such as flooding paddy fields at no more than about 0.5 m (20 in) height above the water source.
To move and mix algae culture in the raceway ponds used for algaculture.
Propulsion of boats (as a paddlewheel)
Low head hydro power (as a waterwheel)
Flow sensors
Aerators
The paddle wheel is an ancient invention but is still used today in a wide range of industrial and agriculture applications.
