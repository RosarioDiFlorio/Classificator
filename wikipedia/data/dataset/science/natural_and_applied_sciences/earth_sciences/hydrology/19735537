The Five Dragon Pool (Chinese: 五龙潭; pinyin: Wǔ Lóng Tán) is a culturally significant pond fed by artesian karst springs in the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. It is one of the best known springs among the 72 famous springs of Jinan.
The spring that supplies the water for the Five Dragon Pool belongs to a group of springs that also contains 28 other springs, such as the Tianjing Spring, Seventy-three Spring, Ximizhi Spring, Dongmizhi Spring, Yueya Spring, Jing Spring, and the Congming Spring. The water of the Five Dragon Spring originates from the deepest circulation of all the springs in Jinan City.
Legend links the Five Dragon Pool to the Tang Dynasty general Qin Shubao, whose residence is said to have stood at the site. According to the legend, the spring pool formed after torrential rains that submersed Qin Shubao's home.
In 1985, the Five Dragon Pool Public Park (Chinese: 五龙潭公园; pinyin: Wǔ Lóng Tán Gōng Yuán) was established and the garden landscape surrounding the springs was restored
