Jacob's Well (Arabic: بئر يعقوب‎, Bir Ya'qub, Hebrew: באר יעקב‎; also known as Jacob's fountain and Well of Sychar) is a deep well hewn of solid rock that has been associated in religious tradition with Jacob for roughly two millennia. It is situated a short distance from the archaeological site of Tell Balata, which is thought to be the site of biblical Shechem.
The well currently lies within the complex of an Eastern Orthodox monastery of the same name, in the city of Nablus in the West Bank.
