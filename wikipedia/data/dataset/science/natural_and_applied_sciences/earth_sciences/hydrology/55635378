The Woodingdean Water Well is the deepest hand-dug well in the world, at 390 meters (1285 feet) deep. It was dug to provide water for a workhouse. Work on the well started in 1858, and four years later, it was finished, on March 16, 1862. It is located just outside of Nuffield Hospital, in Woodingdean.
