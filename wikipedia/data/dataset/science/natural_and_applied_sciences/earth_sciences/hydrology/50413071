An underwater thruster is a configuration of marine propellers and hydraulic or electric motor built into, or mounted to an Underwater Robot as a propulsion device. These give the robot movement and maneuverability against sea water resistance. The main difference between underwater thrusters and marine thrusters is the ability to work under heavy water pressure, sometime up to full ocean depth.
