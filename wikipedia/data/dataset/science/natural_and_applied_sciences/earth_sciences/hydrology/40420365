The British Hydrological Society (BHS) was formed in 1983 to advance interest and scholarship in scientific and applied aspects of hydrology and encourage member involvement in relevant national and international professional activities, drawing its membership from academic (universities and research institutes) and operational sectors. It is a learned 'Associated Society' of the Institution of Civil Engineers, based in London, and a registered charity.
