Goldbug Hot Springs is a hot spring located in the Salmon-Challis National Forest about 20 miles south of Salmon, Idaho. The spring is along Warm Spring Creek and there are about six waterfall-fed pools. Goldbug is listed as having a temperature of 113 °F (45 °C), but the temperature of the pools will vary depending on the time of year. The pools have a sand/gravel bottom and are dammed by boulders. Due to the hike and remoteness of the trailhead, it is not usually crowded.
Water from Goldbug Hot Springs flows into Warm Springs Creek, which flows into the Salmon River.
