Composite propellers are made of an extremely strong, high-tech material. These propellers are produced using an injection molding process, which guarantees a high quality propeller every time. The composite propeller is a lightweight and environmentally friendly boat propeller. When a composite propeller hits debris, the propeller absorbs the impact energy, instead of transferring it to the lower unit; therefore, providing more protection for the drive train. Corrosion from salt water, and electrolysis are nonexistent with composite material.
