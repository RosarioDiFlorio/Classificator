The Central Utah Project is a United States federal water project. It was authorized for construction under the Colorado River Storage Project Act of April 11, 1956 (CRSPA) (Public Law 485, [70 Stat. 105]) as a participating project. In general, the Central Utah Project develops (makes use of) a portion of Utah's share of the yield of the Colorado River as set out in the Colorado River Compact of 1922.
As originally planned and authorized, the Central Utah Project consisted of six units or sub-projects: the Bonneville Unit, the Jensen Unit, the Vernal Unit, the Uinta Unit, the Upalco Unit, and Ute Indian Unit. The largest and most complex is the Bonneville Unit which diverts water from the Uinta Basin, a part of the Colorado River Basin, to the Lake Bonneville Basin. The other units were designed to provide for development of local water supplies in the Uinta Basin.
The Central Utah Project develops water for irrigation, municipal and industrial use, stream flows, and power generation. The project also provides recreation, fish and wildlife, flood control, water conservation, and water quality benefits.
