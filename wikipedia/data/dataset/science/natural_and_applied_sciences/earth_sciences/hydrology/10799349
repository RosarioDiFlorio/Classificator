Geographic information systems (GISs) have become a useful and important tool in hydrology and to hydrologists in the scientific study and management of water resources. Climate change and greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of arguably one of our most vital resources. As every hydrologist knows, water is constantly in motion. Because water in its occurrence varies spatially and temporally throughout the hydrologic cycle, its study using GIS is especially practical. GIS systems previously were mostly static in their geospatial representation of hydrologic features. Today, GIS platforms have become increasingly dynamic, narrowing the gap between historical data and current hydrologic reality.
The elementary water cycle has inputs equal to outputs plus or minus change in storage. Hydrologists make use of a hydrologic budget when they study a watershed. A watershed is a spatial area, and the occurrence of water throughout its space varies by time. In the hydrologic budget are inputs such as precipitation, surface flows in, and groundwater flows in. Outputs are evapotranspiration, infiltration, surface runoff, and surface/groundwater flows out. All of these quantities, including storage, can be measured or estimated, and their characteristics can be graphically displayed in GIS and studied.
As a subset of hydrology, hydrogeology is concerned with the occurrence, distribution, and movement of groundwater. Moreover, hydrogeology is concerned with the manner in which groundwater is stored and its availability for use. The characteristics of groundwater can readily be input into GIS for further study and management of water resources. Because 98% of the worldâ€™s available freshwater is groundwater, the need to keep a closer eye on its disposition is readily apparent.
