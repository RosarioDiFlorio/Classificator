In hydrology and related sciences and technologies, a cline is a comparatively thin, typically horizontal layer within a fluid, in which a property of the fluid varies greatly over a relatively short vertical distance.
Such clines and the respectively varying properties include:
Chemocline - chemistry
Halocline - salinity
Pycnocline - density
Thermocline - temperature
