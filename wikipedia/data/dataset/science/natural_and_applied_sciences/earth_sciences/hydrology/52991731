The Nadisee is a lake with an integrated well system in the Olympic Village, in the Munich district Am Riesenfeld in the city district 11 Milbertshofen-Am Hart.
With an area of about 0.16 ha, it is Munich's smallest bathing lake. The approximate extent in the north-south direction is 50 m, and in the east-west direction 80 m. It was built together with the Athletes village for the Olympic Games in 1972 and is located between Nadistraße and Connollystraße. The Nadisee, named after the road, which also referees to the Italian Athlete Nedo Nadi, is only knee deep and the water level does not go over an adults head at any point. Making it suitable for children and families in summer and for ice skating in winter. Occasionally festivals take place at the lake. When the water is drained for cleaning, the empty concrete tub is used by mountain bikers and, of course, by skateboarders.
