The hadal zone (named after the realm of Hades, the underworld in Greek mythology), also known as the hadopelagic zone, is the deepest region of the ocean lying within oceanic trenches. The hadal zone is found from a depth of around 6,000 to 11,000 metres (20,000 to 36,000 ft) to the bottom of the ocean, and exists in long but narrow topographic V-shaped depressions.
"In total there are 33 trenches (27 subduction trenches and 6 trench faults) and 13 troughs around the worldâ€”46 individual hadal habitats in total."  All the trenches together occupy an area less than one-quarter of one percent of the entire seafloor, with 84% of the hadal habitat found in the Pacific Ocean.
