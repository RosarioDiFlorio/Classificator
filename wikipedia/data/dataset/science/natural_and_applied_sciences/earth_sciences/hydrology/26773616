SWAT-CUP (SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedures) is a program designed to integrate various calibration/uncertainty analysis programs for SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool) using the same interface. Currently the program can run SUFI2 (Abbaspour et al., 2007), GLUE (Beven and Binley, 1992), and ParaSol (van Griensven and Meixner, 2006). To create a project, the program guides the user through the input files necessary for running a calibration program. Each SWAT-CUP project contains one calibration method and allows user to run the procedure many times until convergence is reached. User can save calibration iterations in the iteration history for later use. Also we have made it possible to create charts of observed and simulated data and the predicted uncertainty about them.
