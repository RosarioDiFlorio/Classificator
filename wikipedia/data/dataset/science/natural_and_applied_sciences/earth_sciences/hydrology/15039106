A Buchan Trap (alternative names: Bristol interceptor, interceptor trap and disconnecting trap) is a device made from fireclay located in a domestic sewer pipe to prevent vermin entering the pipe. The trap uses a water seal to prevent rats and mice climbing any further along the pipe. Waste flows from the house through a U-bend in the trap. This means that there is always water in the pipe preventing the passage of anything from the other direction. The device is a large clay U-bend with air-inlets and vents at the top. It is located below the ground level, but can be accessed through the air-inlet and a rodding hole. This hole allows drain rods to unblock anything located at the bottom of the U-bend.
