Narran River, a watercourse of the Barwon catchment within the Murrayâ€“Darling basin, is located in the Southern Downs district of Queensland and Orana district of New South Wales, Australia.
The river rises south west of Dirranbandi, as a branch of the Balonne River in Queensland, and flows generally to the south and south-west, before reaching its mouth at Narran Lake, between Brewarrina and Walgett in New South Wales; descending 61 metres (200 ft) over its 299 kilometres (186 mi) course.
In March 2010 the Narran River flooded the Angledool Lake at Angledool and then spilled into Weetalabah Creek, crossing the Castlereagh Highway, filling Coocoran Lake near Lightning Ridge.
