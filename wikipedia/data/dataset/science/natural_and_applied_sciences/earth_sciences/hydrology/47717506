It was initially named Romanian Centre for Marine Geology and Geo-ecology. Its administrative and scientific headquarters is in the capital of Romania, Bucharest; but the operational center, with the research vessels and marine infrastructure, is in Constanța, an important harbor on the Black Sea. The first director of the institute was the academician Nicolae Panin, now (2015) retired and a personal adviser to the current director, Gheorghe Oaie.
