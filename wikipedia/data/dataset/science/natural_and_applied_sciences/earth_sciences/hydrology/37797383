A vector measuring current meter (VMCM) is an instrument used for obtaining measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean, which exploits two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity. VMCM was developed in the late 1970s by Drs. Robert Weller and Russ Davis and commercially produced by EG&G Sealink System (currently EdgeTech). The instrument has the capability of one year long deployment at depths of up to 5000 m. Both laboratory and field test results show that the VMCM is capable of making accurate measurements of horizontal velocity in the upper ocean. The VMCM is the current standard for making high quality velocity measurements in near-surface regions  and it has been used for benchmarking other current meters.
