The Catawissa Tunnel is a mine drainage tunnel in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Its properties include the discharge, the pH, the chemical hydrology, and the water temperature. A total of 30 different metals and metalloids have been observed in the tunnel's waters. The hydrological data comes from a gauge on the tunnel at a location of 40°54'39" north and 76°03'59" west and an elevation of 1,440 feet (440 m) above sea level. Some of the most abundant metals in the waters of the tunnel include iron, aluminum, and manganese. These metals have concentrations on the order of several milligrams per liter. A number of other metals have concentrations on the order of micrograms per liter and some metals are found in even lower concentrations. Nonmetals such as nitrates, sulfates, fluorides, chlorides, and silica are also present in the tunnel. The concentrations of such nonmetals range between several micrograms per liter and several milligrams per liter.
The discharge of the Catawissa Tunnel is similar to the discharges of other mine drainage tunnels in the watershed of Catawissa Creek, being on the order of several thousand gallons per minute. However, it can become significantly higher during times of heavy rainfall. Additionally, the tunnel is highly acidic, with a pH averaging slightly more than 4.
