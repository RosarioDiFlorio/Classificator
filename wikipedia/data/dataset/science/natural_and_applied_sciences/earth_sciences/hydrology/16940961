The Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) is a platform for partners from the global water industry.
SIWWâ€™s flagship programmes include The Water Leaders Summit, Water Convention, Water Expo, Business Forums, Hydro-Gen and Industrial Water Solutions. It culminates with the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, an award to recognize contributions towards solving global water problems.
The inaugural SIWW was launched in 2008. Since 2012, SIWW has been held biennially in conjunction with the World Cities Summit and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore. In 2013, the attention was focused on the water utility sector with the SIWW Water Utilities Leaders Forum (SWULF).
