The 20 Pipe Well (German: 20-RÃ¶hren-Brunnen) is a water well in the Rhineland-Palatinate village of Altleiningen in the northeast of the Palatinate Forest. The well was probably driven around 1600 and was used originally to supply drinking water to Altleiningen Castle on the hill above. Its present design dates to 1855.
