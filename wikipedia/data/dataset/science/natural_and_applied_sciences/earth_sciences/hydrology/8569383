Groundwater discharge is the volumetric flow rate of groundwater through an aquifer.
Total groundwater discharge, as reported through a specified area, is similarly expressed as:

  
    
      
        Q
        =
        
          
            
              d
              h
            
            
              d
              l
            
          
        
        K
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q={\frac {dh}{dl}}KA}
  
where
Q is the total groundwater discharge ([L3·T−1]; m3/s),
K is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ([L·T−1]; m/s),
dh/dl is the hydraulic gradient ([L·L−1]; unitless), and
A is the area which the groundwater is flowing through ([L2]; m2)
For example, this can be used to determine the flow rate of water flowing along a plane with known geometry.
