The Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) is a water mass found between the top cold, relatively fresh polar water and the bottom deep water in the Arctic domain (bounded by the polar and arctic fronts). AIW is formed in small quantities compared to other water masses, and has limited influence outside of the Arctic domain.
