Rayleigh fractionation describes the evolution of a system with multiple phases in which one phase is continuously removed from the system through fractional distillation. It is used in particular to describe isotopic enrichment or depletion as material moves between reservoirs in an equilibrium process. Rayleigh fractionation holds particular importance in hydrology and meteorology as a model for the isotopic differentiation of meteoric water due to condensation.
