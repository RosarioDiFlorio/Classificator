Mogden Sewage Treatment Works is a sewage treatment plant in the Ivybridge section of Isleworth, West London, formerly known as Mogden. Built in 1931–36 by Middlesex County Council and now operated by Thames Water, it is one of the largest sewage works in the United Kingdom. It treats the waste water from about 1.9 million people served by three sewers in North and West London. The plant has been extended and upgraded several times, most recently in 2011–13, and now covers 55 hectares (140 acres).
