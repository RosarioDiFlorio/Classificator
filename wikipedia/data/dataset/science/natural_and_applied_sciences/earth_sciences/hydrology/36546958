The Misicuni Multiplepurpose Project, better known as the Misicuni Dam, is a concrete-face rock-fill dam partly constructed on the Misicuni River about 35 km (22 mi) northwest of the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia. The dam will divert water from the Misicuni River to the Cochabamba Valley for several purposes to include providing water for irrigation and municipal water uses. In addition, the dam will have an associated 80 MW hydroelectric power station when complete. Construction on the dam began in June 2009 but was halted in November 2013 due to contract disputes. The company finished the construction and is starting the operations by September 2017 .
