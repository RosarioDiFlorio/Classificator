The Eberstadt Stalactite Cave (or Eberstadter Tropfsteinhöhle) is a German show cave located in Bauland at the transition of Southeastern Odenwald forest in the North of Baden-Württemberg. It is near Eberstadt, a District of Buchen, around 70 kilometres (43 mi) east of Heidelberg and 100 km (62 mi) north of Stuttgart. The cave is around 600 metres (1,969 ft) long, lies 341 m (1,119 ft) above [sea level]] and is estimated to be 3 to 5 million years old. It was discovered in December 1971, after blasting operations in a Muschelkalk quarry, and opened in 1973 to the public. Since then it has been used as a show cave and is one of the attractions of the "Geo-Nature park Bergstrasse-Odenwald".
The cave entrance is angled several times and in some instances only 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high, but sports up to 6-metre-high (20 ft) halls. It lies in the lower Muschelkalk and contains rich stalactite ornaments like slender and cone-like Stalagmites and Sinterflags, sinterterraces und crystals. Because the cave was closed after its discovery and guided tours have always used electric light, the dripstones have been preserved mostly still chalk white, in difference to most of the older Germabn showcaves, where the use of der Gcandles and torches have blackened the stones. The Eberstadter Tropfsteinhöhle is thought to be one of the most beautiful show caves of Germany.
