Halliwell is predominantly a residential area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England. It gives its name to an electoral ward of the wider Metropolitan Borough of Bolton. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 13,929. Halliwell lies about 2 miles (3.2 km) to the north west of Bolton town centre and is bounded by Tonge Moor to the east and Heaton to the south west. Smithills Hall to the north is within the ancient township. It lies on the lower south facing slopes of the West Pennine Moors.

Historically a part of Lancashire, Halliwell once formed an autonomous township in the ancient parish of Deane. Traces of this ancient history still remain. Boundary Street marks the old boundary between Halliwell and the parish of Bolton le Moors, and a modern wall along Gladstone Street also marks this former boundary. The old building on Halliwell Road, much modernised, at the end of the wall, is the former toll house.
Halliwell derives its name from the holy well, an ancient spring which used to exist at the northern end of the township off Smithills Croft Road. In Old English it was recorded as halig wella (i.e. holy well). Over the centuries the name has been spelt as Haliwalle (1220), Haliwell (1243), Harywal (1273), and Halewell (1277â€“8). In Deane Parish Church registers it was spelt Halliwoe and Hollowell.
The parish church of St Peter's was consecrated in 1840.
Halliwell had a football team, Halliwell Rovers, who were one of the strongest teams in the area. They played at a ground known as Bennett's or Holy Harbour which is now buried under terraced housing between Elgin Street and Hughes Street, Bennett's Lane and Cloister Street.
