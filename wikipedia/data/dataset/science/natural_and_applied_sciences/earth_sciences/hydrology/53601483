Soborom Hot Springs is a geothermal field located close to the northwestern rim of Tarso Voôn volcano in Chad. It is situated on the eastern flank of Emi Koussi at an altitude of 850 meters (20°55'0"N, 17°10'60"E).
The field consists of a dozen hot springs, where water emerges at temperatures ranging between 22 and 88 °C (72 and 190 °F). The field also contains mud pools and fumaroles that vent noxious gases including sulfur.
The springs are considered to have healing powers - the word Soborom purportedly means "water which heals" in one of the local languages. It is common for the Toubou people as well as others from this part of Sahara to visit this natural resort for a few days to heal diseases such as dermatitis and rheumatism. They bathe in one of the less hot pools which has a temperature of about 42°C. Visitors have made some simple utilities in the pools such as headrests made of flat stones.
