An antecedent stream is a stream that maintains its original course and pattern despite the changes in underlying rock topography. A stream with a dendritic drainage pattern, for example, can be subject to slow tectonic uplift. However, as the uplift occurs, the stream erodes through the rising ridge to form a steep-walled gorge. The stream thus keeps its dendritic pattern even though it flows over a landscape that will normally produce a trellis drainage pattern.
A superposed stream is a stream that forms over horizontal beds that overlie folded and faulted rock with varying resistance. The stream erodes through the underlying horizontal beds, and retains its course and pattern despite changes in the underlying rock. The stream erodes a gorge in the resistant bed and continues its flow as before.
