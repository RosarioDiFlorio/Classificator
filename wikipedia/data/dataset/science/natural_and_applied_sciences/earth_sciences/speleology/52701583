Joseph Delteil (21 March 1909 – 7 November 1979) was a French speleologist.
Delteil trained as a carpenter before turning to speleology. In 1935, he participated in the exploration of the Labouiche underground river, revealing 3800 meters of active network. In 1943 and in 1946-47, he also participated alongside Marcel Loubens and Norbert Casteret to the exploration of the abyss of Henne Morte.
His name is given to the 130 meter deep shaft located at the bottom of the "gouffre Raymonde", the major chasm of the réseau Félix Trombe.
