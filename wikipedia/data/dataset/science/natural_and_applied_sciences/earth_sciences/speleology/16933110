The Texas Cave Management Association (TCMA) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation formed in 1986 to promote the conservation, study, and understanding of caves in Texas. TCMA was the first organization in Texas dedicated to the preservation of caves and underground resources. TCMA manages and owns numerous caves throughout Texas. Some of these caves are protected as home to unique and endangered creatures. Other TCMA caves are routinely used for a variety of purposes by cavers, the general public, youth groups, and rescue training groups. TCMA also provides management, conservation, and education information to individual, groups, organizations, and governmental agencies.
