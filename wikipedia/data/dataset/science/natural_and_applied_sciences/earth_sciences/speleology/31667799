The Southern California Grotto (usually shortened to SoCal Grotto) is a chapter of the National Speleological Society based in the Greater Los Angeles area.
Founded in 1948, the Southern California Grotto, is one of the oldest chapters of the NSS and it continues to thrive as one of the largest grottos in the western United States. The Southern California Grotto has a long history of active caving and cave related projects throughout California and other states, and extending to other areas of the world. Members of the Grotto endorse the goals of the National Speleological Society - the study, exploration, and conservation of caves. The motto: "Take nothing but pictures. Leave nothing but footprints. Kill nothing but time." summarizes the ideals practiced by Southern California Grotto cavers while exploring the underground world.
