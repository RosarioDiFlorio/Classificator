The Sierra de Tamaulipas is an isolated, semi-tropical mountain range in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Its highest point is 4,134 feet (1,260 mts). There are no cities or towns in the Sierra and the small population is largely agricultural. The higher elevations of the Sierra have forests of oak and pine, contrasting with the semi-arid brush that dominates at lower altitudes. Several archaeological sites establish that the Sierra de Tamaulipas was the northern outpost of the agricultural Mesoamerican peoples of eastern Mexico.
On December 5, 2016, the Sierra de Tamaulipas was declared a "Protected Natural Area" by the government of Mexico. The Protected Area has a core acreage of 38,285 hectares (94,600 acres) and a buffer zone containing 269,992 hectares (667,160 acres).
