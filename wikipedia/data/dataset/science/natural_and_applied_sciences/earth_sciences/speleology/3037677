Glaciokarst is a karst landscape that was glaciated during the cold periods of the Pleistocene and displays major landforms of glacial influence. For this reason karstification can be pre- and/or post- Pleistocene; this is not easy to classifiy. Mostly Glaciokarst has not such distinctly karst landforms.
Examples of glaciokarst landscapes are found in the Dinaric Alps especially at Orjen, and in the Alps (e.g. the Kanin Plateau with the Vrtiglavica shaft).
