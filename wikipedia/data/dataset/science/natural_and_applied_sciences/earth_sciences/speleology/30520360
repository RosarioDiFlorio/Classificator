John (Jack) Cristopher Coleman (died 20 April 1971) was a respected Irish geographer, archaeologist, speleologist and mountaineer. He devoted much of his life to the study of the caves of Ireland, the product of which were his many contributions to scientific journals in Ireland and the United Kingdom, his founding of the Speleological Society of Ireland and the publishing of his book, The Caves of Ireland.
His dedication to the exploration of Irish caves and highly respected articles published both nationally and abroad were pivotal in boosting the study of speleology in Ireland during the mid to late 20th century, earning him the affectionate title of the "father of Irish caving".
