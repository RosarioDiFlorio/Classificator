Maczuga Herkulesa is a tall (30 meters) limestone stack situated in Ojców National Park near Pieskowa Skała, north of Kraków in southern Poland. Its name, in Polish, means the "cudgel (or bludgeon) of Hercules", due to its distinctive shape.
Karst topography of soluble bedrock characterizes the entire park. The area is noted for its rock formations, although Maczuga Herkulesa may be the most famous. Apart from limestone monadnocks, there are numerous cliffs, ravines, and over 400 caves in the area.
