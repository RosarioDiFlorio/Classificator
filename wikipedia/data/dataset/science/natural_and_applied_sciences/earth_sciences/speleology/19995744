The West Virginia Speleological Survey (WVaSS) is a speleological organization and ongoing cave survey program that has gathered information and published about West Virginia caves and karst since 1967.
WVaSS was founded by Roger Baroody who was motivated to continue the survey begun by William E. Davies (1917–1990) in his Caverns of West Virginia (1949, 1950, 1965). Davis’ book and its updates were published as part of the West Virginia Geological Survey series, but after 1965 it became apparent that no further updates would be forthcoming. Large quantities of new cave and karst data were becoming available and so the need for a dedicated survey program seemed evident.
