The Riesending cave rescue occurred between 8 June and 19 June 2014 in Bavaria, Germany after a speleologist, who had been exploring the cave in a group of three, suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of a rockfall. It became famous for one of the largest efforts in the history of cave rescues, involving more than 700 people for eleven days and estimated costs of close to one million Euros.
