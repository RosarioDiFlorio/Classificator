A troglobite (or, formally, troglobiont) is an animal species strongly bound to hypogean habitats (not to be confused with troglodyte). A troglobiotic population or race can only form part of an eutroglophile species. In general, troglobite is referred to troglofauna (the land dwelling underground species), but it may be referred to stygofauna (the aquatic species), although for these animals the term stygobite is to prefer.
Troglobites typically have evolutionary adaptations to cave life. Examples of such adaptations include slow metabolism, reduced energy consumption, better food usage efficiency, decrease or loss of eyesight (anophthalmia), and depigmentation (absence of pigment in the integument). Conversely, as opposed to lost or reduced functions, many species have evolved elongated antennal and locomotory appendages, in order to better move around and respond to environmental stimuli. These structures are also full of chemical, tactile and humidity receptors. Troglobites commonly do not survive well outside caves and, therefore, cannot travel between separate cave systems. As a result, many troglobiotic species are endemic to a single cave or system of caves.
Not all cave dwelling species are considered to be troglobite. An animal found out in underground environment may be a troglophile (a species living both in subterranean and in epigean habitats, e.g. bats and cave swallows) or a trogloxene (a species only occurring sporadically in a hypogean habitat and unable to establish a subterranean population).
