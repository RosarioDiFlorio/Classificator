A calanque (French: [kalɑ̃k], "inlet"; Corsican: calanca, pl. calanche; Occitan: calanca, pl. calancas) is a narrow, steep-walled inlet that is developed in limestone, dolomite, or other carbonate strata and found along the Mediterranean coast. A calanque is a steep-sided valley formed within karstic regions either by fluvial erosion or the collapse of the roof of a cave that has been subsequently partially submerged by a rise in sea level.
