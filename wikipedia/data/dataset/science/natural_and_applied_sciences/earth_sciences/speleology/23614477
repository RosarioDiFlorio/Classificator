Sydney University Speleological Society (SUSS) is a caving group based in Sydney, Australia. SUSS was founded in 1948 and is the oldest caving group on mainland Australia (and second-oldest in the country, having formed two years after the Tasmanian Caverneering Club). It has been at the forefront of speleology since its formation.
The Sydney University Speleological Society has published several books on Australian caves and caving, including "The Exploration and Speleogeography of Mammoth Cave, Jenolan", "The Caves of Jenolan 2: The Northern Limestone" and "Tuglow Caves".
The Society also publishes a regular Bulletin.
