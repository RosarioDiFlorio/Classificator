The Irish Cave Rescue Organisation (ICRO) is a voluntary body responsible for cave and abandoned mine rescues within the island of Ireland. The organisation attends, manages and carries out rescues at the request of the Garda Síochána in the Republic of Ireland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in Northern Ireland, and is responsible to both police services.
The rescue organisation has 100 members, including general members who are available to help in any situation and those who have specific skills to assist a rescue, such as first-aid training and the ability to rig a cave.
