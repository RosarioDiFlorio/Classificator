In geology, frostwork is a type of speleothem (cave formation) with acicular ("needle-like") growths almost always composed of aragonite (a polymorph of calcite) or calcite replaced by aragonite. It is a variety of anthodite. In some caves frostwork may grow on top of cave popcorn or boxwork.
In architecture frost-work or frostwork refers to a style of rustication carved with a vertically-oriented pattern evoking hanging pond-weed or algae, or icicles. It is mainly found in garden architecture, where water is to flow over or near the surface. Other decorative arts may use the term for other decorative patterns imitating frost or ice.
