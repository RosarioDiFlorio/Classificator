Balancanché (Spanish: Grutas de Balancanché) are the most famous Maya cave sites, near Chichen Itza, in Mexico. Other names of the cave include, Balancanche, Balaamcanche, Balaancanche, Balankanche and Balancanchyn. The name translates to "the cave of the sacred jaguar throne". According to Bruce Rogers, the name of the cave is related to the Mayan leaders, not the animal jaguar. For the past 22 years, the cave has been used as a tourist attraction.
