The Owenbrean River (Irish: Abhainn Bhr√©an or "stinking river"), is a small river in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland which flows down from Cuilcagh Mountain before sinking underground, eventually reaching the Marble Arch Cave system. The river meets up with two other mountain rivers within the caves, the Sruh Croppa and the Aghinrawn; these three rivers then form the River Cladagh.
