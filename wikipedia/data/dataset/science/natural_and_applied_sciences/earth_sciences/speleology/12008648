The phreatic zone, or zone of saturation, is the area in an aquifer, below the water table, in which relatively all pores and fractures are saturated with water.
The phreatic zone defines the lower edge of the vadose zone.
The phreatic zone size, color, and depth may fluctuate with changes of season, and during wet and dry periods.
