International Union of Speleology (French: Union Internationale de Spéléologie UIS) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization formed in 1965 on the initiative of the International Speleological Congress (held every four years since 1949) to promote interaction between academic and technical speleologists from a wide range of nationalities for the purpose of developing and coordinating international speleology in all of its scientific, technical, cultural and economic aspects. Its voting members consist of a delegate from each member country representing the cavers and speleologists of that country, rather than any of the official national bodies.
Its activities take place in a number of commissions and working groups, such as the UIS Informatics Commission formed in 1986, the Speleotherapy Commission and the Karst Hydrogeology and Speleogenesis Commission.
The UIS publishes the International Journal of Speleology.
