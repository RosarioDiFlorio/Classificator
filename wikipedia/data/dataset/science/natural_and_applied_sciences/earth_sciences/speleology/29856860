A karst spring is a spring that is part of a karst system. That includes the underground drainage of a much larger area, which means that karst springs often have a very large discharge. Because of their often conical or bowl shape, such water sources are also known in German-speaking lands as a Topf ("pot") which is reflected in names such as Aachtopf (the source of the Radolfzeller Aach) or Blautopf (the source of the Blau river in Blaubeuren).
Karst springs are usually the end of a cave system at the place where a river cave reaches the Earth's surface. Thus, it is often possible to enter the caves at a karst spring and explore them.
