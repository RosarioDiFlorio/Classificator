Cavefish or cave fish is a generic term for fresh and brackish water fish adapted to life in caves and other underground habitats. Related terms are subterranean fish, troglomorphic fish and hypogean fish.
Being aquatic, they are a part of the troglobite group known as stygofauna. The more than 200 scientifically described species of obligate cavefish are found on all continents, except Antarctica. Although widespread as a group, many cavefish species have very small ranges and are seriously threatened. Cavefish are members of a wide range of families and do not form a monophyletic group. Typical adaptations found in cavefish are reduced eyes and pigmentation.
