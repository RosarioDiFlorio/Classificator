The Oregon High Desert Grotto (or OHDG) is an American caving club, known as a grotto. It is affiliated with the National Speleological Society.
OHDG is involved with caving and conservation efforts in central Oregon and beyond, including the Oregon Caves National Monument, the Lava Beds National Monument in northern California, and caves in western Idaho and southern Washington. Members of the grotto have worked with the Department of State Lands and received a participation award from state leaders for their volunteer work. In 2013, the grotto was recognized by Region 6 of the United States Forest Service for various volunteer hours working with caves and bats. They received the R6 Volunteers and Service and Program Award.
