The Pakistan Cave Research & Caving Federation (PCRCF), formed on 14 August 1997, is a non-profit national constituent governing body for underground exploration, research, and conservation of caves in Pakistan and adjacent areas. It represents all those persons and groups with a genuine interest in caves, karst and associated phenomena, whether from a strictly sporting viewpoint, a scientific viewpoint, or a combination of both to promote the study of caves and associated phenomena for protection of the natural heritage of Pakistan and international speleological community.

It works closely with its member associations to support cave & karst research by encouraging original exploration, organizing educational, scientific, recreational caving, and cave rescue conferences and expeditions. PCRCF is a member of the International Union of Speleology (UIS), through its founder and President Hayatullah Khan Durrani, Chairman Malik Abdul Rahim Baabai and media officer Mohammad Abubakar Durrani.
