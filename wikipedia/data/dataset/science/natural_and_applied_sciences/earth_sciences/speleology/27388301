The National Association for Cave Diving (NACD) was founded in 1968 with the goal of improving the safety of scuba diving in caves through training and education. A non-profit corporation, the NACD has its headquarters in Gainesville, Florida but is conducting its administration and operations from High Springs, Florida.
NACD offers training courses and certification in cavern and cave diving, and instructor courses. As part of its mission to raise safety standards in cave diving, the NACD publishes a quarterly journal, holds seminars, and sponsors cave diving projects.
