Henry Wesley Voysey (1791-9 April 1824), was a physician, geologist and mineralogist who worked in India in the service of the East India Company. He has been called the "father of Indian geology." He made the first geological map in Indian covering the Hyderabad region that he travelled through as geologist associated with the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. The map was submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta on 8 August 1821 but no copy of it remains.
