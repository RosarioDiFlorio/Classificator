The Barlow Memorial Medal was created in 1916 by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum to recognize the best paper on economic geology published by the Institute each year.
Initially a cash prize, the award then became a silver medal (supplemented by a cash prize), upgrading in 1941 to a gold medal.
The medal is named after Alfred Ernest Barlow, who served as President of the Institute between 1912 and 1919.
