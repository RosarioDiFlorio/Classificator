Voltinia dramba is a fossil metalmark butterfly, found in pieces of amber in the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola in 2004. The butterfly, belonging to the extant genus Voltinia, is the first species to be taxonomically described from amber and the first true fossil of an adult riodinid. Five specimens, all females, were found in pieces of amber from the resin of the extinct leguminous tree Hymenaea protera (Poinar 1991).
