De Striene was a water channel that ran between the Schelde near Tholen and the Maas rivers in Zeeland in the Netherlands. In the Sint-Elisabethsvloed (1421) the watercourses in the Maas and Rhine delta were drastically changed, and the Striene disappeared. However, the current Scheldt-Rhine Canal mostly follows the ancient path of the Striene.
Probably the place names Strijen, Cromstrijen, and Strijenham on Tholen are diverted from Striene. Also the name Strienestad used for Steenbergen in Noord-Brabant during the Carnival, refers to the Striene.
