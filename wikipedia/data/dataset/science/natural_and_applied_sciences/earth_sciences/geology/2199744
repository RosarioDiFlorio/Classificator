The Statherian Period ( ; , meaning "stable, firm") is the final geologic period in the Paleoproterozoic Era and lasted from 1800 Mya to 1600 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically.
The period was characterized on most continents by either new platforms or final cratonization of fold belts.
By the beginning of the Statherian, the supercontinent Columbia had assembled.
