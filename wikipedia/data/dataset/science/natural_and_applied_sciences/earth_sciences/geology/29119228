The Comley Limestone is an Early Cambrian Lagerst√§tte exposed in Comley, Shropshire, England. It is known for its phosphatic microfossils, which can be extracted by acid maceration and are preserved in three dimensions in a similar fashion to the Orsten fossils. It represents around 10 million years of deposition, and was deposited from 519 to 501 million years ago.
