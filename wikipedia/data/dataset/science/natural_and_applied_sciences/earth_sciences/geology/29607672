Pterygotioidea is an extinct superfamily of eurypterids, an extinct group of merostomatan arthropods commonly known as "sea scorpions". It is one of the superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Eurypterina. It includes the family Pterygotidae together with more basal genera like Hughmilleria, Herefordopterus and Slimonia.
Pterygotoidea is the most taxonomically diverse of all eurypterid clades, containing 56 species in 9 genera. Though it only existed for around 40 million years during a time when most continents were widely separated, it is also the clade with the most cosmopolitan distribution. Their fossils have been recovered from Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Asia and Australia, with the earliest remains being from the Early Silurian of Scotland and South China. The exact geographical origin of the group is unclear, but was likely in Laurentia.
