FOSI, Forum Sedimentologiwan Indonesia / Indonesian Sedimentologists Forum sedimentological is a sedimentological section of the Indonesian Geologists Association (Ikatan Ahli Geologi Indonesia / IAGI), which was formed in 1995. The first bulletin was issued in 1996, called Berita Sedimentologi (later became the "Indonesian Journal of Sedimentary Geology" but the original name is still kept in the cover). The bulletin was started as hard copies (paper prints) and in 2010 it has been changed to soft copies and downloadable from FOSI website. FOSI issued the bulletin three times a year.
The logo of FOSI has been introduced in 1999 during the 1st regional conference in Bandung, Indonesia. It has been used as a standard logo of the organization.
