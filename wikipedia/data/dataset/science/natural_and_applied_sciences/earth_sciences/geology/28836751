The Bala Fault is a SW-NE trending geological fault in Wales that extends offshore into Cardigan Bay. In the offshore area it is a major normal fault and forms the bounding structure to the Cardigan Bay Basin, with a fill including about 2500 m of Lias Group. At its northeastern end it links to the similarly orientated Llanelidan Fault.
