In geology, an accretionary complex is a former accretionary wedge. Accretionary complexes are typically made up of a mix of turbidites of terrestrial material, basalts from the ocean floor, and pelagic and hemipelagic sediments. Most of the geological basement of Japan is made up of accretionary complexes.
