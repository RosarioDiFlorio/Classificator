Shoreline Fault is a 25 km long vertical strike-slip fault discovered in 2008 that lies less than a mile from the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in California. It is thought to be able to produce quakes up to 6.5 magnitude, and along with the Hosgri fault are thought to pose a threat to the nuclear plant despite the operator, Pacific Gas and Electric claiming the facility to be able to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake.
