The Shields parameter, also called the Shields criterion or Shields number, is a nondimensional number used to calculate the initiation of motion of sediment in a fluid flow. It is a nondimensionalization of a shear stress, and is typically denoted 
  
    
      
        
          τ

   or 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  . It is given by:

  
    
      
        
          τ
          
            ∗

    {\displaystyle \tau _{\ast }=\theta ={\frac {\tau }{(\rho _{s}-\rho )gD}},}
  
where:

  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
   is a dimensional shear stress;

  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            s
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
   is the density of the sediment;

  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is the density of the fluid;

  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is acceleration due to gravity;

  
    
      
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle D}
   is a characteristic particle diameter of the sediment.
