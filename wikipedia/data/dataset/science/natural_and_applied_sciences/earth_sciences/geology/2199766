The Stenian Period (from Greek στενός (stenós), meaning "narrow") is the final geologic period in the Mesoproterozoic Era and lasted from 1200 Mya to 1000 Mya (million years ago). Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically. The name derives from narrow polymetamorphic belts formed over this period.
The supercontinent Rodinia assembled during the Stenian. It would last into the Tonian period.
This period includes the formation of the Keweenawan Rift at about 1100 Mya.
