In physical geography and geology, a horst is a raised fault block bounded by normal faults or graben. A horst is a raised block of the Earth's crust that has lifted, or has remained stationary, while the land on either side has subsided. The word Horst in Dutch and German means heap - cognate with English "hurst".
The Vosges Mountains in France and Black Forest in Germany are examples of horsts, as are the Table, Jura and the Dole mountains. The word also applies to larger areas, such as the Russian Plain, Arabia, India and Central South Africa, where the continent remains stable, with horizontal table-land stratification, in distinction to folded regions such as the Eurasian chains.
