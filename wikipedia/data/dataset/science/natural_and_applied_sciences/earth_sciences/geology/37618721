The Jiangshanian is the middle stage of the Furongian series. It follows the Paibian stage and is succeeded by the still unnamed Stage 10 of the Cambrian. The base is defined as the first appearance of the trilobite Agnostotes orientalis which is estimated to be 494 million years ago. The Jiangshanian lasted until approximately 489.5 million years ago.
The Cambrian stage was named after Jiangshan, a town in the Zhejiang province of China.
