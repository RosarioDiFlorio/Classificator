Viking–Bergen is a hypothetical former island between modern Scotland and Norway, at the boundary of the North Sea, and Norwegian Sea. The area is now known as the "Viking–Bergen banks" (combining the Viking and Bergen ocean banks).
During the Bølling–Allerød Period, known in Britain as the Windermere interstadial, the northern coast of Doggerland began to recede as global sea levels rose. There may have been a Shetland island marking the northern end of a bay north of the Dogger Hills, and the Viking–Bergen island would have been between the bay and the Norwegian Trench.
