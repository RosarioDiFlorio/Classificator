The New York Mineralogical Club, Inc. is the oldest continually-operating mineral club in the United States. The club was founded by George Frederick Kunz, Benjamin B. Chamberlin and Professor Daniel S. Martin, on September 21, 1886, in the home of Professor Daniel S. Martin at 236 West 4th Street, New York City. The clubâ€™s collection of more than 700 mineral specimens from New York City is stored at the American Museum of Natural History and includes a large 6 inch almandine garnet called the Subway Garnet discovered in 1885.
