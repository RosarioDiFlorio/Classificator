Fire rock is manufactured lava rock that is sold in various shapes and sizes, and is used as a medium for retaining direct heat. Fire rocks are used in natural gas fireplaces or in natural gas or propane burning fire pits. It may be used as the main fuel distributor or as padding for fire glass to go on top. Fire rocks are proven to increase combustion efficiency and maintain a desirable aesthetic quality. They also are known for dispersing the flame of the fireplace or fire pit well, by allowing for gaps that act as channels for air and gas to funnel the flame through. Fire rocks come in many different colors and range in sizes from a half-inch to an inch.
