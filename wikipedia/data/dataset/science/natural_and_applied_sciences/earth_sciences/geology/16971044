A physiographic province is a geographic region with a characteristic geomorphology, and often specific subsurface rock type or structural elements.
The continents are subdivided into various physiographic provinces, each having a specific character, relief, and environment which contributes to its uniqueness. The physiographic provinces are then subdivided into smaller physiographic sections.
