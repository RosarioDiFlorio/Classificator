Gondwana ( ), or Gondwanaland, was a supercontinent that formed from the unification of several cratons in the Late Neoproterozoic, merged with Laurussia in the Carboniferous to form Pangaea, and began to fragment in the Mesozoic. It was the largest continental landmass on Earth, covering an area of 100,000,000 km2 (39,000,000 sq mi) or 64% of today's continents. Located in the Southern Hemisphere, it incorporated several modern landmasses, including Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, and Australia, as well as the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, which have now moved entirely into the Northern Hemisphere.
The formation of Gondwana began c. 800 to 650 Ma with the East African Orogeny – the collision of India, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka with East Africa – and was completed c. 600 to 530 Ma with the overlapping Brasiliano and Kuunga orogenies – the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica, respectively.
