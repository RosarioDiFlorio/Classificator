The Ryukyu arc (琉球弧, Ryūkyū-ko) is a volcanic island arc system of Japan's triple junction formed by the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate between Ryukyu Trench to the south-east and the Okinawa Trough to north-west. It comprises the entirety of the Ryukyu Islands chain. The Ryukyu and Southwest Honshu arcs together form the southwest trending arm of the Boso Triple Junction.
