The Geological Strength Index (GSI) system, proposed in 1995, is used for the estimation of the rock mass strength and the rock mass deformation modulus. The GSI system concentrates on the description of two factors, rock structure and block surface conditions. The guidelines given by the GSI system are for the estimation of the peak strength parameters of jointed rock masses. There are no guidelines given by the GSI, or by any other system, for the estimation of the rock massâ€™ residual strength that yield consistent results.
