Bringelly Shale is a component of the Wianammatta group of sedimentary rocks in the Sydney Basin of eastern Australia. It was formed in the Triassic Period. It is most often seen in the western parts of the city. The shale has its greatest geographical extent at Bringelly, near the suburb of Liverpool. It is similar to Ashfield Shale, though differing in having a greater amount of sandstone and lacking sideritic mudstone bands. The average thickness is around 60 metres. The Bringelly Shale was deposited in a swampy alluvial plain with meandering streams flowing from the west forming discontinuous beds of sandstone.
