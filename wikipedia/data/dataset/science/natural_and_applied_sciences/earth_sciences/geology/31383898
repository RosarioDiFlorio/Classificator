The Sagaing Fault is a major fault in Burma, a continental transform fault between the Indian plate and Sunda Plate that connects spreading centers in the Andaman Sea and the continental convergence zone along the Himalayan front. It passes through populated cities of Mandalay, Yamethin, Pyinmana, the capital Naypyidaw, Toungoo and Pegu before dropping off into the Gulf of Martaban, over 1200 kilometers. Global Positioning System campaigns revealed a right-lateral slip rate of 18 mm/yr. Different segments of the fault ruptured in May-1930, Dec-1930, 1931 and 1946. The fault ruptured in 1930, causing a Magnitude 7.3 quake and likely a local tsunami at Bago, causing over 500 deaths.
