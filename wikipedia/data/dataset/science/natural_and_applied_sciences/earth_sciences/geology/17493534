In structural geology, striations are linear furrows generated from fault movement. The striation's direction reveal the movement directions in the fault plane.
Similar striations called glacial striations can occur in areas subjected to glaciation. Striations can also be caused by underwater landslides.
Striations can also be a growth pattern or mineral habit that looks like a set of hairline grooves, shown on faces of certain minerals. Examples of minerals that can show growth striations include pyrite, feldspar, quartz, tourmaline, chalcocite and sphalerite.
