The North Pennine Batholith, also known as the Weardale Granite is a granitic batholith lying under northeast England, emplaced around 400 million years ago in the early Devonian. The batholith consists of five plutons, the Tynehead, Scordale, Rowlands Gill, Cornsay and Weardale plutons. The Weardale Granite pluton is the largest and the only one that has been proved (sampled), after the Rookhope Borehole confirmed Martin Bott's hypothesis that a large negative gravity anomaly under Weardale represented a low-density igneous intrusion.
