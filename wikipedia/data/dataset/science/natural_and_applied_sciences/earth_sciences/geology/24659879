This is a list of free and open source software for geological data handling and interpretation. The list is split into broad categories, depending on the intended use of the software and its scope of functionality.
Notice that 'free and open source' requires that the source code is available. Simple being 'free of charge' is not sufficientâ€”see gratis versus libre.
