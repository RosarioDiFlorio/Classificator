The Moai Seamount is a submarine volcano, the second most westerly in the Easter Seamount Chain or Sala y GÃ³mez ridge. It is east of Pukao seamount and west of Easter Island. It rises over 2,500 metres from the ocean floor to within a few hundred metres of the sea surface. The Moai seamount is fairly young, having developed in the last few hundred thousand years as the Nazca Plate floats over the Easter hotspot.
The Moai seamount was named after the moai statues of neighbouring Easter Island.
