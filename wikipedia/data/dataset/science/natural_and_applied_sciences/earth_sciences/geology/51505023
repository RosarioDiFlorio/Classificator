The Antioquia Batholith (Spanish: batolito antioqueño) is a cluster of plutons located in Antioquia Department of Colombia. The plutons intruded and cooled in Late Cretaceous times. Much of the batholith is weathered into a ca. 40 m thick saprolite mantle. In some locations this saprolite reaches thicknesses of about 200 m. The development of this weathering is attributed to the humid climate and to stable conditions with limited amounts of erosion. Where the batholith-derived saprolite is eroded inselbergs like Peñól de Guatapé crops out. Inselbergs are held to corresponds to rock masses of the batholith that resisted weathering and erosion by being less fractured.
