The Sturtian glaciation was a glaciation, or perhaps multiple glaciations, during the Cryogenian Period, when the Earth experienced repeated large-scale glaciations. The duration of the Sturtian glaciation has been variously defined, with dates ranging from 717 to 643 Ma. Stern et al. place the period at 715 to 680 Ma.
According to Eyles and Young, "Glaciogenic rocks figure prominently in the Neoproterozoic stratigraphy of southeastern Australia and the northern Canadian Cordillera. The Sturtian glaciogenic succession (c. 740 Ma) unconformably overlies rocks of the Burra Group." The Sturtian succession includes two major diamictite-mudstone sequences, which represent glacial advance and retreat cycles. It is stratigraphically correlated with the Rapitan Group of North America.
The Sturtian is named after the Sturt River Gorge, near Bellevue Heights, South Australia.
Reusch's Moraine in northern Norway may have been deposited during this period.
