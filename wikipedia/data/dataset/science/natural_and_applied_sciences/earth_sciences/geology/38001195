This is a list of lunar sample displays from the Apollo program that were distributed through the United States and around the world. They include samples from the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 missions conducted by NASA from 1969 to the 1970s.
The first human mission to the surface of the Moon returned a few dozen pounds/kilos of Lunar material (mainly rock and dust), and the US put about 0.05 grams in little display cases and gave them out all the U.S. states and World nations as well some extra political entities like the U.S. territories under administration. This was done again with an Apollo 17 sample..
