Portland Bowers Basebed is a type of limestone from Bowers Quarry at the Isle of Portland in Dorset, southern England, on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.
The stone is clear of fossils and is the cleanest of the Portland stone types. Bowers Basebed, which is quarried by Albion Stone, has a maximum bed height of 1.95 metres. It is known for being highly durable and being able to withstand the effects of weathering.
Bowers Basebed was used to construct "7â€“10 Old Bailey", in the city of London.
