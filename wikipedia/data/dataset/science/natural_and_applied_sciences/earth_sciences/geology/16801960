In geology, plating is a hypothesized process whereby asthenospheric mantle hardens beneath crustal material, thereby becoming attached to it and thereafter moving together with the crustal material as part of the lithosphere.
A complementary process, although it does not necessarily always involve the upper mantle, is called delamination.
