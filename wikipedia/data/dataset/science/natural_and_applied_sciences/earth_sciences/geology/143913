The term "Old World" is used in the west to refer to Africa, Europe, and Asia (Afro-Eurasia, or the eastern hemisphere), regarded collectively as the part of the world known to its population before contact with the Americas and Oceania (the western hemisphere). It is used in the context of, and contrasts with, the New World (the Americas and Oceania).
The Old World is roughly coterminous with the Eastern Hemisphere; however, the parts of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and West Africa that are in the Western Hemisphere are still considered part of the Old World, whereas Oceanic Eastern Hemisphere countries like Australia and New Zealand are not.
