The Morón Fault System or Morón Fault Zone (Spanish: Falla Morón) is a complex of geological faults located in northern Venezuela and the adjacent Caribbean Sea. The fault system is of right-lateral strike-slip. The fault forms part of the diffuse boundary between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates. The existence of this fault was hypothesized as early as 1888.
