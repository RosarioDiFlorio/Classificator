The Early Jurassic epoch (in chronostratigraphy corresponding to the Lower Jurassic series) is the earliest of three epochs of the Jurassic period. The Early Jurassic starts immediately after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, 201.3 Ma (million years ago), and ends at the start of the Middle Jurassic 174.1 Ma.
Certain rocks of marine origin of this age in Europe are called "Lias" and that name was used for the period, as well, in 19th century geology. In southern Germany rocks of this age are called Black Jurassic.
