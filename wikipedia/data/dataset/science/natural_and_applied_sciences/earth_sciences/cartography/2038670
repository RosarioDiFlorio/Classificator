A chart datum is the level of water that charted depths displayed on a nautical chart are measured from. A chart datum is generally a tidal datum; that is, a datum derived from some phase of the tide. Common chart datums are lowest astronomical tide and mean lower low water. In non-tidal areas, e.g., the Baltic sea, Mean Sea Level (MSL) is used.
A chart datum is a vertical datum and must not be confused with the horizontal datum for the chart.
