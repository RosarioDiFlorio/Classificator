The King's England is a topographical and historical book series written and edited by Arthur Mee in 42 volumes. It was said that the series was a modern Domesday Book and that the compilers had travelled half-a-million miles in order to complete their task. The first, introductory, volume was published in 1936. In 1989, The King's England Press was established to reprint the series.
