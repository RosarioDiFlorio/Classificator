Italy's postal code system is called CAP (Codice di Avviamento Postale, literally: Postal Expedition Code). CAP are routing information for all the Italian cities and towns which have just a single CAP each; 28 city centres have a specific CAP. Vatican City and San Marino also use the Italian postal code system.
Italian CAP postal codes have an optional prefix of "I-" (or "IT-", or none at all, depending on where the mail originates) followed by five digits. The region name is not used in the postal address, but the provincia is included as the 2-letter abbreviation of the province's capital. Thus, a Mario Rossi living on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi, 10 in the town of Buccinasco in the province of Milan will be addressed as follows:
Rossi Mario
Via Giuseppe Garibaldi, 10
20090 BUCCINASCO MI
ITALY
The town of Buccinasco is in the province of Milan (MI); the region (Lombardy) is not included in the address.
Note also the surname is generally written before the first name
The 2-letter abbreviation of the provincial capital is usually not included in addresses for large towns characterised by multi-CAP in their city centres. Thus, a Mario Rossi living at Via Dante, 10 in the city of Rome in the province of Rome will be addressed as follows:
Rossi Mario
Via Dante, 10
00194 ROMA
ITALY
Neither the province of Rome (RM) nor the region (Lazio) is included in the address.
