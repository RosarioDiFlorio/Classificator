OziExplorer is raster navigation and mapping software for Windows. It is very popular among off-road drivers and adventure travelers as it allows to use and create custom maps for remote locations that are not fully covered by major map providers like Tele Atlas. That is why the software is also widely used on Post-Soviet states territory.
It supports editing, uploading and downloading of waypoints, routes and tracks to most Garmin, Magellan, Lowrance, Brunton and MLR GPS devices.
OziExplorer provides support for Google Maps, Google Earth, TerraServer-USA, OpenStreetMap and Virtual Earth as well as creating your own maps.
