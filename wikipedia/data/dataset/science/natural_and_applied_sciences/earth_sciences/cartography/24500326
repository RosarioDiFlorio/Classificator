The Ordnance Survey International and its predecessors built an archive of air photography, map and survey records for the United Kingdom from 1946 to 1999. The Ordnance Survey International Collection (formerly the Ordnance Survey International Library) held mapping records that were acquired outside the UK.
The agency was closed in 2001. Responsibility for its archive passed to The National Archives c2003; it was dispersed shortly thereafter.
