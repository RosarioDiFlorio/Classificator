The Ferraris map or map of the Austrian Netherlands is a historical map created between 1770 and 1778 by the count Joseph de Ferraris in response to a request by Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine. It is the first systematic, large scale mapping in Belgium and Western Europe.
There are three original versions of the map. The Royal Library of Belgium, the Austrian National Library and National Library of the Netherlands each have one.
