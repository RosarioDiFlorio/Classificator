Imago Mundi is a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal established in 1935 by Leo Bagrow. It covers the history of early maps, cartography, and map-related ideas. Articles are in English and have abstracts in French, German, Spanish, and English. Each volume also contains three reference sections (book reviews, bibliography, and chronicle) that provide a summary of current developments in the field.
