ISO 3166-2:BT is the entry for Bhutan in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.
Currently for Bhutan, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 20 districts.
Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is BT, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Bhutan. The second part is two digits, except Gasa and Trashi Yangtse, which use two letters instead. The first digit indicates the zone where the district is in:
1: Western
2: Central (Gasa also in this zone)
3: Southern
4: Eastern (Trashi Yangtse also in this zone)
