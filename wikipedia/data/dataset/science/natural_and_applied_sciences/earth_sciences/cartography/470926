The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a Japanese sensor which is one of five remote sensory devices on board the Terra satellite launched into Earth orbit by NASA in 1999. The instrument has been collecting data since February 2000.

ASTER provides high-resolution images of the planet Earth in 14 different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to thermal infrared light. The resolution of images ranges between 15 and 90 meters. ASTER data are used to create detailed maps of surface temperature of land, emissivity, reflectance, and elevation.
In April 2008, the SWIR detectors of ASTER began malfunctioning and were publicly declared non-operational by NASA in January 2009. All SWIR data collected after 1 April 2008 has been marked as unusable.
The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) is available at no charge to users worldwide via electronic download.
As of 2 April 2016, the entire catalogue of ASTER image data became publicly available online at no cost. It can be downloaded with a freely registered account from either NASA's Earth Data Search delivery system or from the USGS Earth Explorer delivery system.
