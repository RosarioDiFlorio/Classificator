ISO 3166-2:AN was the entry for the Netherlands Antilles in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.
The Netherlands Antilles were officially assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code AN before it was dissolved into five separate territories in 2010, and the entry has been deleted from ISO 3166-1 as a result. Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten, which became "countries" in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, are now assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes CW and SX respectively. Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, which became "special municipalities" of the Netherlands, are now assigned the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code BQ under the collective entry "Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba".
No ISO 3166-2 codes were ever defined in the entry for the Netherlands Antilles.
