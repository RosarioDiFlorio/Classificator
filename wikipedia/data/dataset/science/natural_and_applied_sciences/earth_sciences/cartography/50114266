MAC Address anonymization is the idea of performing a one way function on a MAC address so that the result may be used in tracking systems for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC Address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like Google, Apple and iInside - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.
