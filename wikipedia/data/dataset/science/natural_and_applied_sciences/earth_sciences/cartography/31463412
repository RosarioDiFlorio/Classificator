Rome2rio is a multimodal transport search engine that launched in April 2011. Rome2rio's platform is capable of long-distance (inter-city) trip planning as well as local (intra-city) journey planning. Users can input any address, town or landmark as the origin and destination and Rome2rio searches a database of flight, train, ferry, bus and driving routes to present route and price options for travelling to that destination.
The company is based in Melbourne, Australia.
