For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the user number of another administrative unit. The prefix for international calls from Albania is 00 (e.g., for a United States number 00 1 ... should be dialed). Below is an explanation when dialing a number within the Tirana administrative unit:

     0 4 xxx xxxx    (from within the Tirana administrative unit)
     0 4 xxx xxxx    (from within Albania, but outside Tirana)
  +355 4 xxx xxxx    (from outside Albania)
