The Collignon projection is an equal-area pseudocylindrical map projection first known to be published by Ã‰douard Collignon in 1865 and subsequently cited by A. Tissot in 1881.
For the smallest choices of the parameters chosen for this projection, the sphere may be mapped either to a single diamond, a pair of squares, or a triangle. The projection is used in the polar areas as part of the HEALPix spherical projection, which is widely used in physical cosmology in making maps of the cosmic microwave background, in particular by the WMAP and Planck space missions.
