23 Avenue NW is a major arterial road in south Edmonton. It runs through several neighbourhoods including Mill Woods and The Meadows, and commercial areas including South Edmonton Common, and Mill Woods Town Centre Mall. In mid-2007 construction of an interchange started at the intersection with Calgary Trail / Gateway Boulevard, expected to be completed in 2011. This is considered Edmonton's busiest intersection. Construction has also been planned to extend 119 Street and the LRT past 23 Avenue, no dates have been set yet for either to begin. Because Edmonton has adapted a quadrant system, the suffix NW is sometimes added to addresses, to avoid confusion with addresses south of Quadrant (1) Avenue.
