Belarus began using its own country code +375 in 1995. Prior to that it was part of the +7 international country code. The local numbering plan was inherited from USSR and remains with little changed.
Geographic area codes were designed based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the analog trunk switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes.
When calling within Belarus add 0 to the trunk prefix. This way dialing within the country is practically unchanged. In 2003 the abbreviated dialing within areas was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit trunk prefix. Previously it was possible to dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80-AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number.
International calling remains unchanged: 8-10-xxx...xxxx where 8 is a trunk prefix, 10 is the international access code, xxx...xxxx are the digits of the destination country, areas and local number.
Transition to new numbering plan
Beltelecom began transition to the international numbering standard similar to the one adapted in many European countries in 2007. March 31, 2007 all short numbers were changed from 2 or 3 digits to 3 digits starting with 1. Beltelecom plans by 2010 to change trunk prefix to 0 from current 80 and international prefix to 00 from current 8-10.
