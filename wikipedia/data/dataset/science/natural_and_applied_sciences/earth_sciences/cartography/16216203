The A433 road is an A road and primary route in Gloucestershire, England. It starts at a junction with the A46 at Dunkirk (51.5754°N 2.3017°W﻿ / 51.5754; -2.3017﻿ (A433 road (western end))), 5 miles (8.0 km) north of junction 18 of the M4 and 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Chipping Sodbury. It runs northeast for 16.5 miles (26.6 km) to a junction with the A429 just west of Cirencester (51.7011°N 2.0006°W﻿ / 51.7011; -2.0006﻿ (A433 road (eastern end))). On its way to Cirencester the road passes the spectacular Westonbirt Arboretum, and runs through the villages of Westonbirt and Doughton, and the town of Tetbury; then to the north of both Cotswold Airport (formerly RAF Kemble) and Kemble village.
The last 2 miles (3.2 km) follow the route of the Fosse Way. In this section the road passes the Thames Head pub (named for the source of the Thames) before rising over a crest and descending into a steep-side cutting to pass under the Golden Valley Line, through a narrow bridge which has no pavement for pedestrians.
