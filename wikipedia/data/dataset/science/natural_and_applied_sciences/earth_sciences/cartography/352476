The A77 road is a major road in Scotland. It runs in a southwesternly direction from the city of Glasgow, past the towns of Giffnock, Newton Mearns, Kilmarnock, Prestwick, Ayr, Maybole, Girvan and Stranraer to the town of Portpatrick on the Irish Sea. It passes through the council areas of Glasgow City, East Renfrewshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway.
It has full trunk road status from the terminus of the M77 motorway at Fenwick to the junction with the A75 in Stranraer.
The A77 is an important link from Glasgow to one of its two major airports, Prestwick Airport, and to the three main Northern Ireland ferry terminals at Stranraer, Cairnryan, and Troon. As a result, the road is subject to a busy mixture of commuter, tourist and heavy goods vehicle traffic which has necessitated upgrades to many sections.
