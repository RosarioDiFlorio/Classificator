The meridian 74° west of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, North America, the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, South America, the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole.
In the United States, the meridian passes through New York City.
In Antarctica, the meridian defines the western limit of the Argentinian territorial claim, and passes through the Chilean and British claims – the three claims overlap.
The 74th meridian west forms a great circle with the 106th meridian east.
