Time of arrival (TOA or ToA), sometimes called time of flight (ToF), is the travel time of a radio signal from a single transmitter to a remote single receiver.
Compared to the TDOA technique, time of arrival uses the absolute time of arrival at a certain base station rather than the measured time difference between departing from one and arriving at the other station. The distance can be directly calculated from the time of arrival as signals travel with a known velocity. Time of arrival data from two base stations will narrow a position to a position circle; data from a third base station is required to resolve the precise position to a single point. Many radiolocation systems, including GPS, use ToA.
