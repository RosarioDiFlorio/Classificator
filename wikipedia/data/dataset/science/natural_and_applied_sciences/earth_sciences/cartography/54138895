The Qinling Huaihe line (秦岭淮河线 Qínlǐng huáihé xiàn) is a reference line used by geographers to distinguish between Northern and Southern China.

It divides China into two regions that differ from each other in climate, culture, lifestyle and cuisine. Qinling refers to the Qinling Mountains, and Huaihe refers to the Huai River.
Regions north of the line tend to be temperate or frigid, with snow being a regular feature in winter. Regions south of the line tend to be subtropical and tropical. The south is hotter and wetter than the north. The north suffers from heavy air pollution due to coal burning facilities that produce electricity and heat.
Nowadays, most people acknowledge that divisions within Chinese society don't fall neatly into "north and south" divisions, because there's significant overlap in many regions in China. Therefore many old Chinese stereotypes for southerners vs northerners are no longer applicable. In other words, modern usage of the Qinling Huaihe Line has become irrelevant. For example, it's completely false to say that people south of the line generally prefer hot and spicy dishes, while people north of the line prefer sweet dishes. In modern China, the opposite is true, Northern Chinese overwhelmingly consume far more dishes (hot pot, chili oil noodles, etc.) with hot chillies, than southern Chinese.
The line also represents the 800 mm annual precipitation line of China.
Historically, the North was more developed (employing the latest technology of that time) than the South. But much has changed in recent times, and half of the most developed Tier 1 (China's city classification system started in 1980s) cities of China are in the South. It was in the Ming dynasty that the economy of the South outpaced that of the North.
