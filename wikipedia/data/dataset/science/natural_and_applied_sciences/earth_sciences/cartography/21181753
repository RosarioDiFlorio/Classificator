The meridian 94Â° west of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, North America, the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole.
The 94th meridian west forms a great circle with the 86th meridian east.
In the United States, the meridian runs just east of, and approximately parallel to, part of the border of Texas with Arkansas and Louisiana.
