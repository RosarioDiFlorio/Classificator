Telephone numbers in Vatican City are integrated into the Italian telephone numbering plan: ITU-T has assigned country code +379 to Vatican City, but this is not in use.
Vatican telephone numbers are in the form of "+39 06 698xxxxx", "+39" being the country code for Italy and "06" the area code for Rome (the city surrounding Vatican City). There's no need to dial the country code for calls within Vatican City or between Italy and Vatican City, but the area code must always be dialed, as for any other call within Italy.
The telecommunications provider of Vatican City is the Vatican Telephone Service (part of the Governorateâ€™s Department of Telecommunications since 2002).
