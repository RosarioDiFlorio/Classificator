The A180 is a primary route in northern England, that runs from the M180 motorway to Cleethorpes. The road is a continuation of the M180, but built to lower specifications: it is mainly dual two-lane without hard shoulders. The road is (mostly grade separated) dual carriageway for 15 miles (24 km) from the M180 to Grimsby, and is a single carriageway road for 2 miles (3.2 km) between Grimsby and central Cleethorpes. The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroute E22.
