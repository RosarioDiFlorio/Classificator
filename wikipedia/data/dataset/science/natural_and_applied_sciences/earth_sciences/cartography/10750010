ISO 3166-2:ME is the entry for Montenegro in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.
Currently for Montenegro, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for 23 municipalities.
Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is ME, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Montenegro. The second part is two digits (01â€“23).
Before the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro in 2006, Montenegro was assigned the ISO 3166-2 code CS-CG under the entry for Serbia and Montenegro.
