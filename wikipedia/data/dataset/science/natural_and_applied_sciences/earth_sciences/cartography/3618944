List of airports by ICAO code: A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H - I - J - K - L - M - N - O - P - Q - R - S - T - U - V - W - X - Y - Z

The prefix 'U' is used for Russia and all the former Soviet republics except Moldova (LU), Estonia (EE), Latvia (EV), and Lithuania (EY). Each former Soviet republic or group of them is assigned a 2-character (Ux) prefix, and Russia has 10 prefixes. The only exception is the prefix UM, which, while used for Belarus airports, is also used for a single airport (UMKK) in Russia (in the Kaliningrad Oblast exclave). For this reason, there is a UM second-level section under Russia as well as the first level section UM – Belarus.
Format of entries is:
ICAO (IATA) – airport name – airport location
