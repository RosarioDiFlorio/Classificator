The Snellius–Pothenot problem is a problem in planar surveying. Given three known points A, B and C, an observer at an unknown point P observes that the segment AC subtends an angle 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   and the segment CB subtends an angle 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
  ; the problem is to determine the position of the point P. (See figure; the point denoted C is between A and B as seen from P).
Since it involves the observation of known points from an unknown point, the problem is an example of resection. Historically it was first studied by Snellius, who found a solution around 1615.
