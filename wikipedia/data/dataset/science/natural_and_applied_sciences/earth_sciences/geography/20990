The Maremma is a coastal area of western central Italy, bordering the Tyrrhenian Sea. It includes much of south-western Tuscany and part of northern Lazio. It was formerly mostly marsh-land, often malarial, but was drained and reclaimed as part of the Battle for Land under the Fascist r√©gime of the early twentieth century. Parts were repopulated with people from other regions of Italy, notably the Veneto.
It was traditionally populated by the butteri, mounted cattle herders who rode horses fitted with one of two distinctive styles of saddle, the scafarda and the bardella.
