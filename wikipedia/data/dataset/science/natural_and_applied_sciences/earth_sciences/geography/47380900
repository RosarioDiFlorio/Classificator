After little activity in the 13th and 14th centuries, 15th century Brittany was to see a marked renaissance of carving in stone; it was to be a veritable "golden age" and two main workshops emerged, the "grand atelier ducal du Folgoët", called "ducal" because of the patronage which came from Brittany's ruling family (the atelier was active during the reigns of John V, Duke of Brittany, Francis I, Duke of Brittany, Peter II, Duke of Brittany, Arthur III, Duke of Brittany and Francis II, Duke of Brittany) and the "atelier cornouaillais du Maître de Tronoën". See Listing of the works of the atelier of the Maître de Tronoën.. The work of the atelier ("Le grand atelier ducal du Folgoët") can be broken down into two sections, the so-called "first atelier" active from 1423 to 1468 and the "second atelier" active from 1458 to 1509. The article will deal with each of these two workshops and for ease of reference the first atelier's work has been divided into sections, i.e.work on porches in either granite or kersanton stone, calvaries, flagstones/effigies for tombs (gisant), statues and some miscellaneous items. The second atelier section deals with the porch of the Église Saint-Herbot in Plonévez-du-Faou and the Église at Plourac'h.
