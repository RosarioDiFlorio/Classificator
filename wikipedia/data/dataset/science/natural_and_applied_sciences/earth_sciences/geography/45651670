LocName, an abbreviation of 'Location Name', is a web and mobile application, The application allow users to assign a short, personalized name to their address details and physical map coordinates. The saved names are known as "LocNames". This process allows users to share their address details faster than sharing standard address details. Other users can then search for the desired LocName on one of the apps and use GPS navigation to reach there.
LocName is using a new Reverse Geocoding concept to convert map coordinates to simple names that are easy to remember and share.
