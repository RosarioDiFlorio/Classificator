Champagne-Ardenne (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɑ̃paɲ aʁdɛn]) is a former administrative region of France, located in the northeast of the country, bordering Belgium. Mostly corresponding to the historic province of Champagne, the region is famous for its sparkling white wine, named champagne after the eponymous wine region.
The administrative region was formed in 1956, consisting of the four departments Aube, Ardennes, Haute-Marne, and Marne. On 1 January 2016, it merged with the neighboring regions of Alsace and Lorraine to form the new region Grand Est, thereby ceasing to exist as an independent entity.
Its rivers, most of which flow west, include the Seine, the Marne, and the Aisne. The Meuse flows north.
