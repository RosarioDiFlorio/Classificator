The Caucasus  or Caucasia  is a region located at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is home to the Caucasus Mountains, which contain Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, at 5,642 metres (18,510 ft), located on the west of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The Greater Caucasus mountain range acts as a natural barrier separating Eastern Europe from Western Asia, the latter including the Transcaucasus and Anatolia regions.
The Caucasus region is separated between northern and southern parts â€“ the North Caucasus (Ciscaucasus) and Transcaucasus, respectively. The Greater Caucasus mountain range in the north is within the Russian Federation, while the Lesser Caucasus mountain range in the south is divided between several independent states, namely Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan. The Transcaucasus extends eastwards to the Caspian Sea and northwestern Iran, and extends westwards into northeastern Turkey.
The region is known for its linguistic diversity: aside from Indo-European and Turkic languages, the Kartvelian, Northwest Caucasian, and Northeast Caucasian families are indigenous to the area.
