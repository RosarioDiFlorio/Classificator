A bioregion is an ecologically and geographically defined area that is smaller than an ecozone, but larger than an ecoregion or an ecosystem, in WWF classification scheme. There is also an attempt to use the term in a rank-less generalist sense, similar to the terms "biogeographic area" or "biogeographic unit".
It may be conceptually similar to an ecoprovince.
It is also differently used in the environmentalist context, being coined by Berg and Dasmann (1977).
