Desert greening is the process of man-made reclamation of deserts for ecological reasons (biodiversity), farming and forestry, but also for reclamation of natural water systems and other Life support systems. It is done by various methods. So far only arid and semi-arid desert are meant when using the expression. Icy deserts are considered unsuitable. Desert greening is an important topic as it can help solve global water, energy, and food crises. It pertains to roughly 32 million square kilometres of land.
