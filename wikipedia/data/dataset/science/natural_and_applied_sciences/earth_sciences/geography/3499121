A geographical state vector is a set of data describing exactly where an object is located in space, and how it is moving. From a state vector, and sufficient mathematical conditions (e.g. the Picard-Lindelöf theorem), the object's past and future position can be determined.
A geographical state vector typically will contain seven elements: three position coordinates, three velocity terms, and the time at which these values were valid. Mathematically, if we are to describe positions in a N-dimensional space (

    {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\dot {\mathbf {r} }}=(v_{1}\;v_{2}\;v_{3})^{T}}
   is the velocity vector.
Due to the freedom one has in choosing coordinate systems for position, a state vector may also be expressed in a variety of coordinate systems (e.g. the North east down coordinate system).
