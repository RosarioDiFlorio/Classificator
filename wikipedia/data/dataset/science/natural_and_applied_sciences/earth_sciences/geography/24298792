The four Comoros Islands that lie in the Mozambique Channel between Madagascar and East Africa are a unique ecoregion, the Comoros forests.
These volcanic islands are rich in wildlife with endemic species including four endangered bird species living on Mount Karthala, the large active volcano on Grand Comoro Island. The islands have a wet tropical climate with a rainy season between October and April.
