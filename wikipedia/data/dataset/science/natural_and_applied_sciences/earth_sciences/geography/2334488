Tropical evergreen forests (or tropical rain forests) are usually found in areas receiving more than 200 cm of rainfall and having a monthly mean temperature of 18Â°C or higher in the coldest months. They occupy about seven percent of the Earth's land surface and harbour more than half of the planet's terrestrial plants and animals. Tropical evergreen forests are dense, multi-layered, and harbour many types of plants and animal.
