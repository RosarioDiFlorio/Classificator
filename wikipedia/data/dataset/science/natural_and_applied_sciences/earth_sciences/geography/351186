Palliser's Triangle, or the Palliser Triangle, is a largely semi-arid steppe region in the Prairie Provinces of Western Canada that was determined to be unsuitable for agriculture because of its unfavourable climate. The soil in this area is dark brown or black in colour and is very nutrient-rich. The semi-arid conditions, however, initially made this area difficult to farm.
