The usage of the inter-related terms horizontal and vertical as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions or calculations using a flat earth approximation vs. spherical earth).
In astronomy, geography, and related sciences and contexts, a direction passing by a given point is said to be vertical if it is locally aligned with the local gravity vector at that point. In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.
