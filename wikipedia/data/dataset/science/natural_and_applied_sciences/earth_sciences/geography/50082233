The Comtois steeple is a typical bell tower on Christian churches with an imperial dome in Franche-Comté, France. Nearly 700 Comtois steeples remained in this eastern traditional province.
This kind of steeple is incorporated into the entrance of the churches rehabilited mainly during the eighteenth century after destructions of Thirty Years' Warin the country and French conquest in 1678. The cloister vault with raised sides ("dôme à pans relevés") et the polychrome glazed tiles on the roofs are typical characteristics of this regional church architecture.
