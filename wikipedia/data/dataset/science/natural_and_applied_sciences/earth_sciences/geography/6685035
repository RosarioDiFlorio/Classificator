The Morava Valley (Serbian: Поморавље/Pomoravlje, pronounced [pɔmɔ̝̌raːvʎe̞]), is a general term which in its widest sense marks valleys of any of three Morava rivers in Serbia: the West Morava (Западно Поморавље/Zapadno Pomoravlje), the South Morava (Јужно Поморавље/Južno Pomoravlje) and the Great Morava (Велико Поморавље/Veliko Pomoravlje). In the narrow sense, the term is applied only to the Great Morava Valley. The Serbian term follows the general manner of coining river valley names in Serbian using the prefix po- and suffix -je, meaning literally "(land) along the Morava". Morava valley lies in the central Balkans, at the crossroads which lead eastwards, towards the Black sea and Asia Minor, and further south, down the Vardar river into the Aegean sea.
