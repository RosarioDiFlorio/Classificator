The Tavoliere delle Puglie (Italian: "Table of the Apulias", pronounced [tavoˈljɛːre delle ˈpuʎʎe]) is a plain in northern Apulia, southern Italy, occupying nearly a half of the Capitanata traditional region. It covers a surface of c. 3,000 km², once constituting a sea bottom: it is bounded by the Daunian Pre-Apennines on the West, the Gargano Promontory and the Adriatic Sea on the East, by the Fortore river on the north, and the Ofanto river on the south. It is the largest Italian plain after the Pianura Padana.
The name Tavoliere derives from the Latin term Tabulae censuariae, tables on which the Romans classified the areas devoted to sheep farming or agriculture.
In winter the plain is sometimes subject to floods by the Ofanto and the Fortore, while in summer drought is frequent.
The main centres, from north to south, are San Severo, Lucera, Foggia and Cerignola.
