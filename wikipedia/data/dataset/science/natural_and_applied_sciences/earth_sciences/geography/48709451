The Calestienne (Walloon: Calistinne) is a 130 km long narrow strip in the Belgian region of Wallonia and also in a small part of France, which is mainly formed of limestone rocks and reaches nearly 300 meters in maximum height. Because of erosion it is rich of relief.
The Calestienne is a transitional region between the lower Fagne-Famenne and the higher Ardennes. It stretches from the communes of Fourmies and Wallers-en-Fagne just across the French border till Louveigné in the Belgian province of Liège.
