A waypoint is an intermediate point or place on a route or line of travel, a stopping point or point at which course is changed, first use of the term tracing to 1880. In modern terms, it most often refers to coordinates which specify ones position on the globe at the end of each "leg" (stage) of an air flight or sea passage, the generation and checking of which are generally done computationally (with a computer or other programmed device).
Hence, the term connotes a reference point in physical space, most often associated with navigation, especially in the sea or air—e.g., in the case of sea navigation, a longitudinal and latitudinal coordinate or a GPS point in open water, a location near a known mapped shoal or other entity in a body of water, a point a fixed distance off of a geographical entity such as a lighthouse or harbour entrance, etc. When such a point corresponds to an element of physical geography on land, it can be referred to as a landmark. In air navigation, waypoints most often consist of a series of abstract GPS points that create artificial airways—“highways in the sky”—created specifically for purposes of air navigation that have no clear connection to features of the real world.
