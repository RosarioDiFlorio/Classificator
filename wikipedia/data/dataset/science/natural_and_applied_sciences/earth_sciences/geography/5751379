Terra di Lavoro (Liburia in Latin) is the name of a historical region of Southern Italy. It corresponds roughy to the modern southern Lazio and northern Campania and upper north west and west border area of Molise regions of Italy.
In Italian the name means literally "Land of Work", but in fact derives from the ancient Liburia, a territory north of Aversa which took its name from the ancient tribe of the Leborini.
