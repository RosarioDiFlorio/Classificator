This is a list of terrestrial ecoregions as compiled by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The WWF identifies terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecoregions.
The terrestrial scheme divides the Earth's land surface into 8 terrestrial ecozones, containing 867 smaller ecoregions. Each ecoregion is classified into one of 14 major habitat types, or biomes.
Additional ecoregions for Antarctic Realm are currently being incorporated (based on Terauds et al. 2012). Antarctic Realm - Tundra Biome: 1 North-east Antarctic Peninsula; 2 South Orkney Islands; 3 North-west Antarctic Peninsula; 4 Central south Antarctic Peninsula; 5 Enderby Land; 6 Dronning Maud Land; 7 East Antarctica; 8 North Victoria Land; 9 South Victoria Land; 10 Transantarctic Mountains; 11 Ellsworth Mountains; 12 Marie Byrd Land; 13 Adelie Land; 14 Ellsworth Land; 15 South Antarctic Peninsula.
