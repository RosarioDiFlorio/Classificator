The National Museum of Surveying was originally the Michigan Museum of Surveying, but in 2007, the museum moved to Springfield, Illinois to become a national museum. The museum officially opened in Springfield on September 24, 2010 and closed in January, 2013. In the 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) space, the museum housed many exhibits on surveying, a room sponsored by NCEES, and the Science on a Sphere. The museum was on the Old State Capitol Plaza, just north of the Old State Capitol.
