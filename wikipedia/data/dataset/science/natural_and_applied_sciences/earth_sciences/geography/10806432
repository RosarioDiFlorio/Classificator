In general, an imaginary line is any sort of geometric line that has only an abstract definition and does not physically exist. In fact, is used to identify a map properly.
As a geographical concept, an imaginary line may serve as an arbitrary division, such as a border. It may also be a standardized marking that serves as a measurement or line of reference, such as a circle of latitude or the Prime Meridian.
