The Garfagnana is a historical and geographical region of central Italy, today part of the province of Lucca, in Tuscany. It is the upper valley or basin of the river Serchio, and thus lies between the Northern Apennines' main ridge to the north-east and the Alpi Apuane to the west. It has heavy rainfall and is densely wooded. The principal towns are Castelnuovo di Garfagnana and Barga.
