Annie Montague Alexander (1867â€“1950) was an American philanthropist and paleontological collector. She established the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP), Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ), and financed their collections as well as a series of paleontological expeditions to the western United States at the turn of the 20th century. She took part in many of these expeditions, gathering a significant collection of fossils and exotic game animals in her own right.
