Jules Haime (28 March 1824, Tours – 28 September 1856, Paris) was a French geologist, paleontologist and zoologist known for his research of coral.
After studying medicine in Tours, he focused his energies towards natural history. Subsequently, he relocated to Paris, where he came under the influence of zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards. In 1855 he became a professor of natural history at the Lycée Napoléon in Paris. In January 1856 (several months prior to his death at age 32) he was named vice-president of the Société géologique de France.
