Michael Frogley is a Quaternary palaeoecologist whose research interests currently include:
the use of stable isotope geochemistry to help determine the climatic histories of lake basins;
the analysis of changes in Quaternary palaeobiogeographical patterns of selected invertebrate faunal groups, particularly around the Mediterranean; and
the relationship between rapid-scale climatic change and societal collapse in the Andean highlands of Peru.
He is a member of the ISOMED working group, involved in the analysis and synthesis of Mediterranean isotopic climatic records; he is also a founding member of the ECCUZ working group, concerned with examining the links between Late Holocene environmental and cultural change in the Cuzco region of Peru. In conjunction with Alex Chepstow-Lusy and Brian Bauer, Michael Frogley unveiled "a new approach" to the problem of detailing Incan history by using the evidence deposited by Oribatid mites.
