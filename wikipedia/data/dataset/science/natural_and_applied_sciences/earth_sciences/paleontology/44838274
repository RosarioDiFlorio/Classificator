Lindsay Zanno is an American vertebrate paleontologist and who is an expert in the taxonomy of Therizinosaurs and is known for her innovative use of X-ray computed tomography in reconstructing dinosaurs. She is the director of the Paleontology & Geology Research Laboratory at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science. With Peter J. Makovicky of the Field Museum of Natural History, Zanno excavated a large carnivorous allosaurid dinosaur in Utah, Siats meekerorum, that was unusual because the Neovenatoridae, carnivorous allosaurids, had been unknown in North America.
Zanno received her B.Sc. from the University of New Mexico in 1999, and her graduate degrees from the University of Utah (M.Sc. in 2004, Ph.D. in 2008).
