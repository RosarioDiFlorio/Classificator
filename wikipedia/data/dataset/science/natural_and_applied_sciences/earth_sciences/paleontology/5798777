Louis Antoine Marie Joseph Dollo (Lille, 7 December 1857 â€“ Brussels, 19 April 1931) was a French-born Belgian palaeontologist, known for his work on dinosaurs. He also posited that evolution is not reversible, known as Dollo's law. Together with the Austrian Othenio Abel, Dollo established the principles of paleobiology.
