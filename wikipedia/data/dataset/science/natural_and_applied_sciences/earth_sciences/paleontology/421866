Etheldred Benett (July 22, 1776 – January 11, 1845) was an early English geologist often credited with being the "First Female Geologist". Benett devoted much of her life collecting and studying fossils that she discovered in South West England. Etheldred Benett’s fossil collection was considered one of the largest at the time. She worked closely with many principal geologists of the time and her fossil collection played a part in the development of geology as a field of science. Gideon Mantell, discoverer of the Iguanadon; was so inspired by Benett's work, he named a Cretaceous sponge after her called the "hoplites benettianus" [1]
