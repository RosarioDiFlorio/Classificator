Guido Sandberger (29 May 1821 in Dillenburg â€“ 22 January 1879 in Bonn) was a German paleontologist and geologist. He was the brother of paleontologist Fridolin von Sandberger.
From 1839 he studied natural sciences at the universities of Heidelberg, Marburg, Bonn and Berlin, and after graduation taught classes at the gymnasium in Wiesbaden. From 1847 onward, he was a teacher at the Realgymnasium (grammar school) in Wiesbaden, where in 1853 he was appointed deputy headmaster.
The palaeontological collection of the Sandberger brothers is presently located in the Museum Wiesbaden.
