Kenneth A. Kermack (1919 â€“ 2000) was a British palaeontologist at University College London most notable for his work on early mammals with his wife, Doris Mary Kermack.
Among Kermack's other significant contributions was the observation that Diplodocus could not have had an aquatic lifestyle because sheer water pressure alone on its chest would have prevented it breathing whilst submerged.
He first described the early mammal Aegialodon dawsoni from a molar tooth and the docodont Simpsonodon oxfordensis. He was also interested in astronomy, elected a member of the British Astronomical Association 1966 February 23, a member until his death.
