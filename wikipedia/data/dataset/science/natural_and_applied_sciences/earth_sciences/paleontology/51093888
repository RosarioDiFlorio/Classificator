Ed Landing (born on 10 August 1949 in Milwaukee) is an American geologist and paleontologist. After college (University of Wisconsin, BSc) and graduate school (University of Michigan, MSc and PhD) and post-doctoral positions (University of Waterloo, Ontario; U. S. Geological Survey, Denver; University of Toronto) he spent his career as NYS Paleontologist and Curator of Paleontology at the NYS Museum, Albany, where he became an emeritus in 2015. His field work (eastern US [NY, VT, MA, NJ], western US (UT, NV), Canada [B.C., Alberta, Que., N.B., N.S., NF), Mexico, Argentina, England and Wales, Germany, Israel, Jordan, Siberia) led to 250+ publications and 11 books that focus on the origin and precise U-Pb geochronology of the oldest metazoans, the biostratigraphy of the Early Paleozoic, recognition of ancient climate cycles and the proposal that high sea levels lead to heightened global warming (hyperwarming), and reconstruction of Avalonia as a separate, unified continent by the terminal Ediacaran. He was a co-proposer of the Ediacaran-Cambrian global stratotype at Fortune Head, eastern Newfoundland, the lowest divisions of the Cambrian Period (the Terreneuvian Epoch and Fortunian Age), and recovered Earth's oldest bryozoan from rock sections in Oaxaca State, southern Mexico. At present (2017), all of his publications are posted on ResearchGate.
