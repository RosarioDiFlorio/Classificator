Gregory M. Erickson, Ph.D. in paleobiology at Florida State University.
Erickson has published many papers on the ontogeny and growth patterns of alligators and dinosaurus, especially on the theropod Tyrannosaurus rex. Erickson has also been contributing when naming and describing some dinosaur genera, like Guanlong (2006) and Limusaurus (2009). He is also a strong proponent to the idea of a dinosaurian origin of birds.
