Victor Joseph de l'Isle Thiollière (28 May 1801, Saint-Étienne – 14 May 1859, Lyon) was a French civil engineer, geologist and paleoichthyologist.
He conducted studies of fossils found in the calcareous limestone at the Cerin quarry, located 80 kilometers east of Lyon, from which, he described numerous paleoichthyological species. He is the taxonomic authority of the genera Holochondrus, Spathobatis, Belemnobatis and Phorcynis. The feather star species Solanocrinites thiollieri was named after him by paleontologist Perceval de Loriol.
His family donated his collection of fossils to the Muséum de Lyon, comprising 1702 items primarily from the Rhône-Alpes region, with 699 coming from the Cerin deposit (30 holotypes).
He is credited with creating the first geological map of the Rhône department, of which, he presented to the Société d'agriculture de Lyon, an organization that he became a member of in 1848. He was also a member of the Académie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon (1848–1859) and the Société linnéenne de Lyon (1850–1858).
