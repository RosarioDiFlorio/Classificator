The Leidy Award is a medal and prize presented by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (formerly the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. It was named after US palaeontologist Joseph Leidy. The award was established in 1923 to recognize excellence in "publications, explorations, discoveries or research in the natural sciences", and was intended to be presented every three years. The award consists of a rectangular bronze medal (decorated with a bust depiction of Leidy) and an honorarium which was initially $5000.
