George Olshevsky (born 1946) is a freelance editor, writer, publisher, amateur paleontologist, and mathematician living in San Diego, California.
Olshevsky maintains the comprehensive online Dinosaur Genera List. He is known as the originator of the Birds Came First hypothesis in the descent of birds debate, which states that all dinosaurs are the descendants of small, arboreal and perhaps flying ancestors.
Olshevsky is part of a collaborative effort to recognize and standardize terms used to describe uniform 4-polytopes and uniform polytopes, the analogues of uniform polyhedra in four and higher dimensions.
