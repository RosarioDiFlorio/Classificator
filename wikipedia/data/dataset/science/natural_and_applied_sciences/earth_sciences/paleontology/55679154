Victoria Megan Arbour is a Canadian evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist working out of the University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum. From 2014 to 2016 she studied jointly out of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University. Arbour primarily studies dinosaurs in the group Ankylosauria, including biomechanical analyses of tail clubs. Arbour has studied microfossils from Nova Scotia. She has also named the possible pterosaur Gwawinapterus from Hornby Island, and a partial ornithischian dinosaur from Sustut Basin, both locations in British Columbia. The latter was written as an Honours Thesis supervised by Milton Graves. In 2008 Arbour completed her Master of Science degree entitled "Evolution, biomechanics, and function of the tail club of ankylosaurid dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Thyreophora)". She has participated in the naming of the ankylosaurs Zuul, Zaraapelta, Crichtonpelta,, Ziapelta, as well as resurrecting Dyoplosaurus, and publishing an extensive phylogenetic analysis on the interrelationships of Ankylosauridae.
