Dr Steve Etches MBE is an English plumber, fossil collector, and preparator in Kimmeridge, on the Isle of Purbeck. He was born in 1949 and from an early age he began to find, collect and restore the fossils he found on the Jurassic Coast. His collection is now housed in a purpose-built museum called The Etches Collection, which was purpose built both to house the collection, and to replace the deteriorating local village hall. The Etches Collection is unique in both its focus on the fossils of the Kimmeridge Clay, and in having the collector still actively pursuing new discoveries and carrying out preparatory work on-site. He has won prizes for his palaeontology and was made a Member of the British Empire by the Queen in 2014. On 24 July 2016, Steve Etches was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, from the University of Southampton.
