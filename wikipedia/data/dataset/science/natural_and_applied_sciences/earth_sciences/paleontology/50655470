Dhirendra Kishore Chakravarti (1902 â€“ after 1982) was an Indian geologist and palaentologist, who worked at Banaras Hindu University in the Geological Museum (now part of the Institute of Science).
In 1934, he was the first Indian to describe a species of dinosaur, Brachypodosaurus gravis (now considered dubious). In 1935, he contested the interpretation of Lametasaurus indicus as an armoured dinosaur, arguing that it was a chimera.
In 1982, the Geological Society of India organised a Festschrift in his honour.
