The Micropalaeontological Society (TMS) is a scientific society based in the UK but with international membership, it was founded in 1970 for the promotion of the study of micropalaeontology (the study of microscopic fossils).
TMS is established as a UK registered charity, number 284013, with the objective "to advance the education of the public in the study of Micropalaeontology" and is operated exclusively for scientific and educational purposes. It publishes a journal, special publications and newsletter, organises meetings and makes various awards and grants.
The society is organised into six specialist groups, namely Foraminifera, Microvertebrates, Calcareous Nannofossils, Ostracods, Palynology and Silicofossils. The groups hold separate meetings, including field trips, throughout the year; these were traditionally meetings for UK-based members but have become more international in their scope. For example, the TMS joint Foraminifera and Nannofossil Spring Meeting have taken place in Denmark, France, Germany, Poland and, The Netherlands. The Society holds an annual conference during November each year. The most recent conferences have been held at the British Geological Survey (2012), The Natural History Museum, London (2013), the 2014 meeting will be held at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.
