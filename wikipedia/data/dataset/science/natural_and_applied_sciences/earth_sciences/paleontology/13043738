Mary Julia Wade (3 February 1928 â€“ 14 September 2005) was an Australian palaeontologist, perhaps best known for her work on the Precambrian Ediacaran biota in South Australia.
Mary Wade (1928-2005) was born in Adelaide, South Australia and spent her early life on a property in the northeast of the state. Her family moved when she was seven to Thistle Island in Spencer Gulf where she first became interested in geology. Studying remotely via correspondence, Wade was sent on scholarship to the Wilderness School in Adelaide as a boarder from the age of 13. After she finished school, she undertook a B.Sc. with honours in geology at the University of Adelaide before graduating in 1954. Wade worked as a demonstrator while she undertook her PhD on tertiary aged microfossils, under the supervision of Professor Martin Glaessner.
