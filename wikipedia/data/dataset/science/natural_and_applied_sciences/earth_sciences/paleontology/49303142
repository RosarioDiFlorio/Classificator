The Bighorn Basin Dinosaur Project (BBDP) is a paleontological research and education group focusing on the Mesozoic ecosystems of the Bighorn Basin in northern Wyoming and southern Montana, U.S.A.
BBDP is headquartered in the Bureau of Natural History at the New Jersey State Museum (NJSM) in Trenton, New Jersey, United States, but has welcomed increasing research and educational collaborations with paleontologists from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis, Wyoming, and The Woods Project of Houston, Texas.
