The Untermassfeld fossil site is a palaeontological site in Thuringia, Germany. Excavated continuously since its discovery in 1978, it has produced many fossils dating to the late Early Pleistocene or Epivillafranchian geologic period, approximately 1.2 â€“ 0.9 million years before present (BP). Claims that hominins were also present at the site have sparked a major controversy.
