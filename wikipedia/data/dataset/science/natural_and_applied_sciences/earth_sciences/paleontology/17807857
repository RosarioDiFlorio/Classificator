Tiberius Cornelis Winkler (May 28, 1822 â€“ April 4, 1897) was a Dutch anatomist, zoologist and natural historian, and the second curator of geology, paleontology and mineralogy at Teylers Museum in Haarlem. Besides translating the first edition of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1860), he wrote a great number of works popularising science, particularly the life sciences.
