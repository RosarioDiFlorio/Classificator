Alice Evelyn Wilson, MBE, FRSC (August 26, 1881 – April 15, 1964), was Canada’s first female geologist. As a trailblazer in a male-dominated profession, she faced many challenges, but her scientific studies of the rocks and fossils of the Ottawa region between 1913 and 1963 remain a respected source of knowledge.
