Auguste Courtiller (1795-1875) was a French paleontologist and viticulturist. Muscat de Saumur was first cultivated in 1842 by Auguste Courtiller, who created it by selecting seedlings from a Pinot Noir Pr√©coce vine with open pollination. Courtiller worked in the Jardin des Plantes of the city of Saumur.
As a paleontologist, he described the ammonites species Ammonites cephalotus (syn. of Neoptychites telinga) in 1860 and Kamerunoceras salmuriensis in 1867. He also named the genus Cupulina in 1861.
