Dr Anne Dambricourt-Malass√© (born 1959) is a paleoanthropologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). She has advocated a highly controversial non-Darwinian view of human evolution with theories similar to punctuated equilibrium, auto-organization and dissipative structures, with natural selection not being the exclusive method of evolution.
