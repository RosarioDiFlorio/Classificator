Charlotte Hill (1849â€“1930) was a homesteader originally born in Indiana. Charlotte Hill is most notably recognized for her work collecting valuable fossils within the Florissant Fossil beds, that multiple paleontologists have recognized as significant finds. Florissant fossil bed investigators purchased many quality specimens from Charlotte Hill. The selling of these specimens was one of her side jobs. Her most significant discovery was the Persephone butterfly near Florissant, Colorado. Charlotte's fortunate discoveries brought attention to Florissant as an important location for fossils, and her findings created an impetus for recognition of the fossil beds as a national monument within the United States of America. Many of her collected fossils now reside in the Harvard University museum and the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History. Furthermore, the fossil rose, Rosa hilliae, was named after Charlotte Hill in 1883.
