Peter Wellnhofer (born Munich, 1936) is a German paleontologist at the "Bayerische Staatssammlung fur Pal√§ontologie" in Munich. He is best known for his work on the various fossil specimens of Archaeopteryx or "Urvogel", the first known bird. Wellnhofer's other work includes The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs.
Wellnhoferia, a bird closely related to Archaeopteryx, or a species of the Urvogel itself, was named in his honor.
In 2007 a special meeting of pterosaur experts in Munich was dedicated to Wellnhofer, describing him as "the foremost authority on pterosaurs for the last four decades." The meeting produced a festschrift in his honor titled Flugsaurier: pterosaur papers in honour of Peter Wellnhofer.
