Schultz's rule is a rule by Adolph H. Schultz declaring a relationship between the first tooth eruption of the molar versus the permanent teeth and the progress or aging of its carrier. It states that species that live longer have more wear on deciduous teeth and as a result start replacing them relatively early in life. Which is an indicator for examining fossil data. According to research, Myotragus balearicus follows Schultz's Rule.
