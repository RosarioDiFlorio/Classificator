Madeleine Alberta Fritz (3 November 1896 â€“ 20 August 1990) was a Canadian palaeontologist. She was a professor at the University of Toronto, where she taught vertebrate studies in the department of Geology. Fritz's writing on the fossil Bryozoa and her research on the stratigraphy of Toronto and the surrounding areas were major contributions to the geological field.
As one of the pioneering researchers on the Palaeozoic fossil Bryozoa, a type of sea creatures that bond together to build joint skeletons composed of tiny chambers, Fritz later became known as "the great-grandmother of Palaeozoic Bryozoa".
Fritz worked at The Royal Ontario Museum as an associate director from 1936 to 1955, and then she later became the Invertebrate Palaeontology Curator at the ROM from 1955 to 1957. In 1956, she became a palaeontology professor at University of Toronto under the Department of Geology until her official retirement in 1967. Fritz was a member of the Geological Association of Canada and the Geological Society of America. She also belonged to the Canadian Confederation of University Women and the International Federation of University Women.
