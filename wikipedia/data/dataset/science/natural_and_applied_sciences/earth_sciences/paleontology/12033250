Graham Edward Budd (born 7 September 1968, Colchester) is a British palaeontologist, Professor of palaeobiology at Uppsala University.
Budd’s research primarily has focused on the anatomy and evolutionary significance of Palaeozoic arthropods and in the integration of palaeontology into evolutionary developmental biology. He has also contributed to the theoretical understanding of the role of functional morphology in evolution. Together with Sören Jensen he reintroduced the concepts of stem and crown groups to phylogenetics. Budd was awarded the Hodson Fund of the Palaeontological Association in 2002 and the President's Medal of the Palaeontological Association in 2015.
He has edited Acta Zoologica together with Lennart Olsson; he has also edited the Geological Magazine.
