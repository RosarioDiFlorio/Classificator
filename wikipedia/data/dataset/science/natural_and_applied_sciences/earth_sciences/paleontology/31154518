Yuri Alexandrovich Popov (Russian: Юрий Александрович Попов) (March 5, 1936 – November 16, 2016) was a Russian paleoentomologist, an authority on the taxonomy and evolution of fossil true bugs (Heteroptera) and Coleorrhyncha. He described more than 20 new families and subfamilies and 300 new genera and species from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. He also was one of the founders of the modern higher classification of true bugs: three of seven heteropteran infraorders have been established by him (Nepomorpha Popov, 1968, Gerromorpha Popov, 1971, and Leptopodomorpha Popov, 1971). He was the author of more than 170 publications, including a classic monograph on the evolution of water bugs.
