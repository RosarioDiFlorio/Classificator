Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (28 January 1858 – 16 December 1940, pronunciation: French pronunciation: ​[øʒɛːn dybwɑ], roughly ) was a Dutch paleoanthropologist and geologist. He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of Pithecanthropus erectus (later redesignated Homo erectus), or "Java Man". Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them.
