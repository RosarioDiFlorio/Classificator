Carl Johan Josef Ernst Wiman (1867â€“1944) was a Swedish paleontologist and the first professor of paleontology at Uppsala University. He published on a variety of topics, including extinct penguins, and dinosaur fossils sent to Sweden from China and the San Juan Basin of New Mexico (U.S.A.). He is responsible for naming the genera Helopus (renamed Euhelopus because Helopus was already in use) and Tanius, and the species Pentaceratops fenestratus and Parasaurolophus tubicen. He was also the first to suggest that the hollow cranial crests of lambeosaurine duckbill dinosaurs could be used as a horn-like noisemaker. "Wiman's Law" states that the stolon of dendroid graptolites divides in groups of three: "one branch went into the bitheca, one into the autotheca, and one continued up along the stipe."
He is recognized for his contributions to paleontology in the names of the extinct penguins Archaeospheniscus wimani and Palaeospheniscus wimani, the fossil turtle Dracochelys wimani, the ichthyosaur Wimanius and the sauropod dinosaur Borealosaurus wimani.
