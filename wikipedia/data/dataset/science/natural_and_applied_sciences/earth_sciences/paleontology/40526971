Alexander Bittner (16 March 1850 in Friedland â€“ 31 March 1902 in Vienna) was an Austrian paleontologist and geologist.
Following graduation from the University of Vienna in 1873, he remained in Vienna as an assistant to Eduard Suess. In 1874-76 he conducted geological research in Italy and Greece, followed by an internship at the Imperial Institute of Geology in Vienna (1877). In 1897 he was appointed chief geologist of the institute.
Bittner is known for his stratigraphic-paleontological research of the eastern Alps, especially studies involving brachiopods from the Alpine Triassic Period. He was among the first scientists to study the effects of the Belluno earthquake that occurred in northern Italy on 29 June 1873.
