Charles Emerson Beecher (9 October 1856 â€“ 14 February 1904) was an American paleontologist most famous for the thorough excavation, preparation and study of trilobite ventral anatomy from specimens collected at Beecher's Trilobite Bed. Beecher was rapidly promoted at Yale Peabody Museum, eventually rising to head that institution.

"Quiet, unassuming, modest in a very marked degree, simple, without affectation, entirely free from all eccentricities, conscientious and painstaking in every thing he had to do. In the words of Professor Chittenden, Director of the Sheffield Scientific School '. . . . to those who knew Professor Beecher intimately no words of appreciation will be deemed too extravagant, for close association only brought more clearly to view the many mental traits that testified to the strength of character and of mind that helped to make Professor Beecher one of the strong men of the Scientific School.'
