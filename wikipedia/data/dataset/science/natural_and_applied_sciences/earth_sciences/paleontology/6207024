Irene Crespin (12 November 1896 â€“ 2 January 1980) was an Australian geologist and micropalaeontologist. Irene's interest in geology brought her attention to Frederick Chapman - who was a palaeontologist at the National Museum of Victoria. Irene became his assistant and later replaced his role as a palaeontologist in the Department of the Interior - receiving half his salary, equipment and office space because she was a woman. Crespin began her research by examining and locating fossils across Australia.
