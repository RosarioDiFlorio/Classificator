Paul Julius Menzel (27 April 1864 in Dresden – 2 April 1927) was a German physician and paleobotanist.
In 1889 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Greifswald, afterwards working as a physician in Hainitz Grosspostwitz (from 1889 to 1898). From 1898 onward, he lived and worked in Dresden.
Known for his close association with the Senckenberg museum; after his death, the museum bought a large part of his fossil plant collection — approximately 11,000 items from the Tertiary formation of northern Bohemia.
