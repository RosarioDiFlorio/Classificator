The Environmental Investment Organisation (EIO) is a UK-based not-for-profit body dedicated to researching, proposing and implementing solutions to climate change. It has developed the Environmental Tracking (ET) concept, rebranded by ET Index Research in 2016 to Engaged Tracking, into two separate components known as the ET Carbon Rankings and the ET Index Series. The ET Carbon Rankings rate companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions intensity and transparency. The ET Low Carbon & Fossil Free Index Series, which are based on the rankings, provide investors with a tool to incentivise companies to lower emissions while reducing their exposure to potential future carbon 'price shocks'.
