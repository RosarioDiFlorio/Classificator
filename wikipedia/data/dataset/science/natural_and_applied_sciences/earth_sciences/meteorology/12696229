The VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Studies (VOCALS) is an international field experiment started in 2006 designed by World Climate Research Programme's core project CLIVAR to better understand physical and chemical processes central to the climate system of the Southeast Pacific region. The experiment is organized in two parts: the VOCALS Regional Experiment (VOCALS-Rex), and the VOCALS Numerical Modeling (VOCALS-Mod).
