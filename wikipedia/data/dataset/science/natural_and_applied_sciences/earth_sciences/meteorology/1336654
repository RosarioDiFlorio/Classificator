The MMR06 is a Russian rocket for meteorological experiments, with a length of 3.48 metres and a total weight of 130 kg. The MMR06 rocket was built in two versions: One version had a conical top, the second one, named MMR06-M, had a detachable free flying top, also called dart. The maximum flight height was about 60 - 80 kilometres. Between 1988 and 1992 62 rockets of the type MMR06-M were launched from the former NVA exercise area Zingst, in order to accomplish wind and temperature measurements in the upper atmosphere.
