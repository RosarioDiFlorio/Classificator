A photometeor is a topic in atmospheric optics. These can be bright objects or phenomena appearing in Earth's atmosphere when sunlight or moonlight creates a reflection, refraction, diffraction or interference under particular circumstances. The most frequent are halos, rainbows, fogbows, cloud iridescences (or irisation), glories, Bishop's rings, coronas, crepuscular rays, parhelia, light pillars, mirages, scintillations, green flashes, etc.
Photometeors are not reported in routine weather observation.
