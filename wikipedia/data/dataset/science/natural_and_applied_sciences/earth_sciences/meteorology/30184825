The European Climate Foundation is an international organisation whose aims are to promote climate and energy policies that it says would greatly reduce Europe's greenhouse gas emissions and to help Europe play a stronger international leadership role in mitigating climate change. According to the group, key elements of a sustainable energy future include:
A substantial increase in energy efficiency
A successful transition from conventional to renewable energy
Maintenance of the earthâ€™s ecological systems and the life-supporting services they provide
Equitable distribution of energy services to different segments of the population, both internationally and within nations.
The European Climate Foundation is funded by the Nationale Postcode Loterij, The Arcadia Fund, The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, The ClimateWorks Foundation, The McCall MacBain Foundation, Oak Foundation, The Stordalen Foundation and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
