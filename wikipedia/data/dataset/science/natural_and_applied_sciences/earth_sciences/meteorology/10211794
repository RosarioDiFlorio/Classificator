The Exner function is an important parameter in atmospheric modeling. The Exner function can be viewed as non-dimensionalized pressure and can be defined as:

  
    
      
        Π
        =
        
          
            (
            
              
                p
                
                  p
                  
                    0
                  
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            
              R
              
                d
              
            
            
              /
            
            
              c
              
                p
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            T
            θ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pi =\left({\frac {p}{p_{0}}}\right)^{R_{d}/c_{p}}={\frac {T}{\theta }}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{0}}
   is a standard reference surface pressure, usually taken as 1000 hPa; 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            d
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{d}}
   is the gas constant for dry air; 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{p}}
   is the heat capacity of dry air at constant pressure; 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is the absolute temperature; and 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is the potential temperature.
