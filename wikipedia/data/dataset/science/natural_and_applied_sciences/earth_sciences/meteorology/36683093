The incidence of individual lightning strikes in any particular place is highly variable, but lightning does have an underlying spatial distribution. In 1997, NASA and National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan launched the first Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS)-equipped satellite to detect and record lightning.
Lightning is now known to occur on average 44 (Â± 5) times a second over the entire Earth, making a total of about 1.4 billion flashes per year.
