Whole sky camera - specialized camera used in meteorology and astronomy for photography of the whole sky.
Whole sky camera typically uses a fisheye lens that takes in an extremely wide, hemispherical image. Such lens was originally developed for use in meteorology . However, alternative techniques are common and are based on photography of mirror like hemisphere . One of the first reported whole sky cameras was based on series of pictures with lens inclined to the horizon at an altitude of 45 degrees, with the lens that covers an angular field of 90 degrees, such camera revolves about a vertical axis. .
Another application is that of hemispherical photography to study plant canopy geometry and to calculate near-ground solar radiation.
