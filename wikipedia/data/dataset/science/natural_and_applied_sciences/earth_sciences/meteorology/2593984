Stop Climate Chaos is a climate change coalition of primarily environmental and international development NGOs that was formed in September 2005. The coalition ran the I Count campaign in 2006â€“07 and organised The Wave, a campaign focused on the climatic impacts of energy production which took place on 5 December 2009, in the run up to the UN talks in Copenhagen.
The coalition encourages individuals to lobby the government of the United Kingdom for what they see as positive policies on climate change. From 2005 to 2010 the director of the coalition was Ashok Sinha. There is also a Scottish secretariat called Stop Climate Chaos Scotland.
