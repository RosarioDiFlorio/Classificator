Forensic meteorology is meteorology, the scientific study of weather, applied to the process of reconstructing weather events for a certain time and location. This is done by acquiring and analyzing local weather reports such as surface observations, radar and satellite images, other data, and eyewitness accounts. Forensic meteorology is most often used in court cases, including insurance disputes, personal injury cases, and murder investigations. With increasing losses from severe weather in recent years, the demand for forensic meteorological services has also grown. In the US, many forensic meteorologists are certified by the American Meteorological Society (AMS)'s rigorous Certified Consulting Meteorologist (CCM) program.
