The North American Mesoscale Model (NAM) refers to a numerical weather prediction model run by National Centers for Environmental Prediction for short-term weather forecasting. Currently, the Weather Research and Forecasting Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) model is run as the NAM, thus, three names (NAM, WRF, or NMM) typically refer to the same model output. The WRF replaced the Eta model on June 13, 2006. The model is run four times a day (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) out to 84 hours. It is currently run with 12 km horizontal resolution and with three-hour temporal resolution, providing finer detail than other operational forecast models. The NAM ensemble is known as the Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) and runs out 87 hours.
