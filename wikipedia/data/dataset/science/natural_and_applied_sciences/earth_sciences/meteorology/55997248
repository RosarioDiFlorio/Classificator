The micro/meso-climatic oasis effect describes the local cooling effect of water evaporation due to heat advection when a source of moisture (lake, stream, source, vegetation cover) exists in an otherwise arid area. It derives its name from the same phenomenon in desert oases.
The oasis effect can be put to use in urban planning to counteract adverse climatic conditions in urban environments, e.g. the heat island effect.
