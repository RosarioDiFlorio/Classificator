Cirrocumulus lacunosus is a type of cirrocumulus cloud. The name cirrocumulus lacunosus is derived from Latin, meaning "full of hollows". Cirrocumulus lacunosus is a relatively rare cloud form that occurs as a layer of cloud with circular holes in it. These holes normally have frayed edges, and they are often arranged in a manner that resembles a net or a honeycomb.
