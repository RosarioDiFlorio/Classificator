The Minuano is a cold wind that blows in the South of Brazil and in Uruguay. It is widely mentioned in the Gaúcho folklore of the region. This wind originates from cold polar fronts that come from the South west of South America during periods of high atmospheric pressure, usually following rains caused by the shock of the cold front with warmer stationary humid air. Some times it produces a "howling" sound.
"Minuano (Six Eight)" is a song title by the Pat Metheny Group on the album Still Life (Talking).
Jazz singer Kurt Elling also did a vocalese version of this same song as the leading cut on his "Man In The Air" album.
Composer, arranger and trombonist Bob Curnow performed a version of "Minuano (Six Eight)" on the album, "Bob Curnow’s L.A. Big Band Plays The Music of Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays".
"Minuano" was the codename of one of the characters from the video game Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Jetstream Sam, who is also of Brazilian descent.
