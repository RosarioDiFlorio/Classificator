The European Storm Forecast Experiment, known as ESTOFEX, is an initiative of a team of European meteorologists, and students in meteorology founded in 2002. It serves as a platform for exchange of knowledge about forecasting severe convective storms in Europe and elsewhere. It is a voluntary organisation and is currently unfunded. It aims to raise awareness and provide real-time education about severe weather forecasting. It issues storm warnings on a daily basis. It also collects reports from the general public about severe convective weather incidents in order to validate its forecasts. ESTOFEX forecasts are published under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 license.
Its definitions of severe convective weather phenomena are one or several of the following :
severe:
hail with a diameter of at least 2.0 cm
tornado
wind gusts with a speed of at least 25 m/s (92 km/h or about 48.6 knots)

extremely severe :

wind gusts with a speed of at least 33 m/s (about 119 km/h or 65 knots)
