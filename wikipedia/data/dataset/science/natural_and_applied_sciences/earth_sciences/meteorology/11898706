Milieudefensie (Dutch for "environmental defense") is a Dutch environmental organization, founded on January 6, 1971, by a group of scientists in response to a report by the Club of Rome. It still performs research and brings out its own reports (sometimes requested by the government) but has also developed into an action group, often operating together with other organizations, such as the political party GreenLeft, and is the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth. Milieudefensie is part of the 30 national organisations that Friends of the Earth Europe represents and unites at the European level.
Milieudefensie has approximately 90,000 members and focuses on five main themes:
Globalization
Transportation
Climate and energy
Landscape
Agriculture and food
