Cumulus mediocris is a low to middle level cloud with some vertical extent (Family D1) of the genus cumulus, larger in vertical development than cumulus humilis. It also may exhibit small protuberances from the top. It may or may not show the cauliflower form characteristic of cumulus clouds. These clouds don't generally produce precipitation of more than very light intensity, but may further advance into clouds such as cumulus congestus and Cumulonimbus, which do.
