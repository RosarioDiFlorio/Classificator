The Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch was a period of unusually cold climate in the North Atlantic region, lasting from about 1800 BC to about 1500 BC. It was followed by the Bronze Age Optimum (1500â€”900 BC).

During that epoch, a series of severe volcanic eruptions occurred, including Mount Vesuvius (Avellino eruption, about 1660 BC), Mount Aniakchak (about 1645 BC), and Thera (Minoan eruption, about 1620 BC).
