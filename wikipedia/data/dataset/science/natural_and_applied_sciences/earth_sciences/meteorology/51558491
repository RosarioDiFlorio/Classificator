Climate-Alliance Germany (German: Klima-Allianz Deutschland) is a network of 110 civil society organizations, including environment groups, development groups, trade unions, and consumer associations. Founded in 2007, the aim of the Alliance is to provide a common front to apply pressure to German decision-makers to adopt climate protection measures. Prominent members include WWF, BUND (or Friends of the Earth Germany), and IG BAU (a multi-sector trade union).
A key issue for the Alliance is the prevention of new coal-fired power plants (the Anti-Coal Campaign). The Alliance wants the German government to phase-out coal (Kohleausstieg) and promote renewable energy.
