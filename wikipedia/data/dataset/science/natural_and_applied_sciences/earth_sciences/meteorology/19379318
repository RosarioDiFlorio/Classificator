A dry thunderstorm or heat storm, is a thunderstorm that produces thunder and lightning, but most or all of its precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground, and dry lightning is the term which is used to refer to lightning strikes occurring in this situation. Both are so common in the American West that they are sometimes used interchangeably. The latter term is a technical misnomer since lightning itself is neither wet nor dry.
Dry thunderstorms occur essentially in dry conditions, and their lightning is a major cause of wildfires. Because of that, the National Weather Service, and other agencies around the world, issue forecasts for its likelihood over large areas.
