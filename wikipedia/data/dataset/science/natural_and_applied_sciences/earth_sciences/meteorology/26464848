The wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) is a positive feedback mechanism between the ocean and atmosphere in which a stronger ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux results in a stronger atmospheric circulation, which results in a strong heat flux. It has been hypothesized that this is the mechanism by which low pressure areas in the tropics develop into tropical cyclones.
