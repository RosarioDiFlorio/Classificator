The Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping (CCOM) / NOAA-UNH Joint Hydrographic Center (JHC) was founded in 2000 by Dr. Larry Mayer to find ways to process the massive amounts of data coming from sonar systems at rates commensurate with data collection; that is, to make the data ready for chart production as rapidly as the data could be collected.
The center is located in the Chase Ocean Engineering building on the campus of the University of New Hampshire in Durham, New Hampshire, United States.
The center works on a wide range of marine research topics, including:
Hydrography
Improved bathymetric processing
Improved side-scan sonar and backscatter processing
Data Visualization with emphasis on whale tracking, flow visualization, and mid-water fish
Seafloor characterization
Lidar
Photographic mosaic
Law of the Sea mapping for the United States
Electronic chart of the future and the marine Automatic Identification System
Acoustic positioning and tracking
