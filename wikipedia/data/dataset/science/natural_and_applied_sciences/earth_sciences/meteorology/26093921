He grew up on Long Island, New York and received his B.S. from Cornell University, followed by his M.Sc. from Pennsylvania State University. After graduation, he briefly worked for NASA as a contractor then was hired by the US National Weather Service at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in 1989. Kocin worked as an on-air personality with The Weather Channel from 1998 to 2006.
