A meteorological day refers to the 24-hour period in which all observations for the corresponding day occur. It often refers to the 08.00-08.00 time span (09.00 to 09.00 for summer time). Frequently, though, the corresponding time span is from midnight to midnight (01.00-01.00 during daylight savings/summer time). Daily minimum temperature observations often refer to the 18.00-06.00 (local time) span. That is the case, for instance, in the United Kingdom. Daily maximum temperature observations often refer to the 06.00-18.00 (local time) span. That is the case, again, in the United Kingdom. Daily precipitation observations often refer to the 06.00-06.00 local time span.
