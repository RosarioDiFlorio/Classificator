Father Time (commonly known as Old Father Time) is a weather vane at Lord's Cricket Ground, London, in the shape of Father Time removing the bails from a wicket. The weathervane is a total of 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall, with the figure of Father Time standing at 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m). It was given to Lord's in 1926 by the architect of the Grandstand, Sir Herbert Baker.
Although frequently referred to as 'Old' Father Time in television and radio broadcasts, 'Old' is not part of the official title.
The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the Laws of Cricket: "After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets."
Old Father Time was originally located atop the old Grand Stand. It was wrenched from its perch during the Blitz, when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon, but was repaired and returned to its previous position. In 1992 the weather vane was struck by lightning, and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's television programme Blue Peter. Old Father Time was permanently relocated to the Mound Stand in 1996, when the Grand Stand was demolished and rebuilt.
Father Time was again damaged in March 2015 by the high winds of Cyclone Niklas which required extensive repair by specialists.
In 1969 Old Father Time became the subject of a poem, "Lord's Test", by the Sussex and England cricketer John Snow.
