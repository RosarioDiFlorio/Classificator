The Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS) (Greek: Εθνική Μετεωρολογική Υπηρεσία (ΕΜΥ)) is a government agency responsible for making weather forecasts and observations for Greece. HNMS was founded in 1931 under the Ministry of Aviation and its mission was to cover all the meteorological and climatological needs of the country. It is based at the former Athens International Airport at Elliniko, and operates under the auspices of the Hellenic Air Force, staffed by both military and civilian personnel.
