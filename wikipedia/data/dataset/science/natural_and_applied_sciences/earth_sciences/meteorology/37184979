Save The Climate (Sauvons le Climat) is a French association created in 2004 by Hervé Nifenecker, Roger Balian, Rémy Carle and Bernard Lerouge. In May 2012, five associations are members and thousands of people have signed its manifesto.
Its purpose is to fight against global warming and provide public information on topics fundamental to sustainable development, the environment, and energy, through eliminating the use of fossil fuels in France by maintaining the share of nuclear power generation in parallel with the use of "heat-like" renewable energy.
The association is approved by the French government as a combination of popular education.
