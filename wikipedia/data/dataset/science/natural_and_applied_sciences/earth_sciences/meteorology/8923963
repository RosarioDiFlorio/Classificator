A south wind is a wind that originates in the south and blows north.
Words used in English to describe the south wind are auster, buster (a violent south gale), f√∂hn/foehn (alps), gibli (Libya with various spellings), friagem (a cold south wind blowing into Brazil from the Antarctic), khamsin (a hot spring wind in Egypt, with various spellings), kona (stormy southwest wind in Hawaii), notus (see mythology below for origin) and sirocco (North Africa).
In Native American Iroquois tradition, the south wind is brought by the Fawn, and has a warm and gentle temperament reminiscent of the sweet flowers, babbling brooks, and the voices of birds of summer.
