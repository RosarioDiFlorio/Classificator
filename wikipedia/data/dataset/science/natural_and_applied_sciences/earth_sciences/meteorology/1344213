Nephoscope is an instrument for measuring the altitude, direction, and velocity of clouds. There are several types of nephoscopes:
the comb nephoscope developed by Louis Besson;
the mirror nephoscope developed by Carl Gottfrid Fineman;
the grid nephoscope, a variation on the comb modified by the Norwegians.
Also a type of nephoscope was invented by Mikhail Pomortsev in 1894 in Russia.
The nephoscope is used as a grid to measure the clouds.It is also used to find the movements of clouds.
A ray of light of known velocity is emitted from Nephoscope, which will strike with the base of the clouds. The travel time of the receiving signal is used to get the height of the clouds. As s = vt t1+ t2/ 2
