Geopotential height is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level â€” an adjustment to geometric height (elevation above mean sea level) using the variation of gravity with latitude and elevation. Thus it can be considered a "gravity-adjusted height". One usually speaks of the geopotential height of a certain pressure level, which would correspond to the geopotential height at which that pressure occurs.
