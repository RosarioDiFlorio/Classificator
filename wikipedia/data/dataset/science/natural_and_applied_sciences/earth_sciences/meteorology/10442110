A snow flurry is a term for a light snowfall that results in little or no snow accumulation. The US National Weather Service specifically defines snow flurries as intermittent light snow that produces no measurable precipitation (trace amounts). In contrast, bursts of snowfall which do result in measurable snow accumulation are called snow showers.
