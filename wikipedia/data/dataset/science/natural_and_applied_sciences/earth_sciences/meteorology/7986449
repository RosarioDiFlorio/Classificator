Basic precipitation or Alkaline precipitation occurs when either calcium oxide or sodium hydroxide is emitted into the atmosphere, absorbed by water droplets in clouds, and then falls as rain, snow, or sleet. Precipitation containing these compounds can increase the pH of soil or bodies of water and lead to increased fungal growth.
The principal cause of basic rain is emissions from factories and waste deposits. Mineral dust containing large amounts of alkaline compounds such as calcium carbonate can also increase the pH of precipitation and contribute to basic rain. Basic rain can be viewed as opposite to acid rain. Acid rain has posed a serious threat to numerous ecosystems surrounding rivers, lakes and forests.
