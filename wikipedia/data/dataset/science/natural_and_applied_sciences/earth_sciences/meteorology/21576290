www.meteoalarm.eu is the official website from Europeâ€™s national weather services that will provide advice on exceptional weather. It is intended for anyone travelling through Europe. Pictograms and colour-coded maps of Europe show at a glance where the weather in the next 24 till 48 hours might be, or soon become, dangerous. The level of risk is colour-coded, based on likely damage, disruption and danger.
Thanks to the use of similar and easy pictograms and colour-coding everyone can instantly understand the weather messages, whichever country is involved and whatever language is spoken. Gales, torrential rain, snow and ice, thunder and lightning, fog and extreme temperatures are all indicated, as well as weather conditions that could lead to increased risk, such as storm surges and high waves, forest fires and avalanches. Behind the pictograms there is a link to the current warnings. More detailed information is given on the WebPages of the co-operating weather services. These are easy to visit by clicking on the country and then on the logo of the weather service.
