The WxChallenge is a weather forecasting competition among colleges in North America. The competition is run by the University of Oklahoma. In its first official semester, fall 2006, there were 1,262 participants from 53 institutions. A similar competition, the National Collegiate Weather Forecasting Contest, recently ended, partially due to this competition.
