Climate drawdown is the point at which greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere begin to decline on a year-to-year basis.
Drawdown is a goal for reversing climate change, and eventually reducing global average temperatures.
Project Drawdown is a climate change mitigation project initiated by Paul Hawken and climate activist Amanda Joy Ravenhill. Central to the project is the compilation of a list of the “100 most substantive solutions to global warming.”  The list, encompassing only technologically viable, existing solutions, was compiled by a team of over 200 scholars, scientists, policymakers, business leaders and activists; for each solution the carbon impact through the year 2050, the total and net cost to society, and the total lifetime savings were measured and modelled.

Paul Hawken has edited the book Drawdown: The most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming to support the Project.
82 of the 100 solutions to global warming that are both available and scaling today, are displayed in “The Periodic Table of Climate Solutions.”
