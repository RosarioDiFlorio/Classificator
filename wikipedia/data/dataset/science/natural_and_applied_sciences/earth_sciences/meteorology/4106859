The constant altitude plan position indicator, better known as CAPPI, is a radar display which gives a horizontal cross-section of data at constant altitude. It has been developed by McGill University in Montreal by the Stormy Weather Group to circumvent some problems with the PPI:
Altitude changing with distance to the radar.
Ground echoes problems near the radar.
