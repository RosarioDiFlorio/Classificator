The Tropical Easterly Jet is the meteorological term referring to an upper level easterly wind that starts in late June and continues until early September. This strong flow of air that develops in the upper atmosphere during the Asian monsoon is centred on 15°N, 50-80°E and extends from South-East Asia to Africa. The strongest development of the jet is at about 15 km above the Earth's surface with wind speeds of up to 40 m/s over the Indian Ocean.
