A Climate Data Record (CDR) is a specific definition of a climate data series, developed by the Committee on Climate Data Records from NOAA Operational Satellites of the National Research Council at the request of NOAA in the context of satellite records. It is defined as "a time series of measurements of sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to determine climate variability and change.".
Such measurements provide an objective basis for the understanding and prediction of climate and its variability, such as global warming.
