Misoscale is an unofficial scale of meteorological phenomena that ranges in size from 40 meters to about 4 kilometers. This scale was proposed by Ted Fujita, the father of the Fujita scale, to classify phenomenon of the order of the rotation within a thunderstorm, the scale of the funnel cloud of a tornado, and the size of the swath of destruction of a microburst. It is a subdivision of the microscale.
