Convective momentum transport is an atmospheric event that involves an exchange of momentum, usually due to vertical motion (convection) associated with clouds.
The essential processes responsible for cloud convective momentum transport in the tropics are:
The vertical momentum advection due to subsidence of environmental air compensating cloud mass flux.
The detrainment of excess momentum from clouds.
The convection induced pressure gradient force.
