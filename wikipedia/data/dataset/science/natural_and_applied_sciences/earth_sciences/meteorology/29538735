The Student Switch Off is a campaign that aims to encourage students to save energy when living in University halls of residence. It is run by the National Union of Students.
The campaign currently runs at 35 universities across the UK and 10 Universities across Europe. In the academic year 2016/17, 26,000+ students pledged their support for energy-saving in their halls of residence.
The scheme concentrates on behavioural change and social marketing to bring about carbon reduction.
In May 2012 the campaign won an Ashden Award (described as the Oscars of the energy-saving world) and in March 2011 won the 'Best Energy Saving Idea' award at the inaugural People and Environment Achievement Awards.
