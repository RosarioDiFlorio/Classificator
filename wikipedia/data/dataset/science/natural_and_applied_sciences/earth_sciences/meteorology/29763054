The Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy (CCCEP) is a climate change research centre in England. It is hosted jointly by the University of Leeds and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
CCCEP is part of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, which is chaired by Lord Nicholas Stern of Brentford, former Chief Economist of the World Bank and author of the widely known Stern Review.
CCCEP was established in 2008, and is funded by the ESRC. Its mission is to advance public and private action on climate change through rigorous, innovative research. In pursuit of its mission, CCCEP has five research themes in its phase 2 programme:
Understanding green growth and climate-compatible development
Advancing climate finance and investment
Evaluating the performance of climate policies
Managing climate risks and uncertainties and strengthening climate services
Enabling rapid transitions in mitigation and adaptation
In October 2016, The Daily mail reported allegations that CCCEP had fraudulently obtained millions of dollars from UK taxpayers by claiming credit for research they did not produce. The organization responded to the claims saying that the alleged fraud was an overreaction to a clerical error.
