The Meteorologische Zeitschrift (English: Meteorological Journal) is a bimonthly international peer-reviewed scientific journal covering research in meteorology and climatology. All papers are published in English since 2000. The journal was established in 1866 by the Österreichische Gesellschaft für Meteorologie. In 1884 a similar journal was established by the Deutsche Meteorologische Gesellschaft. The two journals merged in 1886 and existed until 1944. Following several separate publications after 1945 the journal was reestablished in 1992 as a joint publication of the Austrian, Swiss, and German Meteorological Societies and is published by Borntraeger Science Publishers.
