A Fermi transition or a Gamow–Teller transition are types of nuclear beta decay determined by changes in angular momentum or spin. In the Fermi transition, the spins of the emitted particles are antiparallel, coupling to 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=0}
  , so the angular momentum of the initial and final angular momentum states of the nucleus are unchanged (

        J
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta J=0}
  ). This is in contrast to a Gamow-Teller transition, where the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and antineutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin

  , leading to an angular momentum change

   between the initial and final angular momentum states of the nucleus.
Fermi and Gamow-Teller transitions correspond to two different forms of leading order behavior of the weak interaction Hamiltonian in the non-relativistic limit:

The theoretical work in describing these transitions was done between 1934 and 1936 by Nuclear Physicists George Gamow and Edward Teller at George Washington University.
