Beam's Eye View (or BEV) is an imaging technique used in radiation therapy for the quality assurance and planning of External Beam Radiation Therapy treatments. These are primarily used to ensure that the relative orientation of the patient and the treatment machine are correct. The BEV image will typically contain the images of the patient's anatomy and the beam modifiers (such as jaws or Multi-Leaf Collimators (or MLCs)).
