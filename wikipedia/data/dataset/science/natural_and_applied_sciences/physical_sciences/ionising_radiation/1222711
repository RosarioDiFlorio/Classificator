Daigo Fukuryū Maru (第五福龍丸, F/V Lucky Dragon 5) was a Japanese tuna fishing boat with a crew of 23 men which was contaminated by nuclear fallout from the United States Castle Bravo thermonuclear weapon test at Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954.
The crew suffered acute radiation syndrome (ARS) for a number of weeks after the Bravo test in March. All recovered except for Aikichi Kuboyama, the boat's chief radioman, who died on September 23, 1954, from an underlying liver cirrhosis compounded by a secondary hepatitis C infection. Kuboyama is considered the first victim of the hydrogen bomb and of test shot Castle Bravo. During their ARS treatment, the crew were inadvertently infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions.
