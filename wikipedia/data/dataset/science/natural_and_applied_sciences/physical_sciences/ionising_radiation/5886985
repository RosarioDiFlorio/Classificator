GeoMelt is a process by which dangerous, contaminated material (such as radioactive waste and heavy metals) is mixed with clean soil, a blend of industrial minerals, and/or glass frit and melted to create an extremely hard and leach-resistant glass product. Vitrification immobilizes nearly all of the inorganic contaminants (i.e., radionuclides and heavy metals) present in the initial mixture by incorporation into the glass matrix. Organic wastes in the melt are destroyed by pyrolysis and gaseous contaminants released during the melting process are treated separately.
Developed in 1980 by the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the GeoMelt process is deployed in one of two ways: in-situ (in-place) treatment of buried radioactive and hazardous wastes and In-Container Vitrification (ICV), which is ex-situ treatment where radioactive and hazardous wastes are vitrified in a refractory-lined steel container).
