The Schikorr reaction formally describes the conversion of the iron(II) hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) into iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4).
The basis of this transformation reaction was first studied by Gerhard Schikorr, a German specialist of iron corrosion, in his early works (~1928-1933) on iron(II) and iron(III) hydroxides. The global reaction that Schikorr proposed to explain his observations onto the iron hydroxides conversion, and which later received his name, can be written as follows:
