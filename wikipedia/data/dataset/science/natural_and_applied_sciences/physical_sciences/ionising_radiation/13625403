The Radium Dial Company, was one of a few now defunct United States companies along with the United States Radium Corporation, involved in the painting of clocks, watches and other instrument dials using radioluminescent paint containing radium. The resulting dials are now collectively known as radium dials. The luminous paint used on the dials contained a mixture of phosphorus and radium, a product that the Radium Dial Company named Luna. However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium Dial Company was specifically set up to only paint dials, no other radium processing took place at the premises.
