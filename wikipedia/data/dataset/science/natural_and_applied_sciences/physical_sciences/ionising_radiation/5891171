Hessel de Vries (November 15, 1916 in Annen â€“ December 23, 1959 in Groningen), was a Dutch physicist and professor at the University of Groningen who furthered the detection methods and applications of radiocarbon dating to a variety of sciences. But for his untimely death, he might have been a Nobel laureate. He has been called "the unsung hero of radiocarbon dating" by Eric Willis, the first director of the radiocarbon-dating laboratory at the University of Cambridge.
De Vries became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1956.
