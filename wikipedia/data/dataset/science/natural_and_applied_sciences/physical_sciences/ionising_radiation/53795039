The RBGT-62a was a Geiger counter manufactured in the early 1960s for the Czechoslovak People's Army. It read beta and gamma and had a transistorised circuit. The dial, controls, headphone jack, and probe connector are on the front of the meter, and the battery compartment on the back. The meter body is green lacquered metal, and the probe, aluminium and plastic. They are connected by a connection cable.
