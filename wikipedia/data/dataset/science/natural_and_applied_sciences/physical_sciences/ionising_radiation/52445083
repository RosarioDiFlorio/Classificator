Diamond battery is the name of a prototype battery proposed by the University of Bristol Cabot Institute during their annual lecture held on 25 November 2016 at the Wills Memorial Building. This battery is proposed to run on the radioactivity of waste graphite blocks (previously used as neutron moderator material in nuclear reactors) and would last for thousands of years.
The battery, developed by the University of Bristol, is a betavoltaic cell using carbon-14 in the form of diamond-like carbon as the beta radiation source, and additional normal-carbon DLC to make the necessary semiconductor junction and encapsulate the carbon-14..
Apart from its long life it is also being presented as a means of making the disposal of nuclear waste easier. Some researchers claim that this discovery can lead to “Diamond Age” of battery power.
