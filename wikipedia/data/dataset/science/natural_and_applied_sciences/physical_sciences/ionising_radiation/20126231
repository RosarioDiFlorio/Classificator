A quartz fiber dosimeter, sometimes called a self indicating pocket dosimeter (SIPD) or self reading pocket dosimeter (SRPD), is a type of radiation dosimeter, a pen-like device that measures the cumulative dose of ionizing radiation received by the device, usually over one work period. It is usually clipped to a person's clothing and worn to measure one's actual exposure to radiation. It is now being superseded by more modern dosimeter types such as electronic personal dosimeters.
