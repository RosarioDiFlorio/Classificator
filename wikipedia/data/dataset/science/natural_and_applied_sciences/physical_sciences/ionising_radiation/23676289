Genshin Takano (高野 源進, Takano Genshin, March 15, 1895 – January 4, 1969) was a Japanese lawyer and Home Ministry and Police Bureau government official. He was born in Fukushima Prefecture. He was a graduate of the University of Tokyo. He was governor of Yamanashi Prefecture (1941–1942) and Hiroshima Prefecture from June 10 to October 11, 1945. Following the atomic attack on Hiroshima, Takano took part in the initial rescue work. On October 11, 1945, his term as governor of Hiroshima expired and he was appointed police officer, but was removed from that position in January 1946 by American occupation authorities due to the policy of purging public officials who served during World War II. Later, he worked as a private lawyer.
He died of pneumonia.
