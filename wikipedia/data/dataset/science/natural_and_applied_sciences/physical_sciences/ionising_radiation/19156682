In his 2007 book On Nuclear Terrorism, author Michael A. Levi surveys the issue of nuclear terrorism and explores the decisions a terrorist leader might take in pursuing a nuclear plot. Levi points out the many obstacles that such a terrorist scheme may encounter, which in turn leads to a host of possible ways that any terrorist plan could be foiled.
Professor John Mueller's 2010 book Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism From Hiroshima to Al-Qaeda is an expansion of the same theme.
Michael Levi is a Senior Fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York.
