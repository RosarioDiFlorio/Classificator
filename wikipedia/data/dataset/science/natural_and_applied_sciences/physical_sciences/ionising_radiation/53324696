Potassium–calcium dating, abbreviated K–Ca dating, is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology. It is based upon measuring the ratio of a parent isotope of potassium (40K) to a daughter isotope of calcium (40Ca). This form of radioactive decay is accomplished through beta decay.
Calcium is common in many minerals, with 40Ca being the most abundant naturally occurring isotope of calcium (96.94%), so use of this dating method to determine the ratio of daughter calcium produced from parent potassium is generally not practical. However, in minerals with low calcium content (under 1/50th of the potassium content), this dating method becomes useful. Examples of such minerals include lepidolite, potassium-feldspar, and late-formed muscovite or biotite from pegmatites (preferably of older than 60 Ma). This method is also useful for zircon-poor, felsic-to-intermediate igneous rocks, various metamorphic rocks, and evaporite minerals (i.e. sylvite).
