The Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant is located in Philippsburg in Karlsruhe (district). It is operated by EnBW Kernkraft GmbH.
It houses two units, the first a boiling water reactor (BWR) and the second a pressurized water reactor (PWR).
For the first unit, parts made for the cancelled Wyhl plant were used. The second unit was originally planned to be a BWR as well but plans later changed. Final disconnection for both units was scheduled for 2011 for unit 1 and 2017 for unit 2, but as of 2010 had been changed to 2026 and 2032 respectively.
Following the incident at the Fukushima plant in Japan reactor 1 was closed on 17 March 2011 for a three-month moratorium on nuclear power. The outcome of this moratorium was announced on the morning of 30 May 2011 and Philippsburg-1 was named as a plant that would not be returning to generation at the end of the moratorium.
