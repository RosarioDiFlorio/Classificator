The Office of the United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator was a short-lived independent agency of the federal government of the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The agency was responsible for the placement and long term storage of radioactive waste in the United States. It was created under the auspices of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.
Although the agency was created in 1987, it remained without a head until 1990, when President George H. W. Bush appointed former Idaho Lieutenant Governor David H. Leroy, a Republican, to be the first United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator. In 1993 President Bill Clinton replaced Leroy with former Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings, also from Idaho.
The agency was eliminated in 1995.
