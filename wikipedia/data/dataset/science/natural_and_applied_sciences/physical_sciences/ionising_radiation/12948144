The Nuclear power station Stade (German: Kernkraftwerk Stade, KKS) operated from 1972 to 2003 in Bassenfleth close to the Schwinge river mouth into the Elbe river. It was the first nuclear plant shut down after Germany's nuclear phase out legislation and is currently undergoing the decommissioning process (Phase 2: Deconstruction of larger modules in the containment building).
The station is located at the left bank of the Elbe in Stadersand, a locality of Stade, to the west of Hamburg in Lower Saxony beside another shut down power station Schilling Power Station. The KKS was based upon a light water reactor.
