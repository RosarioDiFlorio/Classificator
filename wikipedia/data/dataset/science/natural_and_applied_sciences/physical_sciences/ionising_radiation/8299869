Dr Alice Mary Stewart, née Naish (4 October 1906 – 3 June 2002) was a physician and epidemiologist specialising in social medicine and the effects of radiation on health. Her study of radiation-induced illness among workers at the Hanford plutonium production plant, Washington, is frequently cited by those who seek to demonstrate that even very low doses of radiation cause substantial hazard. She was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1986.
