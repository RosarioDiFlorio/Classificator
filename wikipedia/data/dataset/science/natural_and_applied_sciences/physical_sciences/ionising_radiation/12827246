The Nuclear power station Oskarshamn is one of three active nuclear power stations in Sweden. The plant is about 30 kilometers (19 mi) north of Oskarshamn, directly at the Kalmarsund at the Baltic Sea coast and with three reactors producing about 10% of the electricity needs of Sweden. All reactors use BWR technology.
Unit 1 has an installed output of 494 MW, Unit 2 664 MW, and Unit 3, the newest reactor block at the facility, has an installed output of 1,450 MW. The nuclear power station Oskarshamn is thereby one of the largest power stations in the Nordic area by production.
Clab, the temporary storage facility for spent nuclear fuel from all Swedish reactors, is also located at the site.
