The Radiological Research Accelerator Facility (RARAF), located on the Columbia University Nevis Laboratories campus in Irvington, New York is a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering biotechnology resource center (P41) specializing in microbeam technology. The facility is currently built around a 5MV Singletron, a particle accelerator similar to a Van de Graaff.
The RARAF microbeam can produce with high accuracy and precision:
70-120 keV/μm alpha particles
8-25 keV/μm protons
0.6 μm diameter focused beam spot
10,000 cells/hour throughput
