A delta ray is a secondary electron with enough energy to escape a significant distance away from the primary radiation beam and produce further ionization", and is sometimes used to describe any recoil particle caused by secondary ionization. The term was coined by J. J. Thomson. Also, Delta rays are entirely unrelated to the family of subatomic particles named delta baryon.
