"The Elephants's Foot" is an extremely radioactive mass of material formed by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. It is named for its wrinkly appearance, resembling the foot of an elephant. Observations determined that it was made up of nuclear fuel, melted concrete, sand, and core shielding that melted and flowed together. Over time, it decomposed, but it will remain radioactive for over 100,000 years.
