A radionuclide identification device (RID) is a hand-held measurement instrument for the detection and identification of radioactive substances. They are used at national borders, by the police and firefighters to localize radioactive sources and determine the radioactive substances they consist of. A RID measures gamma (photon) radiation and optionally neutron radiation. These devices are sometimes named radio-isotope identifying devices (RIID) or handheld isotope identifiers.
Some devices are designed to meet the requirements of the standards ANSI N42.34 and IEC 62327 which describe performance evaluation tests for RIDs.
