Airborne radioactivity was detected in Europe in autumn 2017, starting from the last days of September. The radioactive isotope detected was ruthenium-106 and it was found to be in small quantities (from microbecquerels to a few millibecquerels per cubic metre of air), not significant for the health of the population.
