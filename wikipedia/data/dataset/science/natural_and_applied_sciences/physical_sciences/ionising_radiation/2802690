The National Research Universal (NRU) reactor is a 135 MWt nuclear research reactor built in the Chalk River Laboratories, Ontario, one of Canadaâ€™s national science facilities. It is a multipurpose science facility that serves three main roles. It generates isotopes used to treat or diagnose over 20 million people in 80 countries every year (and, to a lesser extent, other isotopes used for non-medical purposes). It is the neutron source for the NRC Canadian Neutron Beam Centre: a materials research centre that grew from the Nobel Prize-winning work of Bertram Brockhouse. It is the test bed for Atomic Energy of Canada Limited to develop fuels and materials for the CANDU reactor. As well as the world's oldest operating nuclear reactor!
