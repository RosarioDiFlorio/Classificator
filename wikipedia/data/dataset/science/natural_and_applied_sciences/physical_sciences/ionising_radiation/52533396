Alma Clavering Howard Rolleston Ebert (23 October 1913 â€“ 1 April 1984) was a Canadian-born English radiobiologist. She was Joint Editor for many years of the International Journal of Radiation Biology and Deputy Director of the Paterson Laboratories in Manchester. She made a "fundamental contribution to cell biology" in collaboration with physicist Stephen Pelc when they "were the first to ascribe a timeframe to cellular life," creating the concept of the cell cycle. Their nomenclature for the stages of cell replication is used universally and appears in every textbook of biology and pathology.
She married twice after the start of her career but published, and was generally known in the scientific community, under her maiden name.
