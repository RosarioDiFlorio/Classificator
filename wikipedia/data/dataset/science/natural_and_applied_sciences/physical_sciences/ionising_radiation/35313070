Richard Handl (born May 23, 1980) is a Swedish man who experimented with building a breeder reactor in his apartment in Ängelholm, Sweden for 6 months in 2011 with the intention to create a nuclear reaction.
After working in a factory for four years, Handl became unemployed and decided to start a collection of the elements on the periodic table. Out of curiosity he began experimenting with his collected elements to see if he could create a nuclear reaction.
Handl's experiment included the acquisition of fissile material from outside the country, a radiator suitable for transmutation, and instruments to measure the reaction, including a Geiger counter. He spent about $6,000 in materials and equipment. Experiments were done with tritium, americium, aluminium, beryllium, thorium, radium, and uranium, most of which he acquired from foreign companies. One step involved cooking americium, radium and beryllium in 96% sulfuric acid on a stove in order to more easily mix the ingredients; this resulted in an explosion. He kept a blog called "Richard's Reactor" in which he documented the progress of the reactor.
On 22 July 2011 he was detained by the police after having contacted the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) to inquire as to whether his project was legal or not. His apartment was searched, and the radioactive materials as well as his computer were taken by the police. He was released, but is currently suspected for being in violation of the radiation safety act (Strålskyddslagen). He was convicted in July 2014 on the violation of the radiation safety act and the violation of Swedish Environmental Code. A fine of 13,600 kronor was imposed.
