Entombment (also referred to as safe enclosure) of a nuclear reactor is a method of nuclear decommissioning in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a structurally long-lived material, such as concrete, that will last for a period of time to ensure the remaining radioactivity is no longer of significant concern. Entombment is part of one of three various ways to decommission a nuclear power plant including: dismantling, safe enclosure and entombment. Nuclear entombment is the least used of the three options. The use of nuclear entombment is more practical for larger nuclear power plants that are in need of both long and short term burials. Entombment is used as a case by case basis because of its major commitment with years of surveillance and complexity until the radioactivity is no longer a major concern, permitting decommissioning and ultimate unrestricted release of the property.
