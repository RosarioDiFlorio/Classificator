Rainer Kurt "Ray" Sachs (born June 13, 1932) is a German-American computational radiation biologist and astronomer. He and Arthur M. Wolfe were the authors of the Sachs–Wolfe effect, which concerns a property of the Cosmic microwave background radiation. He and Ronald Kantowski were responsible for the Kantowski–Sachs dust solutions to the Einstein field equation. These are a widely used family of inhomogeneous cosmological models.
