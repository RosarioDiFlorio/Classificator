In nuclear physics, the island of stability is the prediction that a set of heavy nuclides with a near magic number of protons and neutrons will temporarily reverse the trend of decreasing stability in elements heavier than uranium. Although predictions of the exact location differ somewhat, Klaus Blaum expects the island of stability to occur in the atomic mass region near the nuclide 300
120Ubn. Estimates about the amount of stability on the island are usually around a half-life of minutes or days, with some predictions expecting half-lives of millions of years.
Although the nuclear shell model has existed since the 1960s, the existence of such superheavy, relatively stable nuclides has not been demonstrated. Like the rest of the superheavy elements, the nuclides on the island of stability have never been found in nature, and so must be created artificially in a nuclear reaction to be studied. However, scientists have not found a way to carry out such a reaction.
With a nuclide graph of protons and neutrons with the third dimension of height being the binding energy, the stability region can be visualized as a valley instead of an island.
