The Deep Geological Repository Project (DGR) is a proposal by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) for the site preparation, construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a deep geological radioactive waste disposal facility for low and intermediate-level radioactive waste (L&ILW). The facility is set to be located on the Bruce nuclear generating station adjacent to OPGâ€™s Western Waste Management Facility (WWMF), within the municipality of Kincardine, Ontario. The facility would manage L&ILW produced from the continued operation of OPG-owned nuclear generating stations at the Bruce, Pickering Nuclear Generating Station and Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Ontario.
The project proposal is divided into two phases - pre-closure and post-closure periods. The pre-closure period would last about 60 years and would include site preparation and construction, operations, and decommissioning. The post-closure period would include a period of institutional control followed by abandonment forever.
