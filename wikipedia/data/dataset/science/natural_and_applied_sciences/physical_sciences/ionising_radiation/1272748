The effect of mobile phone radiation on human health is a subject of interest and study worldwide, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. As of 2015, there were 7.4 billion subscriptions worldwide, though the actual number of users is lower as many users own more than one mobile phone. Mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range (450â€“3800 MHz). Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.
The World Health Organization has categorized electromagnetic fields produced by mobile phones as "possibly carcinogenic", although most studies have found no such association. The effects of the radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) emitted by mobile phones on male fertility and reproductive systems are currently under active debate.
