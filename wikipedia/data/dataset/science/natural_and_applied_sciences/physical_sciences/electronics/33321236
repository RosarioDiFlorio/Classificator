A second screen involves the use of a computing device (commonly a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet) to provide an enhanced viewing experience for content on another device, such as a television. In particular, the term commonly refers to the use of such devices to provide interactive features during broadcast content, such as a television program, especially social media postings on social networking platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. This type of technology is designed to keep an audience engaged in whatever they are involved in. The use of a second screen supports social television and generates an online conversation around the specific content.
