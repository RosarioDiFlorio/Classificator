Pre-charge of the powerline voltages in a high voltage DC application is a preliminary mode which limits the inrush current during the power up procedure.
A high-voltage system with a large capacitive load can be exposed to high electric current during initial turn-on. This current, if not limited, can cause considerable stress or damage to the system components. In some applications, the occasion to activate the system is a rare occurrence, such as in commercial utility power distribution. In other systems such as vehicle applications, pre-charge will occur with each use of the system, multiple times per day. Precharging is implemented to increase the lifespan of electronic components and increase reliability of the high voltage system.
