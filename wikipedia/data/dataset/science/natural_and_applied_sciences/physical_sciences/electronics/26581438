The FeaturePak standard defines a small form factor card for I/O expansion of embedded systems and other space-constrained computing applications. The cards are intended to be used for adding a wide range of capabilities, such as A/D, D/A, digital I/O, counter/timers, serial I/O, wired or wireless networking, image processing, GPS, etc. to their host systems.
FeaturePak cards plug into edgecard sockets, parallel to the mainboard, similarly to how SO-DIMM memory modules install in laptop or desktop PCs.
