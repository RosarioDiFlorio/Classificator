Radio frequency sweep or "frequency sweep" or "RF sweep" refer to scanning a radio frequency band for detecting signals being transmitted there. This is implemented using a radio receiver having a tunable receiving frequency. As the frequency of the receiver is changed to scan (sweep) a desired frequency band, a display indicates the power of the signals received at each frequency.
