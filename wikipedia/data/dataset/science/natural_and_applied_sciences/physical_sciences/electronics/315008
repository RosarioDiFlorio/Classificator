Magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) is a non-volatile random-access memory technology available today that began its development in the 1990s. Continued increases in density of existing memory technologies – notably flash RAM and DRAM – kept it in a niche role in the market, but its proponents believe that the advantages are so overwhelming that magnetoresistive RAM will eventually become a dominant type of memory, potentially even becoming a universal memory. It is currently in production by Everspin, and other companies including GlobalFoundries and Samsung have announced product plans.. A recent, comprehensive review article on magnetoresistance and magnetic random access memories is available as an open access paper in Materials Today.
