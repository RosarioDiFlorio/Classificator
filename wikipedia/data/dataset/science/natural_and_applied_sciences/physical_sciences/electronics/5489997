The Pelena-1 (in Russian means "Shroud") is a Russian ground-based jamming system.
Designed for jamming the AN/APY-2 radar, the primary component of the airborne warning and control system (AWACS), by automatically inducing a jamming frequency on radar carrier frequencies operating in the fast frequency hopping mode. Pelena-1 disrupts the radar capability of detecting targets with RCS of up to 10 - 15 sq.m. The effective jamming range is up to 250 km.
