Jack Donovan Foley (April 12, 1891 â€“ November 9, 1967) was the developer of many sound effect techniques used in filmmaking. He is credited with developing a unique method for performing sound effects live and in synchrony with the picture during a film's post-production. Accordingly, individuals engaged in this trade are called "Foley artists".
He worked on pictures such as Melody of Love (1928), Show Boat (1929), Dat Ol' Ribber, Spartacus, and Operation Petticoat. For his work in Hollywood, Foley received the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Award.
