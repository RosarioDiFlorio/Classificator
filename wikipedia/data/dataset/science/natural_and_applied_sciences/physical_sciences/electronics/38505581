TeraView Limited, or TeraView, is a company that designs terahertz imaging and spectroscopy instruments and equipment for measurement and evaluation of pharmaceutical tablets, nanomaterials, ceramics and composites, integrated circuit chips and more.
TeraView was co-founded by Michael Pepper (CSO) and Dr Don Arnone (CEO) as a spin-out of Toshiba Research Europe in April 2001. The company was set up to exploit the intellectual property and expertise developed in sourcing and detecting terahertz radiation (1 THz= 33.3 cmâˆ’1), using semiconductor technologies. Leading industry proponents of the technology sit on its Advisory Board, and TeraView maintains close links with the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, which was one of the research universities which had an interest in Terahertz techniques. It is also where Professor Pepper, has held the position of Professor of Physics since 1987.
