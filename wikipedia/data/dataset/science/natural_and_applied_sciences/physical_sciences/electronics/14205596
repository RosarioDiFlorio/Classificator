The Shaheen-III (Urdu: شاہین–ااا‎; lit. White Falcon-III) is a land-based surface-to-surface medium range ballistic missile, which was test fired for the first time by military service on 9 March 2015.
Development began in secrecy in the early 2000s in response to India's Agni-III, Shaheen was successfully tested on 9 March 2015 with 2750 km (1700 mi) range, which could enable it all corners of India and reach deep into the Middle East parts of North Africa. This missile, according to a former Director General of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, is designed to reach Indian islands so that India cannot use them as “strategic bases” to establish a “second strike capability.”
The Shaheen program is composed of the solid-fuel system in a contrast to Ghauri program that is primarily based on liquid-fuel system. With the successful launch of the Shaheen', it surpasses the range of Shaheen-II— hence it is the longest-range missile to be launched by the military.
US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 this missile type was not yet operationally deployed.
