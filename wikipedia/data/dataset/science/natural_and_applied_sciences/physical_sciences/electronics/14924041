Cyber electronic warfare (cyber EW) is a form of electronic warfare. Cyber EW is any military action involving the use of electromagnetic energy to control the domain characterized by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to use exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
Cyber EW consists of the following three activities: cyber electronic attack (cyber EA), cyber electronic protection (cyber EP), and cyber electronic warfare support (cyber ES). These three activities are defined as follows:
Cyber electronic attack (cyber EA)
Is the use of electromagnetic energy to attack an adversary’s electronics or access to the electromagnetic spectrum with the intent of destroying an enemy’s ability to use data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
Cyber electronic protection (cyber EP)
Is any means taken to protect electronics from any effects of friendly or enemy employment of cyber EW that destroys ability to use data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.
Cyber electronic warfare support (cyber ES)
Is any action to locate sources of electromagnetic energy from networked systems for the purpose of immediate threat recognition or conduct of future operations.
The four terms suggested above are generated from electronic warfare.
