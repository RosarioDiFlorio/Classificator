Beartooth is a highly specialized radio that communicates with similar devices completely independent of cell phone towers or Wi-Fi signals. It has a variety of features: voice, encrypted text, geolocation, and beaconing, along with SOS broadcast capability for any device in range. Its battery pack can double the current battery life of your phone. The company was co-founded by businessman Michael Monaghan and Kevin Ames, a former smokejumper and telecommunications expert who designed and implemented ad-hoc communication systems supporting backcountry firefighters.
