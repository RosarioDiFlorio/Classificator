A digital lollipop is an electronic device that synthesizes virtual tastes by stimulating the human tongue with electric currents. The device is capable of producing four of the primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Digital lollipops were developed through research led by Nimesha Ranasinghe at the National University of Singapore.
