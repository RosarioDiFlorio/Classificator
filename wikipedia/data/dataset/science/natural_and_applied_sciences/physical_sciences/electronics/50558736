A new class of pulse generator microwave pulse generation microwave pulse generation architecture, the RACE (Rapid Automatic Cascode Exchange) pulse generation circuit, is implemented using low-cost monolithic IC technology and can produce pulses as short as 1 picosecond, and with repetition rates exceeding 30 billion pulses per second. These pulsers are typically used in military communications applications, and low-power microwave transceiver ICs. Such pulsers, if driven by a continuous frequency clock, will act as microwave comb generators, having output frequency components at integer multiples of the pulse repetition rate, and extending to well over 100 gigahertz.
