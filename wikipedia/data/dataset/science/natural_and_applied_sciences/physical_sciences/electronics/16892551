Showco was a sound equipment provider of touring sound reinforcement equipment and services to the concert touring industry. It was based in Dallas, Texas. In 2000, Showco was acquired by Clair Global.
Showco was established in 1970 by Jack Maxson and Rusty Brutsche, and Jack Calmes, and is famous for helping to pioneer post Woodstock-era stadium rock shows by providing state-of-the-art sound equipment for famous acts beginning with Led Zeppelin, Three Dog Night and James Taylor. According to Brutsche:
With Showco equipment and services, the star performers could count on reliable and consistent sound reproduction at different venues. Showco introduced such features as mixing gear and stage monitors to aid the musicians. The equipment was also built to handle rugged touring schedules, outdoor weather conditions and quick assembly and disassembly.
Later forays into stage lighting led to the 1981 formation of sister company Vari-Lite, Inc.
