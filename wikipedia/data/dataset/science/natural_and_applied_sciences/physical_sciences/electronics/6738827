Mobile phone throwing is an international sport that started in Finland in the year 2000. It's a sport in which participants throw mobile phones and are judged on distance or technique. World record holder is Tom Philipp Reinhardt from Germany with a throw of 136,75m.
There are usually four categories in the sport:
Original (also called "Traditional"): an over-the-shoulder throw with the farthest distance winning (best of three)
Freestyle: contestants get points for aesthetics and creative choreography
Team original: up to three competitors have one throw each with their scores added together
Junior: for children aged twelve or younger
The phones used vary not just between events but between competitors, with any phone that weighs over 220 grams being acceptable. At some events, the choice is down to personal preference from those provided by the event organisers, while others provide only one model of phone.
