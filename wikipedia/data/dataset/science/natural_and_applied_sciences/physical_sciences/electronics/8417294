ClearSpeed Technology Ltd is a semiconductor company, formed in 2002 to develop enhanced SIMD processors for use in high-performance computing and embedded systems. Based in Bristol, UK, the company has been selling its processors since 2005. Its current 192-core CSX700 processor was released in 2008, but a lack of sales has forced the company to down size and it has since delisted from the London stock exchange. The company continues to offer its products and technology.
