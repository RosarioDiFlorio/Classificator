A ceibo emulator is an in-circuit emulators for microcontrollers and microprocessors.
These emulators use bond-out processors, which have internal signals brought out for the purpose of debugging. These signals provide information about the state of the processor that is otherwise unobtainable.
Supported microprocessors and microcontrollers include Atmel, Dallas Semiconductor, Infineon, Intel, Microchip, NEC, Philips, STMicroelectronics, and Winbond.
