DC-BUS is technology for reliable and economical communication over noisy DC or AC power lines. The DC-BUS was originally developed by Yamar Electronics Ltd. together with the DC-BUS Alliance, for low cost sub-networks in vehicles, using the battery lines for in-vehicle data communication. The DC-BUS converts the digital input data into phase modulated signals, protected against errors generated by noise over the powerline. On the receiving side, the received signal is demodulated into the original digital data. Gradually it become a popular means of communication in a plurality of applications within aerospace, automotive, solar energy management and lighting. It is also used as an alternative to RS-232 and RS-485 networks in some cases. The common goal for all these applications is reducing wires, saving space, lowering cost and increasing reliability.
