Visual MIMO is an optical communication system. The name is derived from MIMO, where the multiple transmitter multiple receiver model has been adopted for light in the visible and non-visible spectrum. In Visual MIMO, a LED or electronic visual display serves as the transmitter, while a camera serves as the receiver.
