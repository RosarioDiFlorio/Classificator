A frequency divider, also called a clock divider or scaler or prescaler, is a circuit that takes an input signal of a frequency, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            i
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{in}}
  , and generates an output signal of a frequency:

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            o
            u
            t
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              f
              
                i
                n
              
            
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{out}={\frac {f_{in}}{n}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is an integer. Phase-locked loop frequency synthesizers make use of frequency dividers to generate a frequency that is a multiple of a reference frequency. Frequency dividers can be implemented for both analog and digital applications.
