The Valentine One Radar Locator is a combined radar detector and lidar detector designed by Michael Valentine, formerly of Cincinnati Microwave, Inc., and manufactured by Valentine Research, Inc. The detector is notable for its patented warning system, which uses two radar antennas to indicate the number of radar and laser sources or 'bogeys' detected and their relative bearing.
