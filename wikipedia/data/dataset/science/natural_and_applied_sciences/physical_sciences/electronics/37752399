In the electronics industry, embedded instrumentation refers to the integration of test and measurement instrumentation into semiconductor chips (or integrated circuit devices). Embedded instrumentation differs from embedded system, which are electronic systems or subsystems that usually comprise the control portion of a larger electronic system. Instrumentation embedded into chips (embedded instrumentation) is employed in a variety of electronic test applications, including validating and testing chips themselves, validating, testing and debugging the circuit boards where these chips are deployed, and troubleshooting systems once they have been installed in the field.
A working group of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) that is developing a standard for accessing embedded instruments (the IEEE P1687 Internal JTAG standard) defines embedded instrumentation as follows:
Any logic structure within a device whose purpose is Design for Test (DFT), Design-for-Debug (DFD), Design-for-Yield (DFY), Testâ€¦ There exists the widespread use of embedded instrumentation (such as BIST (built-in self-test) Engines, Complex I/O Characterization and Calibration, Embedded Timing Instrumentation, etc.).
