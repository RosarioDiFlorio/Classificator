Automatic test system switching' test equipment allows for high-speed testing of a device or devices in a test situation, where strict sequences and combinations of switching must be observed. By automating the process in this way, the possibility of test errors and inaccuracies is minimized, and only systematic errors would generally be encountered due to such as an incorrect programmed test condition. This eliminates error due to human factors and allows application of a standard test sequence repetitively. The design of a test systemâ€™s switching configuration is governed by the test specification, which is derived from the functional tests to be performed.
A typical test system would involve the connection of input and outputs of the device under test to the test equipment, which is usually controlled by an electronic program generated by a computer or a Programmable Logic Controller.
