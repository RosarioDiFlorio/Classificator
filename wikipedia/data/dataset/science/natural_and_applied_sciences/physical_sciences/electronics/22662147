Onkyo Corporation (オンキヨー株式会社, Onkyō Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer, specializing in premium home cinema and audio equipment, including receivers, surround sound speakers and other portable devices. The word Onkyo translates as "sound harmony". The company started under the name of Osaka Denki Onkyo K.K in 1946 (a company not related to Nippon Denki Onkyo, which became Denon). The current Onkyo Corporation umbrella includes the Integra and Integra Research divisions as well as the main Onkyo brand.
In March 2015, Onkyo purchased Pioneer Corporation's 'Home Electronics Corporation', which makes home cinema amplifiers, Blu-ray players and other AV products. In return Pioneer took a 14.95% stake in Onkyo. The Ohtsuki family remain the largest shareholders of the company with an approximate 26% stake, just above Gibson Brands, with a 16.5% stake.
