Twist-on wire connectors are a type of electrical connector used to fasten two or more low-voltage (or extra-low-voltage) electrical conductors. They are widely used in North America in residential, commercial and industrial building power wiring.
Twist-on connectors are also known as wire nuts, wire connectors, cone connectors, or thimble connectors. One trade name for such connectors, Marrette, is derived from the name of their inventor (see History) and, in Canada, this type of connector is often referred to as a marrette regardless of the actual brand of the product.
In the UK, items similar to those used in North America, but made from ceramic materials, were sold under the brand "Scruit". Such ceramic connectors are currently sold in South Africa under the name "Porcelain Scruits".
