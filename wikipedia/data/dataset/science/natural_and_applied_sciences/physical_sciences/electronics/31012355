General Microelectronics (GMe) was an American semiconductor company in the 1960s.
With Frank Wanlass as director of research and engineering, GMe was the first company to design, fabricate, and sell MOS integrated circuits.
The first MOS chips were small-scale integrated chips for NASA satellites.
In 1964, Wanlass demonstrated a single-chip 16-bit shift register he designed, with an incredible (for the time) 120 transistors on a single chip.
GMe was a 1964 startup that was sold in 1966 to Philco-Ford.
