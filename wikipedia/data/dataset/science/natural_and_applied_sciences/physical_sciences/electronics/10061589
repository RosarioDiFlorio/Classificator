The Portaflex is a line of amplifiers for electric guitars and bass guitars created by Ampeg. Originally designed by Jess Oliver, the main characteristic of the Portaflex is that the head of the amplifier is stored inside the cabinet and flips over when being used. The Portaflex line has many different configurations.
