Falcon is an open source, multi-paradigm programming language. Design and implementation is led by Giancarlo Niccolai, a native of Bologna, Italy and Information Technology graduate from Pistoia.
Falcon translates computer source code to virtual machine instructions for evaluation. The virtual machine is intended to be both a stand-alone interpreter as well as for integration in third-party embedding applications.
A core design consideration for the Falcon programming language is to provide acceptably high performing scripting plug-ins to multi threaded data acquisition, reporting and dispersion applications.
As programming languages go, Falcon design leans more towards conciseness of code and expressiveness than general readability. The Falcon implementation does provide facilities for source level documentation and this documentation may become important as the mixed paradigm potential of Falcon scripting attempts to meet the problems faced with programming in the large.
