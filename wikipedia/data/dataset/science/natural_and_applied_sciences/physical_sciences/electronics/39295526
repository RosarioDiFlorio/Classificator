National Audiovisual Institute (Finnish: Kansallinen audiovisuaalinen instituutti or KAVI) is a governmental bureau under the Finnish Ministry of Education responsible for supervising the distribution of audiovisual content (including video games), advancing media education in Finland and archiving audiovisual material. The agency is tasked with maintaining and developing an online content rating system, training independent classifiers and supervising their operation.
The agency was formed in 2014 as a result of a merger between the National Audiovisual Archive (formerly Finnish Film Archive, established 1957) and the Finnish Board of Film Classification and its short-lived successor Centre for Media Education and Audiovisual Media (2012â€“2014).
