The AN/ALQ-128 Electronic Warfare Warning Set is a countermeasure receiver manufactured by Magnavox and used on the F-15C/D/E. The system, along with the Loral AN/ALR-56C, is used to give the ALQ-135(V), the F-15s automatic countermeasure system, information through radar warning suites that allows it to provide active jamming against enemy radar threats.
