The Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL) is a data collection device manufactured by Texas Instruments and introduced in 1994. The CBL can be used to collect data either in conjunction with a TI graphing calculator, or on its own. Different from programming languages, it consists of a set of commands starting with a colon (:) which are to be executed in existing applications such as the default calculator and the graphical calculation program.
