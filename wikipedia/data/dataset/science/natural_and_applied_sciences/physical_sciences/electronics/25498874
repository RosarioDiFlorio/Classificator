Flex temp is a technique used to reduce noise and engine wear in large airliners by performing take-off at less than full power.
For Airbus and Fokker aircraft the technique is known as flex temp or just flex. Other aircraft may use the terms Assumed temperature thrust reduction, Reduced take-off thrust or Factored take-off thrust.
