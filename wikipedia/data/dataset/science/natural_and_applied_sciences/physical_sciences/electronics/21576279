3D television (3DTV) is television that conveys depth perception to the viewer by employing techniques such as stereoscopic display, multi-view display, 2D-plus-depth, or any other form of 3D display. Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses. 3D TVs are to be discontinued in 2017 due to low consumer demand. LG and Sony were the last manufacturers to build the product. However, only limited 4K TVs with 3D capability still exist.
