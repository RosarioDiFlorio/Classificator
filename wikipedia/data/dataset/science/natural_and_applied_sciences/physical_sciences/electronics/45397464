A System Basis Chip (SBC) is an integrated circuit that includes various functions of automotive electronic control units (ECU) on a single die.
It typically includes a mixture between digital standard functionality like communication bus interfaces and analog or power functionality, denoted as smart power. Therefore SBCs are based on special smart power technology platforms.
The embedded functions may include:
Voltage regulators
Supervision functions
Reset generators,
Watchdog functions
Bus interfaces, like LIN, CAN or others
Wake-up logic
Power switches
The complexity range for SBCs starts with rather simple hardwired devices to configurable state-machine controlled devices, e.g. through a serial peripheral interface.
Various major automotive semiconductor manufacturers offer SBCs.
