The NE612 is an integrated circuit for processing of signals, such as in the transmission of radio signals. It comprises an oscillator and a mixer. It can handle signal frequencies up to 500 MHz and local oscillator frequencies up to 200 MHz. The mixer is a “Gilbert cell” multiplier configuration which provides both a gain of 14 dB and a noise figure of 5 dB at 45 MHz. The IC belongs to a family of the following ICs: NE602, SA602, NE612 and SA612. It is widely used in amateur radio applications, i.e. in the commercial Elecraft products, and the Softrock software-defined radios.
