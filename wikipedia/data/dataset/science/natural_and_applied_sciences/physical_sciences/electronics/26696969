The Atari AMY (or Amy) was a 64-oscillator additive synthesizer implemented as a single-IC sound chip. It was initially developed as part of a larger effort to develop a 16/32-bit workstation known as Sierra, but this project was canceled in 1984. For a time, AMY was slated to be included in updated versions of the Atari 8-bit family, but this did not occur before development of that line was discontinued as well. The technology was later sold, but when the new owners started to introduce it as a professional synthesizer, Atari sued, and work on the project ended.
