The EKV Mosfet model is a mathematical model of metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET) which is intended for circuit simulation and analog circuit design. It was developed by C. C. Enz, F. Krummenacher and E. A. Vittoz (hence the initials EKV) around 1995 based in part on work they had done in the 1980s. Unlike simpler models like the Quadratic Model, the EKV Model is accurate even when the MOSFET is operating in the subthreshold region (e.g. when Vbulk=Vsource then the MOSFET is subthreshold when Vgate-source < VThreshold). In addition, it models many of the specialized effects seen in submicrometre CMOS IC design.
