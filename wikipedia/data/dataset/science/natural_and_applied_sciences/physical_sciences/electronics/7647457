Dokorder was a brand of tape recorder from Japanese electronics company Denki Onkyo, located in ÅŒta, Tokyo (not related to the Onkyo audio company of Osaka, neither to Denon) that included a four-reel transport system called "Dub-A-Tape" capable of feeding two different tapes through the same tape head assembly and, in the process, recording a duplicate of a tape. (The master and blank tapes passed through the same capstan, but through different tape head areas, yielding a Y-shaped tape path reflected in the slots built into the head assembly. Denki Onkyo also supplied a consumer and semi-pro line of reel to reel recorders (including 4 track multitracks) that competed with Tascam/Teac and Sony but ultimately its products were found to be less durable than the competition.

In 1982, Murata Manufacturing acquired 55% shares of Denki Onkyo, and in 1999, the company has been fully merged into Murata.
