An information element, sometimes informally referred to as a field, is a key building block of a wireless message sent between a base transceiver station and a mobile phone or similar piece of user equipment. An information element is often composed of three parts: 1) a type (which corresponds to the label of a field), 2) a value, and 3) a length indicator, though any combination of one or more of those parts is possible. A single message may contain multiple information elements.
The abbreviation IE is found in many technical specification documents from 3GPP. It is not uncommon for a single specification document to contain thousands of references to IEs.
