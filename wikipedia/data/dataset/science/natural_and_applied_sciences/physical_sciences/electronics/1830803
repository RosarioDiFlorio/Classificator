The Motorola 68881 and Motorola 68882 are floating-point coprocessor (FPU) devices that were used in some computer systems in conjunction with the 68020 or 68030 microprocessors. The addition of one of these devices added substantial cost to a computer, but added a floating point unit that could rapidly perform floating point mathematical calculations. In the mid 1980s, this feature was useful mostly for scientific and mathematical software.
