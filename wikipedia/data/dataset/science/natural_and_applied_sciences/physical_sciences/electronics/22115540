A pocket video camera is a tapeless camcorder that is small enough to be carried in one's pocket. Most pocket video cameras resemble mobile phones in shape and size, unlike traditional cameras.
A typical pocket video camera has an LCD screen of at least 1.5", the ability to capture High-definition video (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC) and standard video (or just standard video), at least 128MB of internal memory and a Secure Digital (SD) card extension or at least 4GB internal memory with no SD card slot. Power may be supplied by a proprietary Ni-MH rechargeable battery or 2 standard AA batteries. Dimensions 2.5 x 4.5 x 0.9 in and a weight of 3.8 oz are typical, and a USB connector is usually built-in.
The idea came from camera phones or multimedia phones able to digitally record anything at a moment's notice. Pocket camcorders weigh only from 0.2 to 0.4 lbs and fit neatly into any pocket or purse for ultra portability. Video quality is typically higher than for multimedia phones. Examples include the Creative Vado HD and the Flip Video. The Sony Bloggie MHS-PM5 can shoot video in Full HD and has 4x digital zoom. The Sanyo Xacti PD1 can shoot video in Full HD 1080p at 30fps, with Stereo audio and has 3x optical zoom.
