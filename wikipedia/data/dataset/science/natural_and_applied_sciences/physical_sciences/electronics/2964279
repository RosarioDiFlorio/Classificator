Rotel is a family-owned Japanese manufacturer of high end audio and video equipment: home theater, amplifiers, compact disc players, etc. The company was established in 1961. In the early 1980s Rotel joined the B&W Group forming a strategic alliance with Bowers & Wilkins and later adding Class√© Audio. The company was formed by Tomoki Tachikawa and is currently run by the Nephew, Peter Kao.
The global affiliation between Rotel and the B&W Group dates back to the early 1980s with the establishment of exclusive distribution in North America and several European markets. Over the next 20 years, Rotel appointed virtually all Bowers & Wilkins distributors globally. In 2000 the B&W Group established Rotel Europe in the UK to consolidate all Rotel sales and support activities outside of North America.
Rotel maintains an exclusive network of specialist hi-fi dealers around the world.
