An MP4 watch is a small portable video and music flash-based media player which can be worn on the wrist like a wristwatch. (See MP4 Player for the origin of the 'MP4' moniker.) Most devices are actually functional digital watches as well as being media players. Users can watch video on the LED or OLED color screen and listen to the audio played back over small built-in speakers, earphones, or a wireless headset in the case of Bluetooth MP4 watches.
MP4 watches typically require the user to convert video files to smaller resolution or particular file formats before they can be played back. This led to the development of "MP5" watches that could play all the popular video file formats natively.
MP4 watches are also known as "video watches", "MP4 player watches", and "watch MP4 players".
