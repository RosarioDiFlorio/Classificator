In electronics, the Gilbert cell is a generalized case of an early circuit first used by Howard Jones in 1963, invented independent and greatly augmented by Barrie Gilbert in 1967. It was actually a specific example of what was later even further generalized current-mode approach to analog circuit design, called "translinear" design. The specific property of this cell is that the differential output current is a precise algebraic product of its two, differential analog current inputs.
