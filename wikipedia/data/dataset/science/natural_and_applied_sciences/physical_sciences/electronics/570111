In automotive electronics, Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is any embedded system that controls one or more of the electrical system or subsystems in a transport vehicle.
Types of ECU include Electronic/engine Control Module (ECM), Powertrain Control Module (PCM), Transmission Control Module (TCM), Brake Control Module (BCM or EBCM), Central Control Module (CCM), Central Timing Module (CTM), General Electronic Module (GEM), Body Control Module (BCM), Suspension Control Module (SCM), control unit, or control module. Taken together, these systems are sometimes referred to as the car's computer (Technically there is no single computer but multiple ones.) Sometimes one assembly incorporates several of the individual control modules (PCM is often both engine and transmission).
Some modern motor vehicles have up to 80 ECUs. Embedded software in ECUs continues to increase in line count, complexity, and sophistication. Managing the increasing complexity and number of ECUs in a vehicle has become a key challenge for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Examples of such ECUs include:
Door control unit (DCU)
Engine control unit (ECU) — not to be confused with electronic control unit, the generic term for all these devices
Electric Power Steering Control Unit (PSCU) — Generally this will be integrated into the EPS powerpack.
Human-machine interface (HMI)
Powertrain control module (PCM): Sometimes the functions of the Engine Control Unit and transmission control unit (TCU) are combined into a single unit called the Powertrain Control Module.
Seat Control Unit
Speed control unit (SCU)
Telematic control unit (TCU)
Transmission control unit (TCU)
Brake Control Module (BCM; ABS or ESC)
Battery management system (BMS)
