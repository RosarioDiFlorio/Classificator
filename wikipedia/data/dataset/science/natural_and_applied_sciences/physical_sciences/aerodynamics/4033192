A space dock is a (currently fictional) type of 'dry dock' for spaceships or starships, which would most likely be located in a low planetary orbit. However, concept work has been undertaken on real space dock facilities that could be built with current technology.
In both real-world as well as fictional use, they provide dedicated facilities to repair or build spacecraft, bypassing the need to lift materials from a gravity well (or allowing these materials to be lifted in smaller, more manageable loads), respectively avoiding the need for an existing spacecraft to make a planetary landing for maintenance.
