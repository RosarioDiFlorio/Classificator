In physics, assuming a flat Earth with a uniform gravity field, and no air resistance, a projectile launched with specific initial conditions will have a predictable range.
The following applies for ranges which are small compared to the size of the Earth. For longer ranges see sub-orbital spaceflight. The maximum horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, neglecting air resistance, can be calculated as follows:

where
d is the total horizontal distance travelled by the projectile.
v is the velocity at which the projectile is launched
g is the gravitational acceleration—usually taken to be 9.81 m/s2 (32 f/s2) near the Earth's surface
θ is the angle at which the projectile is launched
y0 is the initial height of the projectile
If y0 is taken to be zero, meaning that the object is being launched on flat ground, the range of the projectile will simplify to:

  
    
      
        d
        =
        
          
            
              v
              
                2
              
            
            g
