Dr. Cheng Xu is a Chinese American aerodynamic design engineer and engineering manager. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and a member of the Technical Committee on Energy and Power Systems, IASTED. He also served as a guest editor of International Journal of Rotating Machinery.
Dr. Xu has made important contributions to the three-dimensional aerodynamic design and turbomachinery research. He is one of the foremost pioneers of the three-dimensional centrifugal compressor impeller, diffuser design, axial compressor blade design, turbine blade, turbine endwall optimization with efficiency and cooling effectiveness, and gas turbine LPT and nozzle optimization in the field of turbomachinery. He has performed advanced aerodynamic research and applied his research results to industry turbomachinery design. He developed a three-dimensional viscous optimization design procedure for industry turbomachinery aerodynamic and heat transfer design. He was one of the pioneers that helped develop high efficiency and wide operating range centrifugal compressor and axial compressor compressors. He has published many papers in peer-reviewed academic journals and refereed conferences. In 2006, Dr. Xu was awarded the 2006 Best Paper Award from ASME for his paper A study of Single Stage Centrifugal Compressor. His papers are also cited widely by many researchers.
