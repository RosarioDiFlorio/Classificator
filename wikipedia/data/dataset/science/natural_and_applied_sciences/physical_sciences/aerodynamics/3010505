Corrected speed is the speed a component would rotate at if the inlet temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at sea level, on a standard day (i.e. 288.15 K).
Corrected speed

          /
        
        
          
            θ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N/{\sqrt {\theta }}}
   can be calculated as follows:

  
    
      
        N
        
          /
        
        
          
            θ
          
        
        =
        N
        
          /
        
        
          
            T
            
              /
            
            288.15
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle N/{\sqrt {\theta }}=N/{\sqrt {T/288.15}}.}
  
Corrected speed is often abbreviated to 
  
    
      
        
          N
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N_{c}}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          N
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N_{r}}
   (for referred speed).
So-called non-dimensional speed 
  
    
      
        N
        
          /
        
        
          
            T
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N/{\sqrt {T}}}
   is proportional to corrected speed:

  
    
      
        N
        
          /
        
        
          
            T
          
        
        =
        (
        N
        
          /
        
        
          
            θ
          
        
        )
        
          /
        
        
          
            288.15
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N/{\sqrt {T}}=(N/{\sqrt {\theta }})/{\sqrt {288.15}}}
  
Nomenclature:

  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   – stagnation (or total) temperature (in kelvins),

  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   – real shaft speed,

  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   – referred temperature.
In relative form, corrected speed, referred speed and non-dimensional speed are all measures of peripheral Mach number.
