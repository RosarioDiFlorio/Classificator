In aeronautics and aeronautical engineering, camber is the asymmetry between the two acting surfaces of an aerofoil, with the top surface of a wing (or correspondingly the front surface of a propeller blade) commonly being more convex (positive camber). An aerofoil that is not cambered is called symmetrical. The benefits of cambering were discovered and first utilized by Sir George Cayley in the early 19th century.
