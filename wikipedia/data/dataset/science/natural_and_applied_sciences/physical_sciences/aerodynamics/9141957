In car design, ground effect is a series of aerodynamic effects which have been exploited to create downforce, particularly in racing cars. This has been the successor to the earlier dominant aerodynamic theory of streamlining. American racing IndyCars employ ground effects in their engineering and designs, similarly they are also employed in other racing series to some extent; however Formula One and many other racing series, primarily across Europe, employ regulations (or complete bans) to limit its effectiveness on safety grounds.
