NACA Report No. 964 - The effects of variations in Reynolds number between 3.0 x 106 and 25.0 x 106 upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of NACA 6-series airfoil sections was published by the United States National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1950. It contained a series of graphs showing the resulting lift and drag of several NACA 6-series airfoil sections from tests performed in a variable-density wind tunnel, in which the Reynolds number (RN) was set at three different values.
