Cruise is a flight phase that occurs when the aircraft levels after a climb to a set altitude and before it begins to descend. 
Cruising usually consumes the majority of a flight, and it may include changes in heading (direction of flight) at a constant airspeed and altitude.
For most passenger aircraft, the cruise phase consumes most of the aircraft's fuel. This lightens the aircraft and raises the optimum altitude for fuel economy. For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft to stay at the cleared flight level. On long-haul flights, the pilot may ask air traffic control to climb from one flight level to a higher one, in a maneuver known as step climb.
