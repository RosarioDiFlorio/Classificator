In aerodynamics, pitch-up is a severe form of stall in an aircraft. It is directly related to inherent properties of all swept wings, and seen primarily on those platforms. Unlike conventional low-speed stalls, pitch-up can occur at any speed, and are especially dangerous when they take place in the transonic; at these speeds the aerodynamic loads can become so high as to break up the aircraft, as occurred in 1964 when a F-105 Thunderchief of the USAF Thunderbirds broke up in mid-air. It can also occur at low speeds, in which case it has been called a Sabre dance, a particularly dangerous behaviour of swept wings that became apparent during the development of the USAF F-100 Super Sabre.
