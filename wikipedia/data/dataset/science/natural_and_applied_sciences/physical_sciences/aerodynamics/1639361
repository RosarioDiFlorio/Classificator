A shock stall is a stall created when the airflow over an aircraft's wings is disturbed by shock waves formed when flying at or above the aircraft's drag divergence Mach number.
A stall is the decrease in Lift to a value below the Weight, and the associated increase in Drag upon the separation of the boundary layer (in this case behind the shock wave).
