An aircraft ground carriage (also "ground power assisted takeoff and landing concept") is a landing gear system connected to the ground, on which aircraft can take off and land without their aircraft-installed landing gear. The technical feasibility of the ground carriage is being investigated by two research groups. In 2013, IATA included the technology into their "Technology Roadmap"; Airbus pursues the concept as part of its "Future by Airbus‚Äù strategy.
