An Air sock is a textile or fabric duct used for draught-free air distribution and delivery of conditioned air as an alternative to traditional spiral or rectangular steel ducts with grilles and diffusers. Fabric ducts are usually cheaper in material cost, and are quicker to install than conventional metal systems.
