LIDAX is a space technology company, founded at the beginning of the year 2000. It designs and manufactures advanced mechanical equipments that form part of complex space flight systems and instruments for Earth observation (EarthCARE, Meteosat), planetary exploration (Exomars), astrophysics instrumentation (James Webb Space Telescope, BepiColombo, Plato, World Space Observatory) and telecom. The activities of the company encompass all aspects, from conceptual design, through integration and testing up to realization; both for satellite and on-ground instrumentation (OGSE & MGSE).
Engineers and technicians represent practically the 90% of the company's personnel. LIDAX also owns a specialized laboratory called SMARTLAB for testing space mechanisms and subsystems. In the Smartlab, the performance of mechanisms can be measured under different environmental conditions, thus, measurement tests with optical metrology can be carried out under vacuum, cryogenic and high temperature environments.
The company is headquartered in Paracuellos de Jarama, near Madrid-Barajas Airport, Spain. It operates next to the Spain's Space Agency Instituto Nacional de TÃ©cnica Aeroespacial (INTA, English: National Institute of Aerospace Technology) and other known space industries such as EADS CASA Espacio.

Since 2014, LIDAX forms part of SUMA Aerospace, a consortium set up with another three companies to become an internationally recognized organization for the design, manufacturing, commercialization and maintenance of electro-mechanical equipments for the aeronautic sector.
