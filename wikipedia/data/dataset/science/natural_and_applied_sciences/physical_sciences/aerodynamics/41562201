Multiple people have covertly sneaked items on to space missions without the knowledge of their superiors. Here is a partial list of those items.
Gemini 3 astronauts in 1968 brought a corned beef sandwich into orbit, which was widely publicized in the media. They were reprimanded by NASA officials.
Soviet Cosmonauts aboard Soyuz 29 in 1978 brought chocolates on board their flight, which scattered in orbit and required two hours to collect.
On December 16, 1965, Walter Schirra discreetly brought a harmonica on board Gemini VI-A and played the song Jingle Bells. The incident marked the first time that a musical instrument was ever played in space and the harmonica is now in the possession of the National Air and Space Museum.
Schirra also reported bringing Scotch and cigarettes onto a Gemini mission without permission.
Edgar Mitchell brought materials on Apollo 14 to conduct unauthorized experiments into extrasensory perception.
