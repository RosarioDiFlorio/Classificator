SpaceOps (also referred to as the International Committee on Technical Interchange for Space Mission Operations and Ground Data Systems) was formed in 1992 to "promote and maintain an international community of space operations experts".
Currently, thirteen space agencies are members of the organization. SpaceOps also has non-space agency members from academia  and industry.
