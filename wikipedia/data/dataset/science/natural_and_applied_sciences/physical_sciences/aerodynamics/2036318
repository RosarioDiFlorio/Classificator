Artur de Sacadura Freire Cabral, GCTE (23 May 1881 – 15 November 1924), known simply as Sacadura Cabral (Portuguese pronunciation: [sɐkɐˈduɾɐ kɐˈbɾaɫ]), was a Portuguese aviation pioneer who in 1922, together with Gago Coutinho (1869–1959), conducted the first flight across the South Atlantic Ocean, and also the first using astronomical navigation only, from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On 15 November 1924, he disappeared while flying over the English Channel, along with his co-pilot, Mechanical Corporal José Correia, due to fog and his shortening eyesight (which never kept him from flying). Although some float remains from his seaplane had been found four days later, the bodies were never found.  A statue dedicated to them is located in Lisbon. Another statue is located in his hometown, Celorico da Beira. He was the granduncle of Portuguese politicians Miguel Portas and Paulo Portas.
