In aviation, coordinated flight of an aircraft is flight without sideslip.
When an aircraft is flying with zero sideslip a turn and bank indicator installed on the aircraftâ€™s instrument panel usually shows the ball in the center of the spirit level. The occupants perceive no lateral acceleration of the aircraft and their weight to be acting straight downward into their seats.
Particular care to maintain coordinated flight is required by the pilot when entering and leaving turns.
