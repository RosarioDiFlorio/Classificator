The Wind Data Generator (WDG) is a wind energy software tool capable of running WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) model to create a wind atlas and to generate wind data at any location, any height of interest for any resolution from 3 km to 10 km.
Before investing in the installation of a meteorological measurement mast tower, wind engineers use the WDG software to generate Virtual Met Masts (VMM) at any area of interest and get 30+ years of hourly wind data (speed and direction). These data can be used to run pre-feasibility analyses and generate conceptual layouts for any wind turbine types. Doing so, site selection & ranking decision-making is based on optimized installed capacity (MW) and capacity factor numbers (MWh/year) even before having on-site mast data. The software has other interesting features (Micrositing, MCP, extreme wind speed analyses...) that can be used to build more profitable wind farms (by reducing uncertainties) over the long-term (IEC standards).
The WDG is used worldwide to bring confidence on the project feasibility at the very early stages of project development in terms of both “quantity” (wind speed) and “quality” (shear, turbulence, inflow angles) of the wind.
