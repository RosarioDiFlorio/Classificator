In fluid mechanics the term static pressure has several uses:
In the design and operation of aircraft, static pressure is the air pressure in the aircraft’s static pressure system.
In fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure in preference to just pressure to avoid ambiguity. Often however, the word ‘static’ may be dropped and in that usage pressure is the same as static pressure at a nominated point in a fluid.
The term static pressure is also used by some authors in fluid statics.
