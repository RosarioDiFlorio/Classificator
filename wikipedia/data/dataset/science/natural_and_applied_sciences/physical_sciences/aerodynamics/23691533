A trickle vent is a very small opening in a window or other building envelope component to allow small amounts of ventilation in spaces intended to be naturally ventilated when major elements of the design - windows, doors, etc., are otherwise closed. Trickle vents are used extensively in the UK and Europe and are integrated into window frames to provide minimum ventilation requirements for naturally ventilated spaces.
