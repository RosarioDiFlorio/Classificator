NASA Robotic Mining Competition (NASA RMC) is a competition established in 2010 for university students to build a mining robot that is designed to navigate on the Martian surface. One team per school is allowed to compete and around 50 schools compete each year. The teams should compose of at least 2 undergraduate students and graduate students who are enrolled in the current school year. The teams also need to include a current faculty member or advisor. There is no limit to the number of members but NASA advises the teams to have a sufficient and manageable size. While the competition is focused on graduate and undergraduate students from four year institutions, invitations are also extended to teams from community colleges. The latest (eighth annual) competition, in May 2017, resulted in the team from the University of Alabama, Alabama Astrobotics, winning for the third consecutive year.
