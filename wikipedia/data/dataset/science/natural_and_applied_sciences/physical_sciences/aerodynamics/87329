A rocket launch is the takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket. Launches for orbital spaceflights, or launches into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform or from an airplane.
Launches of suborbital flights (including missile launches), can also be from:
a missile silo
a mobile launcher vehicle
a submarine
air launch:
from a plane (e.g. Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne, Pegasus Rocket, X-15)
from a balloon (Rockoon, da Vinci Project (under development))

a surface ship (Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System) or ocean based platform (Sea Launch)
an inclined rail (e.g. rocket sled launch)
Launches not into space can also be from:
the shoulder
A skyrocket is launched from some stand.
"Rocket launch technologies" generally refers to the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle, not just the vehicle itself, but also the firing control systems, ground control station, launch pad, and tracking stations needed for a successful launch and/or recovery.
