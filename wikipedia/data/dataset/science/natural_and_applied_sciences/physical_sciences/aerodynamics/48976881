Orion is a series of American Solid-fuel rocket stages, developed and manufactured by Alliant Techsystems (now Orbital ATK). They were originally developed for use as all three stages on the Pegasus rocket, first flown in 1990. Orion is available in several configurations for a variety of use scenarios. All stages in this family are fueled by a mixture of QDL-1, HTPB, and 19% aluminium, with the exception of the yet-unflown Orion 32, which uses QDL-2, HTPB, and 20% aluminium.
