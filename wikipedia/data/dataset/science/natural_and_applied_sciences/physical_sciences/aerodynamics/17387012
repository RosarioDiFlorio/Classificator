WAsP (Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program) is a Windows program for predicting wind climates, wind resources, and energy yields from wind turbines and wind farms. The predictions are based on wind data measured at meteorological stations in the same region, or on generalized wind climates derived from mesoscale model results. The program includes a complex terrain flow model, a roughness change model, a model for sheltering obstacles, a wind turbine wake model and a model for the average atmospheric stability conditions at the site. The software package further contains a Climate Analyst for creating the wind-climatological inputs, a Map Editor for creating and editing the topographical inputs, and a Turbine Editor for creating the wind turbine inputs to WAsP. The fundamentals of WAsP and the wind atlas methodology are described in the European Wind Atlas. WAsP is developed and distributed by the Department of Wind Energy at the Technical University of Denmark, Denmark. Current version is WAsP 11.5.
WAsP is used for:
Wind farm production
Wind farm efficiency
Micro-siting of wind turbines
Power production calculations
Wind resource mapping
Wind climate estimation
Wind atlas generation
Wind data analysis
