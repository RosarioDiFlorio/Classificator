The Cora was a digital fire control system designed by Peter Toth and produced by the Swiss company Contraves.
Peter Toth started the design in 1957, and the system was fielded for anti-aircraft fire direction with the Swiss Army in the 60s.
One copy of the system was used at the EPFL for cartography, and was put on display during Expo64. The unit was rediscovered in storage in 2011, and is now on display at the Bolo computer museum, in the Computer Science department of the EPFL.
