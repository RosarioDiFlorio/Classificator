João Ribeiro de Barros (4 April 1900 – 20 July 1947) was the first aviator of the three Americas to make an air crossing from Europe to America, on April 28, 1927, crossing the Atlantic Ocean with the Savoia-Marchetti S.55 hydroplane Jahú. On his flight, he had the company of three others: João Negrão (co-pilot), Newton Braga (navigator) and Vasco Cinquini (mechanic). The four aviators departed from Genoa, in Italy, to Santo Amaro (São Paulo), with stopovers in Spain, Gibraltar, Cabo Verde and Fernando de Noronha, in the Brazilian territory.
