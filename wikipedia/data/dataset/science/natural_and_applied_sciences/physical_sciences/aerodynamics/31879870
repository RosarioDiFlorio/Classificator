A Bernoulli grip uses airflow to adhere to an object without physical contact. Such grippers rely on the Bernoulli airflow principle. A high velocity airstream has a low static pressure. With careful design the pressure in the high velocity airstream can be lower than atmospheric pressure. This can cause a net force on the object in the direction normal to the side with lower local pressure. A Bernoulli gripper takes advantage of this by maintaining a positive pressure at the gripper face compared to the ambient pressure, while maintaining an air gap between the gripper and the object being held.
