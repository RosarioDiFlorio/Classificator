NASA Space Place is an award winning educational website about space and Earth science targeting upper-elementary aged children. Launched in 1998, it was the first NASA website to create content about multiple missions directly for children. It has its own url, and it also serves as the kidsâ€™ portion of the NASA Science Mission Directorate website.
The site includes informative articles, hands-on activities, and interactive web games. In addition to its content geared toward children, there are resources for parents and educators. It was one of the first NASA websites to produce a companion Spanish language site. Space Place is produced by a team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
