Vertical penetration is a scalar measurement of distance, of the maximum altitude an object, most often an aircraft can gain at any particular moment in time, thereby converting all of its energy from kinetic to gravitational potential.
It is worth noting that when listing an aircraft's technical specifications, vertical penetration can be appropriately used in substitution of maximum vertical penetration.
