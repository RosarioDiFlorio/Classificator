The Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel was founded in 1949 after Glenn L. Martin gave a grant to the University of Maryland, College Park. This grant was used to expand the A. James Clark School of Engineering and build Glenn L. Martin Hall. The tunnel has served many clients over the years, conducting over 2000 tests. The tunnel is a low speed wind tunnel participating in testing ranging from automotive to aviation and more. The current director of the tunnel is Dr. Jewel Barlow. The tunnel is an auxiliary resource to the University of Maryland, generating all necessary income to continue operation of the tunnel. They work primarily with external clients interested in developing products with aerodynamics in mind.
