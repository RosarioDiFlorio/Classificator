The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) logo has three main official designs, although the one with stylized red curved text (the "worm") has been retired from official use since 1992. The three logos include the NASA insignia (also known as the "meatball"), the NASA logotype (also known as the "worm"), and the NASA seal.
The NASA seal was approved by President Eisenhower in 1959, and slightly modified by John F. Kennedy in 1961.
