Ballistics by the Inch (often called BBTI) is an ongoing project to test the performance characteristics of a variety of common handgun calibers/cartridges. The initial testing was done in 2008 and tested the velocity of 13 common handgun cartridges as it related to firearm barrel length. In 2009 an additional three calibers were tested and in 2010 and 2011 more calibers were added. Also in 2011 testing was carried out to study the "cylinder gap effect" on the velocity of ammunition shot from revolvers. All testing has been carried out as carefully as possible with no bias toward any particular manufacturer, caliber, or firearm. In November 2008 the BBTI website went online, describing the tests and making the data freely available so that anyone can dig out any particular bit of information they may be interested in. The website underwent a complete redesign in late 2011 with the addition of the 2011 tests.
