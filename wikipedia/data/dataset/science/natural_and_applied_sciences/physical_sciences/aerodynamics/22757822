Offshore wind power or offshore wind energy is the use of wind farms constructed in bodies of water, usually in the ocean on the continental shelf, to harvest wind energy to generate electricity. Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher, and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. Unlike the typical usage of the term "offshore" in the marine industry, offshore wind power includes inshore water areas such as lakes, fjords and sheltered coastal areas, utilizing traditional fixed-bottom wind turbine technologies, as well as deeper-water areas utilizing floating wind turbines.
At the end of 2016, the total worldwide offshore wind power capacity was 14,384 MW. All the largest offshore wind farms are currently in northern Europe, especially in the United Kingdom and Germany. As of 2017, the 630 megawatt (MW) London Array in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Larger projects are in the planning stage, including Dogger Bank in the United Kingdom at 4,800 MW, and Greater Changhua in Taiwan at 2,400 MW.
The cost of offshore wind power has historically been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but costs have been decreasing rapidly in recent years. Auctions in 2016 have reached costs of €54.5/MWh at the 700 MW Borssele 3&4 due to government tender and size, and €49.90/MWh (without transmission) at the 600 MW Kriegers Flak.
