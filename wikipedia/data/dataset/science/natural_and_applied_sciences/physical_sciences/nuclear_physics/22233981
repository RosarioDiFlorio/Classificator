IGNITOR is the Italian name for a nuclear research project of magnetic confinement fusion, developed by ENEA Laboratories in Frascati. Construction (in Russia) is not complete.
The project theory is based on ignited plasma in tokamak. Started in 1977 by Prof. Bruno Coppi of MIT, IGNITOR is based on the 1970s Alcator machine at MIT which pioneered the high magnetic field approach to plasma magnetic confinement, continued with the Alcator C/C-Mod at MIT and the FT/FTU series of experiments.
Compared to the ITER international project, IGNITOR would be much smaller and cheaper: the ITER reactor is 19,000 tons in weight while the IGNITOR is only 500 tons in weight. IGNITOR is designed to produce approximately 100 MW of fusion power (and ITER to produce ~500 MW fusion power).
