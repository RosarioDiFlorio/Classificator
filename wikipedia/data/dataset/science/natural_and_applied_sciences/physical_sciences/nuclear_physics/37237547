Nuclear transparency is the ratio of cross-sections for exclusive processes from the nuclei to those of the nucleons.
If the nuclear cross-section is denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{N}}
   and free nucleon cross-section as 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{0}}
   then nuclear transparency can be defined as
  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          σ
          
            N
          
        
        
          /
        
        A
        
          σ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T=\sigma _{N}/A\sigma _{0}}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{N}}
   can be parameterized in terms of 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{0}}
   as 
  
    
      
        
          σ
          
            N
          
        
        =
        
          A
          
            α
          
        
        
          σ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma _{N}=A^{\alpha }\sigma _{0}}
  .
Therefore, transparency can be expressed as 
  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          A
          
            α
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T=A^{\alpha -1}}
  .
Here nucleon cross-section can be thought of as hydrogen cross-section and nuclei cross-section can be as for other targets.
