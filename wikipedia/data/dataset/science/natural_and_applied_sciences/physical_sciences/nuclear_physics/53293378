Position-specific isotope analysis (PSIA), also called site-specific isotope analysis, is a branch of isotope analysis aimed at determining the isotopic composition of a particular atom position in a molecule. It can be described as the determination of the relative concentration of isotopomers at natural abundance. The first evidence for a deviation from a stochastic distribution was found in 1961 on amino acids whose carboxyl groups were 13C-enriched compared to the rest of the molecule. Since then, several studies have shown that PSIA can give insights into the origin of a given molecule: biosynthetic pathway, mechanism and temperature of formation.
