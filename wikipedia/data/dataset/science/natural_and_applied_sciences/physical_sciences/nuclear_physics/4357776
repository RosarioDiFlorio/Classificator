Neutron backscattering is one of several inelastic neutron scattering techniques. Backscattering from monochromator and analyzer crystals is used to achieve an energy resolution in the order of Î¼eV. Neutron backscattering experiments are performed to study atomic or molecular motion on a nanosecond time scale.
