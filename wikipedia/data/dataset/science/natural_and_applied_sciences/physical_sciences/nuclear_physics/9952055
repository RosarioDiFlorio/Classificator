A helion is a short name for the naked nucleus of helium, a doubly positively charged helium ion. In practice, helion refers specifically to the nucleus of the helium-3 isotope, consisting of two protons and one neutron. The nucleus of the other stable isotope of helium, helium-4 isotope, which consists of two protons and two neutrons, is specifically called an alpha particle.
This particle is emitted in the decay of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen:

According to CODATA, the mass of a helion particle is 5.006 412 700(62) × 10−27 kg.
Helions are intermediate products in the proton-proton chain reaction in stellar fusion.
