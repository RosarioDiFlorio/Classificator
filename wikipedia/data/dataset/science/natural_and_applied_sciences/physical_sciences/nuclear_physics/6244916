A spectral energy distribution (SED) is a plot of brightness or flux density versus frequency or wavelength of light. It is used in many branches of astronomy to characterize astronomical sources. For example, in radio astronomy, an SED with a negative spectral index around âˆ’0.7 would indicate a synchrotron radiation source. In infrared astronomy, SEDs can be used to classify young stellar objects.
