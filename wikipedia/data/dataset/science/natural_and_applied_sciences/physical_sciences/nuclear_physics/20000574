The Tokamak de Fontenay-aux-Roses (TFR) was the first French tokamak, built in a research centre of the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France.
In the years 1973 to 1976, it was the highest-performance fusion device in the world.
It was followed by Tore Supra at Cadarache.
