Sub-Doppler Cooling is a mechanism that can be used to cool a substance to a temperature lower than the Doppler cooling limit. When atoms or molecules are cooled to reach the Doppler cooling limit, the natural decay induced repulsion is balanced with the cooling and trapping force induced by doppler cooling. The substance would meet the case that temperature can't be cooled to lower temperature. There are methods to break the doppler cooling limit and reach the sub-doppler cooling.
The methods to get sub-doppler cooling includes Dark Magneto-Optical Trap, Optical molasses, and Sisyphus cooling.
