Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear (IPFN) (Institute for Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion) is a research unit of Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Lisbon, and a leading Portuguese institution in physics research. IPFN has the status of Associate Laboratory in the thematic areas of controlled nuclear fusion, plasma technologies and intense lasers, granted by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.
IPFN was formally created in January 2008, as a result of the merging between the former research units Center for Nuclear Fusion and Center for Plasma Physics. As of 2015, almost 190 people work at IPFN, of which more than 100 are PhDs.
