Delbr√ºck scattering, the deflection of high-energy photons in the Coulomb field of nuclei as a consequence of vacuum polarization was observed in 1975. The related process of the scattering of light by light, also a consequence of vacuum polarization, was not observed until 1998. In both cases, it is a process described by quantum electrodynamics.
