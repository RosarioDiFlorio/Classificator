The proton radius puzzle is an unanswered problem in physics relating to the size of the proton. Historically the proton radius was measured via two independent methods, which converged to a value of about 0.8768 femtometres (1 fm = 10âˆ’15 m). This value was challenged by a 2010 experiment utilizing a third method, which produced a radius about 5% smaller than this. The discrepancy remains unresolved, and is a topic of ongoing research.
