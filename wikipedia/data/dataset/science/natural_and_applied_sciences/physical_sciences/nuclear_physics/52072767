Proton Computed Tomography (pCT), or Proton CT, is an imaging modality first proposed by Cormack in 1963  and initial experiment explorations identified several advantages over conventional x-ray CT (xCT). However, particle interactions such as multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) and (in)elastic nuclear scattering events deflect the proton trajectory, resulting in nonlinear paths which can only be approximated via statistical assumptions, leading to diminished and substandard spatial resolution. Further experiments were largely abandoned until the advent of proton radiation therapy in the 1990s which renewed interest in the topic due to the potential benefits of imaging and treating patients with the same particle.
