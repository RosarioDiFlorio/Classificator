The proton magnetic moment is the magnetic dipole moment of the proton, symbol Î¼p. Protons and neutrons, both nucleons, comprise the nucleus of an atom, and both nucleons act as small magnets whose strength is measured by their magnetic moments. The magnitude of the proton's magnetic moment indicates that the proton is not an elementary particle.
