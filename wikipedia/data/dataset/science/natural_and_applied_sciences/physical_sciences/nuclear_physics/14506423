In the field of formation evaluation, porosity is one of the key measurements to quantify oil and gas reserves. Neutron porosity measurement employs a neutron source to measure the hydrogen index in a reservoir, which is directly related to porosity. The Hydrogen Index (HI) of a material is defined as the ratio of the concentration of hydrogen atoms per cm3 in the material, to that of pure water at 75 Â°F. As hydrogen atoms are present in both water and oil filled reservoirs, measurement of the amount allows estimation of the amount of liquid-filled porosity.
