In September 2010 Former Energy and Petroleum Ministry PS Patrick Nyoike announced that Kenya aims to build a 1,000 MW nuclear power plant between 2017 and 2022. The projected cost using South Korean technology is US$3.5 billion. Nuclear and renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar and geothermal plants could play a major role in helping Kenya achieve middle income status, as the reduction of carbon emissions becomes a higher priority.
