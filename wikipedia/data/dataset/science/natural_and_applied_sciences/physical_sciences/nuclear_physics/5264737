The decay scheme of a radioactive substance is a graphical presentation of all the transitions occurring in a decay, and of their relationships. Examples are shown below.
It is useful to think of the decay scheme as placed in a coordinate system, where the ordinate axis is energy, increasing from bottom to top, and the abscissa is the proton number, increasing from left to right. The arrows indicate the emitted particles. For the gamma rays (vertical arrows), the gamma energies are given; for the beta decay (oblique arrow), the maximum beta energy.
