TIme-dependent neutronics and temperatures (TINTE) is a two-group diffusion code for the study of nuclear and thermal behavior of high temperature reactors. It was developed by Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich in Germany, formally known as KFA (German: Kernforschungsanlage), to investigate HTGRs in 2D (r-Z) geometry.
