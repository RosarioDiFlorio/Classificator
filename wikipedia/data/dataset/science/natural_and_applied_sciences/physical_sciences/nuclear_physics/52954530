The Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment, or ICSE, was a magnetic fusion energy reactor designed by the UKAEA ("Harwell") design team. It was intended to be the follow-on design to the ZETA, incorporating a high-speed current pulse system that was expected to improve the stability of the plasma and allow fusion reactions to take place. Construction began in 1959, starting with its building known as "D-1", but Harwell's new director expressed concerns about some of the theoretical assumptions being made about the design, the project was canceled in August 1960. Parts that were already built were scavenged by other teams.
