Hypernuclear Physics is the science of hypernuclei, or nuclei which fall under the category of hypernucleus, and their constituents and properties. These nuclei are made of baryons which have at least one hyperon, i.e. a three-quark particle having at least one strange quark in them.
The Hall C  of the Jlab, or the US Jefferson National Laboratory, in Newport News, VA, is currently involved among other international laboratories in research on the hypernuclei.
