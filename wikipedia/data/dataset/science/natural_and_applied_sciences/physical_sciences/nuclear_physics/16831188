In a nuclear reactor, criticality is achieved when the rate of neutron production is equal to the rate of neutron losses, including total neutron absorption and total neutron leakage. Geometric buckling is a measure of neutron leakage, while material buckling is a measure of neutron production minus absorption. Thus, in the simplest case of a bare, homogeneous, steady state reactor, the geometric and material buckling must be equal.
