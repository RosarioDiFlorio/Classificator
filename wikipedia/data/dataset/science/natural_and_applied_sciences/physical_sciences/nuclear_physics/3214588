Charmed baryons are a category of composite particles comprising all baryons made of at least one charm quark. Since their first observation in the 1970s, a large number of distinct charmed baryon states have been identified. Observed charmed baryons have masses ranging between 2300 and 2700 MeV/c2. In 2002, the SELEX collaboration, based at Fermilab published evidence of a doubly charmed baryon (Ξ
cc), containing two charm quarks) with a mass of ~3520 MeV/c2, but has yet to be confirmed by other experiments. One triply charmed baryon (Ω
ccc) has been predicted but not yet observed.
