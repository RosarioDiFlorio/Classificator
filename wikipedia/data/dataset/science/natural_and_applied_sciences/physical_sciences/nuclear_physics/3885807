A deep geological repository is a nuclear waste repository excavated deep within a stable geologic environment (typically below 300 m or 1000 feet). It entails a combination of waste form, waste package, engineered seals and geology that is suited to provide a high level of long-term isolation and containment without future maintenance. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, under construction in the USA, is the only one which actually contains nuclear waste. However, the facility suffered a chemical explosion which led to a serious radiological accident in 2014.
