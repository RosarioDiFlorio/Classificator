Yoshio Shimamoto was chairman of the applied mathematics department at Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1964 to 1975.Shimamoto researched in combinatorial mathematics, the economics of outer continental shelf oil and gas lease sales (on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey), the architecture of supercomputers, and the linking of computers for parallel processing.
During the 1970s, he worked with Heinrich Heesch and Karl Durre on methods for a computer-aided proof of the four color theorem, using computer programs using Heesch's notion of "discharging" to eliminate 4-colorable cases.
Born in Hawaii in 1924, Shimamoto served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps and Strategic Bombing Survey in Japan, during World War II. He died in New Jersey on August 27, 2009.
