Insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (INEPT) is a signal resolution enhancement method used in NMR spectroscopy. It involves the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from spins with large Boltzmann population differences to nuclear spins of interest with low Boltzmann population differences. INEPT uses J-coupling for the polarization transfer in contrast to Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) which arises from dipolar cross-relaxation. This method of signal enhancement was introduced by Ray Freeman in 1979. Due to its usefulness in signal enhancement, pulse sequences used in heteronuclear NMR experiments often contain blocks of INEPT or INEPT-like sequences.
