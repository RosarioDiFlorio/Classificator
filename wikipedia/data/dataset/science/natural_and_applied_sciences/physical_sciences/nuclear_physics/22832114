The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA93) deals with the control of radioactive material and disposal of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom.
On 6 April 2010 the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 came into force. These new regulations repeal, amend and replace much of Radioactive Substances Act 1993 in England and Wales.
