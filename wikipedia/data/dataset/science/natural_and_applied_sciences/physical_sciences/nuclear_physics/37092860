The International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF) (also referred to as Annual Conference on Cold Fusion in 1990-1991 and mostly International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science since 2007) is an annual or biennial conference on the topic of cold fusion. An international conference on cold fusion was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico US in 1989. However, the first ICCF conference (ICCF1) took place in 1990 in Salt Lake City, Utah, under the title "First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion". Its location has since rotated between Russia, US, Europe, and Asia. It was held in India for the first time in 2011.
The conferences have been criticized as events which attract "crackpots" and "pseudo-scientists". However, preserving the conference documents has been said, in 2004, to be a task worth supporting, because the documents "reflect evolution of a unique scientific controversy," especially for historians of science.
