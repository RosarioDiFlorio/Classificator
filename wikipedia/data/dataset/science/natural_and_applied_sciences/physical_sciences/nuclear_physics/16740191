Several theories on the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko were circulated following his death from polonium 210 poisoning on 23 November 2006. Litvinenko was a former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service during the late 1990s who escaped prosecution in Russia and later received a political asylum in Great Britain. Litvinenko wrote two books throughout his career, Blowing up Russia: Terror from Within and Lubyanka Criminal Group, where he accused Russian secret services of staging Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts to bring Vladimir Putin to power in 2000. On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalised. He died three weeks later, and becoming the first known victim of lethal polonium-210-induced acute radiation syndrome. According to his doctors: "Litvinenko's murder represents an ominous landmark: the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism". Litvinenko's allegations about the misdeeds of the Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB) and his public deathbed accusations that the Russian government was behind his unusual malady resulted in worldwide media coverage.
