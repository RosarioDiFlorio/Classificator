LS I +61 303 is a binary system harboring a compact object and a massive star (possibly a microquasar) that emits HE and VHE (High Energy and Very High Energy) gamma rays. It is only one of three known star systems that produce such energetic rays. The other two systems are PSR B1259-63 and LS 5039.
