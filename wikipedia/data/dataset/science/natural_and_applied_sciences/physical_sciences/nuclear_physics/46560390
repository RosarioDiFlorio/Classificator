Long-time nuclear waste warning messages are intended to deter human intrusion at nuclear waste repositories in the far future, within or above the order of magnitude of 10,000 years. Nuclear semiotics is an interdisciplinary field of research, first done by the Human Interference Task Force since 1981.
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has done extensive research in development of these messages. Since today's written languages are unlikely to survive, the research team has considered pictograms and hostile architecture.
In Europe, the warning models rely mostly on integrating the waste disposal facilities within society so information about their presence can be passed on from generation to generation. Into Eternity is a Finnish documentary about how the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository tries to resolve the issue.
