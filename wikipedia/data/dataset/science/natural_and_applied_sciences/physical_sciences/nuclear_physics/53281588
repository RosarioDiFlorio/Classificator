COMET, which stands for COherent Muon to Electron Transition is currently a funded experiment in J-PARC, Tokai, Japan. In contrast to the usual muon decay to an electron and neutrinos, COMET seeks to look for neutrinoless muon to electron conversion, where the electron carries away with it about 104.8MeV of energy. Muon to electron conversion is not forbidden in The Standard Model but the branching ratio is about

It will be using a new beamline connecting the J-PARC main ring and the J-PARC Nuclear and particle Physics Experimental Hall (NP hall).
