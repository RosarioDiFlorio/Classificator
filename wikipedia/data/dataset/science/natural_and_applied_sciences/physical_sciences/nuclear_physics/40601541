In nuclear physics, the Bateman equation is a mathematical model describing abundances and activities in a decay chain as a function of time, based on the decay rates and initial abundances. The model was formulated by Ernest Rutherford in 1905 and the analytical solution was provided by Harry Bateman in 1910.

(this can be adapted to handle decay branches). While this can be solved explicitly for i = 2, the formulas quickly become cumbersome for longer chains.
Bateman found a general explicit formula for the amounts by taking the Laplace transform of the variables.

   for some isotope pair, cancellation can lead to computational errors. Therefore, other methods such as numerical integration or the matrix exponential method are also in use.
e.g. for the simple case of a chain of three isotopes, the corresponding Bateman equation reduces to:
