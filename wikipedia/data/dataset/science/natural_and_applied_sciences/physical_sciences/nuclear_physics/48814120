Natural isotopes are either stable isotopes, radioactive isotopes that have a sufficiently long half-life to allow them to exist in substantial concentrations in the Earth (e.g. bismuth-209, with a half-life of 1.9 * 1019 years, potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.251(3)Ã—109 y), daughter products of those isotopes (e.g. 234Th, with a half-life of 24 days) or cosmogenic elements. The heaviest stable isotope is lead-208, but the heaviest 'natural' isotope is U-238.
Many elements have both natural and artificial isotopes (e.g. hydrogen has three natural isotopes and another four known artificial isotopes). A further distinction among stable natural isotopes is division into primordial (existed when the Solar System formed) and cosmogenic elements ( created by cosmic ray bombardment or other similar processes).
