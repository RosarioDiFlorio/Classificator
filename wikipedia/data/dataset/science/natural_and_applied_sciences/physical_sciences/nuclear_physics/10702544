Floating nuclear power stations (Russian: плавучая атомная теплоэлектростанция малой мощности, ПАТЭС ММ - lit. floating combined heat and power (CHP) low-power nuclear station) are vessels designed by Rosatom.
They are self-contained, low-capacity, floating nuclear power plants. The stations are to be mass-produced at shipbuilding facilities and then towed to the destination ports of the cities and towns experiencing deficit of power due to industrialization.
The work on such projects dates back to MH-1A, which was built in the 1960s into the hull of a World War II Liberty Ship; however, the Rosatom project is the first mass-produced floating nuclear power plant. The initial plan was to manufacture at least seven of the vessels by 2015.
