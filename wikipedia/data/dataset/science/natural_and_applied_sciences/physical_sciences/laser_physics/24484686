Thunderbolt is the brand name of a hardware interface developed by Intel (and collaboration of Apple) that allows the connection of external peripherals to a computer. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same connector as Mini DisplayPort (MDP), whereas Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C. It was initially developed and marketed under the name Light Peak, and first sold as part of a consumer product on February 24, 2011.
Thunderbolt combines PCI Express (PCIe) and DisplayPort (DP) into two serial signals, and additionally provides DC power, all in one cable. Up to six peripherals may be supported by one connector through various topologies.
