Cladding is the bonding together of dissimilar metals. It is different from fusion welding or gluing as a method to fasten the metals together. Cladding is often achieved by extruding two metals through a die as well as pressing or rolling sheets together under high pressure.
The United States Mint uses cladding to manufacture coins from different metals. This allows a cheaper metal to be used as a filler.
