In nonlinear optics, B-Integral is a measure of the nonlinear phase shift of light. It calculates the exponential growth of the least stable spatial frequency in a laser beam, and is the numerical equivalent of the nonlinear phase shift along the laser system's optical axis.
In a multipass laser system as a cumulative measure of the nonlinear interaction, this integral is given by:

where 
  
    
      
        I
        (
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I(z)}
   is the optical intensity along the beam axis, 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
   the position in beam direction, and

   the nonlinear index quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity. As

    {\displaystyle n_{2}I(z)}
   is the nonlinear change in the refractive index, one easily recognizes the B integral to be the total on-axis nonlinear phase shift accumulated in a passage through the device. The B integral is frequently used in the context of ultrafast amplifiers, e.g. for optical components such as the Pockels cell of a regenerative amplifier.
