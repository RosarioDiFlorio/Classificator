Vasily Astratov is a full professor of Physics and Optical Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He became known for launching synthetic opals as new self-assembled photonic crystals for visible light in 1995 in his former group at Ioffe Institute in Russia (jointly with Yurii Vlasov, Alexander Kaplyanskii and co-authors). This work has resulted in a quest for inverse opals with a complete three-dimensional photonic band gap.
