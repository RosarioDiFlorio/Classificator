Resonant-cavity-enhanced photo detectors (or, RCE photo detectors) enable improved performance over their predecessors by placing the active device structure inside a Fabry–Pérot resonant cavity. Though the active device structure of the RCE detectors remains close to other conventional photodetectors, the effect of the optical cavity, which allows wavelength selectivity and an enhancement of the optical field due to resonance, allows the photo detectors to be made thinner and therefore faster, while simultaneously increasing the quantum efficiency at the resonant wavelengths.
