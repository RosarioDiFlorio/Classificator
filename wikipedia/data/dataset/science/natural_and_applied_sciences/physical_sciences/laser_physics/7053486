A Hole accumulation diode (HAD) is an electronic noise reduction device in a charge-coupled device (CCD) or CMOS imaging sensor. HAD devices function by reducing dark current that occur in the absence of light falling on the imager for noise reduction and enhanced image quality.
HAD CCDs are used in consumer and professional single, as well as, three-chip video cameras.
