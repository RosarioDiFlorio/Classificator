An SMD LED Module (surface-mount device light-emitting diode module) is a type of LED module that uses surface-mount technology (SMT) to mount LED chips on printed circuit boards (PCB). It is a self-contained surface-mount LED device designed either to function on its own or to plug into a compatible unit.
Other types of LED lighting that are not SMD are the newer and more powerful luminescence COB (chip on board) and MCOB (multi-COB), finally there are the older DIP LEDS, "Dual In Line Package", DIP LED providing only low luminescence.
