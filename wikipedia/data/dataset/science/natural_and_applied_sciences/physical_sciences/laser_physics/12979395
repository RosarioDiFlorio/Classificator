Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) is an excited state electron transfer process by which an excited electron is transferred from donor to acceptor. Due to PET a charge separation is generated, i.e., redox reaction takes place in excited state (this phenomenon is not observed in Dexter electron transfer).
