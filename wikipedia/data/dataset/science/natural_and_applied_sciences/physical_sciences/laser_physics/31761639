Serial time-encoded amplified imaging/microscopy or stretched time-encoded amplified imaging/microscopy' (STEAM) is a fast real-time optical imaging method that provides MHz frame rate, ~100 ps shutter speed, and ~30 dB (Ã— 1000) optical image gain. Based on the Photonic Time Stretch technique, STEAM holds world records for shutter speed and frame rate in continuous real-time imaging. STEAM employs the Photonic Time Stretch with internal Raman amplification to realize optical image amplification to circumvent the fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and speed that affects virtually all optical imaging and sensing systems. This method uses a single-pixel photodetector, eliminating the need for the detector array and readout time limitations. Avoiding this problem and featuring the optical image amplification for dramatic improvement in sensitivity at high image acquisition rates, STEAM's shutter speed is at least 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art CCD and CMOS cameras. Its frame rate is 1000 times faster than fastest CCD cameras and 10-100 times faster than fastest CMOS cameras.
