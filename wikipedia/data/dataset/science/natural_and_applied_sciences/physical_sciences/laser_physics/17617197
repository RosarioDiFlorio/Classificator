A Linear diode array is used for digitizing x-ray images. The LDA system consists of an array of photodiode modules, The diodes are laminated with a scintillation screen to create x-ray sensitive diodes. The scintillation screen converts the photon energy emitted by the x-ray tube into visible light on the diodes. The diodes produce a voltage when the light energy is received. This voltage is amplified, multiplexed, and converted to a digital signal.
