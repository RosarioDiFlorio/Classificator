In the context of computer supplies, the word spindle or cakebox may refer to a plastic container for packaging optical discs. It typically consists of a round base with a vertical rod (on which the disks are threaded) and a cylindrical cover. Bulk blank CDs, DVDs, and BDs are often sold in such a package.
