A laser cutting bridge system in the world of textiles is an industrial machine for cutting and engraving of textile materials (i.e. fabrics). It is formed by a galvanometric laser head and CO2 laser source that runs along an horizontal beam (the bridge) supported by two lateral columns and sometimes by central columns. This system is placed over one or more embroidery machines, more frequently multi-head rather than single-head machines, cutting tables, roller devices, to cut out and/or engrave embroidered fabrics.
