This is a list of Samsung's CMOS camera sensors, available for purchase by other companies, for a wide variety of products including mobile phones, computers, digital cameras and more.
These sensors use one of the following technologies:
FSI: frontside-illuminated. The light that reaches the photosensitive area is reduced because it needs to pass through multiple metal and dielectric layers.
BSI: backside-illuminated. The light reaches the photosensitive area directly.
ISOCELL: ISOCELL is the more advanced technology which provides increased light sensitivity and higher color fidelity even in poor lighting conditions.
