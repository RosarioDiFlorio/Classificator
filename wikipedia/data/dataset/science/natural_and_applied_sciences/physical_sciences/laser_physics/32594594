The superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) is a type of near-infrared and optical single-photon detector based on a current-biased superconducting nanowire. It was first developed by scientists at Moscow State Pedagogical University and at the University of Rochester in 2001.
As of 2013, a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector is the fastest single-photon detector (SPD) for photon counting.
