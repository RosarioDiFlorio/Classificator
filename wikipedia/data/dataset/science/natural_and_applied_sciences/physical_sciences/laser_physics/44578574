SpellBrite is a light-emitting diode (LED) signage system that looks like neon but uses LEDs as its light source. The SpellBrite system consists of 44 letters, numbers and symbols that click together and are interchangeable, which allows a user to create a custom sign message and later reconfigure the sign to a different message.
