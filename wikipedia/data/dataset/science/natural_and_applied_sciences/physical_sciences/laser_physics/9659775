High harmonic generation (HHG) is a non-linear process during which a target (gas, plasma or solid sample) is illuminated by an intense laser pulse. Under such conditions, the sample will emit the high harmonics of the generation beam (above the fifth harmonics). Due to the coherent nature of the process, high harmonics generation is a prerequisite of attophysics.
