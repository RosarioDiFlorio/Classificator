Germanane is a single-layer crystal composed of germanium with one hydrogen bonded in the z-direction for each atom. In material science, great interest is shown in related single layered materials, such as graphene, composed of carbon, and silicene, composed of silicon. Such materials represent a new generation of semiconductors with potential applications in computer chips and solar cells. Germananeâ€™s structure is similar to graphane, and therefore graphene. Bulk germanium does not adopt this structure. Germanane has been produced in a two-step route starting with calcium germanide. From this material, the calcium is removed by de-intercalation with HCl to give a layered solid with the empirical formula GeH. The Ca sites in Zintyl-phase CaGe2 interchange with the H atoms in the HCl solution, which leaves us with GeH and CaCl2.
