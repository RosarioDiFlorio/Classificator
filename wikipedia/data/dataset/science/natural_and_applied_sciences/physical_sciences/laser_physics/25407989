The L Prize (aka the Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize) is a competition run by the United States Department of Energy aimed to "spur lighting manufacturers to develop high-quality, high-efficiency solid-state lighting products to replace the common incandescent light bulb".
The competition, launched in May 2008 at Lightfair, offers two prizes for the replacement of two types of bulb, an A19 60-watt incandescent light bulb and a PAR 38 halogen incandescent bulb.

The competition has set out various qualifying requirements for the replacement bulbs summarized in the table below:
