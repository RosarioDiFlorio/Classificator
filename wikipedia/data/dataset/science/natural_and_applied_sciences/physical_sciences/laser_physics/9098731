Coherent addition (or coherent combining) of lasers is one of methods of the power scaling. It allows a to increase the output power and brightness of single-transversal mode laser.
Usually, the term coherent addition applies to fiber lasers. As the ability of pumping and/or cooling of a single laser is saturated, several similar lasers can be forced to oscillate in phase with common coupler. The coherent addition was demonstrated in power scaling of Raman lasers.
