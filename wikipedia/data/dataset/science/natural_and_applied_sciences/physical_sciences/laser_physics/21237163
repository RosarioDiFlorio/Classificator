A line laser is a laser modified to project a line rather than a point (e.g. laser pointer). This may be achieved by passing the beam through a cylindrical lens or a Powell lens.
Using multiple lasers, it is possible to project multiple lines for use with image processing.
Depending on the application, line lasers can generate lines, crosses or other patterns. Civil engineering and interior design projects can use line lasers to measure the levelling of a small building site.
