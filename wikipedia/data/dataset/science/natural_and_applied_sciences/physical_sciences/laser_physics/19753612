Black silicon is a semiconductor material, a surface modification of silicon with very low reflectivity and correspondingly high absorption of visible (and infrared) light. The modification was discovered in the 1980s as an unwanted side effect of reactive ion etching (RIE). Other methods for forming a similar structure include electrochemical etching, stain etching, metal-assisted chemical etching, and laser treatment (which is developed in Eric Mazur's laboratory at Harvard University), and FFC Cambridge process (an electrochemical reduction process).
