Caesium cadmium bromide (CsCdBr3) is a synthetic crystalline material. It belongs to the AMX3 group (where A = alkali metal, M = bivalent metal, X = halogen ion). As a single crystal structure doped with rare-earth ions, it can be used as active laser medium. However, its hygroscopic behaviour limits its use as a laser crystal.
