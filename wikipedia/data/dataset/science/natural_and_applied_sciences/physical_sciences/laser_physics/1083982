Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), also known as laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), is the technique of using the Doppler shift in a laser beam to measure the velocity in transparent or semi-transparent fluid flows, or the linear or vibratory motion of opaque, reflecting, surfaces. The measurement with LDA is absolute, linear with velocity and requires no pre-calibration.
