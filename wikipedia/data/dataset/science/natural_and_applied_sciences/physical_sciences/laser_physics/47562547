microLED, also known as micro-LED, mLED or ÂµLED, is an emerging flat panel display technology. As the name implies, mLED displays consist of arrays of microscopic LEDs forming the individual pixel elements. When compared to the widespread LCD technology, mLED displays offer better contrast, response times, and energy efficiency.
Along with OLEDs, mLEDs are primarily aimed at small, low-energy devices such as smartwatches and smartphones. OLED and mLED both offer greatly reduced energy requirements compared to conventional LCD systems. Unlike OLED, mLED is based on conventional GaN LED technology, which offers far higher total brightness than OLED products, as much as 30 times, as well as higher efficiency in terms of lux/W. It also does not suffer from the shorter lifetimes of OLED, although the multi-year lifespan of modern OLEDs has mitigated this issue in most roles.
As of 2017, mLED displays have not been mass-produced or commercialized.
