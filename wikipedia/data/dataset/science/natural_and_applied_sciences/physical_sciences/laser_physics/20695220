AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode, ) is a display technology used in smartwatches, mobile devices, laptops, and televisions. OLED describes a specific type of thin-film-display technology in which organic compounds form the electroluminescent material, and active matrix refers to the technology behind the addressing of pixels.
As of 2008, AMOLED technology was used in mobile phones, media players and digital cameras and continued to make progress toward low-power, low-cost and large-size (for example, 40-inch or 100-centimetre) applications.
