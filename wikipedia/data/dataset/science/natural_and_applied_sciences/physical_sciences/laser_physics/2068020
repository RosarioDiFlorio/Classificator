Professional Disc (PFD) is a digital recording optical disc format introduced by Sony in 2003 primarily for XDCAM, its new tapeless camcorder system. It was one of the first optical formats to utilize blue laser, which allowed for higher density of data to be stored on optical media compared to infrared laser technology used in the CD and red laser technology used in the DVD format.
