Round-trip gain refers to the laser physics, and laser cavities (or laser resonators). It is gain, integrated along a ray, which makes a round-trip in the cavity.
At the continuous-wave operation, the round-trip gain exactly compensates both the output coupling of the cavity and its background loss.
