PoliScan speed is a system for traffic enforcement made by Vitronic. The measurement is based on lidar (light radar). By time-of-flight measurement, a scanning laser determines speeds and positions of all vehicles in the measurement area.
PoliScan speed is available as a mobile or a stationary system.
Apart from the use as speed camera, the systems of the PoliScan family are also used as red light camera and for automatic number plate recognition.
