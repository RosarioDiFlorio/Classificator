Optical decay is process of relaxation of excitation of an excited quantum system, usually due to the spontaneous emission of a photon or a phonon. Optical decay is dominant mechanism of quenching of excitation of active optical media. In solid-state lasers the optical decay limits the storage of energy in active medium.
Also, the term optical decay is used to the effect of quick reduction of luminosity of astrophysical objects
