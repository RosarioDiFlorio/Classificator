A talbot cavity is an external cavity used for the coherent combining of output from multiple laser diodes arranged in an array. It is generally constructed with a single mirror at half the talbot distance from the output facet of the laser array. This images the near field image of the array back onto the array itself at the talbot distance, creating optical feedback. This feedback forces the diode lasers in the array to mode lock.
