Thor-CD was a recordable CD format proposed in 1988 by Tandy (parent company of Radio Shack), that was never released in commercial version.
At the time Tandy proposed the new format, CDs were mostly used for digital music, but not for other digital data. Tandy aimed to change this with its new format.
However, the introduction of the CD-ROM format, which was incompatible with Tandy's proposal, all but killed Tandy's product.
Several years before recordable compact discs were introduced, Tandy Corporation announced a similar CD format named Thor-CD, but after being pushed back for several years, it was finally shelved due to technical limitations, and then became known as "Vapordisc".
