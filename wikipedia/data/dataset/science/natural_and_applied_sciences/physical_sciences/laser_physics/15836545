Laser bonding is a marking technique that uses lasers to bond an additive marking substance to a substrate.
First invented in the mid 1990s by Paul W. Harrison, the founder of TherMark, LLC, this patent protected and patent pending technology  produces permanent marks on metal, glass, ceramic and plastic parts for a diverse range of industrial and artistic applications, ranging from aerospace and medical to the awards and engraving industries. It differs from the more widely known techniques of laser engraving and laser ablation in that it is an additive process, adding material to the substrate surface instead of removing it.
Laser bonding has been achieved by Nd:YAG, CO2 laser, Fiber laser and Diode-pumped solid-state laser and can be accomplished using other forms of radiant energy.
