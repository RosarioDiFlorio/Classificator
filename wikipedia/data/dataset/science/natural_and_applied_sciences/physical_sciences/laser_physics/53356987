LED tube is a modern source of light used in fluorescent lamp luminaires with G5 and G13 bases in place of traditional fluorescent tubes. As compared to fluorescent tubes, the most important advantages of LED tubes are energy efficiency and long service life. LED tubes are sometimes also referred to as ‘LED fluorescent tubes’, but since the light actually comes from LED components and the tubes contain no fluorescent substance, ‘LED tube’ is more correct.
