Plasmonics is the study of plasmons, quasiparticles of plasma oscillation in solids such as metals, semi-metals, metal oxides, nitrides, doped semiconductors, etc. An effort is currently being made to implement plasmons in electric circuits, or in an electric circuit analog, to combine the size efficiency of electronics with the data capacity of photonic integrated circuits. Plasmonics can be understood as "light-on-metal-dielectric-interfaces," where electrons oscillate at the surface of a metal due to strong resonant interactions with the electric field of incident light. Due to the high scattering rate of electrons, ohmic losses in plasmonic signals are generally large, which limits the signal transfer distances to the sub-centimeter range, unless hybrid optoplasmonic light guiding networks, or plasmon gain amplification are used. Both surface plasmon polaritons propagating along the metal-dielectric interfaces and localized surface plasmon modes supported by metal nanoparticles are characterized by large momentum values, which enable strong resonant enhancement of the local density of photon states, and can be utilized to enhance weak optical effects of opto-electronic devices.
