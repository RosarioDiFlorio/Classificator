LED Art is a form of light art constructed from light-emitting diodes. Many artists that use LEDs are guerrilla artists, incorporating LEDs to produce temporary pieces in public places. LEDs are very inexpensive to purchase and have become a new way to make street art. LEDs are, among others, used in installation art, sculptural pieces and interactive artworks.
Strobe art is another example, it consists of drawing red, green and blue colours onto a canvas or a piece of paper and then switching on an led strobe so that the object will appear to spin round or the scene will appear to change depending on the colours used. The positioning of the green colours will dictate which direction the object goes round. TheStrober is a youtube artist who uses this technique a lot in his videos to create pyschedelic effects or make political statements.
