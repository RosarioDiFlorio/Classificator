LVX System of Companies is the inventor of Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) market. The LVX system is a collection of LED light bulbs and specialized equipment which allow the transmission of data through light photons- pulse width modulation (PWM) of the LED. The current speed at which the data is able to be transmitted is 3 Mbit/s. The goal of the LVX system is to free up wireless Wi-Fi spectrum which LVX asserts can be quite congested in some business areas. The 3 Mbit/s speed is slower than existing Wi-Fi technology, but the company is working on an improved LED which will be able to match the speeds of current Wi-Fi networks. The lights also have ability to transmit any specific colour along the spectrum. Because the lights are also communication devices, they could be directed through the LVX network to turn a certain colour to lead the way out of a building during emergencies or to a specific office. As well, lights could be directed to turn on and off as an energy savings measure. The communication and networking capabilities are marketed as an add-on or "bonus" to the energy savings and maintenance inherited by LED lights in general as compared to fluorescent or incandescent light bulbs. LVX sells maintenance contracts in which LVX will be responsible for the 24/7 maintenance of the lights.
