Laser ablation of thyroid nodules is a minimally invasive procedure indicated to treat benign thyroid lesions such as cold nodules or single nodules within a multinodular goiter. The technique consists in the destruction of the tissue by the insertion therein of optical fibers which convey the light energy, causing a complete and not reversible lesions necrosis. The therapeutic outcome is the reduction in volume of the nodule, and as a result of local symptoms, such as compression, and reduction or loss of visibility of nodular goiter.
The goal of therapy is to destroy the lesion without removing the organ, thus preserving its normal anatomy.
Once documented the benign nature of the nodule, the selection criteria for treatment with the laser concern injuries sufficiently massive to create cosmetic damages or local compressive symptoms and those patients who have contraindications at surgery or anesthesia or will not, for aesthetic reasons, to undergo surgery.
