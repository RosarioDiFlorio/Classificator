Electro-optics is a branch of electrical engineering and material physics involving components, devices (e.g. Lasers, LEDs, waveguides etc.) and systems which operate by the propagation and interaction of light with various tailored materials. It is essentially the same as what is popularly described today as photonics. It is not only concerned with the "Electro-Optic effect". Thus it concerns the interaction between the electromagnetic (optical) and the electrical (electronic) states of materials.
