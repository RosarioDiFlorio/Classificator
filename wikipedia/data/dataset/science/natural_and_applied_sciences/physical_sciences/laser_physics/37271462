The Einstein Prize for Laser Science was a recognition awarded by the former Society for Optical and Quantum Electronics and sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Company. The prize, awarded in the 1988–1999 period, consisted in a 3-inch brass medal including Einstein's image and a depiction of a two-level transition including the A and B coefficients. Recipients of the prize include:
Serge Haroche, 1988
Herbert Walther, 1988
H. Jeff Kimble, 1989
Richart E. Slusher, 1989
Carlton M. Caves, 1990
Daniel Frank Walls, 1990
S. E. Harris, 1991
L. M. Narducci, 1991
John L. Hall, 1992
Willis E. Lamb, 1992
Raymond Chiao, 1993
Norman F. Ramsey, 1993
G. S. Agarwal, 1994
Theodor W. Hänsch, 1995
Carl E. Wieman, 1995
David J. Wineland, 1996
Peter L. Knight, 1996
Paul Corkum, 1999
In retrospect, the prize was mainly awarded for significant contributions in quantum optics. Two recipients of the Einstein Prize for Laser Science were already Nobel laureates in physics (W. E. Lamb and N. F. Ramsey) and five other recipients went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics (S. Haroche, J. L. Hall, T. W. Hänsch, C. E. Wieman, and D. J. Wineland). Presentation of the prize was done at the Lasers'88 to Lasers'99 conferences.
Note: the official name of these conferences was The International Conference on Lasers and Applications, Lasers 'XX.
