Laser Powder Forming, also known by the proprietary name (Laser Engineered Net Shaping) is an additive manufacturing technology developed for fabricating metal parts directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) solid model by using a metal powder injected into a molten pool created by a focused, high-powered laser beam. This technique is also equivalent to several trademarked techniques that have the monikers Direct Metal Deposition (DMD), and Laser Consolidation (LC). Compared to processes that use powder beds, such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) objects created with this technology can be substantially larger, even up to several feet long.
