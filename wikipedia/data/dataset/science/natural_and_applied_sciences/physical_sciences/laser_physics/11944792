AmBX (officially stylised amBX) is a technology (originally developed by Philips) for controlling incandescent and white/coloured LED lighting and other compatible peripherals. This allows lighting designers, and entertainment media providers to generate custom designed lighting environments that are triggered by compatible peripherals (such as lights). The patents for the technology are now owned by a British company based in Redhill, amBX UK LTD. AmBX licenses the technology to entertainment producers at no charge.
