AppleCD is a range of SCSI-based CD-ROM drives for Apple Macintosh personal computers, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from the late 1980s to late 1990s. Earlier AppleCD drives required a CD caddy in order to be used, while later models used a tray-loading mechanism. The original model introduced in 1988 was simply called the AppleCD SC. There was also a version of the CD drive that did not have the Apple logo.
