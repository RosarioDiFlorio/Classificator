In soft-tissue laser surgery, a highly focused laser beam vaporizes soft tissue with a high water content. The laser makes small incisions when the beam is focused on tissue; the focal spot size can be as small as 100 µm, but the most widely used in practice is 400 µm (0.4 mm). When the beam is defocused, the intensity of the laser light diminishes, and it can be used for cauterization of small blood vessels and lymphatics, therefore decreasing post-operative swelling.
