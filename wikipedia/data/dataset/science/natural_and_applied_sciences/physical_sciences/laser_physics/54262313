Pauls Stradiņš, Jr. (born 1963) is a physicist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and a foreign member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.
Currently he is the principal scientist and a project leader of the silicon photovoltaics group at NREL. He leads a team that recently theorized that defects in photovoltaic cells could actually improve the performance of those cells.
He is the grandson of Pauls Stradiņš (17 January 1896 – 14 August 1958), a Latvian professor, physician, and surgeon who founded the Museum of the History of Medicine in Riga and whose image appears on a Latvian postage stamp and for whom hospitals and medical schools were named.
