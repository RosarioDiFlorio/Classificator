An LED filament light bulb is an LED lamp which is designed to resemble a traditional incandescent light bulb with visible filaments, for aesthetic purposes. It produces its light by LED filaments, multi-diode structures that resemble the filament of an incandescent light bulb. They are designed as drop-in replacements for conventional clear incandescent bulbs used in decorative light fixtures, such as table lamps, pendant lights, chandeliers, and bulb-based candelabras. They are also an effective, efficient and reliable, form of LED lighting.
