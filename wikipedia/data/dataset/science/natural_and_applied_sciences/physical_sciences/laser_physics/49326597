A gamma-ray laser, or graser, would produce coherent gamma rays, just as an ordinary laser produces coherent rays of visible light. It would be powered by nuclear transitions from a nuclear isomer. To construct a gamma ray laser, one must identify a suitable isomer, purify it, create a crystal from the purified material, and assemble a configuration that leads to the emission of a coherent gamma-ray beam. Because the wavelength of gamma rays are shorter than that of x-rays, such a device, which has yet to be realized, would potentially be very useful in applications such as high-resolution imaging, surgery, and communications, as well as high-intensity applications.
Research to solve the difficulties inherent in the construction of a practical gamma-ray laser continues. In his 2003 Nobel lecture, Vitaly Ginzburg cited the gamma-ray laser as one of the thirty most important problems in physics.
The search for a gamma-ray laser is interdisciplinary, including quantum mechanics, nuclear and optical spectroscopy, chemistry, solid-state physics, metallurgy, as well as the generation, moderation, and interaction of neutrons, and involves specialized knowledge and research in all these fields. The subject involves both basic science and engineering technology.
