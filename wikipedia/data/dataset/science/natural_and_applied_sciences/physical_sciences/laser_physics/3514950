Aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) is a semiconductor material. It is any alloy of aluminium nitride and gallium nitride.
The bandgap of AlxGa1âˆ’xN can be tailored from 3.4eV (xAl=0) to 6.2eV (xAl=1).
AlGaN is used to manufacture light-emitting diodes operating in blue to ultraviolet region, where wavelengths down to 250 nm (far UV) were achieved. It is also used in blue semiconductor lasers.
It is also used in detectors of ultraviolet radiation, and in AlGaN/GaN High-electron-mobility transistors.
AlGaN is often used together with gallium nitride or aluminium nitride, forming heterojunctions.
AlGaN layers can be also grown on sapphire.
