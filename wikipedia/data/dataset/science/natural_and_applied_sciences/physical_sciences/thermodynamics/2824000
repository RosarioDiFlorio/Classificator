A humidity indicator card (HIC) is a card on which a moisture-sensitive chemical is impregnated such that it will change color when the indicated relative humidity is exceeded. This is usually blotting paper impregnated with cobalt(II) chloride base, or less toxic, copper(II) chloride base.
This item is an inexpensive way to quantify relative humidity levels inside sealed packaging. They are available in many configurations and used in many applications, especially military and semiconductor. The most common humidity indicator cards change color from blue (less than indicated RH level) to pink (greater than indicated RH level). United States Military Specification Mil-I-8835A is the governing specification for a humidity indicator card. The humidity indicator card is also specified for use in J-STD-033 which is the standard for Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices, also known generically as semiconductors. This is a joint standard developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council and IPC and is used in semiconductor packaging.
