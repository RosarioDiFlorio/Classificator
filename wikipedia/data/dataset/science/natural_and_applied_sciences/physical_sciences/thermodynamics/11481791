Airport reference temperature is defined as the monthly mean of average daily temperature (Ta) for the hottest month of the year plus one-third the difference of this temperature (Ta) and the monthly mean of the maximum daily temperature (Tm) for the same month of the year.
Thus airport reference temperature is
