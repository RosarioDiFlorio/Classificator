The multiplicity function for a two state paramagnet, W(n,N), is the number of spin states such that n of the N spins point in the z-direction. This function is given by the combinatoric function C(N,n). That is:

  
    
      
        W
        (
        n
        ,
        N
        )
        =
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              N
              n
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              N
              !
            
            
              n
              !
              (
              N
              −
              n
              )
              !
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W(n,N)={N \choose n}={{N!} \over {n!(N-n)!}}}
  

It is primarily used in introductory statistical mechanics and thermodynamics textbooks to explain the microscopic definition of entropy to students. If the spins are non-interacting, then the multiplicity function counts the number of states which have the same energy in an external magnetic field. By definition, the entropy S is then given by the natural logarithm of this number:

  
    
      
        S
        =
        k
        ln
        ⁡
        
          W
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=k\ln {W}\,}
    Where k is the Boltzmann constant
