Isentropic expansion waves are created when a supersonic flow is redirected along a curved surface. These waves are studied to obtain a relation between deflection angle and Mach number. Each wave in this case is a Mach wave, so it is at an angle 
  
    
      
        α
        =
        s

          n

        (

            M
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha =sin^{-1}({\frac {1}{M}})}
   , where M is the Mach number immediately before the wave. Expansion waves are divergent because as the flow expands the value of Mach number increases, thereby decreasing the Mach angle.
In an isentropic wave, the speed changes from 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   to 
  
    
      
        (
        v
        +
        d
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v+dv)}
  , with deflection 
  
    
      
        d
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\theta }
  . We have oriented the coordinate system orthogonal to the wave. We write the basic (continuity, momentum and 1st, 2nd law of thermodynamics) equations for this infinitesimal control volume.
