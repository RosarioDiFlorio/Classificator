The Marangoni number (Ma) is a dimensionless number named after Italian scientist Carlo Marangoni. The Marangoni number may be regarded as proportional to (thermal-) surface tension forces divided by viscous forces. It is – for example – applicable to bubble and foam research or calculations of cryogenic spacecraft propellant behaviour.
