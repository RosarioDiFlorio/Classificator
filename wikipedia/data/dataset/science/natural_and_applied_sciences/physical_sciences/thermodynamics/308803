Carnot's theorem, developed in 1824 by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, also called Carnot's rule, is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain. The efficiency of a Carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs.
Carnot's theorem states:
All heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same reservoirs.
Every Carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient, regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details.
The formula for this maximum efficiency is

   is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir.
Based on modern thermodynamics, Carnot's theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics. Historically, it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law.
