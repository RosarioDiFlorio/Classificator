The Néel temperature or magnetic ordering temperature, TN, is the temperature above which an antiferromagnetic material becomes paramagnetic—that is, the thermal energy becomes large enough to destroy the microscopic magnetic ordering within the material.
The Néel temperature is analogous to the Curie temperature, TC, for ferromagnetic materials. It is named after Louis Néel (1904–2000), who received the 1970 Nobel prize in physics for his work in the area.
Listed below are the Néel temperatures of several materials:
