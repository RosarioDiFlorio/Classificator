Colloquially, room temperature is the range of air temperatures that people prefer for indoor settings, which feel comfortable when wearing typical indoor clothing. As a medical definition, the range generally considered to be suitable for human occupancy is between 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit) and 25 °C (77 °F), though human comfort can extend somewhat beyond this range depending on factors such as humidity and air circulation. In certain fields, like science and engineering, and within a particular context, "room temperature" can have varying agreed upon values for temperature.
