The thermal velocity or thermal speed is a typical velocity of the thermal motion of particles which make up a gas, liquid, etc. Thus, indirectly, thermal velocity is a measure of temperature. Technically speaking it is a measure of the width of the peak in the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann particle velocity distribution. Note that in the strictest sense thermal velocity is not a velocity, since velocity usually describes a vector rather than simply a scalar speed.
Since the thermal velocity is only a "typical" velocity, a number of different definitions can be and are used.

   is the temperature, and 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is the mass of a particle, then we can write the different thermal velocities:
