Mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) is an energy recovery process. It involves taking vapor (usually water vapor) at, or a little above, atmospheric pressure and adding energy to it by compression. The result is a smaller volume of vapor, at a higher temperature and pressure, which can be used to do useful work.
