Ehrenfest equations (named after Paul Ehrenfest) are equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions. The Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions, as both specific entropy and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.
