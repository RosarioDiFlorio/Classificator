The entropy of fusion is the increase in entropy when melting a substance. This is almost always positive since the degree of disorder increases in the transition from an organized crystalline solid to the disorganized structure of a liquid; the only known exception is helium. It is denoted as 
  
    
      
        Δ
        
          S
          
            fus
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{fus}}}
   and normally expressed in J mol−1 K−1
A natural process such as a phase transition will occur when the associated change in the Gibbs free energy is negative.

Since this is a thermodynamic equation, the symbol T refers to the absolute thermodynamic temperature, measured in kelvins (K).
Equilibrium occurs when the temperature is equal to the melting point
