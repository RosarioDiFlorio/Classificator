In statistical mechanics and thermodynamics the compressibility equation refers to an equation which relates the isothermal compressibility (and indirectly the pressure) to the structure of the liquid. It reads:

  
    
      
        k
        T
        
          (
          
            
              
                ∂
                ρ
              
              
                ∂
                p
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        1
        +
        ρ
        
          ∫
          
            V
          
        
        
          d
        
        
          r
        
        [
        g
        (
        r
        )
        −
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle kT\left({\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial p}}\right)=1+\rho \int _{V}\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} [g(r)-1]}
  

where 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is the number density, g(r) is the radial distribution function and 
  
    
      
        k
        T
        
          (
          
            
              
                ∂
                ρ
              
              
                ∂
                p
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle kT\left({\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial p}}\right)}
   is the isothermal compressibility.
Using the Fourier representation of the Ornstein-Zernike equation the compressibility equation can be rewritten in the form:

  
    
      
        
          
            1
            
              k
              T
            
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              
                ∂
                p
              
              
                ∂
                ρ
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              1
              +
              ρ
              ∫
              h
              (
              r
              )
              
                d
              
              
                r
              
            
          
        
        =

              ρ
              
                
                  
                    H
                    ^
                  
                
              
              (
              0
              )
            
          
        
        =
        1
        −
        ρ

        =

    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{kT}}\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial \rho }}\right)={\frac {1}{1+\rho \int h(r)\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }}={\frac {1}{1+\rho {\hat {H}}(0)}}=1-\rho {\hat {C}}(0)=1-\rho \int c(r)\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }
  

where h(r) and c(r) are the indirect and direct correlation functions respectively. The compressibility equation is one of the many integral equations in statistical mechanics.
