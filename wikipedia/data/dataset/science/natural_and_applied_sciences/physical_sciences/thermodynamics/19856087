In the field of heat transfer, intensity of radiation 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
   is a measure of the distribution of radiant heat flux per unit area and solid angle, in a particular direction, defined according to

  
    
      
        d
        q
        =
        I
        
        d
        ω
        
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        
        d
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle dq=I\,d\omega \,\cos \theta \,dA}
  
where

  
    
      
        d
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle dA}
   is the infinitesimal source area

  
    
      
        d
        q
      
    
    {\displaystyle dq}
   is the outgoing heat transfer from the area 
  
    
      
        d
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle dA}
  

  
    
      
        d
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle d\omega }
   is the solid angle subtended by the infinitesimal 'target' (or 'aperture') area 
  
    
      
        d
        
          A
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle dA_{a}}
  

  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is the angle between the source area normal vector and the line-of-sight between the source and the target areas.
Typical units of intensity are W·m−2·sr−1.
Intensity can sometimes be called radiance, especially in other fields of study.
The emissive power of a surface can be determined by integrating the intensity of emitted radiation over a hemisphere surrounding the surface:

  
    
      
        q
        =
        
          ∫
          
            ϕ
            =
            0
          
          
            2
            π
          
        
        
          ∫
          
            θ
            =
            0
          
          
            π
            
              /
            
            2
          
        
        I
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
        d
        θ
        d
        ϕ
      
    
    {\displaystyle q=\int _{\phi =0}^{2\pi }\int _{\theta =0}^{\pi /2}I\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\phi }
  
For diffuse emitters, the emitted radiation intensity is the same in all directions, with the result that

  
    
      
        E
        =
        π
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=\pi I}
  
The factor 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   (which really should have the units of steradians) is a result of the fact that intensity is defined to exclude the effect of reduced view factor at large values 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  ; note that the solid angle corresponding to a hemisphere is equal to 
  
    
      
        2
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\pi }
   steradians.
Spectral intensity 
  
    
      
        
          I
          
            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I_{\lambda }}
   is the corresponding spectral measurement of intensity; in other words, the intensity as a function of wavelength.
