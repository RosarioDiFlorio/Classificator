The 3ω-method (3 omega method) or 3ω-technique, is a measurement method for determining the thermal conductivities of bulk material (i.e. solid or liquid) and thin layers. The process involves a metal heater applied to the sample that is heated periodically. The temperature oscillations thus produced are then measured. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the sample can be determined from their frequency dependence. The process was first published by David Cahill and Robert Pohl in the April 1987 issue of the Physical Review in a paper titled "Thermal Conductivity of Amorphous Solids above the Plateau".
