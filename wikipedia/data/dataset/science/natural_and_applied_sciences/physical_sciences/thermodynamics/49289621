Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (APG), also known as Thermally Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG), is a form of synthetic graphite that offers excellent in-plane thermal conductivity. As with pyrolytic carbon or pyrolytic graphite (PG), APG is also low in mass, is electrically conductive, and offers diamagnetic properties that allow it to levitate in magnetic fields.
