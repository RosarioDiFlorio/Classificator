Optothermal stability describes the rate at which an optical element distorts due to a changing thermal environment. A changing thermal environment can cause an optic to bend due to either 1) thermal gradients on the optic and a non-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, or 2) coefficient of thermal expansion gradients in an optic and a temperature change.  Therefore, optothermal stability is an issue for optics that are present in a changing thermal environment. Optothermal stability is important for objects in orbit which have varyiable heat loads from changes in spacecraft attitude, solar flux, planetary albedo, and planetary infrared emissions. Optothermal stability is important when measuring surface figure of optics because thermal changes are typically of a low frequency nature (diurnal or HVAC cycling) which makes it difficult to use the same methods used to remove errors due to vibrational disturbances. Also, optothermal stability is important for certain optical systems such as those that use a coronagraph which requires a high level of stability.
