A hydrolysis constant is an equilibrium constant for a hydrolysis reaction.
For example, if a metal salt such as AlCl3 dissolves in an aqueous solution, the metal cation behaves as a Lewis acid and hydrolyzes the water molecules in the solvent.
Al3+ + 2H2O → AlOH2+ + H3O+
The hydrolysis constant for this reaction is as shown:
Khydrolysis = [H3O+] * [AlOH2+] / [Al3+]
In a more generalized form, the hydrolysis constant can be described as:
Ka = [H3O+] * [A−] / [HA]
where A− represents any base, and HA represents any acid.
