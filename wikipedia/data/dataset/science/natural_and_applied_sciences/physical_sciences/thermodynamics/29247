Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a mineral acid with the molecular formula H2SO4. It is a colorless odorless syrupy liquid that is soluble in water.
Its corrosiveness can be mainly ascribed to its strong acidic nature. It is also hygroscopic, readily absorbing water vapour from the air. Sulfuric acid at even moderate concentrations is very dangerous upon contact with skin.
Sulfuric acid has a wide range of applications including in domestic acidic drain cleaners, as an electrolyte in lead-acid batteries and in various cleaning agents. It is also a central substance in the chemical industry. Principal uses include mineral processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis. It is widely produced with different methods, such as contact process, wet sulfuric acid process, lead chamber process and some other methods.
