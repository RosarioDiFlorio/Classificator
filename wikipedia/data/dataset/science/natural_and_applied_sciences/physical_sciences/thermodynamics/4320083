The Clausius theorem (1855) states that for a system exchanging heat with external reservoirs and undergoing a cyclic process, one that ultimately returns a system to its original state,

    {\displaystyle \delta Q}
   is the infinitesimal amount of heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir and 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is the temperature of the external reservoir at a particular instant in time. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds. The reversible case is used to introduce the entropy state function. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir. Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around.
