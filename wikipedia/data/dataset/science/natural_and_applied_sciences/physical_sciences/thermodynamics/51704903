Thermal inductance refers to the phenomenon wherein a thermal change of an object surrounded by a fluid will induce a change in convection currents within that fluid, thus inducing a change in the kinetic energy of the fluid. It is considered the thermal analogue to electrical inductance in system equivalence modeling; its unit is the thermal henry.
Thus far, few studies have reported on the inductive phenomenon in the heat-transfer behaviour of a system. In 1946, Bosworth demonstrated that heat flow can have an inductive nature through experiments with a fluidic system. He claimed that the measured transient behaviour of the temperature change cannot be explained by merely the combination of the thermal resistance and the thermal capacitance. Bosworth later extended the experiments to study the thermal mutual inductance; however, he did not report on the thermal inductance in a heat-transfer system with the exception of a fluid flow.
