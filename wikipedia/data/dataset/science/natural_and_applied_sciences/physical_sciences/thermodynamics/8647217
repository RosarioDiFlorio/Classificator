A transcritical cycle is a thermodynamic cycle where the working fluid goes through both subcritical and supercritical states. This is often the case when carbon dioxide, CO2, is the refrigerant.
The modern transcritical cycle was developed in 1988–1991 by the Norwegian professor Gustav Lorentzen (1915–1995) and his team.
