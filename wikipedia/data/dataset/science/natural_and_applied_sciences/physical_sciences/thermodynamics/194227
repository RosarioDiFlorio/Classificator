Heat capacity or thermal capacity is a measurable physical quantity equal to the ratio of the heat added to (or removed from) an object to the resulting temperature change. The unit of heat capacity is joule per kelvin

Heat capacity is an extensive property of matter, meaning that it is proportional to the size of the system. When expressing the same phenomenon as an intensive property, the heat capacity is divided by the amount of substance, mass, or volume, thus the quantity is independent of the size or extent of the sample. The molar heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: mole) of a pure substance, and the specific heat capacity, often called simply specific heat, is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material. Nonetheless some authors use the term specific heat to refer to the ratio of the specific heat capacity of a substance at any given temperature to the specific heat capacity of another substance at a reference temperature, much in the fashion of specific gravity. In some engineering contexts, the volumetric heat capacity is used.
Temperature reflects the average randomized kinetic energy of constituent particles of matter (i.e., atoms or molecules) relative to the centre of mass of the system, while heat is the transfer of energy across a system boundary into the body other than by work or matter transfer. Translation, rotation, and vibration of atoms represent the degrees of freedom of motion which classically contribute to the heat capacity of gases, while only vibrations are needed to describe the heat capacities of most solids, as shown by the Dulong–Petit law. Other contributions can come from magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in solids, but these rarely make substantial contributions.
For quantum mechanical reasons, at any given temperature, some of these degrees of freedom may be unavailable, or only partially available, to store thermal energy. In such cases, the heat capacity is a fraction of the maximum. As the temperature approaches absolute zero, the heat capacity of a system approaches zero because of loss of available degrees of freedom. Quantum theory can be used to quantitatively predict the heat capacity of simple systems.
