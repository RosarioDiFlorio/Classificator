A compressor map is a chart created for a compressor in a gas turbine engine. Complete maps are based on compressor rig test results or predicted by a special computer program. Alternatively the map of a similar compressor can be suitably scaled.
Compressor maps are an integral part of predicting the performance of a gas turbine engine, both at design and off-design conditions. Fans and turbines also have operating maps, although the latter are significantly different in appearance to that of compressors.
