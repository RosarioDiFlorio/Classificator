Thermal fluids or Thermofluids is a branch of science and engineering divided into four sections:
Heat transfer
Thermodynamics
Fluid mechanics
Combustion
The term consists of two words: "thermal", meaning heat, and "fluids", which refers to liquids, gases and vapors. Pressure, volume, and density all play an important role in thermal fluids. Temperature, flow rate, phase transition and chemical reactions may also be important in a thermal fluids context.
