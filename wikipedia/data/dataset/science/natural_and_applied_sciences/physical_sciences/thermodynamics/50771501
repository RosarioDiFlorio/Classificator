Overheating is a phenomenon of rising of temperature in an electric circuit (or portion of a circuit). Overheating causes potential damage to the circuit components, and can cause fire, explosion, or injury. Damage caused by overheating are commonly irreversible; i.e. the only way to repair is to replace some components.
