A humidor is a humidity-controlled box or room used primarily for storing cigars, cigarettes, or pipe tobacco. Either too much or too little humidity can be harmful to tobacco products; a humidor's primary function is to maintain a steady, desirable moisture level inside; secondarily it protects its contents from physical damage and deterioration from sunlight.
For private use, small wooden boxes holding a few dozen cigars or less are common, while cigar shops may have walk-in humidors. Other uses include maintaining a constant humidity level in baseballs: the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball team stores its game balls in a large humidor at their home stadium to counteract the effects of Denver's low humidity. Many humidors use hygrometers to monitor their humidity levels.
