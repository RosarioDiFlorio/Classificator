The ability to sense infrared thermal radiation evolved independently in several different families of snakes. Essentially, it allows these animals to "see" radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 Î¼m to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes, and other snakes with the organ may detect warm bodies from a metre away. It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but recent evidence suggests that it may also be used in thermoregulation and predator detection, making it a more general-purpose sensory organ than was supposed.
