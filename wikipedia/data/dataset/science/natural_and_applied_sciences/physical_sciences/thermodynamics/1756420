Thermal hydraulics (also called thermohydraulics) is the study of hydraulic flow in thermal fluids. A common example is steam generation in power plants and the associated energy transfer to mechanical motion and the change of states of the water while undergoing this process.
The common adjectives are "thermohydraulic", "thermal-hydraulic" and "thermalhydraulic".
