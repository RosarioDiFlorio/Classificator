The electrokinematics theorem connects the velocity and the charge of carriers moving inside an arbitrary volume to the currents, voltages and power on its surface through an arbitrary irrotational vector. Since it contains, as a particular application, the Ramo-Shockley theorem, the electrokinematics theorem is also known as Ramo-Shockly-Pellegrini theorem.
