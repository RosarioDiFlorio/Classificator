Behavior-altering parasites are parasites capable of causing changes in the behavior of their hosts by directly affecting the hosts' decision-making and behavior control mechanisms. The acquired or modified behaviors assist in the parasite's transmission, and in the case of parasitoids result in the host's death.
Parasites can cause various types of behavioral changes, some extremely complex and "unnatural" to the host. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, for example, infects small rodents and causes them to become careless, and attracted to the smell of feline urine, which increases their risk of predation and the parasite's chance of infecting a cat, its definitive host.
Mechanisms of altering the host's behavior include infection of the host's central nervous system and altered neurochemical communication.
