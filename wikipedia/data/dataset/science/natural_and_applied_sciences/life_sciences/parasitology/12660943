The International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) was created in 1958 in Budapest and is aiming to exchange information on the biology, the pathophysiology, the epidemiology, the immunology, and the clinical aspects of trichinellosis in humans and animals. Prevention is a primary goal.
Since the creation of the ICT, more than 110 members from 46 countries have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every 4 years: the International Conference on Trichinellosis. These conferences were held in Warsaw (Poland) in 1960, in Wrocław (Poland) in 1964, in Miami Beach (USA) in 1972, in Poznań (Poland) in 1976, in Noordwijk aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1980, in Val Morin (Canada) in 1984, in Alicante (Spain) in 1988, in Orvieto (Italy) in 1993, in Mexico City (Mexico) in 1996, in Fontainebleau (France) in 2000, in San Diego (USA) in 2004 and in the Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia) in 2007. The proceedings edited after each of these conferences showed the great amount of scientific knowledge exchanged there.
