Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus is an acanthocephalan parasite which lives in the intestines of pigs and other suids, and very occasionally in humans or dogs. It causes enteritis, gastritis or peritonitis. Its life cycle includes beetles of the genus Melolontha as intermediate hosts. It is known as, "Giant Thorny-Headed Worm of swine".
