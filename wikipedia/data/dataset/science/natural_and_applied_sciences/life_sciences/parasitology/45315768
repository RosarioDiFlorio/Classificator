Lee Hong Susan Lim (February 14, 1952 â€“ August 2, 2014), more commonly known as Susan Lim, was a Malaysian parasitologist who specialised on the Monogenea, a class of parasitic flatworms which are important ectoparasites of fishes. She was the first and only Malaysian commissioner elected to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Her research was mainly in the fields of taxonomy and faunistics, although in later years, she became involved in a wide range of parasitological disciplines.
She has been considered the leading monogenean specialist in South-East Asia. By describing more than 100 new species and reassigning more than 100 others, she became the sixth most productive monogenean worker (and foremost female worker) of all time. She is also noted for describing an entirely new attachment mechanism in the form of net-like structures formed by secretions from the haptor of some of her worms.
Susan Lim died from cancer in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia, on August 2, 2014, after a long illness.
