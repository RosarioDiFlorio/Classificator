Sir Edward George Sayers  (10 September 1902 – 12 May 1985) was a New Zealand doctor, parasitologist, Methodist missionary, military medical administrator, consultant physician and, from 1958 to 1968, Dean of the University of Otago, School of Medicine. Having trained as a doctor, from 1927 to 1934 he worked at the Methodist mission in the Solomon Islands where he carried out fieldwork in the treatment of malaria. The significance of this work became apparent when Sayers used his knowledge to reduce deaths of American, Australia and New Zealand military forces during the invasion of Pacific Islands during World War II. He served as a doctor with the 2nd Division 2 NZEF during 1941–42 in Greece and North Africa. In 1942 he was transferred to the Pacific to serve with the 3rd Division, 2 NZEF IP.
His 1943 handbook on malaria control, Malaria in the South Pacific, became a standard text. As a specialist in tropical diseases (malaria, dengue fever, sand-fly fever and dysentery) his work contributed to minimising deaths in the New Zealand army. The pre-war experience and malaria records of Sayers was also helpful to the United States forces in reducing malaria rates during the Solomon Islands campaign. His contribution was acknowledged by the award of the Legion of Merit by the United States.
