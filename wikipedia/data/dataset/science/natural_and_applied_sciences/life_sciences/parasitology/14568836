Muellerius capillaris (Mueller, 1889), also known as hair lungworm, is nematode parasite of small ruminants. Adult worms occur in small air passages (bronchioles, bronchioli) and in the alveoli, even in the subpleural tissue. In ruminants, parasite causes chronic bronchopneumonia. In case of massive infection or secondary bacterial infection, M. capillaris infection can cause death of the host.
