Warble fly is a name given to the genus Hypoderma, large flies which are parasitic on cattle and deer. Other names include "heel flies", "bomb flies", and "gad flies", while their larvae are often called "cattle grubs" or "wolves." Common species of warble fly include Hypoderma bovis and Hypoderma lineatum (cattle) and Hypoderma tarandi (reindeer). Larvae of Hypoderma species also have been reported in horses, sheep, goats, and humans. They have also been found on smaller mammals such as cats, squirrels, rabbits, voles, and dogs.
Adult warble flies are large, hairy, and bee-like and brown, orange, or yellow in color. The adults have vestigial mouthparts, so do not feed during their short lifespans, which can be as little as five days.
They are found on all continents of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly between 25° and 60° latitude.
