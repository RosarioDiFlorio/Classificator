Clinostomum marginatum is a species of parasitic flukes (class Trematoda). It is commonly called the "yellow grub". It is found in many freshwater fish in North America, and no fish, so far is immune to this parasite. This type of fluke can be found in the mouth of aquatic birds such as herons and egrets. They are also found commonly in the esophagus of fish-eating birds, and reptiles. Eggs of these trematodes are shed in the feces, hopefully into the water. Many aquatic birds become infected by ingesting freshwater fish that are infected. The metacercariae are found right beneath the skin or in the muscles.
Life cycle of this “yellow grub” consists of two intermediate hosts and one definitive host. The parasite’s eggs hatch in the water and the miracidium invades the foot of the snails. The cercaria leaves the snail and encysts in the muscle of the connective tissue of fresh-water species. The metacercarial stage is that is formed is then referred to as the “yellow grub”. The encysted metacercaria appears yellow, slightly oval spot, about 3 to 6 mm long. Metacercariae are common in the caudal, dorsal, and pectoral fins; on the inside surface of the operculum, and in the flesh. The adult trematode is found in the mouth and esophatus of herons and other fish-eating birds.
