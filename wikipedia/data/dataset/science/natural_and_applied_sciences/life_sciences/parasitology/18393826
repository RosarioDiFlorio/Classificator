Eucerotinae is a worldwide subfamily of the parasitic wasp family Ichneumonidae with only one genus, Euceros.
Euceros species are hyperparasitoids of Ichneumonoidea. First instar larvae hatche from eggs laid on leaf surfaces, attach to passing Lepidoptera or Symphyta larva and enter the body of an emerging primary endoparasitoid, such as a campoplegine or banchine or an attached ectoparasitoid. The genus has been variously placed in Tryphoninae and Ctenopelmatinae.
