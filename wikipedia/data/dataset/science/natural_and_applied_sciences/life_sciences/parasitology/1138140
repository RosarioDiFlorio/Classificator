Alveolar hydatid disease (AHD), also known as alveolar echinococcosis, alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolococcosis, multilocular echinococcosis, and small fox tapeworm is a form of echinococcosis, and is a disease that originates from a parasite. Although alveolar echinococcosis is rarely diagnosed in humans and is not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis, it is also still a serious disease that not only has a significantly high fatality rate but also has the potential to become an emerging disease in many countries.
