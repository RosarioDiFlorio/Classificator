Maurice Neveu-Lemaire (24 September 1872 in Montbéliard – 4 May 1951 in Paris) was a French physician and parasitologist.
After receiving his degree in natural sciences (1895), he spent several years as an intern in marine laboratories at Banyuls-sur-Mer, Roscoff and Tatihou, as well as performing duties as préparateur at the laboratory of parasitology in Paris. After receiving his medical doctorate, he participated as a physician and naturalist aboard the yacht Princesse Alice to the Canary Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde and the Azores (1901-02). During the following year, he performed similar roles as part of the Créqui Montfort et Sénéchal de la Grange mission in South America.
From 1904 to 1920, he was an associate professor to the faculty of medicine in Lyon, where for a number of years he gave lectures on parasitology. Afterwards, he was appointed chef des travaux de parasitologie to the faculty of medicine in Paris, and in 1926 he became a professor in the school of malariology at the university. During the 1920s, he conducted several scientific expeditions to the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa.
In 1901 he described a family of parasitic protists known as Haemogregarinidae. In 1924 he named several genera of parasites that affected large mammals (Khalilia, Paraquilonia, Buissonia, Henryella).
