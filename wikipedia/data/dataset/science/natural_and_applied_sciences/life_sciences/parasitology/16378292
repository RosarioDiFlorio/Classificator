Diplozoon paradoxum is a flatworm (platyhelminth) from the class Monogenea found in freshwater fishes in Asia and Europe and known for its complete monogamy. This parasite is commonly found on the gills of European cyprinid fishes. It is usually around 0.7 centimeters long (approximately the size of a fingernail) and has bilateral symmetry. It has several hooks at its mouth which it uses to grab on to the gills of a fish. From there it feeds on the blood of a Cyprinid.
They exhibit strong seasonal variation in their reproductive activity. Unlike most parasites that produce gametes all year, paradoxum gametes are produced primarily during the spring, with the highest production from May to June and continuing through the rest of the summer. The eggs of Diplozoon paradoxum are laid in a freshwater fish's gills. There it hatches into a larva stage (oncomiracidium, diporpa). It remains in that stage unless two larvae come together. Then the two larvae undergo metamorphosis and become fused.
