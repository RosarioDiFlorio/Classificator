Kleptopredation is a form of feeding in which a predator eats prey after the prey has hunted, consuming both the prey and its recent meal. The term was first used in an article published in the journal Biology Letters. Kleptopredation has been observed in nudibranchs, who may target hydroid polyps that have recently eaten zooplankton.
