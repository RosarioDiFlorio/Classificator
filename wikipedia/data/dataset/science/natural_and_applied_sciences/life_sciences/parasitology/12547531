Phengaris rebeli (formerly Maculinea rebeli), common name mountain Alcon blue, is a species of butterfly in the Lycaenidae family. It was first found and described in Styria, Austria, on Mount Hochschwab around 1700. Although it was initially classified as a subspecies of P. alcon, a European researcher, Lucien A. Berger, designated it as a separate species in 1946. Genetic similarities between P. rebeli and P. alcon have led many researchers to argue that the two are the same species and differences are due to intraspecific variation.
Although P. rebeli is found across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is difficult to determine the species' precise range due to confusion with P. alcon.
Behavioral ecologists have found its role as a brood parasite to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it does not directly oviposit in the hosts' nests. The P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring the P. rebeli caterpillars back to their nests and feed them. P. rebeli is dependent on the plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle and is vulnerable to parasitism by Ichneumon eumerus while inside the nest of M. schencki. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species vulnerable to extinction.
