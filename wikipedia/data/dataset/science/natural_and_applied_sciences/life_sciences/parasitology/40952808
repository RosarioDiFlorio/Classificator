Cuterebriasis is a parasitic disease affecting rodents, lagomorphs (hares, rabbits, pikas), felines and canines. The etiologic agent is the larval development of bot flies within the Cuterebra or Trypoderma genera, which occurs obligatorily in rodents and lagomorphs, respectively. Felines and canines serve as accidental hosts, but research suggests only by Trypoderma spp. Entrance into the body by first instar larva occurs via mucous membranes of natural orifices or open wounds as opposed to direct dermic penetration.
