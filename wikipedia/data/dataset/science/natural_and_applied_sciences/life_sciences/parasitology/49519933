Cephenemyia trompe, also known as reindeer nose bot fly, is a species of fly first described by Adolph Mod√©er in 1786. It belongs to the Cephenemyia genus of deer botflies. This fly is parasitic on reindeer. It is one of the two Cephenemyia species found in Scandinavia.
The larvae of Cephenemyia trompe infect the nose area of reindeers. The adult is active during the Arctic summer, being able to fly very fast and having developed olfactory abilities to find reindeer from long distances. Its activity, however, is inhibited by strong winds, low temperatures and rain or snow. This species has a very short pupariation time compared to other reindeer botfly species.
