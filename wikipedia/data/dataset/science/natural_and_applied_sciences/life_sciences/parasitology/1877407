Onchocerca volvulus is a nematode that causes onchocerciasis (river blindness), and is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide after trachoma. It is one of the twenty neglected tropical diseases listed by the World Heath Organisation (WHO), with elimination from certain countries expected by 2020.
John O’Neill, an Irish surgeon, first described Onchocerca volvulus in 1874 where he found it to be the causative agent of ‘craw-craw’, a skin disease found in West Africa. A Guatemalan doctor Rodolfo Robles first linked it to visual impairment in 1917.
Onchocerca volvulus is primarily found in Sub-Saharan Africa and humans are the only known definitive host. It is spread from person to person via female biting blackflies of the genus Simulium.
