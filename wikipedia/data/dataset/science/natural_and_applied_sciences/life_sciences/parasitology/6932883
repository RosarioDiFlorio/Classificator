The Ismarinae are a subfamily of wasps belonging to the family Diapriidae, containing only the single genus Ismarus. About 30 species are known in this small relictual group, all of which appear to be hyperparasitoids that parasitize Dryinidae (that attack leafhoppers).
Ismarines differ from other diapriid wasps by lacking a facial projection from which the antenna arise, and characterized by various degrees of fusion of the metasomal terga.
