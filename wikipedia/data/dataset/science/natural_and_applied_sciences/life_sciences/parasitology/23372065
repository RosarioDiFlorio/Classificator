Jaroslav Flegr (born March 12, 1958) is a parasitologist, evolutionary biologist, and author of the book Frozen Evolution. He is professor of biology at Charles University in Prague, and is a member of the editorial board of the journal Neuroendocrinology Letters.
His work on how toxoplasmosis—an infection caused by the protozoan parasite T. gondii—influences personality, sex ratios, and rates of traffic accidents, has received coverage in The Atlantic, Salon, and The Guardian. Flegr maintains that toxoplasmosis might increase the rate of traffic accidents by as much as one million collisions per year. He also believes that T. gondii contributes to suicides and mental disorders such as schizophrenia.
