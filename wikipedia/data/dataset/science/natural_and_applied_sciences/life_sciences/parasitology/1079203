Hookworm infection is an infection by a type of intestinal parasite in the roundworm group. Initially there may be itching and a rash at the site of infection. There may be no symptoms in those only affected by a few worms. In those infected by many worms there may be abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and feeling tired. The mental and physical development of children may be affected. Anemia may result.
Two species of hookworms that commonly infect humans are Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Hookworm eggs occur in the stool of infected people. If these end up in the environment, they can hatch into immature worms, which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope.
The disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.
Hookworm infected about 428 million in 2015. Heavy infections can occur in both children and adults but are less common in adults. It is rarely fatal. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and classified as a neglected tropical disease.
