Ablerus is a genus of chalcid wasps belonging to the family Aphelinidae. The genus was created by the American entolmologist Leland Ossian Howard in 1894 for the species named in that year by William Harris Ashmead as Centrodora clisiocampae. The genus Azotus was synonymized with Ablerus by Alexandre Ars√®ne Girault in 1913 and Hyatt synonymized Myocnemella with Ablerus in 1994, leaving Ablerus as the sole genus within the subfamily Azotinae. These tiny wasps are normally hyperparasitoids and are associated with the Aleyrodidae and Coccoidea as well as the eggs of a variety of other insects. Overall there are over 90 species of Ablerus.
