Artificial digestion is a laboratory technique that reduces digestible material for analytical purposes. Naturally occurring digestive agents such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid are typically used to accomplish artificial digestion.
As an example, artificial digestion is used to detect the presence of encysted trichinella larvae in suspected muscle tissue. The meat sample is dissolved by a digestive solution and the remains are examined for the presence of larvae.
