Mites are small crawling animals related to ticks and spiders. Most mites are free-living and harmless. Other mites are parasitic, and those that infest livestock animals cause many diseases that are widespread, reduce production and profit for farmers, and are expensive to control.
The invertebrate mites are arthropods with a chitinous exoskeleton and jointed limbs. Within the Arthropoda, they belong in the subclass Acari (or Acarina) and species belonging to the Acari are informally known as acarines. Although both acarines and insects (class Insecta) are studied in the fields of veterinary and medical parasitology, acarines are separated from insects by structure, feeding, lifecycles, and disease relations. Both livestock and companion animals are susceptible to mite infestation. Humans also may become infested by contagion from these domestic animals (a zoonosis). The term livestock is used in this article for all those domesticated mammals and birds that people rear for production of food, hides, wool, and draught power. Infestation by mites usually causes skin diseases known as mange, scabies, scab, demodecosis, or in general as acariasis. The causation, economic impact, and control of these diseases in livestock are described in this article. Mites that cause disease in honey bees are described in Varroa destructor.
