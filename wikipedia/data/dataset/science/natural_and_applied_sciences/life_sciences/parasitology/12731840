Nectar robbing is a foraging behavior utilized by some organisms that feed on floral nectar. "Nectar robbers" usually feed from holes bitten in flowers, rather than by entering through the flowers' natural openings. Often, nectar robbers avoid contact with the floral reproductive structures, and therefore do not facilitate plant reproduction via pollination. Because many species that act as pollinators also act as nectar robbers, nectar robbing is considered to be a form of exploitation of plant-pollinator mutualism.
Nectar robbers vary greatly in species diversity and include species of carpenter bees, bumblebees, stingless Trigona bees, solitary bees, wasps, ants, hummingbirds, passerine birds, and flowerpiercer birds. Nectar robbing mammals include a fruit bat and a squirrel which robs nectar from the ginger plant.
