The fecal–oral route (or oral–fecal route or orofecal route) describes a particular route of transmission of a disease. Pathogens in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person. Main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate sanitation (leading to open defecation), and poor hygiene practices. If soil or water bodies are polluted with fecal material, humans can be infected with water-borne diseases or soil-transmitted diseases.
Fecal contamination of food is another form of fecal-oral transmission. Washing hands properly after changing a baby’s diaper or going to the bathroom can prevent diseases from spreading.   
The common fecal-oral routes are fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food. Diseases caused by fecal-oral transmission include diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, polio and hepatitis.
