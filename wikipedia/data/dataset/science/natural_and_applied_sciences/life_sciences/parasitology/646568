Gasterophilus is a genus of parasitic flies in the family Oestridae which includes the horse botfly. They lay eggs on horses, caribou, donkeys, and similar animals, usually equines. The eggs are laid depending on the species of gasterophilus. There are two species - Gasterophilus nasalis, and gasterophilus intestinalis. Nasalis lay eggs around the mouth, eyes, nose, and chin. Intestinalis lay eggs around the lower legs, and shoulders. The eggs hatch by licking, moisture or humidity. The gasterophilus intestinalis then travel to the mouth where larvae are hatched and travel into the intestines. The gasterophilus nasalis travel to the sinus cavities and/or the brain. Gasterophilus is laid by the bot fly which looks like a bumble bee, which hovers around the ground. These can be managed and held down to a lower number by a de-worming schedule and removing the eggs with a bot comb or a grooming block. Intestinal bots in large numbers can cause gastrointestinal problems with animals.
There are exceptional cases of human babies infected by these flies.
