Léon Gaston Seurat (born 1872) was a French zoologist and parasitologist known for his investigations of fauna native to French Polynesia and North Africa.
In 1899 he submitted his graduate thesis on entomophagous Hymenoptera to the faculty of Paris, afterwards (1902–05) working as a naturalist in the South Seas, most notably in the Tuamotu and Gambier Islands. In May 1906 he began work as préparateur of zoology in the laboratory of Biologie appliquée aux colonies. Later on in his career, he was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Algiers.
Taxa with the specific epithet of seurati are named after him, a few examples being Acomys seurati (Seurat's spiny mouse), Perinereis seurati (an annelid species described by Charles Gravier in 1905)  and Calcinus seurati (Seurat's hermit crab).
