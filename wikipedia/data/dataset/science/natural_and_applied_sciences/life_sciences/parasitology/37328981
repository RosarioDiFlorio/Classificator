Huffmanela ossicola is a parasitic nematode. It has been observed in the branchial arch bone and the spinal cord bone (as well as others) of the labrid marine fishes Bodianus loxozonus, Bodianus busellatus and Bodianus perditio caught off New Caledonia. This is the first species of Huffmanela reported from bone tissue. Its eggs are only available for the continuation of the life-cycle after the host's death.
