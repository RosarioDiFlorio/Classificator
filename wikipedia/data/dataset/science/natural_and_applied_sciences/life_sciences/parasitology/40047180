FAMACHA (FAffa MAlan CHArt) is a method whereby only certain sheep or goats in a flock are selected for treatment against wireworm (also known as barbers pole worm, Haemonchus contortus). Sheep are selected for treatment based on the degree of anaemia they are displaying in their mucous membranes. In turn, the degree of anaemia is assessed through a colour guided chart.
