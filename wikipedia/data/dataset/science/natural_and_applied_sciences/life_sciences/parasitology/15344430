Pyramidelloidea is a superfamily of mostly very small sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks and micromollusks within the clade Panpulmonata.
This is a voluminous taxon: above the species level close to 400 named taxa are referred to this gastropod superfamily.
Pyramidelloidea has both fossil and recent members. They live as ectoparasites on bivalve molluscs and polychaete worms, and have a sharp, piercing stylet instead of a radula.
