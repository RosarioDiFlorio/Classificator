Acanthochondria limandae is a species of copepods in the genus Acanthochondria. They are host-specific ectoparasites of two species of flatfish: the common dab (Limanda limanda) and the European flounder (Platichthys flesus). They attach themselves to the bases of the gill arches of their hosts. They can infest as much as 2 to 30% of fish in a given population.
Acanthochondria limandae is classified under the family Chondracanthidae in the copepod order Poecilostomatoida. It was first described by the Danish zoologist Henrik Nikolai Kr√∏yer in 1863 as Chondracanthus limandae.
