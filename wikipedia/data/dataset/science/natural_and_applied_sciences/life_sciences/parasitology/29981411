Lemurpediculus verruculosus is an ectoparasite that is found on Microcebus rufus, a mouse lemur of southeastern Madagascar. It is a type of sucking louse that is found on the external ears of the mouse lemur due to the rich peripheral blood supply and sparse fur. The mouse lemur M. rufus is the only known host to this particular sucking louse, and infestations range from light to fairly heavy on the ears. The exact effect these lice have on the host is largely unknown.
Previously, only female L. verruculosus lice were recovered during one of Harry Hoogstraal's collecting expeditions, making the female louse the better-described sex. However, it has been recently discovered that there are three sexes of this ectoparasite: male, female and an instar nymph which is morphologically and reproductively different from either male or female.
