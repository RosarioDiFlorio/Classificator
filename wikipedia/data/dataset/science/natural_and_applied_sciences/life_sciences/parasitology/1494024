Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the nematode (roundworm) called Strongyloides stercoralis, or sometimes S. fülleborni which is a type of helminth. It belongs to a group of nematodes called roundworms. This intestinal worm can cause a number of symptoms in people, principally skin symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. In some people, particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated. The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests. The medication ivermectin is widely used to treat strongyloidiasis.
Strongyloidiasis is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. It is thought to affect 30–100 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical countries. It belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and worldwide efforts are aimed at eradicating the infection.
