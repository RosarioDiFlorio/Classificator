Lemurpediculus robbinsi is an ectoparasite of Crossley's dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus crossleyi A. Grandidier, in Madagascar. Both genders of the louse species are distinct from the two previously known species of Lemurpediculus, L. verruculosus (Ward) and L. petterorum Paulian.
Crossley's dwarf lemur is endangered, so its obligate parasites must also be considered endangered.
Lemurpediculus robbinsi is not yet known to be a vector of pathogens or parasites to its host.
