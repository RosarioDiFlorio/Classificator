The cat flea (scientific name Ctenocephalides felis) is an extremely common parasitic insect whose principal host is the domestic cat, although a high proportion of the fleas found on dogs also belong to this species (this despite the widespread existence of a separate and well-established "dog" flea, Ctenocephalides canis).
