Parasitoid wasps are a large group of hymenopteran superfamilies, all but the Orussoidea (wood wasps) in the wasp-waisted Apocrita. As parasitoids, they lay their eggs on or in the bodies of other arthropods, sooner or later causing the death of these hosts. Different species specialise in hosts from different insect orders, most often Lepidoptera, though some select Coleoptera, Diptera, or Hemiptera; the Pompilidae exclusively attack spiders. Parasitoid wasp species differ in which host life-stage they attack: eggs, larvae, pupae, or adults.
Parasitoidy evolved only once in the Hymenoptera, during the Permian, leading to a single clade, but the parasitic lifestyle has secondarily been lost several times including among the ants, bees, and yellowjacket wasps. As a result, the order Hymenoptera contains many families of parasitoids, intermixed with non-parasitoid groups.
Host insects have evolved a range of defences against parasitoid wasps, including hiding, wriggling, and camouflage markings.
Many parasitoid wasps are considered beneficial to humans because they naturally control agricultural pests. Some are applied commercially in biological pest control, starting in the 1920s with Encarsia formosa to control whitefly in greenhouses. Historically, parasitoidy in wasps influenced the thinking of Charles Darwin.
