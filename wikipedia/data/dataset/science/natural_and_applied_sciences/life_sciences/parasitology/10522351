The International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT) was created in 1958 in Budapest and is aiming to exchange information on the biology, the physiopathology, the epidemiology, the immunology, and the clinical aspects of trichinellosis in humans and animals. Prevention is a primary goal (see ICTweb pages). Since the creation of the ICT, its members (more than 110 from 46 countries) have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every 4 years : the International Conferences on Trichinellosis. These conferences were held in Warsaw in 1960, in Wrocław in 1964, in Miami beach in 1972, in Poznań in 1976, in Noordwijk aan Zee, Netherlands in 1980, in Val Morin in 1984, in Alicante in 1988, in Orvieto in 1993, in Mexico City in 1996, in Fontainebleau in 2000, in San Diego in 2004 and in the Plitvice national Park in 2007. The proceedings edited after each of these conferences showed the great amount of scientific knowledge exchanged there.
