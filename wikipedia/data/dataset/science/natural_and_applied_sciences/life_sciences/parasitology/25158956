Parasitic castration is the strategy, by a parasite, of blocking reproduction by its host, completely or in part. For example, Hemioniscus balani, a parasitic castrator of hermaphroditic barnacles, feeds on ovarian fluid, so that its host loses female reproductive ability but still can function as a male. This would be a case of direct parasitic castration (feeding on host gonads). Indirect strategies are also seen such as diverting host energy from gonad development or secreting castrating hormones.
The parasitic castration strategy is used by some larval trematode parasites of snails and some isopod and barnacle parasites of crustaceans. For example, 18 species of trematodes are known to parasitically castrate the California horn snail, Cerithidea californica.
