Hugh McLeod Gordon (28 March 1909 â€“ 23 April 2002) was a pioneering Australian veterinary scientist and parasitologist.
Gordon had a long and distinguished career in veterinary research, becoming a world-renowned expert in the field of veterinary parasitology. Amongst his most important contributions in that field was the discovery that phenothiazine was a safe and effective anthelmintic in sheep and cattle. This discovery, along with the recognition that this compound could be manufactured locally, saved Australian sheep farmers millions of dollars.
