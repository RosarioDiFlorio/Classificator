Tapeworm infection is the infestation of the digestive tract by a species of parasitic flatworm (known as a cestode), called tapeworms. Live tapeworm larvae grouped in cysts (coenuri)are sometimes ingested by consuming undercooked meat. Once inside the digestive tract, a larva can grow into a very large adult tapeworm. Additionally, many tapeworm larvae cause symptoms in an intermediate host. For example, cysticercosis is a disease involving larval tapeworms in the human body.
