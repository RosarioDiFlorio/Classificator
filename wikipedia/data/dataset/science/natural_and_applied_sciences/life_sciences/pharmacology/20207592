JNJ-5207852 is a histamine antagonist selective for the H3 subtype. It has stimulant and nootropic effects in animal studies, and has been suggested as a possible treatment for memory defects associated with epilepsy. JNJ-5207852 itself did not progress to clinical development due to poor pharmacokinetic characteristics, but the related compound JNJ-17216498 is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of narcolepsy.
