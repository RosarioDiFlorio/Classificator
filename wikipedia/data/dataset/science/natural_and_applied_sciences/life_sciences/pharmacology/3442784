Pharmacy and Therapeutics is a committee at a hospital or an insurance plan that meets to decide which drugs will appear on that entity's drug formulary. The committee usually consists of both physicians and pharmacists. They must weigh the costs and benefits of each drug and decide which ones a person and the most efficacy per dollar. This is one aspect of pharmaceutical policy.
Most generic drugs are available on formularies, except in cases where that class of drugs are no longer considered safe and efficacious. For instance most formularies will not cover barbiturates since their therapeutic index is low compared to benzodiazepines. Barbiturates have a danger of overdosing that occurs at a smaller milligram range than the benzodiazepines.
