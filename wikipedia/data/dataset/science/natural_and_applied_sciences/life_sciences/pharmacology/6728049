10-Deacetylbaccatins are a series of closely related natural organic compounds isolated from the yew tree (Genera Taxus). 10-Deacetylbaccatin III is a precursor to the anti-cancer drug docetaxel (Taxotere).
10-deacetylbaccatin III 10-O-acetyltransferase converts 10-deacetylbaccatin to baccatin III:
acetyl-CoA + 10-deacetylbaccatin III â‡Œ CoA + baccatin III
