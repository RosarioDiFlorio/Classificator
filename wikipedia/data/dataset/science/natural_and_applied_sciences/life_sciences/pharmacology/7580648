The WHO Adverse Reactions Terminology (WHOART) is a dictionary meant to serve as a basis for rational coding of adverse reaction terms. The system is maintained by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC), the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. The system is no longer actively maintained.
