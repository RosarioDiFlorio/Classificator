Pomalidomide (INN; marketed as Pomalyst in the U.S. and Imnovid in the EU and Russia) is a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is anti-angiogenic and also acts as an immunomodulator.
Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It has been approved for use in people who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013.
