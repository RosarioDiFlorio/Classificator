The defined daily dose (DDD) is a statistical measure of drug consumption, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is used to standardize the comparison of drug usage between different drugs or between different health care environments. The DDD is not to be confused with the therapeutic dose or with the dose actually prescribed by a physician for an individual patient.
The WHO's definition is: "The DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."
