Pâteçassaïé was a brand of fluoride-free, herbal toothpaste produced in Bangui, Central African Republic, from 1923 until the factory's closure in 1966. The toothpaste was notable for being one of the first locally manufactured toothpastes in what was the French colony of Ubangi-Shari, and the formula was loosely based on dentifrice brands in Europe, whilst using a mixture of salt and local herbs.
