Mecasermin rinfabate (INN, USAN) (brand name Iplex), also known as rhIGF-1/rhIGFBP-3, is a drug consisting of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) which is used for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease).
It is similar in action to mecasermin, but with fewer side effects (such as hypoglycemia).
