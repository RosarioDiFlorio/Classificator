Metacresol purple or m-cresol purple, also called m-cresolsulfonphthalein is a triarylmethane dye and a pH indicator that is used in medicine to detect end-tidal carbon dioxide to ensure successful tracheal intubation in an emergency as the indicator inside a colorimetric carbon dioxide detector.
In colometric capnography the indicator is incorporated in a matrix that provides a pH just above the indicator's colour change, it undergoes the colour change from purple to yellow with CO2; (a yellow colour often described as gold) when CO2 dissolves as CO2 is acidic.
In chemistry, it has two useful indicator ranges:
pH 1.2–2.8: red to yellow
pH 7.4–9.0: yellow to purple
