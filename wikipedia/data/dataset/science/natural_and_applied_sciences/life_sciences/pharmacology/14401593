An anti-CD22 immunotoxin is a monoclonal antibody (targeting CD22) linked to a cytotoxic agent. They are being studied in the treatment of some types of B-cell cancer.
They bind to CD22, a receptor protein on the surface of normal B cells and B-cell tumors, and, upon internalization, kill the cells.
