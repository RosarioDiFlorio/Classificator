Sacrosidase (trade name Sucraid) is a medication used to replace sucrase in people lacking this enzyme. It is available as an oral solution. Sucraid is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the therapy of the genetically determined sucrase deficiency that is part of the Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency (CSID). Sucraid assists in the breakdown of sugar/sucrase into simpler forms. Many uses for Sucraid include the relief of gastrointestinal symptoms that are associated with CSID.
Sucraid is dispensed as a clear solution, with a pale yellow tint, which has a sweet taste. Users must take with food and patients who take Sucraid can maintain a normal diet. Sucraid is packaged in two plastic bottles, each 118ml. A scoop to measure Sucraid is included within the package.
