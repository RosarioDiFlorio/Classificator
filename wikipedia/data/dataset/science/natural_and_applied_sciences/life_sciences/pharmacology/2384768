CHON is a mnemonic acronym for the four most common elements in living organisms: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.
The acronym CHNOPS, which stands for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, represents the six most important chemical elements whose covalent combinations make up most biological molecules on Earth. Sulfur is used in the amino acids cysteine and methionine. Phosphorus is an essential element in the formation of phospholipids, a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes, as they can form lipid bilayers, which keep ions, proteins, and other molecules where they are needed for cell function, and prevent them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Phosphate groups are also an essential component of the backbone of nucleic acids and are required to form ATP â€“ the main molecule used as energy powering the cell in all living creatures.
Carbonaceous asteroids are rich in CHON elements. These asteroids are the most common type, and frequently collide with Earth as meteorites. Such collisions were especially common early in Earth's history, and these impactors may have been crucial in the formation of the planet's oceans.
The simplest compounds to contain all of the CHON elements are fulminic acid and isocyanic acid (the latter of which is much more stable), having one of each atom.
