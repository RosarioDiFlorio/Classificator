Vaginal rings (also known as intravaginal rings, or V-Rings) are polymeric drug delivery devices designed to provide controlled release of drugs for intravaginal administration over extended periods of time. The ring is inserted into the vagina and provides contraception protection. Vaginal rings come in one size that fits most women.
The correlation between breast cancer and the use of vaginal rings is under investigation, but recent literature suggests that the hormones used in vaginal rings has little, if any, relation to the risk of developing breast cancer.
Several vaginal ring products are currently available, including:
Estring - a low-dose estradiol-releasing ring, manufactured from silicone elastomer, for the treatment of vaginal atrophy (atrophic vaginitis).
Femring - a low-dose estradiol-acetate releasing ring, manufactured from silicone elastomer, for the relief of hot flashes and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.
NuvaRing - a low-dose contraceptive vaginal ring, manufactured from poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), and releasing etonogestrel (a progestin) ethinylestradiol (an estrogen).
Progering, containing progesterone as a sole ingredient, is available only in Chile and Peru.
A number of other vaginal ring products are also in development.
