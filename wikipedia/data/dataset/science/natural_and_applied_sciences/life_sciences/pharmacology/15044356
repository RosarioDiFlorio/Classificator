Miotine is an anticholinesterase drug. Miotine was the first synthetic carbamate that was used clinically.
Unlike the miotine analog neostigmine, it doesn't have a quaternary ammonium group to give it a permanent positive charge. It can exist as an uncharged free base which could allow it to cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier and cause unwanted central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
