Pembrolizumab (formerly MK-3475 and lambrolizumab, trade name Keytruda) is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy. It blocks a protective mechanism on cancer cells, and allows the immune system to destroy those cancer cells. It targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor. The drug was initially used to treat metastatic melanoma. In May 2017 it was approved for any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with certain genetic qualities (mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability) without regard to the tissue type or site of the tumor, a first for the FDA.
