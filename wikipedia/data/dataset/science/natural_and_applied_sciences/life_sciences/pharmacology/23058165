A norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) is a type of drug which induces the release of norepinephrine (and epinephrine) and dopamine in the body and/or brain.
Examples of NDRAs include phenethylamine, tyramine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, cathinone, methcathinone, propylhexedrine, phenmetrazine, pemoline, 4-methylaminorex, and benzylpiperazine.
A closely related type of drug is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).
