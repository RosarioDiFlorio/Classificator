The College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) is a professional organization representing pharmacists and other healthcare professionals in the specialty areas of psychiatric and neurologic pharmacy practice within the United States. It is the only such organization representing the interests of neuropsychiatric pharmacists in the United States. In an effort to help connect patients with psychiatric pharmacists, CPNP maintains "The Mental Health Pharmacy Directory," an online search engine that includes more than 850 mental health pharmacies. As of December 2015, CPNP is a member of the Coalition on Psychiatric Emergencies (COPE) and is the only professional pharmacy organization represented on the coalition. In January 2017, CPNP was elected to membership status on the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP). CPNP is the only Board of Pharmacy Specialties accredited provider of BCPP (Board Certified Psychiatric Pharmacist) recertification products.
