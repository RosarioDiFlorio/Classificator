Iobitridol is a molecule used as a contrast medium in X-ray imaging. 45.6% of the molecular mass is contributed by the three iodine atoms.
Xenetix 300 of Guerbet (Roissy, France) contains Iobitridol in 300 mg iodine/ml concentration. Recommended mean doses are 1.1 to 2.8 ml/kg body mass corresponding to 0,33 to 0,84 g iodine/kg human body mass. Injected into veins it will be filtered out by the kidneys. It is used also to fill joints or the uterus.
Iobitridol is nonionic but water-soluble by some -OH- groups.
