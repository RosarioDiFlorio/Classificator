Perflenapent (INN/USAN), or perfluoropentane (PFP), is a fluorocarbon. It has several biomedical applications including: propellant for pressurized metered dose inhalers; gas core in microbubble ultrasound contrast agents; and occlusion therapy via the conversion of nanometer liquid droplets into micrometer sized gas microbubbles (acoustic droplet vaporization).
