Safety pharmacology is a branch of pharmacology specialising in detecting and investigating potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of new chemical entities (NCEs) on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.
Primary organ systems (so-called core battery systems) are:
Central Nervous System
Cardiovascular System
Respiratory System
Secondary organ systems of interest are:
Gastrointestinal System
Renal System
Safety pharmacology studies are required to be completed prior to human exposure (i.e., Phase I clinical trials), and regulatory guidance is provided in ICH S7A and other documents.
