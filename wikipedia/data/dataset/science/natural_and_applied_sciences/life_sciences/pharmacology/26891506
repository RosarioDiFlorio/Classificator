An ion current is the influx and/or efflux of ions through an ion channel. In electrolyte like CuSO4, NaCl, etc. there are positive and negative ions( Cu++,SO4--) These are forced to move in definite direction under the effect of external electric field causing electric current, thus in current carriers, ions are positively and negatively charged. Generally, gases are insulators of electricity but they can be ionized by applying high P.D. at low pressure or by irradiating gas with X-rays.
