Fenpropathrin (brand names Danitol, Meothrin), or fenopropathrin, is a widely used pyrethroid insecticide in agriculture and household.
A person developed Parkinson's disease after six months of daily exposure to fenpropathrin, and animal tests subsequently revealed that the compound is a dopaminergic neurotoxin. It has thus been implicated as an environmental risk factor for Parkinson's disease.
