The ProTide technology is a prodrug approach used in molecular biology and drug design. It is designed to deliver nucleotide analogues (as monophosphate) into the cell (ProTide: PROdrug + nucleoTIDE). It was discovered by Chris McGuigan (School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University) in the early 1990s.
