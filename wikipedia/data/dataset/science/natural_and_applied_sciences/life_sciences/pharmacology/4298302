The iPLEDGE program is a mandatory distribution program in the United States for isotretinoin (sold under the trade name Accutane, among others). It is intended to prevent the use of the medication during pregnancy due to the high risk of birth defects (see Teratogenicity of isoretinoin). As of March 1, 2006, patients, their doctors and their pharmacists are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to register and use a web site in order to receive this medication. The program has been of unclear benefit and has been criticized for being overly complicated.
