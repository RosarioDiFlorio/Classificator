Lumacaftor/ivacaftor (brand name Orkambi) is a combination drug available as a single pill that is used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in people who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. It is a combination drug that consists of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Ivacaftor increases the activity of the CFTR protein at the surface of epithelial cell, while lumacaftor acts as a chaperone during protein folding and increases the number of CFTR proteins that are trafficked to the cell surface. It was approved by the US FDA in July 2015.
