A love rose consists of a glass tube with a paper or plastic rose inside of it, and a bit of cork or foil on the ends to keep the rose from falling out. While ostensibly intended as romantic gifts, their primary known use is as a crack pipe by users of crack cocaine. They are commonly sold at convenience stores in the United States, particularly in inner-city locations.
Crack cocaine users remove the cork or foil from the ends, discard the rose, and put a small piece of copper scouring pad or similar metallic material into the end to act as a "filter". The pipes are not durable, and must be replaced often.
