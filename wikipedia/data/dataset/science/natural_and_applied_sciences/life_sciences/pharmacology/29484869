The site is an early drug discovery research centre with a track record of generating a succession of products in the areas of anaesthesia and psychiatry. In 2007, the Royal Society of Chemistry Malcolm Campbell Memorial Prize was awarded to researchers for its work on a new anaesthesia drug, sugammadex.
