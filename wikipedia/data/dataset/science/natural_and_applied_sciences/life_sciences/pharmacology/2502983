The estrogen patch (oestrogen patch) is a delivery system for estradiol, which is used as hormone replacement therapy to treat the problems of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, or to prevent osteoporosis. They are also used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women. The estrogen is given transdermally rather than via oral tablets, meaning that the estrogen patch carries similar risks and benefits that conventional forms of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy have, but there are also important differences.
The route of administration of estrogens may have implications for adverse effects. For example, transdermal estrogen bypasses the liver so avoids the liver effects that occur with use of oral medications, and has slightly different effects on triglycerides and cholesterol than oral estrogens. Also, the specific type of estrogen is of importance, with transdermal 17-beta estradiol not having the increased risk of venous thromboembolism seen with ethinylestradiol.
