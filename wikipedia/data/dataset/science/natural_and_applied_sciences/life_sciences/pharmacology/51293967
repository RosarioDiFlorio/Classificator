4'-Fluorocannabidiol (also known as HUF-101 and 4'-F-CBD) is a fluorinated cannabidiol derivative that has more potent anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic and anti-compulsive activity in mice compared to its parent compound. It was first synthesized in 2016, alongside 10-fluorocannabidiol diacetate and 8,9-dihydro-7-fluorocannabidiol.
