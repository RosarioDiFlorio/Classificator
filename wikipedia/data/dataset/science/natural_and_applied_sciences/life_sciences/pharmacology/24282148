Dry shampoo is a type of shampoo which reduces hair greasiness without the need for water. It is in powder form. It is typically administered from an aerosol can. Reported use in the United Kingdom estimate that 17% of women have used dry shampoo. Dry shampoo is often based on corn starch or rice starch. Some attest that daily wash-and-rinse with detergent shampoo can strip away natural oil from hair.
Evidence suggests that people in Asia used clay powder in their hair as early as the late 15th-century. The first reference of dry shampoo in the United States is from the late 1700s, when starches were used to deodorize and alter the color of wigs.
