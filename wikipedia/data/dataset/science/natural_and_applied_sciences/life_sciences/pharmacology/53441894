Branaplam, also known as LMI070 and NVS-SM1, is a highly potent, selective and orally active small molecule experimental drug being developed by Novartis to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is a pyridazine derivative that works by increasing the amount of functional survival of motor neuron protein produced by the SMN2 gene through modifying its splicing pattern.
As of March 2017, branaplam is in a phase-II clinical trial in children with SMA type 1.
