A flacon (from Late Latin flasco, meaning "bottle"; cf. "flagon") is a small, often decorative, bottle. It has an opening seal or stopper and is designed to hold valuable liquids which may deteriorate upon contact with the air. They are widespread in the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the cosmetics industry. They are generally made of glass for perfumes, but can also be made out of plastics for other uses.
