Pan-assay interference compounds, also referred to as PAINS in the assay or simply PAINS, are chemical compounds that are often false positives in high-throughput screens. PAINS tend to nonspecifically react with numerous biological targets rather than specifically affecting one desired target. A number of disruptive functional groups are shared by many PAINS.
While a number of filters have been proposed and are used in virtual screening and computer-aided drug design, the accuracy of filters with regard to compounds they flag and don't flag has been criticized.
