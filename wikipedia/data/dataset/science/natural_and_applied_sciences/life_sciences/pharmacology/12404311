An agent study is a part of a clinical trial that tests the chemotherapeutic properties of a specific substance. More specifically, an agent study is used to detect whether or not a substance can prevent or inhibit cancer. In a clinical trial, researchers perform multiple studies in order to test the potential of new cancer drugs. An agent study helps determine the potential of a substance to inhibit cancer, before more studies are done in order to further knowledge of this potential.
