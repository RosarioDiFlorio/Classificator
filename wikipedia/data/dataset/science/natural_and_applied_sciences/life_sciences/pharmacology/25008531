Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) is an experimental treatment for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A, which was developed by José Santamaría-Araujo and Guenter Schwarz at the German universities TU Braunschweig and the University of Cologne.
cPMP is a precursor to molybdenum cofactor, which is required for the enzyme activity of sulfite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase and aldehyde oxidase.
