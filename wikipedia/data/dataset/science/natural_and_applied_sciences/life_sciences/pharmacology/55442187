A bioassay is an analytical method to determine concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues. Bioassays were used to estimate the potency of agents by observing their effects on living animals (in vivo) or tissues (in vitro).
A bioassay experiment can either be qualitative or quantitative, direct or indirect. If the measured response is binary, the assay is qualititative, if not, it is quantitative.
Bioassay is used to detect biological hazards or give a quality assessment of a mixture. Bioassay is often used to monitor water quality and also sewage discharge and its impact on surrounding. It is also used to assess the environmental impact and safety of new technologies and facilities.
