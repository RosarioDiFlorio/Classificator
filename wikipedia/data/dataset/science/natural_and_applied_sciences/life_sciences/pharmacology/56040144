Coinduction in anaesthesia is a pharmacological tool whereby a combination of sedative drugs may be used to greater effect than a single agent, achieving a smoother onset of general anaesthesia. The use of coinduction allows lower doses of the same anaesthetic agents to be used which provides enhanced safety, faster recovery, fewer side-effects, and more predictable pharmacodynamics. Coinduction is used in human medicine and veterinary medicine as standard practice to provide optimum anaesthetic induction. The induction phase of anaesthesia is a critical phase involving the loss of consciousness and reactivity in the patient, and is arguably the most dangerous period of a general anaesthetic. A great variety of coinduction combinations are in use and selection is dependent on the patient's age and health, the specific situation, and the indication for anaesthesia. As with all forms of anaesthesia the resources available in the environment are a key factor.
