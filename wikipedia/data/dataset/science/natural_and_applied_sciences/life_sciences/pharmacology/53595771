Silmitasertib (INN), codenamed CX-4945, is a small-molecule inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II), a constitutively active serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is overexpressed in several types of tumors.
Silmitasertib is in clinical trials for use as an adjunct to chemotherapy in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), and in preclinical development for other cancers, including hematological and lymphoid malignancies.
In January 2017, it was granted orphan drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced cholangiocarcinoma. It is being developed by Senhwa Biosciences of Taiwan.
