Any product defined as a drug under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act must have an associated Drug Identification Number (or DIN).
The Drug Identification Number (DIN) is the 8 digit number located on the label of prescription and over-the-counter drug products that have been evaluated by the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD) and approved for sale in Canada. The DIN is typically an eight digit number.
Once a drug has been approved, the Therapeutic Products Directorate issues a DIN which permits the manufacturer to market the drug in Canada. For drugs where there is minimal market history in Canada, there is a more stringent review and the drug is required to have a Notice of Compliance and a DIN in order to be marketed in Canada.
A DIN lets the user know that the product has undergone and passed a review of its formulation, labeling and instructions for use. A drug product sold in Canada without a DIN is not in compliance with Canadian law.
The DIN is also a tool to help in the follow-up of products on the market, recall of products, inspections, and quality monitoring. A drug product can be looked up via its DIN with the Health Canada's Drug Product Database (DPD) to find specific information of drugs approved by the Ministry.
