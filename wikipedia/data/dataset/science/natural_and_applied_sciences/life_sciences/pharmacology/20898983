The HumaPen Memoir is an insulin delivery implement produced by Eli Lilly and Company. It is a needle-based injector medical drug delivery device that stores in memory a record of the last 16 injections. A similar product by the same manufacturer is the HumaPen Luxura HD, which has no memory function. The pens deliver between 1 and 30 units of insulin in half-unit increments. Insulin pen injectors use short needles to deliver precise insulin doses, and are highly portable.
