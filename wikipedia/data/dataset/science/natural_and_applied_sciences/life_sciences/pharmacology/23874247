Union des Fabricants (Unifab) was created by several pharmaceutical manufacturers in 1872, when they realised that their products were being counterfeited in Germany and came together to create the "Charte de l'Union des Fabricants".
Unifab began working for the international protection of intellectual property and for the fight against counterfeiting. It took part in drawing up the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883) and the Madrid Arrangement concerning international trademark registration (1891). Encouraged by these successes, it helped to draw up a large number of bilateral treaties to increase the protection of industrial property between France and Austria, Portugal, the United States, Greece, Peru, Russia, etc.
In France, it was recognised as a public interest organisation as early as 1877 and came under the system created by the Associations Act in 1901. It took part in the creation of the National Trade Mark and Patent Office in 1901 and recommended the creation of the first register of trademarks, which was later used as the basis for the Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (INPI, the French Industrial Property Office).
Today, Union des Fabricants includes 300 companies and professional federations based in France from all sectors of the economy. It is a unique observatory of the protection of intellectual property rights, a source of information and a discussion forum.
