The Access to Medicine Index is an independent initiative that ranks the worldâ€™s 20 largest research-based pharmaceutical companies according to their efforts to improve access to medicine in 107 low- to middle-income countries. The Index assesses how companies are making their products more available, affordable, accessible and acceptable to patients in need. By comparing companies to one another, the Index aims to stimulate pharmaceutical companies to play a bigger part in addressing the challenges of access to medicine in developing countries and to offer them insight into the activities of their peers. Furthermore, the Access to Medicine Index seeks to create a platform for stakeholders from the pharmaceutical industry, governments, investors, civil society, patient organisations and academia to gather and form a common view of how these pharmaceutical companies can make further progress.
The Access to Medicine Index is published every two years by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an international not-for-profit organisation dedicated to improving access to medicine for people in need. The organisation is based in Haarlem, The Netherlands and receives financial support from donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
