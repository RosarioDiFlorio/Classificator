The use of insect cell lines as production hosts is an emerging technology for the production of bio pharmaceuticals. There are currently more than 100 insect cell lines available for recombinant protein production with lines derived from Bombyx mori, Mamestra brassicae, Spodoptera frugiperda, Trichoplusia ni, and Drosophila melanogaster being of particular interest. Insects cell lines are used because post translational modifications of protein are possible in insect cells whereas this mechanism is not present in prokaryotic system The Sf9 is one of the most commonly used cell lines in insect cell culture.
