Neurokinin 1 (NK1) antagonists are a novel class of medications that possesses unique antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antiemetic properties. The discovery of neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists was a turning point in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.
An example of a drug in this class is aprepitant. Chemotherapy-induced emesis appears to consist of acute and delayed phases. So far, the acute phase emesis responds to 5-HT3 antagonists while the delayed phase remains difficult to control. The discovery and development of NK1 receptor antagonists have elicited antiemetic effect in both acute and especially in delayed phases of emesis. Casopitant, netupitant and rolapitant are some newer additions in this group. Rolapitant has a significantly long half-life of 160 hours and was approved by the US FDA in 2015.
The first registered clinical use of NK1 receptor antagonists was the treatment of emesis, associated with cancer chemotherapy.
