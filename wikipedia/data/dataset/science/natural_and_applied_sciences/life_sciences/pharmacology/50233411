Multidrug resistance pumps (MDR pumps) also known Multidrug efflux pumps are a type of efflux pump and P-glycoprotein. MDR pumps in the cell membrane extrudes many foreign substances out of the cells and some pumps can have a broad specificity. MDR pumps exist in animals, fungi, and bacteria and likely evolved as a defense mechanism against harmful substances. There are seven families of MDRs and are grouped by homology, energy source, and overall structure. Extrusion of compounds by efflux pumps is energy dependent on either ATP hydrolysis or ion electrochemical gradients. The increased use in antibiotics has resulted in a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. Pathogenic bacterial and fungal species have developed MDR pumps which efflux out many antibiotics and antifungals rendering them useless against an infection.
