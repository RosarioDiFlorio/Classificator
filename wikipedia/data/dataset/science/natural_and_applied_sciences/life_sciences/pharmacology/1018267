A jet injector is a type of medical injecting syringe that uses a high-pressure narrow jet of the injection liquid instead of a hypodermic needle to penetrate the epidermis. It is powered by compressed air or gas, either from a pressure hose from a large cylinder, or from a built-in gas cartridge, small cylinder, or spring (as in the MadaJet, Medijector Vision, Vitajet, Injex 23 and 30, or Insujet).
Jet injectors were used for mass vaccination, and as an alternative to needle syringes for diabetics to inject insulin. As well as health uses, similar devices are used in other industries to inject grease or other fluid.
The term "hypospray," although better known within science-fiction, originates from an actual jet injector known as the Hypospray and has been cited within several scientific articles.
