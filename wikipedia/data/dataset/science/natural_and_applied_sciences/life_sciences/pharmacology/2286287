Iotrolan (trade name Isovist) is a radiocontrast agent, a substance used to improve the visibility of body structures on images obtained by X-ray techniques. It is particularly used to image spaces surrounding the central nervous system, such as the ventricles, after injection into the cerebrospinal fluid. It can also be used to image joint spaces and in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
Chemically, the substance is a dimer of triiodinated isophthalic acid derivatives.
