Corticorelin (INN) is a diagnostic agent. It is a synthetic form of human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH).
The corticorelin stimulation test helps to differentiate between the etiologies of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent hypercortisolism. It is used to evaluate the status of the pituitary-adrenal axis in the differentiation of a pituitary source from an ectopic source of excessive ACTH secretion.
If corticorelin injection increases plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol, a diagnosis of Cushing's disease is achieved (ACTH of pituitary origin).
If corticorelin injection leads to little or no response in plasma levels of ACTH or cortisol, a diagnosis of ectopic ACTH syndrome is confirmed.
