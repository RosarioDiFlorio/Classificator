Intraperitoneal injection or IP injection is the injection of a substance into the peritoneum (body cavity). It is more often applied to animals than to humans. In general, it is preferred when large amounts of blood replacement fluids are needed or when low blood pressure or other problems prevent the use of a suitable blood vessel for intravenous injection.
In animals, it is used predominantly in veterinary medicine and animal testing for the administration of systemic drugs and fluids because of the ease of administration compared with other parenteral methods.
In humans, the method is widely used to administer chemotherapy drugs to treat some cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. Fluids are injected intraperitoneally in infants, also used for peritonial dialysis. Although controversial, that specific use has been recommended as a standard of care.
