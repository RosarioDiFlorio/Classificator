The contraceptive sponge combines barrier and spermicidal methods to prevent conception.
Three brands are marketed: Pharmatex, Protectaid and Today. Pharmatex is marketed in France and the province of Quebec; Protectaid in the rest of Canada and Europe; and Today in the United States.
Sponges work in two ways. First, the sponge is inserted into the vagina, so it can cover the cervix and prevent any sperm from entering the uterus. Secondly, the sponge is produced with spermicide already inside of it, which is used to prevent the sperm from moving.
The sponges are inserted vaginally prior to intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective. Sponges provide no protection from venereal diseases (VD).
