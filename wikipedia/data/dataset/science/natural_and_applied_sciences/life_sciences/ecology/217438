A parasitoid is an organism that spends a significant portion of its life history attached to or within a single host organism in a relationship where the host is ultimately killed. Parasitoidy is one of six major evolutionary strategies within parasitism, distinguished by the fatal prognosis for the host. Because the host is killed the strategy is close to predation.
There are parasitoids in a wide variety of taxa, including microbial diseases, plants, crustaceans, insects, and vertebrates. Among the Hymenoptera, the ichneumons and many wasps are highly specialised for a parasitoidal way of life. Some parasitoidal wasps are used in biological pest control. Parasitoids are found in some other insect groups, including the Diptera.
The biology of parasitoidy has inspired science fiction authors and scriptwriters to create numerous parasitoidal aliens that kill their human hosts, including the alien species in Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien.
