Eco-industrial development (EID) is a framework for industry to develop while reducing its impact on the environment. It uses a closed loop production cycle to tackle a broad set of environmental challenges such as soil and water pollution, desertification, species preservation, energy management, by-product synergy, resource efficiency, air quality, etc.
Mutually beneficial connections among industry, natural systems, energy, material and local communities become central factors in designing industrial production processes.
The approach itself is largely voluntary and market-driven but often pressed ahead by favorable government treatment or efforts of development co-operation.
