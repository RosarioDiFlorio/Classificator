Art pop (also typeset as art-pop or artpop) is a loosely defined style of pop music influenced by pop art and its integration of high and low culture, and which emphasizes the manipulation of signs, style, and gesture over personal expression. Drawing on postmodern approaches and art theories as well as other forms of art, such as fine art, fashion, cinema, and avant-garde literature,  art pop artists deviate from traditional rock music conventions and pop audiences, exploring ideas such as pop's status as commercial art, notions of artifice, the self as a construction, and questions of historical authenticity.
Starting in the mid 1960s, British and American pop musicians began incorporating the ideas of the pop art movement and pseudo-symphonic textures to their recordings. English art pop musicians drew from their art school studies, while in America the style intersected with the Beat Generation and folk music's subsequent singer-songwriter movement. After its "golden age" among some glam rock artists who embraced theatricality and throwaway pop culture in the 1970s, art pop's traditions would be continued in styles such as post-punk, industrial music, and synthpop, as well as the British New Romantic scene of the 1980s. The genre further developed with artists who rejected conventional rock instrumentation and structure in favor of dance styles and the synthesizer. The 2010s saw new art pop trends develop, such as hip hop artists drawing on visual art and vaporwave artists exploring elements of contemporary capitalism.
