Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. The biologist Orator F. Cook coined the term 'speciation' in 1906 for the splitting of lineages or "cladogenesis", as opposed to "anagenesis" or "phyletic evolution" within lineages. Charles Darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation in his 1859 book The Origin of Species. He also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism, but found it problematic.
There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. Speciation may also be induced artificially, through animal husbandry, agriculture, or laboratory experiments. Whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the subject matter of much ongoing discussion.
