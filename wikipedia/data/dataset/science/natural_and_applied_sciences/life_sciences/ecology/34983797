Taylor's law (also known as Taylor's power law) is an empirical law in ecology that relates the variance of the number of individuals of a species per unit area of habitat to the corresponding mean by a power law relationship. It is named after the ecologist who first proposed it in 1961, Lionel Roy Taylor (1924â€“2007). Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean.
