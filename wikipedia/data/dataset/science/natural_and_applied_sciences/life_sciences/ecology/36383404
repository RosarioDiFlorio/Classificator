Bezlotoxumab (trade name Zinplava) is a human monoclonal antibody designed for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infections.
This drug, along with actoxumab, was developed through Phase II efficacy trials by a partnership between Medarex Inc and MassBiologics of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The project was then licensed to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp for further development and commercialization.
Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies which bind Clostridium difficile (C diff) toxins A and B, respectively.
A Phase III trial only showed a benefit from bezlotoxumab; the combination of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab worked no better to prevent recurrence of C.difficile associated diarrhea than bezlotoxumab alone.
