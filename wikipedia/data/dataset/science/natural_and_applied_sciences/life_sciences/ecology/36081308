Monodominance is an ecological condition in which more than 60% of the tree canopy comprises a single species of tree. Although monodominance is studied across different regions, most research focuses on the many prominent species in tropical forests. Connel and Lowman, originally called it single-dominance. Conventional explanations of biodiversity in tropical forests in the decades prior to Connel and Lowman's work either ignored monodominance entirely or predicted that it would not exist.
Connel and Lowman hypothesized two contrasting mechanisms by which dominance can be attained. The first is by fast regrowth in unstable habitats with high disturbance rates. The second is through competitive exclusion in stable habitats that have low disturbance rates. Explanations of persistent monodominace include the monodominant species being more resistant than others to seasonal flooding, or that the monodominance is simply a sere. With persistent monodominance, the monodominant species successfully remains so from generation to generation.
