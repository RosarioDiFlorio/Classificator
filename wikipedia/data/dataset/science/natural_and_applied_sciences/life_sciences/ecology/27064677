In macroecology and community ecology, an occupancy frequency distribution (OFD) is the distribution of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas. It was first reported in 1918 by the Danish botanist Christen C. Raunki√¶r in his study on plant communities. The OFD is also known as the species-range size distribution in literature.
