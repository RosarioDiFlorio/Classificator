Ecotropism or ecotropic (from eco – hearth and tropic – to turn towards) indicates that a pathogen, like a virus or a bacterium, has a narrow host range and can infect one or a small group of species or cell culture lines.
Ecotropism can also refer to the philosophy that for human culture to be healthy, it must exist as in an ecological niche and thereby relate appropriately with all the fields of forces of nature, organic and inorganic. The following form of the term has been used since 1990 in the publication of "Toward an Ecotropic Poetry" by the poets John Campion and John Herndon.
