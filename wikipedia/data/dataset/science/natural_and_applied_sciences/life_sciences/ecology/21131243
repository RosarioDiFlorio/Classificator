The San Joaquin Experimental Range is an ecosystem research experimental area in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The range is located in O'Neals, California, outside of the Sierra National Forest about 32 kilometres (20 mi) north of Fresno, California.
The San Joaquin Experimental Range was established after a statement on the need for an experimental area in the San Joaquin Valley foothills was prepared in 1934. The initial purpose for the San Joaquin Experimental Range was to learn how to better manage these lands. San Joaquin lands were purchased in 1934 (1,387 hectares or 3,427 acres), with additional purchases in 1936 (16 hectares or 40 acres) and 1937 (372 hectares or 919 acres). In 1938, another 64 ha were obtained under authority of the Weeks Forestry Act. Of these, 32 ha have been designated as a Research Natural Area. The San Joaquin is managed cooperatively by the Pacific Southwest Research Station of the United States Forest Service and California State University's Agricultural Foundation, primarily for research and education. Facilities include limited conference facilities, office space, barracks, and storage space available for approved research.
The range was established as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve under the designation San Joaquin Biosphere Reserve in 1976.
The range's administration is located at: San Joaquin Experimental Range USDA Forest Service Sierra Nevada Research Center 2081 East Sierra Avenue Fresno, CA 93710
with a research and lab located at: San Joaquin Experimental Range California State University-Fresno School of Agricultural Sciences and Technology 2385 East Barstow Avenue Fresno, CA 93740
