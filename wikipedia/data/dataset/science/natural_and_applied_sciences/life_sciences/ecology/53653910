A super-oxidized solution (SOS) is an electrochemically processed aqueous solution manufactured from pure water and sodium chloride (NaCl). During the electrolysis process, water molecules are pulled apart, and reactive species of chlorine and oxygen are formed.
Super-oxidized solutions have been shown to be effective disinfectants against microbes of all types. SOS is a stable, pH-neutral solution with over a one-year shelf life. The primary method of action is to denature the cell walls of single-cell organisms, such as fungus, bacteria, viruses, and spores, but leave multicellular organisms (such as human tissue) alone. SOS is commercially available in the United States as Microcyn and New Zealand and Australia as an OTC product known as Microdacyn.
In a randomized controlled trial involving forty patients with postoperative lesions on an infected diabetic foot, a super-oxidized solution was found to reduce healing times significantly more than treatment with povidone iodine.
