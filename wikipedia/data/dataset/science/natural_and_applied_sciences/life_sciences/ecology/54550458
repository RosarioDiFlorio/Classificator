Trophic coherence is a property of directed graphs (or directed networks). It is based on the concept of trophic levels used mainly in ecology, but which can be defined for directed networks in general and provides a measure of hierarchical structure among nodes. Trophic coherence is the tendency of nodes to fall into well-defined trophic levels. It has been related to several structural and dynamical properties of directed networks, including the prevalence of cycles and network motifs, ecological stability, intervality, and spreading processes like epidemics and neuronal avalanches.
