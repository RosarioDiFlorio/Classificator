The Hog Farm is an organization considered to be America's longest running hippie commune. With beginnings as a collective, first in North Hollywood, then, after moving, taking its name from its actual hog farm domicile in Tujunga, California. The group, founded in the mid-1960s by peace activist and clown Wavy Gravy (formerly Hugh Romney) and his actress wife, Jahanara Romney (formerly Bonnie Jean Beecher), evolved into a "mobile, hallucination-extended family", active internationally in both music and politics.
