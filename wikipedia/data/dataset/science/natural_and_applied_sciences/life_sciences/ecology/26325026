Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are generated by immune activation of cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells). They are generally CD8+, which makes them MHC class I restricted. CTLs are able to eliminate most cells in the body since most nucleated cells express class I MHC molecules. The CTL-mediated immune system can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, functional effector CTLs are generated from naive Tc cells through activation and differentiation. In the second phase, affector CTLs destroy target cells by recognizing the antigen-MHC class I complex.
