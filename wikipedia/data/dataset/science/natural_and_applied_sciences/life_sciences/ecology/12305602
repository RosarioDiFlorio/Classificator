An ecological relationship is the relationship between an organism in its ecosystem. All organisms in an ecosystem are connected in one way or another. Each interaction depends on the one before it. Each population interacts with one another in a complex web of relations. Ecological relationships help better to describe how they are connected.
There are ecological relationships in which two are oppositional and four are symbiotic. The oppositional relationships are predation and competition. The symbiotic relationships are mutualism, commensalism, amensalism , neutralism , cooperation and parasitism.
The ecological relationship an organism has depends on the way the organism adapted to its environmental pressures on evolutionary basis.
