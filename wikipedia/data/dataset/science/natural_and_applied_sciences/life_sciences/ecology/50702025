A material passport is a document consisting of all the materials that are included in a product or construction. It consist of a set of data describing defined characteristics of materials in products, which give them value for recovery, recycling and re-use.
The core idea behind the concept is that a material passport will contribute to a more "circular economy", in which materials are being recovered, recycled and/or re-used in an open traded material market. The concept of the 'material passportâ€™ is currently being developed by multiple parties in mainly European countries. A possible second-hand material market or material-bank could become a reality in the future.
Similar concepts are being developed by several parties. Other names for the material passport are:
Circularity passport 
Cradle-to-cradle passport 
Product passport
