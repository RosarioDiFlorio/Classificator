Migration, in ecology, is the large-scale movement of members of a species to a different environment. Migration is a natural behavior and component of the life cycle of many species of mobile organisms, not limited to animals. It is often cyclical, frequently occurring on a seasonal basis, and in some cases on a daily basis. Species migrate to take advantage of more favorable conditions with respect to food availability, safety from predation, mating opportunity, or other environmental factors. Types of migration include:
Animal migration, the physical movement by animals from one area to another
Bird migration, the regular seasonal journey undertaken by many species of birds
Reverse migration, a phenomenon in bird migration

Fish migration, the regular journey of fish
Insect migration, the seasonal movement of insects
Lepidoptera migration, the movement of butterflies and moths

Diel vertical migration, a daily migration undertaken by some ocean organisms
