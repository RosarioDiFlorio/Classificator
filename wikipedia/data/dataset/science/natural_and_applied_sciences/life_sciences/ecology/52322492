GS-5734 is an antiviral drug, a novel nucleotide analog prodrug. It was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for filovirus infections such as Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus, though it has subsequently also been found to show reasonable antiviral activity against more distantly related viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, and MERS-coronavirus. GS-5734 was rapidly pushed through clinical trials due to the 2013â€“2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic crisis, eventually being used in at least one human patient despite its early development stage at the time. Preliminary results have been promising, and further clinical trials are planned.
