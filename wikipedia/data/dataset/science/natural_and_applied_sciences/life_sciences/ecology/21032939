Enediynes are organic compounds containing two triple bonds and one double bond. The term is usually used to describe a class of bacterial natural products characterized by either nine- and ten-membered rings in which the double bond lies between the two triple bonds. Many of these compounds are capable of undergoing Bergman cyclization. The resulting diradical, a 1,4-dehydrobenzene derivative, is capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms from the sugar backbone of DNA which results in strand scission.
