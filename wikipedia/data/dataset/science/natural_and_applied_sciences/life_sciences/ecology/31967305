Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA, Dacthal) is an organic compound with the formula C6Cl4(CO2CH3)2. It is a colourless solid, although commercial samples can be off white. DCPA is the dimethyl ester of tetrachloroterephthalic acid. It is used as a preemergent herbicide. It kills grass and many common weeds without killing sensitive plants such as flowers, fruits, vegetables, turf, and cotton. DCPA was first registered for use in the United States in 1958. Production of DCPA was eventually discontinued by ISK Biosciences in 1998, but the large manufacturing company AMVAC began producing the product in 2001 for use in America. Sigma-Aldrich also manufactures DCPA for use in the USA under the name Pestanal. In Australia, DCPA is the active ingredient in agchem company Farmalinx's herbicide called Dynamo 750. Currently, DCPA is only used for eggplant, kale, turnips, and sweet potatoes.
