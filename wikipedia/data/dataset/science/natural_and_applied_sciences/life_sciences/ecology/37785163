Arenicin is the name used to classify a group of antimicrobial peptides, which have shown promise as a novel drug to combat Gram-negative bacteria.
The Arenicin family consists of three different subjects, each distinct in their structure: Arenicin-1, Arenicin-2, and the most recently discovered, Arencin-3. Arenicin-1 and Arenicin-2 were identified by a Russian research group in 2004, while Arenicin-3 was discovered by a Danish biopharmaceutical company called Adenium Biotech, which once operated within Novozymes A/S.
Given the growing acquisition of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, the development of Arenicin as a novel drug treatment has been under way. Arenicin-3 has been of particular interest in the fight against urinary tract infections caused by E. coli strains. It is also being developed with the intention of treating hospital acquired infections. In both applications, there are two proposed modes of action by which Arenicin-3 interacts with the bacteria.
Adenium Biotech currently remains in the preclinical testing period of their product, Arenicin-3. Toxicology, drug efficacy, and other information have yet to be determined with further research completed in clinical settings. However, with Gram-negative bacteria causing 65% of hospital-acquired infections, the commercial market for Arenicin is large.
