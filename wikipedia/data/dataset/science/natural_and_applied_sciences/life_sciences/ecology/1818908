Emile Francisco de Antonio (May 14, 1919 – December 15, 1989) was an American director and producer of documentary films, usually detailing political, social, and counterculture events circa 1960s–1980s. He has been referred to by scholars and critics alike, and arguably remains, “…the most important political filmmaker in the United States during the Cold War.”
