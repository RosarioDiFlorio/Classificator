Patricia Campbell Hearst (born February 20, 1954) is the granddaughter of American publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. She became internationally known for events following her 1974 kidnapping while she was a nineteen-year-old student living in Berkeley, California. Hearst was abducted by a left-wing terrorist group with twenty members known as the Symbionese Liberation Army. Later on she joined them after having come to sympathize with her captors.
Hearst was found nineteen months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes. She was held in custody, despite speculation that her family's resources would prevent her from spending time in jail. At her trial, the prosecution suggested that she had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition. She was found guilty of bank robbery. Hearst's sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter, and she was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.
