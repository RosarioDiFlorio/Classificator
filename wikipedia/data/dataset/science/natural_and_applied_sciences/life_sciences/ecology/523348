Acid rock is a loosely defined type of rock music that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage punk movement and helped launch the psychedelic subculture. The style is generally defined by heavy, distorted guitars, lyrics with drug references, and long improvised jams. Distinguishing acid rock from other genres can be tenuous, as much of the style overlaps with 1960s punk, proto-metal, and heavy, blues-based hard rock.
The term, which derives its name from lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), is sometimes deployed as a synonym of "psychedelic rock", but it may also refer to a more musically intense subgenre or sibling to the psychedelic rock style. Acid rock distinguishes itself from other psychedelic styles by having a harder, louder, or heavier sound. Developing mainly from the American West Coast, acid rock did not focus on novelty recording effects or whimsicality as much as subsequent British psychedelia. Rather, American groups emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience.
As the movement progressed into the late 1960s and 1970s, elements of acid rock split into two directions, with hard rock and heavy metal on one side and progressive rock on the other. In the 1990s, the stoner metal genre combined acid rock with other hard rock styles such as grunge, updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in acid rock and psychedelic-influenced metal.
