Mellow Yellow is the fourth album from British singer-songwriter Donovan. It was released in the US in March 1967 (Epic Records LN 24239 (monaural) / BN 26239 (rechanneled stereo), but not released in the UK because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented Sunshine Superman from a UK release. In June 1967, a cross-section of both albums was released as Sunshine Superman (Pye Records NPL 18181) in the UK. "Mellow Yellow" was the name of Donovan's hit single released the previous November.
