The Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator (SELES) is a tool for constructing and running spatio-temporal landscape models that integrate natural and anthropogenic processes (e.g. fire, insect outbreaks, logging, succession) and track indicators (e.g. age class, habitat supply, timber volumes) over long time-frames and large spatial areas. SELES extends research in the fields of landscape ecology, simulation, and ecological modelling, and is useful as a tool for research on sustainable forest management, natural disturbance modelling and habitat modelling.
