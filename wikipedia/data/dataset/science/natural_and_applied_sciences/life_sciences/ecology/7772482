An animal with the conservation status of lower risk is one with populations levels high enough to ensure its survival. Animals with this status do not qualify as being threatened or extinct, however, natural disasters or certain human activities would cause them to change to either of these classifications.
This classification is sub-divided into three types:
Conservation dependent - where cessation of current conservation measures could result in it being classified at a higher risk level.
Near threatened - close to becoming vulnerable but not meeting the criteria.
Least concern - where neither of the two above apply.
