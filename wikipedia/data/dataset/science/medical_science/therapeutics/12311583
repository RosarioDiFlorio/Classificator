StomaphyX is an endoscopic suturing system designed to treat patients who have had previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Following this surgery, the stomach pouch and stomach outlet (stoma) becomes enlarged in some patients. The StomaphyX device can be used to restrict the size of the stoma without exposing the patient to further surgical risk.
Although initial post-procedure weight loss is evident in some trials, there is doubt as to whether such results are sustained over the long term.
The StomaphyX device was patented by EndoGastric Solutions.
