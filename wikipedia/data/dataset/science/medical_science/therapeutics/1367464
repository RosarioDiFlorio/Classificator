The Milwaukee protocol, sometimes referred to as the Wisconsin protocol, is an experimental course of treatment of an infection of rabies in a human being. The treatment involves putting the patient into a chemically induced coma and administering antiviral drugs.
It was developed and named by Rodney Willoughby, Jr., following the successful treatment of Jeanna Giese. Giese, a teenager from Wisconsin, became the first patient known to have survived rabies without receiving the rabies vaccine.
