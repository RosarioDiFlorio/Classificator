Orthopathy (from the Greek ὀρθός orthos "right" and πάθος pathos "suffering") or Natural Hygiene (NH) is a set of alternative medical beliefs and practices originating from the Nature Cure movement. Proponents claim that fasting, dieting, and other lifestyle measures are all that is necessary to prevent and treat disease.
Orthopathy is against most mainstream and alternative medical treatment, with the exception of surgery in certain situations, such as for broken bones and to remove a deadly secondary cause. Orthopathy has its roots in naturopathy and first emerged in the early nineteenth century.
