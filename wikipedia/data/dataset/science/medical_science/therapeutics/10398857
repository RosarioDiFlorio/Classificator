Mountain Bike Rally, titled Cannondale Cup in North America, is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System bicycle racing video game that is a simulation of real mountain biking. The player can choose from many characters and many mountain bikes ranging from mediocre to excellent in many categories. It was the first game to support the Life Fitness Entertainment System, an exercise bike peripheral for the Super Nintendo. The North American release has the same graphics as the European release, but the names of the racers, bikes, and locations were all altered.
