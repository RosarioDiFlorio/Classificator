Manual medicine, also known as chirotherapy (from Ancient Greek χείρ cheir, "hand"), is a branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the human musculoskeletal system, and most commonly with back pain. It is partly based on the wider field of chiropractic and osteopathy, but is distinguished from these fields by being part of rational-critical scientific medicine and practised only by licensed physicians or physiotherapists. It is a non-invasive treatment regarded as complementary to other forms of treatment.
