Makoto is a game invented in Colorado in 1992. It is played in the Makoto Arena. In 2002, Makoto USA, Inc. (www.makoto-usa.com) purchased all intellectual property from the original designers and have been improving/redesigning it ever since. The current Makoto Arena bears little resemblance to the original design with the exception of the three towers and triangular design. The current Makoto Arena utilizes a Windows-based computer to control the lights and sounds of the game as well as to track scores.
