Bian stones are pointed stones that were historically used in traditional Chinese medicine. They are generally considered to be a precursor to acupuncture, utilising heated pointed stones (instead of acupuncture needles) in the treatment of back and neck pain. The stones are made from a variety of materials found along the coastline of Shandong, China.
