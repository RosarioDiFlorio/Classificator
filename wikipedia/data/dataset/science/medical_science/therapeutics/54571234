The Hunza diet consists of a series of selective food and drink intake practiced by the Hunza people of northern Pakistan that is argued by some to be unique and have long lasting effects. The diet mostly consists of raw food including nuts, fruits and seeds added with yogurt. The cooked meal, daal included with chappati, is included for dinner. It has also been advocated for being inexpensive and mostly self-producible.
