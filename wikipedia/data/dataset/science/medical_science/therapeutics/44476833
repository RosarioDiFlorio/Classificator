Plasma needling is a minimal invasive aesthetic medical procedure claiming to rejuvenate skin, reduce hyper- and hypotrophic scars as well as stretchmarks and to be able to reduce pattern hairloss by multimodal physical and biochemical cellular stimulation without the use of additional artificial substances. It basically is a combination of classical medical microneedling by Dermaroller or DermaPen, both used in Collagen induction therapy and PRP (platelet-rich plasma), the latter used in Prolotherapy as well as in the Vampire facelift. The stimulating effects on fibroblasts, cells and stemcells already shown in scientific publications regarding microneedling, and the injection of PRP, have also been tested as a combined treatment.
The term "plasma needling" began to emerge between the year 2013 and 2014. Despite the fact that plasma needling is already being performed in many clinics and practices, the efficacy of this technique has yet to be confirmed in large-scale controlled clinical trials.
