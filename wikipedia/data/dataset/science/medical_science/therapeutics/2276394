Phenmetrazine (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Preludin, and many others) is a stimulant drug that was previously used as an appetite suppressant, but has since been withdrawn from the market. It was initially replaced by its analogue phendimetrazine which functions as a prodrug to phenmetrazine, but now it is rarely prescribed, due to concerns of abuse and addiction. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a substituted amphetamine with a morpholine ring.
