The Dukan Diet is a protein-based commercial fad diet devised by Pierre Dukan. Dukan has been promoting his diet for over 30 years; it gained a wider audience after the 2000 publication of his book, The Dukan Diet, which has sold more than 7 million copies globally. The book has since been translated into 14 languages and published in 32 countries. The book was released in the United Kingdom in May 2010, and in the United States in April 2011.
It is not clear the diet has any benefit and it carries risks to kidney and cardiovascular health.
