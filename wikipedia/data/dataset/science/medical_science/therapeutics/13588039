A dermal adhesive (or skin glue) is a glue used to close wounds in the skin, as an alternative to sutures, staples or clips.
Glued closure produces less scarring and is less prone to infection than sutured or stapled closure. There is also no residual closure to remove, so follow-up visits for removal are not required.
