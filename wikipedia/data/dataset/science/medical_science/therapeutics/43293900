A Corn-free diet is a diet that excludes foods containing corn. Although allergic reactions to corn are rare, reactions can be severe and can occur from consuming raw or cooked corn as well as products that contain corn. Preventing the symptoms of food allergy can be done by avoiding the allergenic food, therefore following a corn-free diet may be recommended if a corn allergy has been diagnosed. Following a corn-free diet may be challenging, as corn and corn products are commonly found in food products across the globe.
