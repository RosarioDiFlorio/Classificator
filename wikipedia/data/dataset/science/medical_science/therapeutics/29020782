The TriBalance Yoga Method is a form of hot yoga that integrates aspects of several styles, including Ashtanga Yoga, Iyengar Yoga, Yin yoga, and therapeutic yoga. The style emphasizes mind-body-spirit union and action meditation.
One concept behind the TriBalance Method is self-discipline and modernization of an ancient tradition. One aspect of early yoga was as a martial art, which warriors would practice to be strong and limber for battles. Another is Tapas, which is a Sanskrit word that translates literally to heat. In yogic discipline it means ecstasy, burning out negativity on the journey to enlightenment. It is an egalitarian method of yoga emphasizing modifications of poses and use of props, designed to help students gradually grow strong enough to perform the full posture on their own. It emphasizes mindfulness and action-meditation. From the moment they enter the room until the moment they leave, students are asked to observe silence between classes to quiet their minds. Lastly, the TriBalance Method emphasizes helping students to uncover their practice, rather than teaching it to them.
