Elastoplast is a brand of adhesive bandages (also called sticking plasters), and medical dressings made by Beiersdorf. Beiersdorf bought UK and Commonwealth rights from Smith & Nephew in 1992. It has become a genericized trademark for "sticking plaster" in some Commonwealth countries including the United Kingdom and Australia.
In some countries in Europe Hansaplast, a brand name started by Beiersdorf in 1922, is used instead. A third trademark, named Curitas, is used in parts of Latin America.
