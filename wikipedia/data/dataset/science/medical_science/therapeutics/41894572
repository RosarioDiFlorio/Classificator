The werewolf diet, also known as the lunar diet and the moon diet, is a fad diet that centers upon users fasting according to the lunar phases. This has prompted people to nickname the diet plan the "werewolf diet" as a result. Celebrities that have endorsed the diet include Demi Moore and Madonna.
The diet is typically performed in one of two fashions: the "basic moon plan" or the "extended version". The first plan is a variation of the grapefruit diet in that individuals are only permitted to imbibe water and freshly squeezed fruit or vegetable juice. This is typically performed in a 24-hour period during either the full or new moon. The extended version requires the dieter to begin with the initial fast during the full moon and then follow a series of eating plans tailored to the various moon phases, such as not eating after 6 p.m. or eating less than normal.
