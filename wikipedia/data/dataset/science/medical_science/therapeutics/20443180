Personal Trainer: Walking, known in PAL regions as Walk with me! Do you know your walking routine? and in Japan as Aruite Wakaru Seikatsu Rhythm DS (歩いてわかる 生活リズムDS, lit. A Life Rhythm that You can Understand by Walking DS), is an exergaming application developed by Nintendo Network Service Development (Nintendo NSD) and Creatures Inc. for the Nintendo DS. The pedometer accessory was developed in-house at Nintendo NSD, while the software portion was developed in conjunction with Nintendo NSD, Creatures Inc., and Engines.
It is part of both Nintendo's Touch! Generations brand and Personal Trainer series. It is one of the very few Nintendo DS titles that support the use of Mii characters.
