Alkalinizing agents are drugs used to manage disorders associated with low pH. For example, they may be used to treat acidosis due to renal failure.
Used for oral or parenteral therapy, sodium bicarbonate is the commonly preferred alkalinizing agent. Others include potassium citrate, calcium carbonate, sodium lactate and calcium acetate.
