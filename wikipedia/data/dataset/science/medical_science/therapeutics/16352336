A thoracostomy is a small incision of the chest wall, with maintenance of the opening for drainage. It is most commonly used for the treatment of a pneumothorax. This is performed by surgeons, emergency department physicians, and paramedics, usually via needle thoracostomy or with a thoracostomy tube (chest tube).
A thoracostomy is often confused with thoracotomy, which is a larger incision commonly used to gain access to organs within the chest.
