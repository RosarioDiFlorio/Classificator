Mary Gertrude Enig (née Dracon; July 13, 1931 – September 8, 2014) was a nutritionist and researcher known for her unconventional positions on the role saturated fats play in diet and health. She promoted skepticism towards the widely held view in the scientific and medical communities that diets high in saturated fats can contribute to development of heart disease, while she advocated for a diet based on whole foods and rich in certain saturated fats.
Along with Sally Fallon, Enig co-founded the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF) in 1999. According to WAPF Vice President Kaayla Daniel, Enig died of a stroke at the age of 83.
