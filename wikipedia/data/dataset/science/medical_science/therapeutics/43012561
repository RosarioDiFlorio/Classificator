Just Dance Now is a video game in the Just Dance series developed by Ubisoft. It was released on September 25, 2014, available in both the App Store and Google Play. The trailer for the game was revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 on June 9, 2014. Without the purchase of V.I.P. an ad-supported version of the game is available. A few months prior, a beta version was available in the previously mentioned stores for most parts of Europe.
Just Dance Now is intended for people who may not have access to a console to play the original game. The app version instead uses an internet connection to the Just Dance Now website through either a television, a computer, a laptop, an iPad or a Chromecast. The device acts as a controller, much like the Wiimote, the Nintendo Wii's main controller. Multiple players may connect simultaneously, and there is no limit to the number of players allowed. The app offers one random non-VIP song (which changes weekly) for free, with other songs in the library requiring a time-limit VIP pass which can be purchased through the app or coins which can be earned by playing songs or purchasing them through the app.
