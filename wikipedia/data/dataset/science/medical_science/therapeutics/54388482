Aunt Sally is a traditional English throwing game played in pub gardens or fairgrounds dating back to the 17th Century  in which players throw sticks or battens at a model of an old woman's head. In 2011 the inaugural World Aunt Sally Open Singles Championship (WASOSC) took place at the Charlbury Beer Festival in Charlbury, West Oxfordshire which was attended by former prime minister David Cameron and the tournament has continued there annually ever since. The tournament is a knock out competition for individuals, the winner's name is engraved onto the Finings Cup Trophy and the runner-up receives a case of beer.
