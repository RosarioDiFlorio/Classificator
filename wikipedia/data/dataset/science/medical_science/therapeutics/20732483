Revision weight loss surgery is a surgical procedure that is performed on patients who have already undergone a form of bariatric surgery, and have either had complications from such surgery or have not successfully achieved significant weight loss results from the initial surgery. Procedures are usually performed laparoscopically, though open surgery may be required if prior bariatric surgery has resulted in extensive scarring.
With the increase in the number of weight loss surgeries performed every year, there are growing numbers of individuals who have experienced an unsatisfactory result from their bariatric procedures. There are several weight loss surgery options, some of which may limit later options for revision weight loss surgery.
