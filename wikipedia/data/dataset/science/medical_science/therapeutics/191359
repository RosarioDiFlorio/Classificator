Trampolining is a recreational activity, acrobatic training tool as well as a competitive Olympic sport in which athletes perform acrobatics while bouncing on a trampoline. In competition, these can include simple jumps in the straight, pike, tuck, full flip, or straddle position to more complex combinations of forward or backward somersaults and twists. Scoring is based on the difficulty and on the total seconds spent in the air. Points are deducted for bad form and horizontal displacement from the center of the bed.
Outside of the Olympics, competitions are referred to as GymSport, Trampoline Gymnastics(TG), or Gymnastics, which includes the events of Trampoline, Synchronized Trampoline, Double Mini Trampoline & Tumbling.
