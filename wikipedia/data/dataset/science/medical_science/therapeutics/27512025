P90X, or Power 90 Extreme, is a commercial home exercise regimen created by Tony Horton in 2005 and was developed as a successor to the program called "Power 90". It consists of a training program that uses cross-training and periodization, combined with a nutrition and dietary supplement plan.
The program was launched in 2005; it was heavily marketed through infomercials and was endorsed by Sheryl Crow, Michelle Obama, and Paul Ryan. The Creative Director Ned FarrFarr used a documentary approach when filming the infomercials, using raw home footage supplied by P90X graduates.

In 2010, P90X sales dropped off dramatically, however, it still represented half of Beachbodyâ€™s $430 million revenue in 2010 and had sold over 4.2 million copies.
