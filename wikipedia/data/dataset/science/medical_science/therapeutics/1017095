Sweet'n Low (stylized as Sweet'N Low) is a brand of artificial sweetener made primarily from granulated saccharin. It also contains dextrose and cream of tartar, and is distributed primarily in packets. There have been over 500 billion Sweetâ€™N Low packets produced.
Sweet'n Low is manufactured and distributed in the United States by Cumberland Packing Corporation, which also produces Sugar in the Raw and Stevia in the Raw, and in the United Kingdom by Dietary Foods Ltd. Its patent is U.S. Patent 3,625,711. The trademark of words "Sweet'n Low" and the musical staff logo is U.S. Trademark registration No. 3,317,421.
In Canada, Sweet 'n Low is made from sodium cyclamate instead of saccharin that is in the U.S. version. This is because saccharin was not allowed as a food additive in Canada beginning in 1977 when studies surfaced showing bladder cancer in laboratory rats that had been given the additive. In 2014, Canada lifted this ban when those studies were proven faulty.
Sweet'n Low has been licensed to Bernard Food Industries for a line of low-calorie baking mixes.
