Tricking is a training discipline that combines kicks with flips and twists from gymnastics as well as many dance moves and styles from breakdancing. It aims to achieve an aesthetic display of different combinations of "tricks". Tricking practitioners are commonly referred to as trickers or tricksters. Examples of tricking techniques include the 540 kick, the flashkick, the butterfly twist and the double leg.
