Hypoxia preconditioned plasma or hypoxia pre-conditioned plasma (abbreviated as HPP), is the term used to describe the (cell-free) plasma obtained after extracorporeal conditioning (i.e. culturing) of anticoagulated blood under physiological temperature (37 °C) and physiological hypoxia (1–5 %O2). Blood conditioning is typically carried out over 2 to 4 days. Since blood cells sediment over time, during conditioning, HPP can be passively separated from the blood cell components without centrifugation, a requirement for sampling normal blood plasma. Hypoxia precondtioned blood products (in Europe marketed as HYPPP®)) are currently developed as therapies for wound regeneration and skin rejuvenation.
