Tasmania has been since it was settled by Europeans, traversed in many ways, and in most cases un-recorded.
In the twenty-first century, some people have created and recorded their journeys around the island as 'events' for publicity and fund raising, with most walks mentioned here in the latter category.
A northâ€“south crossing of Australia may also include walking around Tasmania, known as a 'traversal crossing'.
Historically, the sheer volume of people walking or traversing the island in a number of ways is not traceable. Some noted nineteenth-century ventures around the island before proper roads included such ventures of the walks of Thomas Bather Moore and the Walk to the West, which involved substantial logistic issues due to terrain and lack of support.
