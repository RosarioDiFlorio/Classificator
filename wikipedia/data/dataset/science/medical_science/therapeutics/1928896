Chubby Bunny is an informal recreational and hazing game that involves the placement of an increasing number of marshmallows or similar items such as cotton balls into one's own mouth and stating a phrase that is intended to be difficult to say clearly with a filled mouth. The game is often played where marshmallows are readily available, such as around a campfire. Variations include similar-sounding phrases such as Fluffy Bunny, Fuzzy Bunny, and Chubby Monkey.
Although the origins of the game are unknown, a 1959 Peanuts comic strip shows Snoopy's mouth being filled with an increasing number of marshmallows while Charlie Brown keeps count.
