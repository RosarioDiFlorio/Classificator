In weight training, training to failure is repeating an exercise (such as the bench press) to the point of momentary muscular failure, i.e. the point where the neuromuscular system can no longer produce adequate force to overcome a specific workload.
The Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment states that training to failure is necessary for maximal hypertrophic response.
