Archery Tag is a brand of combat archery equipment.
The combat archery sport is similar to dodgeball where participants shoot one another using a bow and arrows with large foam tips. Players are eliminated when hit by an arrow, or if another player catches an arrow they shot. To avoid injury, participants wear protective facemasks and use bows with less than 30lb draw weight.
The game's rules closely resemble dodgeball. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow.
Archery Tag was invented by John Jackson of Ashley, Indiana in 2011. The game experienced a boost in popularity from the Hunger Games book and film series, which feature a bow-wielding protagonist, and Jackson staged Archery Tag games at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, mostly in the United States, but also in Russia, Peru and Saudi Arabia.
