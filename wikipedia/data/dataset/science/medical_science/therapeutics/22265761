The Halliwick Concept focuses on biophysical principles of motor control in water, in particular developing sense of balance (equilibrioception) and core stability. The Halliwick Ten-Point-Programme implements the concept in a progressive programme of mental adjustment, disengagement, and development of motor control, with an emphasis on rotational control, and applies the programme to teach physically disabled people balance control, swimming, and independence. Halliwick Aquatic Therapy (also known as Water Specific Therapy, WST), implements the concept in patient-specific aquatic therapy for application in rehabilitation of injury and disability.
