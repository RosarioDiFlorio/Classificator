A frenuloplasty of tongue is a frenuloplasty of the frenulum of tongue.
A tight frenulum in this context is sometimes referred to as "tongue-tie" which is also known as ankyloglossia. In this condition the frenulum of the tongue restricts range of motion which may interfere with breastfeeding or speech. A less extensive clipping of the lingual frenulum is known as a frenotomy.
