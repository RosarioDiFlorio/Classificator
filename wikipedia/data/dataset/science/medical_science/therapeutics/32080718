Chronotherapy, also called chronotherapeutics or chronotherapeutic drug delivery, refers to the use of circadian or other rhythmic cycles of a condition's symptoms and/or of the individual being treated in the application of therapy. Examples of this are treatments of psychiatric and somatic diseases that are administered according to a schedule that corresponds to these rhythms in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects of the therapy.
Chronotherapy is used in various clinical fields such as the treatments of asthma, cancer, hypertension, and multiple types of depression, among others seasonal affective disorder and bipolar disorder.
Chronotherapy is also becoming increasingly popular in non-clinical settings, for example on the work floor, where it is used to increase productivity and performance.
