Eleanor Laura Davan 'Ella' Mills (n√©e Woodward) (born 31 May 1991) is an English food writer and entrepreneur under the brand Deliciously Ella. She was an advocate of clean eating but turned against it after a media backlash that questioned its health benefits and says she never used the term herself. Her clean eating series of books was called by The Guardian "arguably the most successful fad diet cookbook series in recent years".
