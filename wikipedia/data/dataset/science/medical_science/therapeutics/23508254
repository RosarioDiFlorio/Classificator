NGD-4715 is a drug developed by Neurogen, which acts as a selective, non-peptide antagonist at the melanin concentrating hormone receptor MCH1. In animal studies it has anxiolytic, antidepressant and anorectic effects, and it has successfully passed Phase I clinical trials in humans.
Neurogen was acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals in August, 2009, and NGD-4715 was not listed among the key assets in the Business Wire article. All four laboratories were closed and sold, and no employees were retained. Neurogen's domain name is delisted. No reference to NGD-4715, nor MCH Antagonists exists on ligand.com as of 2011-09-04. Internet searches as of 2011-09-04 for Phase-II come up negative.
An email to Ligand Investor Relation received this response on 2011-09-07: "NGD-4715, a MCH-1 antagonist, was under development at Neurogen for obesity. Neurogen terminated the program prior to Ligandâ€™s acquisition. Ligand owns the rights and currently has no plans for further development on the compound."
