The Feldenkrais Method is a mind-body approach devised by Moshé Feldenkrais (1904–1984) that claims to reorganize connections between the brain and body and so improve body movement and psychological state. There is no good medical evidence that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits, and it is not known if it is safe or cost-effective, even though it is hard to conceive of serious risks.
