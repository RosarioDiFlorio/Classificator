Cotton pads are pads made of cotton which are used for medical or cosmetic purposes. For medical purposes, cotton pads are used to stop or prevent bleeding from minor punctures such as injections or venipuncture. They may be secured in place with tape. Cotton pads are also used in the application and the removal of makeup. Cotton pads are soft enough that they can be used to clean babies. Cotton balls have much of the same applications as cotton pads, and can be used interchangeably.
Despite their name, most modern cotton balls and pads are not made out of cotton at all but are instead made out of cheaper, bleached synthetic fibers such as polyester and nylon. In the United States, these products are frequently prominently labeled as "cotton balls" because non-woven products (of which disposable wipes, diapers and tampons are other examples) are excluded from the Federal Trade Commission's stringent labeling requirements for textile products (15 U.S.C. ยง 70j).
The specific phobia of cotton balls has been reported, but its prevalence is unknown.
