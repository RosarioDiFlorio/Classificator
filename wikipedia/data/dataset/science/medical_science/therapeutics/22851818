Diet-to-Go (DTG) is a privately held company that was founded in 1991 by Hilton Davis.
Diet-to-Go is a service that offers a national diet delivery food product and local food pickup meals. The company was formed originally as a local diet delivery company in Virginia. The company offers four types of meal plans - Low Fat Portion Controlled, Low Fat Vegetarian and Low Carb as well as Low Fat Diabetic. In 1999, the company started one of the first frozen diet meal mail-order products in the United States, making its line of products available nationwide.
The local food pick-up program is a partnership between local businesses including fitness clubs such as Gold's Gym, World Gym, One To One Fitness, Sport and Health, and other independent gyms and health clubs. Other distributors include drug stores such as Walgreens and gas stations / convenience stores such as Rotten Robbie. These locations act as fresh food pick up locations, currently in five metropolitan areas across the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington D.C.
The company's two kitchens are currently inspected daily by the USDA and follow the association guidelines of the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association. The company currently produces roughly 40,000 meals per week.
Diet-to-Go maintains a large commercial kitchen in Lorton, Virginia, and a partner kitchen in Los Angeles managed and operated by Fresh and Ready Foods.
