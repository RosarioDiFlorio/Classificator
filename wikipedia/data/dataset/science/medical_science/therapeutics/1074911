The AVPU scale (an acronym from "alert, voice, pain, unresponsive") is a system by which a health care professional can measure and record a patient's responsiveness, indicating their level of consciousness.
It is a simplification of the Glasgow Coma Scale, which assesses a patient response in three measures: Eyes, Voice and Motor skills. The AVPU scale should be assessed using these three identifiable traits, looking for the best response of each.
