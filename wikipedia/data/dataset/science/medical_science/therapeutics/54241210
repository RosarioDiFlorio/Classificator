From a subtopic: This is a redirect from a subtopic of the target article.
If the redirected subtopic could potentially have its own article in the future, then also use {{R with possibilities}} and {{R printworthy}}. If notability of the subject can be shown, then be bold and convert this redirect into an article on the subtopic.
