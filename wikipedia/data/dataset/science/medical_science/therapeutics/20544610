John A. McDougall (born May 17, 1947) is an American physician and author who has written that degenerative disease can be prevented and treated with a low-fat, whole foods, plant-based vegan diet—especially one based on starches which excludes animal foods and added vegetable oils. McDougall's diet—The McDougall Plan—is a fad diet that carries some possible disadvantages, such as a boring food choice and the risk of feeling hungry.
