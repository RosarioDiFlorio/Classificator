The term Bible Diet (or the Maker's Diet) is used to refer to a food diet promoted on radio and in books by writer and motivational speaker Jordan S. Rubin. Rubin presents the diet as based on teachings from the Book of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and other books of the Bible; he characterizes certain foods as either forbidden ("unclean") or acceptable ("clean") to God. Rubin also markets supplements associated with the diet through his two companies: Garden of Life, Inc. and Beyond Organic.
Rubin sees the diet as responsible for his recovery from Crohn's disease at the age of 19. As of 2008 no peer-reviewed scientific-journal articles had evaluated this diet. In 2004 the United States Food and Drug Administration ordered Rubin's company, Garden of Life, Inc., to stop making unsubstantiated claims about eight of its products and supplements.
The Bible Diet classifies food according to certain factors, such as:
how the food was raised, cooked or cleaned
how a particular animal lived
whether the food comes from a so-called "creeping" animal or not
the physical form of the source animal, such as whether a certain fish had fins and scales or not
While largely influenced by Jewish dietary law, the Bible Diet derives rules for determining clean and unclean foods derive from certain passages from the Bible in the books of Genesis, Proverbs, Luke, Exodus, Peter, Leviticus, Judges, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, 1 Corinthians, Habakkuk, and Daniel.
Short features (based on Rubin's book The Maker's Diet) that aired on Christian radio in the United States previously promoted Rubin as a "Biblical Health Coach". As of September 2009 these features, titled "Take a Moment for Your Health", describe Rubin as an author giving "lifestyle advice" based on his book.
Some fundamentalist Christians follow Mosaic dietary rules.
