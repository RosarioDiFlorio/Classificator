UNO Stacko is one of the many variations of the card game Uno. This game is a block-stacking tower game which combines the gameplay of Uno and that of Jenga. There are two versions of the game: the earlier version requires the use of a die, while later versions eliminate the die, making the game play closer to Jenga.
