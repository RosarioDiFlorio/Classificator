A therapy dog is a dog that might be trained to provide affection comfort and love to people in hospitals, retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, hospices, disaster areas, and to people with anxiety disorders or autism.
Therapy dogs are usually not assistance or service dogs, but can be one or both with some organizations.
In the U.S., therapy dogs are not service animals and are not afforded the same privileges as service animals are.
