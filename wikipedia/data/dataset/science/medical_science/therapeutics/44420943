Dave Asprey is an entrepreneur, businessman and author  from Albuquerque, NM. He founded Bulletproof 360, Inc. in 2013 and founded Bulletproof Nutrition Inc. in 2014.
Asprey is a "biohacker," creator of 'Bulletproof Coffee' and the 'Bulletproof diet', and authored a book describing the diet.
Asprey is also known for being early to exploit the Internet for commerce, selling caffeine-molecule t-shirts via the alt.drugs.caffeine newsgroup in 1994. Previously, Asprey held executive and director positions for technology companies including Trend Micro, Blue Coat Systems and Citrix Systems.
Dietitians point out there is no scientific basis for the claims made for the Bulletproof diet, and that any sense of alertness from Bulletproof Coffee is "just a caffeine buzz."
