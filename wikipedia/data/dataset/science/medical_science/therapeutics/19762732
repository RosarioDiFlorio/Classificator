The Suzuki frame is a medical device, used for helping heal broken fingers, especially those with deep, complex intra-articular fractures. Rubber bands are used to generate traction between two metal Kirschner wires that are inserted into the bone on either side of a fracture.
It was named after its inventor, a Japanese Dr. Suzuki who first described it in 1994.
