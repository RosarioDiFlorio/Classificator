Dietary management, also known as “foodservice management”, is the practice of providing nutritional options for individuals and groups with diet concerns through supervision of foodservices. Practitioners in dietary management, known as dietary managers, work in hospitals, long-term care facilities, restaurants, school and college cafeterias, correctional facilities, and other foodservice settings, usually implementing meal plans established by a dietitian or nutritionist. They are responsible for supervising the work of other nutrition personnel such as cooks and dietary aides.
