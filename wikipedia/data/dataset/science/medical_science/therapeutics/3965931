The complete glucose breakdown is a series of chemical reactions representing transformation of glucose to adenosine triphosphate during the normal phases of aerobic cellular respiration. It is mostly done inside the mitochondria to release the maximum amount of energy. When this is done, it must be harvested.
Pyruvate is made from glucose during the glycolysis and transformed to an acetyl group during transition reaction. The acetyl group is used in the Krebs cycle and the phase ends with the electron transport chain.
