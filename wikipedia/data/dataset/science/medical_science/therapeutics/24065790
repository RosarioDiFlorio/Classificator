Kutha (Kuttha) meat is defined as "meat of animal or fowl slaughtered slowly", as prescribed by the Muslim halal procedure. Abstaining from Kutha meat is one of the requirements for a Sikh to be an initiated Khalsa or Sahajdhari according to the code of conduct (Rehat Maryada) of Sikhism.
Both the Hindu and the Sikh communities view slow methods of killing animals negatively and forbid adherents from consuming such meat. The objection to Kutha meat has been the belief that the slow death by bleeding the animal is an inhumane way of killing animals to prepare meat. The Sikh tradition recommends the jhatka method instead, where the animal is killed is a single strike.
