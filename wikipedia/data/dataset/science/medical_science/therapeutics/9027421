Jhatka, or Chatka (jhàṭkā IPA: [tʃə̀ʈkɑ]), is meat from an animal killed instantaneously, such as by a single strike of a sword or axe to sever the head. This method of meat production is opposed to slow bleed, ritualistic slaughter (kutha) methods such as the kosher and halal (dhabihah).
Jhatka is the method of meat production demanded by many Hindus, Sikhs, and denominational Christians, while Halal is demanded by the Muslims, and Kosher by the Jews.
