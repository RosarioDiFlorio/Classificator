The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure is a 1987 health book by Robert Kowalski, who wrote it as a personal recollection about dealing with cholesterol issues. Kowalski wrote the book after having two coronary bypass surgeries and a heart attack. He created the program detailed in the book after he realized that a diet change alone would not help him, and the book is sometimes credited with popularizing oat bran as a health food. Kowalski published three other books in the 8-Week Cholesterol Cure series as well as The Blood Pressure Cure: 8 Weeks to Lower Blood Pressure without Prescription Drugs, which dealt with blood pressure.
In October 1988 a lawsuit was filed by 16 plaintiffs against Kowalski and Harper & Row. The plaintiffs alleged that following the advice listed in the book caused them emotional and physical harm and that the book was not properly researched by its author or publisher.
