Kayotsarga (Sanskrit: कायोत्सर्ग Kāyōtsarga, Jain Prakrit: काउस्सग्ग Kāussagga) is a yogic posture which is an important part of the Jain meditation. It literally means "dismissing the body". A tirthankara is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the kayotsarga posture. Kayotsarga means "to give up one's physical comfort and body movements", thus staying steady, either in a standing or other posture, and concentrating upon the true nature of the soul. It is one of the six essentials (avasyaka) of a Jain ascetic and one of the 28 primary attributes of a Digambara monk
Twenty-one of the tīrthankaras of Jainism are said to have attained moksha in the kayotsarga “standing meditation” posture. An example of unflinching standing meditation is that of Arihant Bahubali who is said to have stood in kayotsarga for a year.
