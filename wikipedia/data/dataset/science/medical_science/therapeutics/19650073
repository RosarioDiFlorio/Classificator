Sleepees is the name of an herbal remedy for sleeplessness. Sleepees was the subject of a national recall in Canada following the news that it was adulterated with the prescription drug estazolam. Sleepees was in the news again more recently when CTV's W-5 presented a special titled, "What's in the Pill?"
