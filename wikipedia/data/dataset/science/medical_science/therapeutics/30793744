The Somatosensory Rehabilitation of Neuropathic Pain, is a method whose aim is to treat conditions of a reduced sense of touch or sensation (hypoesthesia) in order to decrease neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain, with a prevalency of 6.9% of the general population, represents an important public health problem. e.g. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) concerns 2.7% of the general population.; i.e. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) concerns 26/100,000 person-years of the general population. Patients with chronic pain need every possible therapy to battle the pain. Chronic pain is not a symptom but a syndrome in its own right, and requires therapists from a wide range of disciplines.So too, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and other physical therapy procedures emerged rapidly, bringing substantial pain relief to large numbers of people.
