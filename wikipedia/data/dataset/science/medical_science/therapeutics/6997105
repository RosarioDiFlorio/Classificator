The MedicAlert Foundation is a non-profit company founded in 1956 and headquartered in Salida, California. It maintains a database of members' medical information that is made available to medical authorities in the event of an emergency. Members supply critical medical data to the organization and receive a distinctive metal bracelet or necklace tag which is worn at all times. It can be used by first responders, such as emergency medical personnel or law-enforcement agents, to access wearers' medical history and special medical needs.
The name MedicAlert may be interpreted either as the two separate words "medic alert" or as a blended form of the phrase "medical alert".
