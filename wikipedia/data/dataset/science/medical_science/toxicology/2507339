Pyrazinamide is a medication used to treat tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, muscle pains, and rash. More serious side effects include gout, liver toxicity, and sensitivity to sunlight. It is not recommended in those with significant liver disease or porphyria. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe but it is likely okay during breastfeeding. Pyrazinamide is in the antimycobacterial class of medications. It is not entirely clear how it works.
Pyrazinamide was first made in 1936 but did not come into wide use until 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Pyrazinamide is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 2.76 USD per month. In the United States it costs about 100 to 200 USD per month.
