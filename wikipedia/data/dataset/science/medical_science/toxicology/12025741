Ligustrum ovalifolium, also known as Korean privet, California privet, garden privet, and oval-leaved privet, is a shrub in the privet genus Ligustrum. 
The species is native to Japan and Korea.  It is occasionally known as Japanese privet, but is not to be confused with Ligustrum japonicum which is predominantly called by that common name.
