Afoxolaner (INN) is an insecticide and acaricide used in dogs. It is indicated for the treatment and prevention of flea infestations, and the treatment and control of tick infestations in dogs and puppies 8 weeks of age and older, weighing 4 pounds (~1.8 kilograms) of body weight or greater. It is given once a month.
Unlike most other flea treatments which are applied topically to the animal's coat, afoxolaner is administered orally in meat-flavoured tablets, and poisons fleas once they start feeding. It is used either alone or as a combination treatment with milbemycin oxime.
