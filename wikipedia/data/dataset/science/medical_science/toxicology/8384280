Cantarella was a poison allegedly used by the Borgias during the papacy of Pope Alexander VI. It was probably a variation of arsenic or cantharidin powder (made from blister beetles). The use of this poison is not well documented in any of the papal records and it was most likely conceived after 1503 as part of Pope Julius II's effort to remove his name from the records.
