Datura quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf thorn-apple or the Chinese thorn-apple, is a small shrub in the genus Datura. It can grow within dry or moist soils and requires large amount of sunlight to grow.
The species was first described in 1818 by Alexander von Humboldt. Its leaves resemble oak leaves, hence the name quercifolia. It grows in Mexico and the Southwestern United States, where it is a ground cover or an upright bush up to 3 ft. tall. It produces green colored fruit with long sharp spikes or spines. The unremarkable light blue funnel-shaped flowers are less than 2 in. long. Except for its unusual leaves, Datura quercifolia does not have much ornamental value
