Iris orjenii, (the Orjen Iris), is a rare species of iris found in Montenegro and Hercegovina on the karst landscape of Mt. Orjen. It grows in the wild on grassy slopes at 1,500 to 1,700 m (4,900 to 5,600 ft), in sunny or semi-shaded locations within Bosnian Pine communities. It is a member of the subgenus iris, meaning that it is a bearded iris, and grows from a rhizome.
