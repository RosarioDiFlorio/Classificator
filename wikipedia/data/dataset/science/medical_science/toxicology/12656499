Julius Mount Bleyer (16 March 1859 â€“ 3 April 1915) was a New York doctor who specialized in laryngology who took a keen interest in medical jurisprudence. He studied the methods used for capital punishment and as a member of a commission, was among the first to propose lethal injections in 1888. He pointed out in The Medico-Legal Journal, the problems with other methods of executing death sentences including decapitation and electrocution. Lethal injections were however not used until the late 1970s.
Bleyer was also a pioneer of photofluoroscopy, a method of visualizing x-rays to observe the functioning of internal organs. He also introduced the idea of an inhaler for delivering medication into the lungs and considered applications in laryngology that made use of sound recording instruments.
