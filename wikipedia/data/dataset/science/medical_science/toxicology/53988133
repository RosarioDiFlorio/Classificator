The acute to chronic ratio (ACR) uses acute toxicity data to gauge the chronic toxicity (MATC) of a chemical of interest to an organism. The science behind determining a safe concentration to the environment is imperfect, statistically limited, and resource intensive. There is an unfilled demand for the rapid assessment of different chemical toxicity to many different organisms. The ACR is a proposed solution to this demand.
While empirical methods are crucial to making scientific conclusions and informed decisions, best personal judgement is often the best tool to the regulator in allowing or prohibiting potentially toxic chemicals from entering the environment. This means taking into consideration information about chemical structure, physical and chemical properties including fate and transport in the environment, and most importantly toxicological data.
The ACR is mathematically the inverse of the application factor (AF), which was first proposed by Mount and Stephan (1967). It provides no new information, it simply converts AF values into whole integer numbers that are more easily comparable for researchers visually.
