Iris sambucina ('elder scented iris') is a species in the genus Iris, it is also in the subgenus of Iris. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from southern and central Europe (Germany, GB and Ireland, Italy, the Balkans, Croatia), and Spain. It has green, curved or sword-like leaves, tall round stem (with branches), multiple flowers in shades from brown violet, or brown-purple, to purple-violet, blue violet, mauve, and to purple. The large flowers are fragrant, with the scent of elderflowers, hence the name. It was once separate species (when found), then it was classified as a synonym of Iris germanica, before being classified (in some sources) as a separate species again, but with a hybrid origin from Iris pallida and Iris variegata. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions.
