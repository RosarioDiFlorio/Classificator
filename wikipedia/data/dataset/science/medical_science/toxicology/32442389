Timorex Gold is a natural botanical broad spectrum fungicide with prophylactic and curative activity, based on a plant extract of Melaleuca alternifolia. Timorex Gold is effective against a wide range of plant-pathogenic fungi, including Oomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycota, on numerous crops, including vegetables, herbs, grapevines, fruit trees, and banana. Timorex Gold has demonstrated high efficacy against Black Sigatoka (Black leaf streak disease in banana). Plants damaged by Black Sigatoka have a significant reduction in the photosynthesizing area of the leaf, and fruit yield losses can reach 50% through premature maturation.
Black Sigatoka is caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Morelet), and is considered the most damaging and costly disease of commercial banana and plantain. It originated in the Pacific region, was reported in Fiji in 1963, and since then has reached other banana producing countries. Control of this disease may require as many as 70 treatments per year using synthetic fungicides.
Timorex Gold's special formulation contains multiple components, mostly terpenes and their alcohols, which have been proven antiseptic, fungicide and bactericide properties. The unique and powerful potential of this plant extract is highly effective for control in agricultural crops while significantly reducing the chemical risk to operators and the environment.
