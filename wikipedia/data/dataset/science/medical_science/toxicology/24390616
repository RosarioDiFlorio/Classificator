Romell Broom (born June 4, 1956) is an American convicted of murder, kidnapping, and rape. He was convicted in 1984 of abducting and killing Tryna Middleton, age 14, who was walking home from a football game in East Cleveland, Ohio. In 2003, Broom accepted an offer from the state of Ohio for a DNA test to prove his innocenceâ€”however, the test results failed to exonerate him. The clemency hearing concluded that "the DNA report does not indicate an exact match, but does indicate that the likelihood of Broom [not] being the donor is 1 in 2.3 million. Otherwise stated, eight or nine other people in the country would have the same profile." Broom has repeatedly requested independent DNA retesting and a change of legal team.
Broom also has convictions for robbery, aggravated robbery and four counts of kidnap of a male child. He was also convicted in a separate incidence of raping a female child.
