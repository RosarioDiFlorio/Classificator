Lathyrus japonicus (common names sea pea, beach pea, circumpolar pea and sea vetchling) is a legume native to temperate coastal areas of Asia, Europe, and North and South America.
It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing trailing stems to 50–80 cm long, typically on sand and gravel storm beaches. The leaves are waxy glaucous green, 5–10 cm long, pinnate, with 2-5 pairs of leaflets, the terminal leaflet usually replaced by a twining tendril. The flowers are broad, with a dark purple standard petal and paler purple wing and keel petals; they are produced in racemes of up to twelve flowers.
