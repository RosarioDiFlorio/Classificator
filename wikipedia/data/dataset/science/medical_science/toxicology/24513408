The Visha Kanya (Sanskrit विष कन्या; English: Poison girl) were young women reportedly used as assassins, often against powerful enemies, during the times of the Ancient India. Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, Arthashastra, written by Chanakya, an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BCE).
