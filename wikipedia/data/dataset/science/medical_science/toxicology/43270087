eTOX is a temporary consortium established in 2010 to share and use toxicology data. It is a pre-competitive collaboration which main goal is to create and distribute tools to predict drug side-effects based on pre-clinical experiments. Aims are a better in silico predictability of potential adverse events and a decrease of the use of animals in toxicological research. eTOX is funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI).
