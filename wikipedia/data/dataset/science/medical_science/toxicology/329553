Restricted use pesticides or "RUP" are pesticides not available to the general public in the United States. The "Restricted Use" classification restricts a product, or its uses, to use by a certificated pesticide applicator or under the direct supervision of a certified applicator. This means that a license is required to purchase and apply the product. Certification programs are administered by the federal government, individual states, and by company policies that vary from state to state. This is managed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Worker Protection Standard.
Pesticides are classified as "restricted use" for a variety of reasons, such as potential for or history of groundwater contamination. Atrazine is the most widely used restricted-use herbicide, however there are over 700 such "restricted use" pesticides as of 2017. Many insecticides and fungicides used in fruit production are restricted use.
