Dichlorvos or 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (commonly abbreviated as DDVP) is a organophosphate, widely used as an insecticide to control household pests, in public health, and protecting stored product from insects. The compound has been commercially available since 1961 and has become controversial because of its prevalence in urban waterways and the fact that its toxicity extends well beyond insects.
