Human type I interferons (IFNs) are a large subgroup of interferon proteins that help regulate the activity of the immune system.
Interferons bind to interferon receptors. All type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN-Î± receptor (IFNAR) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains.
Type I IFNs are found in all mammals, and homologous (similar) molecules have been found in birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish species.
