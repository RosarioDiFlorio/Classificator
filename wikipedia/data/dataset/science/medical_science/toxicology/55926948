Pesticide standard values are applied worldwide to control pollution, since pesticides are largely applied in numerous agricultural, commercial, residential, and industrial applications. Usually, pesticide standard value is regulated in residential surface soil (i.e., pesticide soil regulatory guidance value, or RGV), drinking water (i.e., pesticide drinking water maximum concentration level, or MCL),, foods (i.e., pesticide food maximum residue level, or MRL), , and other ecological sections (e.g., air, surface water, groundwater, bed sediment, or aquatic organisms).
