The name destroying angel applies to several similar, closely related species of deadly all-white mushrooms in the genus Amanita. They are Amanita bisporigera and A. ocreata in eastern and western North America, and A. virosa in Europe. Another very similar species, A. verna or fool's mushroom was first described in France.
Closely related to the death cap (A. phalloides) they are among the most toxic known mushrooms, containing amatoxins as death caps do.
