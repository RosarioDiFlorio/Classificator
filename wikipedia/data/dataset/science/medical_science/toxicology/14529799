Derris eliptica is a species of leguminous plant from Southeast Asia and the southwest Pacific islands, including New Guinea. The roots of D. elliptica contain rotenone, a strong insecticide and fish poison.
Also known as derris powder and tuba root (in Indonesia), it was formerly used as an organic insecticide used to control pests on crops such as peas. However, due to studies revealing the extreme toxicity of rotenone to which the powder is often refined, it is unsafe: in spite of its popularity with organic growers.
Derris root, when crushed, releases rotenone. Some native residents of Fiji and New Guinea practice a form of fishing in which they crush the roots and throw them into the water. The stunned or killed fish float to the surface where they can be easily reached.
Despite its toxicity, Derris is used as a food plant by Lepidopteran larvae  including Batrachedra amydraula.
