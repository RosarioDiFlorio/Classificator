The term Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) (spraying) is used in the context of pesticide application.
Ultra-low volume application of pesticides has been defined as spraying at a Volume Application Rate (VAR) of less than 5 L/ha for field crops or less than 50 L/ha for tree/bush crops. VARs of 0.25 â€“ 2 l/ha are typical for aerial ULV application to forest or migratory pests.
ULV spraying is a well-established spraying technique and remains the standard method of locust control with pesticides and is also widely used by cotton farmers in central-southern and western Africa. It has also been used in massive aerial spraying campaigns against disease vectors such as the tse-tse fly.
A major benefit of ULV application is high work rate (i.e. hectares can be treated in one day). It is a good option if all (or some) of these conditions apply:
large area of land to treat
rapid response required
little or no water for making pesticide tank mixtures
logistical problems for supplies
difficult terrain: poor access to target site
