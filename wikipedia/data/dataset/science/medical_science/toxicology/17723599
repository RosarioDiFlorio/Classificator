Euphorbia poissonii, also known as Euphorbia poissoni  and, incorrectly as Euphorbia poisoni is a highly irritant and toxic succulent member of the large and varied spurge family of plants. It is native to northern Nigeria, where local farmers extract its latex for use as a pesticide. Its powerfully irritant and pain-producing nature mandates use as a fencing plant.
