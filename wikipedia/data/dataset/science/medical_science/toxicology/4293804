Smokeless tobacco is tobacco or a tobacco product that is used by means other than smoking. These uses include chewing, sniffing, placing the product between the teeth and gum, or application to the skin. Smokeless tobacco products are produced in various forms, such as chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, and dissolvable tobacco products. All smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine. It is highly addictive. Quitting smokeless tobacco use is as challenging as smoking cessation.
According to a report by the Royal College of Physicians, "As a way of using nicotine, the consumption of non-combustible tobacco is of the order of 10â€“1,000 times less hazardous than smoking, depending on the product". It is correlated with a number of adverse effects such as dental disease, oral cancer, oesophagus cancer, and pancreas cancer, as well as adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight. There is no safe level of smokeless tobacco use. Smokeless tobacco products contain cancer-causing chemicals. Approximately 28 chemical constituents present in smokeless tobacco are carcinogenic in nature, among which nitrosamine is the most prominent. Smokeless tobacco accounts for an abundance of deaths globally with a significant proportion of them attributed to Southeast Asia.
Smokeless tobacco consumption is widespread throughout the world. Once addicted to nicotine from smokeless tobacco use, many people, particularly young people, expand their tobacco use by smoking cigarettes. Males were more likely than females to have used smokeless tobacco in the past month.
