Atrop-abyssomicin C is a polycyclic polyketide-type natural product that is the atropisomer of abyssomicin C. It is a spirotetronate that belongs to the class of tetronate antibiotics, which includes compounds such as tetronomycin, agglomerin, and chlorothricin. In 2006, the Nicolaou group discovered atrop-abyssomicin C while working on the total synthesis of abyssomicin C. Then in 2007, SÃ¼ssmuth and co-workers isolated atrop-abyssomicin C from Verrucosispora maris AB-18-032, a marine actinomycete found in sediment of the Japanese sea. They found that atrop-abyssomicin C was the major metabolite produced by this strain, while abyssomicin C was a minor product. The molecule displays antibacterial activity by inhibiting the enzyme PabB (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase), thereby depleting the biosynthesis of p-aminobenzoate.
