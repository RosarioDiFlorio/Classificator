A watusi is a type of firecracker that is popular in the Philippines.
Its ingredients are yellow phosphorus, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, and trinitrotoluene. The ingredients in the firework are highly toxic, and ingestion can lead to painful death. In particular, children are killed by watusi fireworks after sucking on them or mistaking them for sweets. The yellow phosphorus, the most dangerous component of the watusi, may explode and rip apart the esophagus when ingested. The Philippine Department of Health is attempting to have the sale of watusi fireworks to children banned to prevent these deaths.
