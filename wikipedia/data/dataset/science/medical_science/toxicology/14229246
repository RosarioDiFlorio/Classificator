Phytotherapy Research is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal publishing original research papers, short communications, reviews, and letters on medicinal plant research. Key areas of interest are pharmacology, toxicology, and the clinical applications of herbs and natural products in medicine, from case histories to full clinical trials, including studies of herb-drug interactions and other aspects of the safety of herbal medicines. Papers concerned with the effects of common food ingredients and standardised plant extracts, including commercial products, are particularly relevant, as are mechanistic studies on isolated natural products.
The editors-in-chief are Elizabeth M. Williamson (University of Reading), Angelo Izzo (University of Naples), Sung-Hoon Kim (Kyung Hee University) and Rajan Radhakrishnan (Roseman University of Health Sciences).
