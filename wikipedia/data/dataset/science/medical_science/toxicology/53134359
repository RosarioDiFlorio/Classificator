Bacteria live in complex multispecies communities such as biofilms and human-associated microbiotas. The dynamics and structure of these communities are greatly influenced by interbacterial competition through the secretion of toxic effectors. Bacteria have evolved several systems to outcompete their neighbors by poisoning them through a contact-dependent killing (including effectors of type V and VI secretion systems) or the release of soluble toxins (including colicins) in the environment. Polymorphic toxins are multi-domain proteins primarily involved in competition between bacteria but also involved in pathogenesis when injected in eukaryotic cells. They are found in all major bacterial clades.
