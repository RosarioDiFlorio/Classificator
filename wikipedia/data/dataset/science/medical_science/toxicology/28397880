Carcinogenesis is a peer-reviewed medical journal in the field of cancer biology. It was established in 1980 and is published monthly by Oxford University Press. As of 2010, the editor-in-chief is Curtis C. Harris (National Cancer Institute). Carcinogenesis publishes articles in four sections: cancer biology covers the cell and molecular biology of cancer, as well as mutation and DNA repair; molecular epidemiology includes genetic predisposition to cancer; cancer prevention covers chemoprophylaxis as well as dietary factors; and carcinogenesis covers all forms of carcinogens, including their metabolism and detection in the environment. Authors can pay to have their articles released freely online as part of a hybrid open access scheme. Free or reduced-rate online access is available to educational institutions in low-income countries.
