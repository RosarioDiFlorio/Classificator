Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus within the Pezizaceae family. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria, commonly known as the pink crown, the violet crown-cup, or the violet star cup. It is a whitish or grayish cup fungus, distinguished by the manner in which the cup splits into lobes from the top downward. It is commonly found in the mountains in coniferous woods under humus on the forest floor, and often appears after the snow melts in late spring and early summer. The fungus is widespread, and has been collected in Europe, Israel and the Asian part of Turkey, North Africa, and North America. In Europe, it is considered a threatened species in 14 countries. Although several taxa have been described as Sarcosphaera species since the introduction of the genus in 1869, most lack modern descriptions, have been transferred to the related genus Peziza, or are considered synonymous with S. coronaria.
The fruit body, typically found partially buried in soil, is initially like a fleshy hollow ball, and may be mistaken for a puffball. Unlike the latter, it splits open from the top downwards to form a cup with five to ten pointed rays, reaching up to 12 cm (4.7 in) in diameter. It is lavender-brown on the inside surface, and whitish outside, but usually dingy from adhering soil. Characteristic microscopic features include asci that are amyloid (so their tips stain blue at the tip with iodine), and smooth, blunt-ended, ellipsoid spores with large oil droplets. Sarcosphaera coronaria—once thought to be a good edible—is not recommended for consumption, after several reports of poisonings causing stomach aches, and in one instance, death. The fruit bodies are known to bioaccumulate the toxic metalloid arsenic from the soil.
