Gentamicin, sold under brand names Garamycin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others. It is not effective for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections. It can be given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, or topically. Topical formulations may be used in burns or for infections of the outside of the eye. In the developed world it is often only used for two days until bacterial cultures determine what antibiotics the infection is sensitive to. The dose required should be monitored by blood testing.
Gentamicin can cause inner ear problems and kidney problems. The inner ear problems can include problems with balance and problems with hearing. These problems may be permanent. If used during pregnancy it can cause harm to the baby. It appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding. Gentamicin is a type of aminoglycoside. It works by stopping the bacteria from making protein, which typically kills the bacteria.
Gentamicin was discovered in 1963. It is made from the bacteria Micromonospora purpurea. Gentamicin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The injectable's wholesale cost in the developing world in 2014 was between US$0.05 and US$0.58 per ml.
