Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal which covers legal aspects of toxicological and pharmacological regulations. It is published by Elsevier on behalf of the International Society of Regulatory Toxicology & Pharmacology. The current editor-in-chief is Gio Batta Gori. The journal is financed in part by the tobacco, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.
In 2002, a group of 45 academics wrote a letter accusing the journal of a concealed pro-industry bias, a possible lack of full and independent peer review, and a failure to disclose conflicts of interest, citing a case in which Gori was paid $30,000 by the Tobacco Institute to write an article later published in the journal dismissing the health risks of secondhand smoke. The letter's coordinator later commented that the journal "reads like an industry trade publication, but it's masked as a peer-reviewed journal" and that it lacked any "credible peer-review process." In response, the journal's publisher implemented a conflict of interest disclosure policy at the journal in January 2003, shortly before the correspondence was published.
