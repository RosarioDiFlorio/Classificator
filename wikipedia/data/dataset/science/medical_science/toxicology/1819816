Envenomation is the process by which venom is injected into some animal by the bite (or sting) of a venomous animal.
Many kinds of animals, including mammals (e.g., the northern short-tailed shrew, Blarina brevicauda), reptiles (e.g., the king cobra) spiders (e.g., black widows), and insects (e.g., wasps, honey bees, ants and caterpillars), employ venom for hunting and for self-defense.
