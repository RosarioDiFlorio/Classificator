Trichosanthes is a genus of tropical and subtropical vines. They belong to the cucumber family (Cucurbitaceae), and are closely related to Gymnopetalum. Hodgsonia, formerly included here, is usually considered a well-distinct genus nowadays.
The shoots, tendrils, and leaves of some or possibly all species may be eaten as greens, and at least two species (serpent gourd, T. cucumerina, and pointed gourd, T. dioica) are grown commercially for their fleshy fruits used as vegetables, most popular in South Asia and Southeast Asia. At least two species (T. kirilowii and T. rosthornii) are grown for use in traditional Chinese medicine, where they are called the name gualou (Chinese: 瓜蒌; pinyin: guālóu). Trichosanthes is also known as a medicinal as well as poisonous plant in India. The herb has shown an ability to reduce chest congestion by breaking down phlegm and aiding in its removal from the lungs.
