Antivenom, also known as antivenin, venom antiserum and antivenom immunoglobulin, is a medication made from antibodies which is used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. They are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. It is given by injection.
Side effects may be severe. They include serum sickness, shortness of breath, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Antivenom is made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal's blood and purified. Versions are available for spider bites, snake bites, fish stings, and scorpion stings.
Antivenom was first developed in the late 1800s and came into common use in the 1950s. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Depending on the type, the wholesale cost in the developing world is 9.00 to 118.80 USD per vial. In the United States the wholesale cost is as high as 2,300 USD per dose.
