XF-73 (Exeporfinium chloride) is an experimental drug candidate. It is an anti-microbial that works via weakening bacteria cell walls. It is a potential treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and possibly Clostridium difficile. It is being developed by Destiny Pharma Ltd.
Structurally it is a dicationic porphyrin.
It has completed a phase I clinical trial for nasal decolonisation of MRSAâ€”being tested against 5 bacterial strains. It seems unlikely to cause MRSA to develop resistance to it.
In 2014 a phase 1 clinical trial for nasal administration was run.
As of February 2016 another phase 1 clinical trial (for nasal administration) is recruiting.
