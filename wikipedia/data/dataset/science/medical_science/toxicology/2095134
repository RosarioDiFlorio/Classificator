The oligodynamic effect (from Greek oligos "few", and dynamis "force") is a biocidal effect of metals, especially heavy metals, that occurs even in low concentrations. The effect was discovered by Karl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli, although he did not identify the cause. Brass doorknobs and silverware both exhibit this effect to an extent.
