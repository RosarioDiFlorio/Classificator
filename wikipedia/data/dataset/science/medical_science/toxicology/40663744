Stephania crebra is a herbaceous perennial vine of the Menispermaceae family and genus Stephania. It is native to Southeast Asia and was first described in Thailand in 1988 by L. L. Forman. It is one of 15 Stephania found only in northern Thailand, specifically in the province of Chiang Mai. It has leaves 12–17 cm (4.7–6.7 in) long and 9–16 cm (3.5–6.3 in) wide. It resembles Stephania reticulata but S. crebra has larger flowers but smaller drupes and endocarps.
