Lobomycosis also known as (Jorge) Lobo's disease or lacaziosis, is a blastomycosis, a fungal infection of the skin caused by Lacazia loboi (formerly named Loboa loboi), and discovered by Brazilian dermatologist Jorge Lobo. Other names which were given to the disease are: keloidal blastomycosis, Amazonian blastomycosis, blastomycoid granuloma, miraip and piraip. These last two names were given by natives of the Amazon and mean that which burns.
This disease is usually found in humans and bottle-nosed dolphins, with the possible risk of transmission from one species to the next.
