The European Working Group for Legionella Infections (EWGLI) was formed in 1986. Its members are scientists with an interest in improving knowledge and information on the epidemiological and microbiological (clinical and environmental) aspects of legionnaires' disease. This is achieved through international surveillance of the disease, as well as developments in diagnosis, management and treatment methods.
EWGLI is based at the Health Protection Agency - Centre for Infections, Department of Respiratory Diseases (Legionella Section), 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, United Kingdom
