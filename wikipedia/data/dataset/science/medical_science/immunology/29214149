The British Society for Immunology, or BSI, is a UK based organisation of British immunologists but accepts members from all countries. It was founded in November 1956 by John H. Humphrey, Robin Coombs, Bob White, and Avrion Mitchison and is one of the oldest and largest Immunology societies in the world and the largest in Europe. It publishes two scientific journals: Immunology and Clinical and Experimental Immunology.
BSI members work throughout the entire Immunology chain, stretching from the laboratory bench right through to the clinics and hospitals in which patients are treated - from discovery to delivery. The fields in which they work are wide and extensive, from HIV/AIDS to allergy, diabetes, malaria, tuberculosis, animal health, arthritis, transplantation, vaccination and infectious disease.
The BSIâ€™s main objective is to promote and support excellence in research, scholarship and clinical practice in immunology for the benefit of human and animal health and welfare. The BSI seeks to help British Immunology accomplish the highest possible goals.
To meet this objective, the BSI undertakes the following:
Running innovative events in research, public engagement and education
Promoting and disseminating research and good practice in Immunology, translational medicine and vaccination
Working with its members to develop the benefits of membership and the relevance of the Society
Providing bursaries and grants
Enhancing public awareness of immunology
Influencing policy and decision makers
Working with other societies
