Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The early stage of the infection is characterised by a painless nodule or area of swelling. This nodule can turn into an ulcer. The ulcer may be larger inside than at the surface of the skin, and can be surrounded by swelling. As the disease worsens, bone can be infected. Buruli ulcers most commonly affect the arms or legs; fever is uncommon.
M. ulcerans releases a toxin known as mycolactone, which decreases immune system function and results in tissue death. Bacteria from the same family also cause tuberculosis and leprosy (M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, respectively). How the disease is spread is not known. Sources of water may be involved in the spread. As of 2013 there is no effective vaccine.
If people are treated early, antibiotics for eight weeks are effective in 80%. The treatment often includes the medications rifampicin and streptomycin. Clarithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of streptomycin. Other treatments may include cutting out the ulcer. After the infection heals, the area typically has a scar.
In 2015 about 2,000 cases were reported. Buruli ulcers occur most commonly in rural sub-Saharan Africa especially Cote d'Ivoire, but can also occur in Asia, the Western Pacific and the Americas. Children are most commonly infected. Cases have occurred in more than 32 countries. The disease also occurs in a number of animals other than humans. Albert Ruskin Cook was the first to describe buruli ulcers in 1897. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.
