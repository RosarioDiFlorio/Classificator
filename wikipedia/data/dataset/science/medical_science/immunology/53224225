ILC2 cells, or type 2 innate lymphoid cells are a type of innate lymphoid cell. They are derived from common lymphoid progenitor and belong to the lymphoid lineage. These cells lack antigen specific B or T cell receptor because of the lack of recombination activating gene. ILC2s produce type 2 cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13).
The cell type were first described in 2001. In 2006, a similar cell population was identified in a case of helminthic infection. The name "ILC2" was not proposed until 2013. They were previously identified in literature as natural helper cells, nuocytes, or innate helper 2 cells.
