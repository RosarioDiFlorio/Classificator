The 1985 United States salmonellosis outbreak was Salmonella typhimurium in milk from the Hillfarm Dairy in Melrose Park, Illinois. It was the worst outbreak of salmonellosis food poisoning in United States history at the time. At least 16,284 people were infected, all but 1,059 of them from Illinois. The others were in Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Two people died and the infection was a contributing factor in the deaths of "four, possibly five, others".
