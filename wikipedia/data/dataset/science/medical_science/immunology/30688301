Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV) was initially discovered in Australian field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus and Teleogryllus oceanicus) by Carl Reinganum and his colleagues at the Victorian Plant Research Institute (Burnley, Melbourne, Australia). The paralytic disease spread rapidly through a breeding colony as well as through a laboratory population causing about 95% mortality. This was the first recorded isolate of the virus  and is generally referred to as CrPVvic to distinguish it from subsequent isolates.
