H-Y antigen is a male tissue specific antigen. Originally thought to trigger the formation of testes, it is now known that it doesn't trigger the formation of testes but may be activated by the formation of testes. In its production, there are at least two loci involved, an autosomal gene that generates the antigen and one that generates the receptor.
The H-Y antigen secreted by the testis is identical to m√ºllerian-inhibiting substance.
