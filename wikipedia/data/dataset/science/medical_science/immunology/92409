Shigellosis is a type of diarrhea caused by a bacterial infection with Shigella. Symptoms generally start one to two days after exposure and include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and pain with passing stool. Blood may be present in the stool. Symptoms typically last five to seven days. Complications can include post infectious arthritis, sepsis, seizures, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Shigellosis is caused by four specific types of Shigella. These are typically spread by exposure to infected feces. This can occur via contaminated food, water, or hands. Contamination may be spread by flies or when changing diapers. Diagnosis is by stool culture.
Prevention is by properly washing the hands. There is no vaccine. Shigellosis usually resolves without specific treatment. Sufficient fluids by mouth and rest is recommended. Bismuth subsalicylate may help with the symptoms; however, medications that slow the bowels such as loperamide are not recommended. In severe cases antibiotics may be used but resistance is common. Commonly used antibiotics include ciprofloxacin or azithromycin.
Globally shigellosis occurs in at least 80 million people and results in about 700,000 deaths a year. Most cases occur in the developing world. Young children are most commonly affected. Outbreaks of disease may occur in childcare settings and schools. It is also relatively common among travelers. In the United States about half a million cases occur a year.
