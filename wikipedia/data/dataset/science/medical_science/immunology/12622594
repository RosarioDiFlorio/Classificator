The Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act of 2008 or the HHS-Labor-Education Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3043) is a bill introduced in the House of Representatives during the 110th United States Congress by Rep. David Obey.
President Bush vetoed the act because of the cost and because it would ban the use of childhood flu vaccines that contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been alleged to cause autism.
