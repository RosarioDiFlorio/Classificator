Condensing osteitis is a periapical inflammatory disease that results from a reaction to a dental related infection. This causes more bone production rather than bone destruction in the area (most common site is near the root apices of premolars and molars). The lesion appears as a radiopacity in the periapical area hence the sclerotic reaction. The sclerotic reaction results from good patient immunity and a low degree of virulence of the offending bacteria. The associated tooth may be carious or contains a large restoration, and is usually associated with a non-vital tooth.
