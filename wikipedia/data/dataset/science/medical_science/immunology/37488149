For anthrax vaccines generally, see Anthrax vaccines.
Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA) — also called MDPH-PA or MDPH-AVA; trade name BioThrax — is the only FDA-licensed human anthrax vaccine in the United States. It is produced by Emergent BioDefense Corporation, formerly known as BioPort Corporation in Lansing, Michigan. The parent company of Emergent BioDefense is Emergent BioSolutions of Rockville, Maryland.
AVA originated in studies done in the 1950s and was first licensed for use in humans in 1970. In the U.S., the principal purchasers of the vaccine are the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services. Ten million courses (60 million doses) of the vaccine have been purchased for the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile in anticipation of the need for mass vaccinations owing to a future bio-terrorist anthrax attack. The product has attracted some controversy owing to alleged adverse events and questions as to whether it is effective against the inhalational form of anthrax.
