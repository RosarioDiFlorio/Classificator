Checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a form of cancer treatment currently under research in the United States and globally. The therapy uses immune checkpoints which affect immune system functioning. Immune checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory.
Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. Checkpoint therapy can block inhibitory checkpoints, restoring immune system function. One ligand-receptor interaction under investigation is the interaction between the transmembrane programmed cell death 1 protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role on T cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.
