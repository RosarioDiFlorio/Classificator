Laverania is a subgenus of the Plasmodium genus of parasites. Infection with these species results in malaria. The subgenus was first described in 1958.
The name was first proposed by Welch in 1897 as a genus name for the group now known as Plasmodium but for a variety of reasons the genus name Plasmodium was preferred.
