Discitis or diskitis is an infection in the intervertebral disc space that affects different age groups. In adults it can lead to severe consequences such as sepsis or epidural abscess but can also spontaneously resolve, especially in children under 8 years of age. Discitis occurs post surgically in approximately 1-2 percent of patients after spinal surgery.
