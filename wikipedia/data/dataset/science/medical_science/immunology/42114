Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped (bacillus) gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The two species of Salmonella are Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. Salmonella enterica is the type species and is further divided into six subspecies that include over 2,500 serotypes.
Salmonella species are non-spore-forming, predominantly motile enterobacteria with cell diameters between about 0.7 and 1.5 µm, lengths from 2 to 5 µm, and peritrichous flagella (all around the cell body). They are chemotrophs, obtaining their energy from oxidation and reduction reactions using organic sources. They are also facultative anaerobes, capable of generating ATP with oxygen ("aerobically") when it is available; or when oxygen is not available, using other electron acceptors or fermentation ("anaerobically"). S. enterica subspecies are found worldwide in all warm-blooded animals and in the environment. S. bongori is restricted to cold-blooded animals, particularly reptiles.
Salmonella species are intracellular pathogens: certain serotypes cause illness. Nontyphoidal serotypes can be transferred from animal-to-human and from human-to-human. They usually invade only the gastrointestinal tract and cause Salmonella food poisoning; symptoms resolve without antibiotics. However, in sub-Saharan Africa they can be invasive and cause paratyphoid fever, which requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Typhoidal serotypes can only be transferred from human-to-human, and can cause Salmonella food poisoning, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Typhoid fever occurs when Salmonella invades the bloodstream—the typhoidal form; or in addition spreads throughout the body, invades organs, and secretes endotoxins—the septic form. This can lead to life-threatening hypovolemic shock and septic shock and requires intensive care including antibiotics.
