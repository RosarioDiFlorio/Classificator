In medicine, desensitization is a method to reduce or eliminate an organism's negative reaction to a substance or stimulus.
In pharmacology, drug desensitization is equivalent to drug tolerance, though the latter term refers to the more general concept of subjects' reactions (positive or negative) to a drug reducing following its repeated use.
