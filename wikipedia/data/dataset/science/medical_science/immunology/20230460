Corn/Maize allergy is a type of food allergy. It can be a difficult allergy to manage, particularly in the United States, due to the various food products which contain various forms of corn, such as corn starch, modified food starch, vinegar, and vanilla extract, among many others. However, it is an allergy that often goes unrecognized.
