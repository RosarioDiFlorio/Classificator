In molecular biology, the protein family Dispanin is another name for Interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM). This refers to a family of protein domains which have a specific formation, or in other words, topology containing two alpha helices in within the cell membrane which are called two transmembrane proteins. This includes proteins such as CD225 (Cluster of Differentiation 225). The function of this protein family is to inhibit cell invasion of many harmful, pathogenic viruses, such as HIV. Henceforth, they are being intensively studied in the hope of drug discovery. They mediate the immune response by interferons.
