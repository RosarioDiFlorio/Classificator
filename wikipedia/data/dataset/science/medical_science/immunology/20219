Mycoplasma genitalium, commonly known as Mgen, is a sexually transmitted, small and pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. Mgen is a recognised sexually transmitted infection, with alarmingly increasing prevalence worldwide and aggressive resistance to multiple antibiotics, including azithromycin which until recently was the most reliable line of antimicrobial defence. The causative agent was first isolated from meatal swabs (urogenital tract) of humans in 1981, and was eventually identified as a new species of Mycoplasma in 1983. It can cause significant morbidity in men and women. It is also a recognised risk factor for HIV transmission with higher occurrences in homosexual men and those previously treated with the azithromycin antibiotics.
Specifically, it causes urethritis in both men and women, and also cervicitis and pelvic inflammation in women. . It presents clinically similar symptoms to that of Chlamydia trachomatis infection and has shown higher incidence rates, compared to both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in some populations. Its complete genome sequence was published in 1995 (size 0.58 Mbp, with 475 genes). It was regarded as a cellular unit with the smallest genome size (in Mbp) until 2003 when a new species of Archaea, namely Nanoarchaeum equitans, was sequenced (0.49 Mbp, with 540 genes).
The synthetic genome of Mgen named Mycoplasma genitalium JCVI-1.0 (after the research centre, J. Craig Venter Institute, where it was synthesised) was produced in 2008, becoming the first organism with a synthetic genome. In 2014, a protein was described called Protein M from M. genitalium.
