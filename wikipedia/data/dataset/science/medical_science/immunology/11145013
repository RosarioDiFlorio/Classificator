Toxic cough syrup refers to a 2007 scandal in which Panamanian pharmaceutical manufacturers produced cough syrup using diethylene glycol which they believed to be glycerine. Diethylene glycol is a less-expensive alternative to glycerine for industrial applications, however, diethylene glycol is nephrotoxic and can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), especially in children.
