The Compatibility Gene is a 2014 book about the discovery of the mechanism of compatibility in the human immune system by professor Daniel M. Davis. It describes the history of immunology with the discovery of the principle of graft rejection by Peter Medawar, and the way the body distinguishes self from not-self via natural killer cells. The compatibility mechanism contributes also to the success of pregnancy by helping the placenta to form, and may play a role in mate selection.
