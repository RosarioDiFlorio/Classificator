A promegakaryocyte is a precursor cell for a megakaryocyte, arising from a megakaryoblast.
The developmental stages of the megakaryocyte are: CFU-Me (pluripotential hemopoietic stem cell or hemocytoblast) → megakaryoblast → promegakaryocyte → megakaryocyte.
When the megakaryoblast matures into the promegakaryocyte, it undergoes endoreduplication and forms a promegakaryocyte which has multiple nuclei, azurophilic granules, and a basophilic cytoplasm. The promegakaryocyte has rotary motion, but no forward migration.
