Garre's sclerosing osteomyelitis is a type of chronic osteomyelitis also called proliferative periostitis, periostitis ossificans and Garré's sclerosing osteomyelitis.
It is a rare disease. It mainly affects children and young adults. It is associated with a low grade infection, which may be due to dental caries (cavities in the teeth).
The body of the mandible may show irregular lucent/opaque changes with subperiosteal opaque layering along inferior border. It is a chronic osteomyelitis with subperiosteal bone and collagen deposition.
It was first described by the Swiss surgeon Carl Garré.
