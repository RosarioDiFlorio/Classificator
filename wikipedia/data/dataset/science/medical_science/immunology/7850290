Interleukin 20 (IL20) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL20 gene. Interkeukin 20 also includes other cytokines, including IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26. Based on common structural and functional properties of IL-20's receptors and target cells, these cytokines constitute the same subfamily, IL-20.
