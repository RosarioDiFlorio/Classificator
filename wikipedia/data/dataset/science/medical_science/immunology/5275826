Golfer's vasculitis, exercise-induced vasculitis and hiker's rash, are names proposed by different medical researchers for a form of vasculitis resulting in a purpuric rash (bleeding from underlying tissues). It is often experienced in the lower legs caused by excessive exercise in hotter temperatures. It is more common among older people.
It is called 'Golfer's' due to the large amount of walking done in golf, as well as it being a sport more popular among older people, resulting in greater incidence of the condition.
