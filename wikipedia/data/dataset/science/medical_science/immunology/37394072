Inguinal lymphadenopathy causes swollen lymph nodes in the groin area. It can be a symptom of infective or neoplastic processes. Infective aetiologies include Tuberculosis, HIV, non-specific or reactive lymphadenopathy to recent lower limb infection or groin infections. Another notable infectious cause is Lymphogranuloma venereum, which is a sexually transmitted infection of the lymphatic system. Neoplastic aetiologies include lymphoma, leukaemia and metastatic disease from primary tumours in the lower limb, external genitalia or perianal region and melanoma.
