Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.
Examples of common applications of immunoproteomics include:
The isolation and mass spectrometric identification of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) binding peptides
Purification and identification of protein antigens binding specific antibodies (or other affinity reagents)
Comparative immunoproteomics to identify proteins and pathways modulated by a specific infectious organism, disease or toxin.
The identification of proteins in immunoproteomics is carried out by techniques including gel based, microarray based, and DNA based techniques, with mass spectroscopy typically being the ultimate identification method.
