SLP65/SLP76, Csk-interacting membrane protein, termed SCIMP, belongs to family of transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAP) which do not directly associate with a receptor, such as LAT, NTAL, LIME or LAX. SCIMP is expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC), namely B cells, bone marrow derived dendritic cells and macrophages.
