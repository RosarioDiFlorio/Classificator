Killer Activation Receptors (KARs) are receptors expressed on the plasmatic membrane of Natural Killer cells (NK cells). KARs work with inhibitory Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which inactivate them in order to regulate the NK cells functions on hosted or transformed cells. These two kinds of specific receptors have some morphological features in common, such as being transmembrane proteins. The similarities are specially found in the extracellular domains and, therefore, the differences tend to be in the intracellular domains. KARs and KIRs can only do their function in presence of immunoreceptors that contain tyrosine and have an activator or inhibitor function (they are called ITAMs and ITIMs).
At first, it was thought that there were only one KAR and one KIR (two-receptor model). In the last decade, lots of different KARs and KIRs, such as NKp46 or NKG2D, have been discovered (opposing-signals model).
