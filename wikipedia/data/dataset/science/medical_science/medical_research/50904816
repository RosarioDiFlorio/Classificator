ALTEX: Alternatives to Animal Experimentation is a quarterly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering alternatives to animal experimentation and related issues of bioethics, seeking to promote the replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal use in research (the "3Rs"). It was originally published in German and established in 1984 as ALTEX: Alternativen zu Tierexperimenten and is published by Springer Spektrum on behalf of the Swiss Society ALTEX Edition.
It is the official journal of Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, the American Society for Cellular and Computational Toxicology, the European consensus platform for alternatives, the European Society for Alternatives to Animal Testing, and the transatlantic think tank for toxicology. It has been an open access journal since 2011 under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.
The journal has two companion publications: ALTEX Proceedings (ISSN 2194-0479), which publishes proceedings of scientific conferences relating to the 3Rs, and TIERethik, a biannual German-language periodical on bioethics and human-animal studies.
