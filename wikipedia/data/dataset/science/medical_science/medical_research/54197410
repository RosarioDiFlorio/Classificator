Irosustat (INN, USAN; developmental code names STX-64, 667-coumate, BN-83495; also known as oristusane) is an orally active, irreversible, nonsteroidal inhibitor of steroid sulfatase (STS) which was under development by Ipsen for the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer but was never marketed. The drug reached phase II clinical trials prior to the discontinuation of its development.
By inhibiting STS, irosustat prevents the conversion of hormonally inactive steroid sulfates such as DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) and estrone sulfate (E1S) into their respective active forms, DHEA and estrone (which, in turn, can be transformed into more potent androgens and estrogens, respectively). Administration of 5 mg/day irosustat to women with breast cancer for 5 days inhibited STS activity by 98 to 99% in breast tumor tissue and significantly decreased serum levels of estrone (by 76%), estradiol (by 39%), DHEA (by 41%), androstenediol (by 70%), androstenedione (by 62%), and testosterone (by 30%), whereas levels of DHEA-S and E1S increased slightly (by 1.1% and 7.4%, respectively).
