The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF)[1] is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, founded in the Spring of 2005, with the mission “accelerating cures for the major diseases of our time through stem cell research.” NYSCF established the first privately funded stem cell laboratory in New York City, where NYSCF researchers and scientific collaborators conduct advanced stem cell investigations. The foundation supports stem cell scientists through the NYSCF Innovator Program, and it engages the academic, medical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology communities by hosting the annual translational stem cell research conference and other symposia throughout the year. NYSCF aims to educate the public on the importance of stem cell research in new therapies.
The foundation focuses on three areas:
NYSCF Research and Laboratory – Supports non-government funded advanced stem cell research, in the NYSCF Research Institute laboratory and through collaborations with medical research institutions worldwide.
NYSCF Innovator Program – Intends to support and train "the next generation of scientists," at the postdoctoral level as Fellows or as Investigators, pursuing innovative work that translates research into cures. NYSCF awards an annual prize to honor the most significant achievement in translational stem cell research.
NYSCF Conference and Symposia – Convenes the annual translational stem cell research conference and on-going programs for scientists, policymakers and the public.
Susan L. Solomon is the CEO, and Kevin Eggan serves as the Chief Scientific Officer.
