Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) or Targeted covalent drugs are rationally designed inhibitors that bind and then bond to their target proteins. These inhibitors possess a bond-forming functional group of low chemical reactivity that, following binding to the target protein, is positioned to react rapidly with a specific nucleophilic residue at the target site and form a bond (Singh, Petter, Baillie, & Whitty, 2011a).
