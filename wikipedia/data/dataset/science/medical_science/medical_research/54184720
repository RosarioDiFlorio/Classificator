Spiroxasone (INN, USAN) is a synthetic, steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group which was developed as a diuretic and antihypertensive agent but was never marketed. It was synthesized and assayed in 1963. The drug is 7α-acetylthiospirolactone with the ketone group removed from the C17α spirolactone ring. Similarly to other spirolactones like spironolactone, spiroxasone also possesses antiandrogen activity.
