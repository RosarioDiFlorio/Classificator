Cyclofenil (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Fertodur, Menopax, Ondonid, Ondogyne, Sexovid, others) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used as a gonadotropin stimulant which is or has been marketed in Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and Brazil, among other countries.
Cyclofenil was studied in the 1970s as an agent to induce ovulation in infertile women. It was then investigated as a possible treatment for scleroderma in the 1980s, but was found to be ineffective. Later study of its efficacy in treating Raynaud's phenomenon in people with scleroderma also found no statistically significant benefit.
