Methynodiol diacetate (USAN) (developmental code name SC-19198), or metynodiol diacetate, also known as 11Î²-methyletynodiol diacetate, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group which was patented in 1968 but was never marketed. It is the diacetate ester of metynodiol, which, similarly, was never marketed.
