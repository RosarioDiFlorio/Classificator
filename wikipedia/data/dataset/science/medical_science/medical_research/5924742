Gideon Koren M.D., FACMT, FRCP(C) (Hebrew: גדעון קורן‎; born 1947 in Tel Aviv, British mandate of palestine (now in Israel) is an Israeli-Canadian pediatrician, clinical pharmacologist, toxicologist, and a composer of Israeli popular music.
He is perhaps best known for being at the centre of the Motherisk scandal which has thrown into doubt the findings of 16,000 child protection cases and six criminal cases. An independent review found that neither the lab's director, clinical toxicologist Gideon Koren, nor his staff, had the qualifications or expertise to do that kind of forensic work.
Prior to this Dr. Koren was officially reprimanded by the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons for writing harassing anonymous letters to Dr. Nancy Olivieri and three other colleagues, about which he then lied repeatedly to conceal his responsibility. The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons also cited him for additional misconduct in research.
