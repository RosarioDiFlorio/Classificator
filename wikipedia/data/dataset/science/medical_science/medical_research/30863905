The Behavior Genetics Association (BGA) is a learned society established in 1970 and which promotes research into the connections between heredity and behavior, both human and animal. Its members support education and training in behavior genetics; and aid in the dissemination of knowledge concerning genetics and behavior, and its implications, such as in health.
