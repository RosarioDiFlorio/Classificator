Axomadol (INN, USAN) (code name EN3324) is a synthetic, centrally-acting opioid analgesic of the benzenoid class which was under investigation by Endo Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with Gr√ºnenthal for the treatment of chronic, moderate to severe lower back pain and arthrosis. Development was halted after phase II clinical trials as it did not meet the pre-determined clinical endpoints.
