Transfersome is a trademark registered by the German company IDEA AG, which refers to its proprietary drug delivery technology. The name means “carrying body” and is derived from the Latin word 'transferre', meaning 'to carry across', and the Greek word 'soma', meaning 'a body'. A Transfersome carrier is an artificial vesicle designed to exhibit the characteristics of a cell vesicle or a cell engaged in exocytosis, and thus suitable for controlled and, potentially, targeted drug delivery.
