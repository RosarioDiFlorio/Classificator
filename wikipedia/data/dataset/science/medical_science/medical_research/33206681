Charles Bradley (1902â€“1979) was a Rhode Island physician who was best known for the serendipitous discovery that the use of Benzedrine in children with behavior problems resulted in an improvement in their performance in a residential setting. Investigations leading from his work led directly to the current pharmaceutical treatment of ADHD.
