Pseudohypoxia refers to increased cytosolic ratio of free NADH to NAD in cells. Research has shown that declining levels of NAD+ during aging cause pseudohypoxia, and that raising nuclear NAD+ in old mice reverses pseudohypoxia and metabolic dysfunction, thus reversing the aging process. It is expected that human NAD trials will begin in 2014.
