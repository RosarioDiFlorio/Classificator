PC3 (PC-3) human prostate cancer cell lines are one of the cell lines used in prostate cancer research. These cells are useful in investigating the biochemical changes in advanced prostatic cancer cells and in assessing their response to chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, they can be used to create subcutaneous tumors in mice in order to investigate a model of the tumor environment in the context of the organism.
