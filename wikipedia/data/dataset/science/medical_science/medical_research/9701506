Efungumab (trade name Mycograb) is a drug developed by NeuTec Pharma (a subsidiary of Novartis), intended to treat invasive Candida infection in combination with amphotericin B. The European Medicines Agency has twice refused to grant marketing authorization for Mycograb, citing product safety and quality issues.
Chemically, efungumab is a single-chain variable fragment of a human monoclonal antibody. As such, it potentially act similarly to an IgA - inhibiting by binding and blocking.
Its ability to potentiate the effects of the antifungal amphotericin B in culture were later found to be non-specific.
