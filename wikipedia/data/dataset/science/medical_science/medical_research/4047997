Clorgiline (INN), or clorgyline (BAN), is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) structurally related to pargyline which is described as an antidepressant. Specifically, it is an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). Clorgiline was never marketed, but it has found use in scientific research. It has been found to bind with high affinity to the Ïƒ1 receptor (Ki = 3.2 nM) and with very high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor (Ki = 40 pM).
