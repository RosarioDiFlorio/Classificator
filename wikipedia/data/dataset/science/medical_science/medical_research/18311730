The Hematology-Oncology Research Center and Stem Cell Transplantation (HORCSCT; formerly HORCBMT) is affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) and based in Shariati Hospital, Tehran, Iran. As a main national hematology-oncology center, it is among the most prominent stem cell transplantation centers in the world, with more than 300 successful transplantations performed per year.
The Center is mainly involved in new therapeutic approaches which are developed or under development for hematologic-oncologic patients, particularly stem cell transplantation. In addition, it is involved in the research activities aimed at improving the diagnosis and management of different hematologic and oncologic diseases.
The Center was founded in 1991 by Professor Ardeshir Ghavamzadeh, who is currently the Center director. It was further expanded in 2000, when it was moved to a new 4800 m2 building well-equipped for different basic and clinical research and services.
Iran will invest 2.5 billion dollars in the country's stem cell research over the next five years (2008-2013).
