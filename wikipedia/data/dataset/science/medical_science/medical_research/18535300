The National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre (NCPIC) was established in 2008 in response to data published in the Pfizer Australia Health Report. NDARC and NCPIC have collaborated with Pfizer Australia to assist with educating the public about cannabis. Many in the Australian community are concerned that this collaboration and NCPIC involvement with GW Pharmaceutical and SATIVEX places NDARC and NCPIC in a position of conflicted interests. In 2016 it was announced that the Australian government would cut funding to the NCPIC at year's end.
While prevalence rates have markedly reduced over the past decade, cannabis is still widely used by young people, and the impacts on adolescent development remain an important issue.
The key goals of the Centre are:
providing the Australian community with cannabis information resources about cannabis
supporting service providers to respond to those experiencing problems related to cannabis
specifically engaging young people to reduce and prevent cannabis uptake
