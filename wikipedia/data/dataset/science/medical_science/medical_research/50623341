Clemente Estable (23 May 1894, Canelones â€“ 27 October 1976, Montevideo) was a University Professor and Docent. He was a pioneer in the areas of cellular biology and neurobiology research. Estable was an educator, scientist and philosopher who left his mark on the intellectual collective thinking of his native land. He lived his life guided by strong democratic values and ethical principles and worked tirelessly to better the pedagogic, cinematic, political and scientific frameworks of the day.
Today, the 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas Clemente Estable' (of which he was a founding member) carries on his scientific work and carries his name.
