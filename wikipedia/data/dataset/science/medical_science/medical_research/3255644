Cell Computing is a now-defunct distributed computing project that was operated by NTT Data to perform biomedical research.
It used the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform; however, it was initially launched using the United Devices Grid MP platform in 2002.
The project ended in 2008 due to lack of popularity.
