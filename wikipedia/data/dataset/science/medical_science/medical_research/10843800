Expanded access (also known as compassionate use or "pre-approval access") refers to the use of an investigational new drug (IND) outside of a clinical trial by people with serious or life-threatening conditions who do not meet the enrollment criteria for the clinical trial in progress. Outside the United States, such access is allowed through named patient programs. In the US this type of access may be available, in accordance with United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, when it is determined that people may benefit from the treatment, the therapy can be given safely outside the clinical trial setting, no other alternative therapy is available, and the drug developer agrees to provide access to the drug. The FDA refers to such a program as an expanded access program (EAP). EAPs have many use cases, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, genetic disorders, and rare diseases, among others.
There are several types of EAPs allowed in the United States. Treatment protocols and treatment INDs provide large numbers of people access to investigational drugs. A single-patient IND is a request from a physician to the FDA that an individual be allowed access to an investigational drug on an emergency or compassionate use basis. When the FDA receives a significant number of requests (~10 to 100) for individual expanded access to an investigational drug for the same use, they may ask the trial sponsor to consolidate these requests, creating an intermediate-size group. “Compassionate use” is a more colloquial term that is not generally used by the FDA. Individuals and their physicians can apply for use of an investigational drug using FDA Form 3926, an application form created by the agency in June 2016.
