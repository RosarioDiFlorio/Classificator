HT1080 is a fibrosarcoma cell line which has been used extensively in biomedical research. The cell line was created from tissue taken in a biopsy of a fibrosarcoma present in a 35-year-old human male. The patient who supplied the sample had not undergone radio or chemotherapy and this lack of therapy is important as both radio and chemotherapy may introduce unwanted mutations into the sample.
The cell line carries an IDH1 mutation.
