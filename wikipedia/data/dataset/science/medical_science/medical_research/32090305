Acivicin is an analog of glutamine. It is an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transferase.
It is a fermentation product of Streptomyces sviceus. It interferes with glutamate metabolism and inhibits glutamate dependent synthesis of enzymes, and is thereby potentially helpful in treatment of solid tumors.
After its discovery in 1972, acivicin was studied as an anti-cancer agent, but trials were unsuccessful due to toxicity.
