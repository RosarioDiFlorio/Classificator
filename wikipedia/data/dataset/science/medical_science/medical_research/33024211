Fezakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-22, designed for the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Wyeth discovered and initially developed the drug, and clinical development continued after that company was acquired by Pfizer. Fezakinumab, in combination with methotrexate, completed a phase II trial in rheumatoid arthritis, but data was not released. Development was discontinued in August 2011.
