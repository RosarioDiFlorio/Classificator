RU-58841 (also known as PSK-3841 or HMR-3841) is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which was previously investigated for use as a topical treatment for acne, androgenetic alopecia (pattern hair loss or baldness), and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). The compound is similar in structure to RU-58642 but contains a different side-chain. These compounds are similar in chemical structure to nilutamide, which is related to flutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide. RU-58841 can be synthesized either by building the hydantoin moiety or by aryl coupling to 5,5-dimethylhydantoin.
