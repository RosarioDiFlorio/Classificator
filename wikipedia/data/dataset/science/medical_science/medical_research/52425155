Methandriol diacetate, or methylandrostenediol diacetate, also known as 17α-methylandrost-5-ene-3,17β-diol 3,17β-diacetate, is a synthetic, injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated derivative of 5-androstenediol that was never marketed. It is an androgen ester – specifically, the C3,17β diacetate ester of methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol) – and acts as a prodrug of methandriol in the body.
