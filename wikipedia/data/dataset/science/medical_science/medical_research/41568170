Cloxotestosterone (INN), also known as 17β-chloral hemiacetal testosterone, is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ether – specifically, the 17β-chloro hemiacetal ether of testosterone – which was never marketed. The O-acetate ester of cloxotestosterone, cloxotestosterone acetate (brand name Caprosem), in contrast to cloxotestosterone, has been marketed.
