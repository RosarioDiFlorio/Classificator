Brain Tumour Research is a UK-based medical research charity dedicated to finding a cure for brain tumours of all kinds.
Through funds raised by supporters and fundraising groups, Brain Tumour Research aims to fund seven Research Centres of Excellence in the UK, of which four are in operation. These centres require £1million per year to run, and so Brain Tumour Research’s fundraising goal is to raise £7million per annum.
