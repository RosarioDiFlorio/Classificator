The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, or NEIDL, is a biosciences facility of Boston University located near Boston Medical Center on Albany Street in the South End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.
The lab is part of a national network of secure facilities that study infectious diseases, whether naturally occurring or introduced through bioterrorism. The Labs will include a BSL-4 laboratory. On February 2, 2006, Boston Medical Center received regulatory approval from the federal government to fund construction of a biosafety laboratory on its medical campus in Boston.
There has been strong community opposition to the planned building, and BSL-2 level research did not begin until 2012 due to court injunctions. BSL-3 and BSL-4 level research is still anticipated to be launched in the future after alleviating community opposition.
In early 2014, BSL-4 research was still being opposed by community groups including the Union Park Neighborhood Association and Boston City Councilor Charles Yancey who was conducting hearings on its safety and recommending a citywide ban on BSL-4 research. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was still researching the issues involved. NEIDL was seeking permission of the Boston Public Health Commission to do BSL-4 research.
On December 6, 2017, NEIDL was approved by Mayor Marty Walsh for BSL-4 research at Boston University's South End campus. This gives NEIDL the opportunity to study some of the world's most deadly diseases.
