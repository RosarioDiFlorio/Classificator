Timothy M. Buie is a pediatric gastroenterologist at Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts General Hospital, who also practices at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. Buie joined Harvard Medical School in 1998 after previously practicing at Pediatric Gastroenterology Associates for eight years. He is also the director of Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Services at MGH's Lurie Center for Autism. He is well known for his research pertaining to the possible connection between autism and gastrointestinal disorders, and has told the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee that over half of autistic children experience gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas he stated that this was the case for "between 50 and 70%" of children with autism in an interview with ABC News. He has also said that a subset of autistic children (though not the majority) may benefit from gluten-free, casein-free diets, and that more research is needed into this area. Buie was honored as "Professional of the Year" by the Autism Society of America in 2009.
