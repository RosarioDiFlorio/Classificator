Cochrane Eyes and Vision (CEV) is a collaboration of researchers and healthcare professionals who prepare systematic reviews to study interventions pertaining to the treatment of eye disease and visual impairment. Though many of the systematic reviews focus on common eye diseases, reviews have been prepared for varied eye topics, including screening prevention and rarer eye diseases. CEV was officially registered in 1997, operating from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and funded by the National Institute for Health Research. In 2002, a satellite center was created in the United States, at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Currently, the Coordinating Editor of CEV is Dr. Richard Wormald.
CEV has partnerships with the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Glaucoma Society to collaborate in research. Additionally, CEV works closely with the Wilmer Eye Institute of Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Byers Eye Institute of the Stanford University School of Medicine, as CEV Centers for Evidence-based Medicine.
CEV has conducted over 100 systematic reviews in the field of ophthalmology. The most common topics reviewed include trials studying conditions such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataract. Ophthalmic treatments investigated by CEV systematic reviews include patching for corneal abrasion, eyesight screening for visual impairment in the elderly, vitamin supplements for cataracts, NSAIDS for macular edema, antimetabolites for trabeculectomy, and antiviral agents for herpes simplex virus.
