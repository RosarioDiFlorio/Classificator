Setrobuvir (also known as ANA-598) was an experimental drug candidate for the treatment of hepatitis C that was discovered at Anadys Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Roche in 2011; Roche terminated development in July 2015. It was in Phase IIb clinical trials, used in combination with interferon and ribavirin, targeting hepatitis C patients with genotype 1.
Setrobuvir works by inhibiting the hepatitis C enzyme NS5B, an RNA polymerase.
