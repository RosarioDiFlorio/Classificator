The Pasqual Maragall Foundation for Research on Alzheimer was founded to answer publicly the commitment made by Pasqual Maragall, President of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Government of Catalonia 2003–2006) and Mayor of Barcelona (1982–1997), in October 2007, when he announced that he had been diagnosed with the disease.
The Foundation was established in April 2008, and is led by Dr. Jordi Camí, director and promoter of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park. The Foundation promotes scientific research into the prevention and cure of Alzheimer's and related neurodegenerative diseases and aims to create a dedicated scientific research center.
