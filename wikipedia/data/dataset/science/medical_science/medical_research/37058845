The Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine (SCRM) is a stem cell research centre at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, dedicated to the study and development of new regenerative treatments for human diseases. The £54 million facility is part of a total £600 million joint investment in stem cell biology and medicine by the Scottish Government and the University of Edinburgh. Designed by Sheppard Robson, the SCRM is part of the BioQuarter cluster at Little France.
The 9000 m2 building, which can house up to 250 scientists, is home to biologists and clinical academics from the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM), and applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and Roslin Cells. It contains laboratory and support space, a company incubator unit, and a clinical translation unit which enables the production of cells at Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade.
Conditions being researched at the SCRM include multiple sclerosis and heart and liver disease.
The Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine was officially opened by the Princess Royal on 28 May 2012.
On 25 August 2014, the centre grew the first working organ, a thymus, from scratch inside an animal.
