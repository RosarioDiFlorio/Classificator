Estradiol butyrate benzoate, or estradiol 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate, also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen and an estrogen ester – specifically, the 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate diester of estradiol – which was never marketed. Under the tentative brand name Unimens, estradiol butyrate benzoate was studied in combination with the progestogen algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide) as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive (at doses of 10 mg and 150 mg, respectively).
