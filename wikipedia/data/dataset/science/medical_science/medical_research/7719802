Lauren B. Alloy is a professor of psychology at Temple University and is recognized in the area of mood disorders. Her research focuses on cognitive, interpersonal, and biopsychosocial processes in the onset and maintenance of depression and bipolar disorder. In the late 1970s, Alloy and her longtime collaborator Lyn Yvonne Abramson demonstrated that depressed individuals held a more accurate view than their non-depressed counterparts in a test which measured illusion of control. This finding held true even when the depression was manipulated experimentally (see also depressive realism).
