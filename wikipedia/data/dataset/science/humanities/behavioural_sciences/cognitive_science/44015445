Innerscope Research was an integrated consumer neuroscience research firm that was acquired by Nielsen in 2015. Founded in 2006, Innerscope was based in Boston, Massachusetts with an office in New York City. Using applied neuroscience tools such as biometrics, eye tracking, facial coding as well as fMRI, often integrated with traditional measures of self-report, the company aims to measure in a more comprehensive way consumers’ non-conscious emotional connection to brands, products and services.
The company services Fortune 500 clients and works in multiple domains using a neuroscience informed framework (sometimes referred to as neuromarketing). Its research offering includes the evaluation of video advertising, shopper marketing, media platforms, online/mobile user experience as well as a variety of custom studies from testing fragrances to automobile driving experiences. Innerscope’s goal is to help its clients understand the role of non-conscious processing in decision making.
On May 27, 2015, Nielsen completed an acquisition of Innerscope Research and renamed its combined offering as Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. Dr. Carl Marci was named Chief Neuroscientist.
