Keith R. Laws is a professor of neuropsychology at the School of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire. Professor Laws' research centres on how cognitive functions and processes relate to brain structure and function; notably for research on cognitive functioning in people suffering from neurological and psychiatric disorders. Laws, with his colleagues, created one of the first research groups to investigate impairment of everyday knowledge in patients with schizophrenia and to demonstrate worse cognitive outcomes in women suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Laws' work on the link between MDMA (also known as ecstasy) drug use and poor memory is the principal analysis of its kind to date, and has been broadly cited in both national and international media. In 2013 he published a study showing that women are better at multitasking than men. Laws completed a PhD at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge. He is the author of over 100 papers and a recent book entitled 'Category-Specificity: Evidence for Modularity of Mind'. He is a Chartered Psychologist, Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society (AFBPsS), Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) and various academic organisations including the British Neuropsychological Society, British Neuropsychiatric Association, Experimental Psychology Society. He is a section editor at BMC Psychology and an editor at PLOS ONE.
