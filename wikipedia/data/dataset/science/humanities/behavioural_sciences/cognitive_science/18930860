Michael Howe (1940 – 2 January 2002) was a British cognitive psychologist. He was well known as a defender of environmental influences on intelligence, and as an opponent of IQ, and he was regularly involved in the controversies surrounding that area of research (see, e.g., Howe, 1997b). As a widely cited example of this work, with colleagues Davidson & Sloboda he argued against the existence of innate talent, a position welcomed by some, but characterised as “Absurd environmentalism” by researchers such as Douglas Detterman.
