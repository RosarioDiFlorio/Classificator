Brodmann area 45 (BA45), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It is situated on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9 and adjacent to BA46.
This area is also known as the pars triangularis (of the inferior frontal gyrus). In humans, it occupies the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (H) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of the lateral sulcus (H), a portion of the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (H). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of the lateral sulcus (H), it borders on the insula in the depth of the lateral sulcus.
In terms of cytoarchitecture, it is bounded caudally by the opercular area 44 (BA44), rostrodorsally by the middle frontal area 46 (BA46), and ventrally by the orbital area 47 (BA47) (Brodmann, 1909).
