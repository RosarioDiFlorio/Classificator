The theory of indispensable attributes (TIA) is a theory in the context of perceptual organisation which asks for the functional units and elementary features that are relevant for a perceptual system in the constitution of perceptual objects. Earlier versions of the theory emerged in the context of an application of research on vision to audition, and analogies between vision and audition were emphasised, whereas in more recent writings the necessity of a modality-general theory of perceptual organisation and objecthood is stressed.
The subject of perceptual organisation, and with it TIA, constitute a prime example of how theories of Gestalt psychology have been taken up and kept alive in cognitive psychology.
TIA has been drawn on in the context of music research, in the areas of music philosophy, and systematic music theory.
