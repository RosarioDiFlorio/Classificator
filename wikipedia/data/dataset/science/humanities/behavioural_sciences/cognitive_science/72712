In functional-cognitive linguistics, as well as in semiotics, iconicity is the conceived similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to arbitrariness.
Iconic principles:
Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity
Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance
Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain
