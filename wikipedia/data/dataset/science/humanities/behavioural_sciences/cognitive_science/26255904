Simplicity theory is a cognitive theory that seeks to explain the attractiveness of situations or events to human minds. It is based on work done by scientists like Nick Chater, Paul Vitanyi, Jean-Louis Dessalles, and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber. It claims that interesting situations appear simpler than expected to the observer.
