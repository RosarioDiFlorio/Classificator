The Lexical Integrity Hypothesis or Lexicalist Hypothesis is a disputed hypothesis in linguistics. It is based on transformational grammar, and says that syntactic transformations do not apply to subparts of words.
This hypothesis is incompatible with endoclitics, claimed to exist e.g. in the Udi language.
