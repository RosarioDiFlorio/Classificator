Knowledge organization (KO), organization of knowledge, organization of information, or information organization is a branch of library and information science (LIS) concerned with activities such as document description, indexing, and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives, etc. Traditional human-based approaches performed by librarians, archivists, and subject specialists are increasingly challenged by computational (big data) algorithmic techniques. KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) (such as taxonomy and ontology) as well as the resulting knowledge organizing systems (KOS).
Divergent historical and theoretical approaches towards organizing knowledge are based on different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. This richness lends itself to many complementary ways to consider knowledge organization. The academic International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) engages with these issues via the research journal Knowledge Organization.
