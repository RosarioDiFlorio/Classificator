In the philosophy of mind, double-aspect theory is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance. It is also called dual-aspect monism. The theory's relationship to neutral monism is ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements to determine whether the group is mental, physical, both, or neither, double-aspect theory requires the mental and the physical to be inseparable and mutually irreducible (though distinct).

Double-aspect theorists include, among others:-
Baruch Spinoza, who believed that the Existence had two aspects, Extension and Mind, which together were to be taken as two of an infinite set of attributes comprising God (or, Nature).
There is a dual-aspect interpretation of Immanuel Kant's noumenon.
Arthur Schopenhauer, who considered the fundamental aspects of reality to be Will and Representation.
David Bohm, who used implicate and explicate order as a means of displaying dual-aspects
Gustav Fechner
George Henry Lewes
Carl Gustav Jung
Wolfgang Pauli
John Polkinghorne
Brian O'Shaughnessy on the dual aspect theory of the Will
Thomas Nagel.
David Chalmers who explores a double-aspect view of information, with similarities to Kenneth Sayre's information-based neutral monism.
