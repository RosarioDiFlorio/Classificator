Complex perceptions like voice recognition or discrimination of similar sound sequences need experience and can generally be trained. Complex perceptions are often multi-sensory perceptions. Example: To distinguish between a real apple and fake the subject needs to touch or to smell it, because visual inspection may be insufficient.
Depending on previous experience with similar situations the subject will decide which strategy to use. Vision-Motor-Perception Program is based on the assumption that vision is the most important sensory mechanism. This program, to help children gain superior perception abilities, was developed based on theory and research in how they develop. 
The basic principles of perception training are similar to problem solving. The perception of a simple stimulus (like a sound of a given intensity) can normally not be trained to function below its intensity threshold.
