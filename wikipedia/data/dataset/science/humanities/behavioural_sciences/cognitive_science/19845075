Brain Assist or Touch de Uno DS is a puzzle video game released for Nintendo DS in Japan, North America, and the PAL region. Studies in the 1960s demonstrated the lateralization of brain function. The left-brain hemisphere deals with sequential analysis - reasoning using language, mathematics, abstraction and reasoning. Memory is primarily stored in a language format. The right hemisphere deals with auditory, visual, and spatial concepts (art, for example) dancing and gymnastics. There is an overlap, though. Brain Assist for the Nintendo DS aims to stimulate your right brain.
