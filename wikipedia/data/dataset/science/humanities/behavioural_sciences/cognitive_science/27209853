When referring to digital text, pictures and documents, the term materiality refers to the physical medium used to store and convey the text, as apart from the text itself. This concept is important to archivists and historians, who often require access to the physical medium of documents or correspondence in order to understand the transitions that the document underwent between initial conception and final publication.
