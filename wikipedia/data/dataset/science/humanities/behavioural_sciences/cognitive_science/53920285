Tail wagging by dogs is the behavior of the dog observed as its tail moves back and forth in the same plane. It is considered a social signal. Tail wagging by dogs can be described by its vigorous movement or even just the slightest movement of the tip of its tail. Other dogs wag their tail in a circular motion, and even when the tail is between their legs or the dog is on its back. The behavior of a dog can not always be an indication its friendliness. When a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tail wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships or a warning that the dog may bite.
Tail wagging functions as the equivalent of a human smile. It is a greeting or an acknowledgment of recognition. Dogs tend not to wag their tails unless there is another animal or human nearby with whom to interact.
