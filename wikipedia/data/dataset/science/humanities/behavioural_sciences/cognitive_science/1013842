Psychological movements are considered to be post-cognitivist if they are opposed to or move beyond the cognitivist theories posited by Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor, David Marr, and others.
Researchers who have followed post-cognitive directions include Hubert Dreyfus, Gregory Bateson, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. Their work carries forward some of the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean Piaget, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Lev Vygotsky and others.
