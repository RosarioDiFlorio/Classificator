The extended mind thesis (EMT) says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world. As Clark and Chalmers see it:

Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an active externalism, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the mind in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.
