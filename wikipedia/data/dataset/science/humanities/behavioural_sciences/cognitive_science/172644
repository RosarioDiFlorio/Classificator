Handedness is a better (faster or more precise) performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the nondominant hand. Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women. Studies suggest that 88â€“92% of the world population is right-handed.
