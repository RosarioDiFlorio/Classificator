The Dalle Molle Institute for Semantic and Cognitive Studies (Italian: Istituto Dalle Molle per gli studi semantici e cognitivi, ISSCO) is a research institute in Geneva, Switzerland. It was founded in Lugano in 1972 by Angelo Dalle Molle through the Fondation Dalle Molle to conduct research into the application of artificial intelligence to linguistics, cognitive science and semantics with the aim of developing systems for automated translation. Since 1976 it has been a part of the Faculté de traduction et d'interprétation, the faculty of translation and interpreting, of the University of Geneva.
ISSCO is one of four Swiss research organisations founded by the Dalle Molle foundation, of which three are in the field of artificial intelligence.
