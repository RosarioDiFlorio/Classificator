Cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to the cognition process.
The term may describe
deficits in overall intelligence (as with intellectual disabilities),
specific and restricted deficits in cognitive abilities (such as in learning disorders like dyslexia),
neuropsychological deficits (such as in attention, working memory or executive function),
or it may describe drug-induced impairment in cognition and memory (such as that seen with alcohol, glucocorticoids, and the benzodiazepines.)
It usually refers to a durable characteristic, as opposed to altered level of consciousness, which may be acute and reversible. Cognitive deficits may be inborn or caused by environmental factors such as brain injuries, neurological disorders, or mental illness.
