Brain Age Express (known in Japan as Chotto Brain Training and in Europe and Australia as A Little Bit of... Dr Kawashima's Brain Training) are three educational puzzle video games developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare download service. They are the third series of games in the Brain Age series, and are repackaged versions of both Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day! games, featuring both old and new puzzles. There are three editions: Arts & Letters, Math, and Sudoku. The Arts & Letters and Math versions were originally released on December 24, 2008 in Japan as launch titles for the DSiWare service, and the Sudoku edition on April 22, 2009 in Japan as well. The Math edition is the only version currently available outside Japan, and was released on April 5, 2009 in North America and June 19, 2009 in the PAL regions, as a launch title for the service. However, the Arts & Letters edition was released on August 10, 2009 in North America and October 23, 2009 in the PAL regions. The puzzles featured in both the Literature and Science editions were created by Ryuta Kawashima. One puzzle in each of these two editions utilizes the Nintendo DSi's camera function, while both versions allow players to use a photo for their in-game profile. On June 19, 2015, Brain Age Express: Sudoku was pulled from the DSi Shop and 3DS eShop, with no official reason given. Brain Age Math and Arts & Letters are pre-installed on North American Nintendo DSis.
