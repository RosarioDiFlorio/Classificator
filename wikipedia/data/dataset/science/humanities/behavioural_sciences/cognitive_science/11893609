Batyr (July 23, 1970 – August 26, 1993) was an Asian elephant claimed to be able to use a large amount of meaningful human speech. Living in a zoo in Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union, Batyr was reported as having a vocabulary of more than 20 phrases. A recording of Batyr saying "Batyr is good", his name and using words such as "drink" and "give" was played on Kazakh state radio and on the First Programme of the Central Television of the USSR — Vremya, in 1980.
Like all cases of talking animals, these claims are subject to the observer-expectancy effect.
