Calming signals is a term coined by Norwegian dog trainer Turid Rugaas to describe the signals used by dogs to communicate with each other. According to Rugaas there are at least 30 calming signals. What signals dog use depends on the dog. They may use a subset of these signals. The signals, however, are universal and all dogs understand all signals even if they do not use them. Dogs are known to use these signals with humans too.
The term has been used by other canine behaviour experts to explain dog behaviour. Popular dog illustrator Lili Chin has illustrated these signals. There are several others who have illustrated these signals. Several books on dog behaviour and training now use the term calming signals to describe dog-dog and dog-human communication.
There are three main forms of communication used by dogs: auditory, visual, and olfactory.  Auditory includes a diverse range of sounds, such as grunts, whines, yelps, screams, tooth snapping, growling, coughing, and barking.  Visual communication often originates from the behaviour of wolves, displayed in the form of either aggressive/fearful acts, or dominant/submissive acts.  For example, an aggressive wolf is characterized by pricked ears, with both head and tail held high.  Similar behaviour would be displayed during an aggressive visual act of a domestic dog.  Olfactory communication is often used to distinguish a female during the period of heightened sexual arousal and activity.  Males are able to detect this sexual period from long distances, simply by the smell of her urine.
