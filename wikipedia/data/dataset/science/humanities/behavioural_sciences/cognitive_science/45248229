The Department of Information Studies is a department of the UCL Faculty of Arts and Humanities.
The School of Librarianship of the University of London was created in 1919 as a school of University College London. The School was the first school of librarianship that was full-time. The School was shut in 1939 and opened again in 1945. It later changed its name to School of Library, Archive and Information Studies and then to Department of Information Studies.

From 1947, the School also awarded a Diploma in Archive Administration. From 1966, the School also awarded Master of Arts (MA, by examination), Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in Librarianship or Archives (the MPhil and PhD degrees are awarded for a thesis or dissertation). From 1972, the School also awarded a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Information Studies.
