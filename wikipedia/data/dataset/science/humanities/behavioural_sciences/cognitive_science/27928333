The Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences (CSHALS) was a scientific meeting on the practical applications of semantic technology to pharmaceutical R&D, healthcare, and life sciences. The conference was held annually from 2008 to 2014, and was the premier meeting in this domain. In 2015, it as organised as a special interests group (SIG) meeting of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference.
Conference topics included a World Wide Web Consortium tutorial on semantic web standards. In 2012, CSHALS took on the additional topic of the application of Big Data to healthcare and life sciences, while maintaining its previous focus on semantic technologies.
