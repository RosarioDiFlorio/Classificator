The Leaf Project is a group robot development program whose objective is to develop a robot platform that supports experiments with artificial intelligence, vision, navigation, etc.
Leaf was created by Bruce Weimer, Alex Brown and Robin Hewitt. It is an artificial life program, inspired by Steve Grand's computer game Creatures, in which artificial beings hatch, develop, and interact in a simulated environment. A PC (software-only) version of Leaf was demonstrated in 2003, construction of the first robot began in early 2004.
