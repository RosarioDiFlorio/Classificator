Low field magnetic stimulation (LFMS) is an experimental form of non-invasive neurostimulation that aims to use broadly distributed, low field strength, oscillating magnetic stimulation to manipulate brain function, based on observations of mood changes in some people after they underwent certain kinds of magnetic resonance imaging; it is in the early stages of development.
