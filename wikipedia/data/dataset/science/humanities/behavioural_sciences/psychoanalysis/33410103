Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a very broad category involved in psychological disorders. PTSD is "consequence of terrifying occurrences, both natural and manmade, which shock the psychological system and violate core assumptions that life is predictable, safe, and secure" (Sharpless). Combat PTSD is common in soldiers that have experienced time in combat on the battlefield where they were exposed to many different traumatic scenes and situations. In the United States, the people that are involved with the treatment of combat PTSD are most likely employed by Veteran Affairs (VA). The treatments and therapies discussed will be prolonged exposure therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, cognitive processing therapy, drug therapy, and a few other therapies that are less practiced.
