The Palace at 4 a.m. is a 1932 surrealist sculpture by Alberto Giacometti. It is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
Giacometti said the work relates to "a period of six months passed in the presence of a woman who, concentrating all life in herself, transported my every moment into a state of enchantment. We constructed a fantastical palace in the nightâ€”a very fragile palace of matches. At the least false movement a whole section would collapse. We always began it again."
