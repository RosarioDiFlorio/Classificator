Hermine Hug-Hellmuth (born Hermine Hug Edle von Hugenstein; 31 August 1871, Vienna â€“ 9 September 1924, Vienna) was an Austrian psychoanalyst. She is regarded as the first psychoanalyst practicing with children. She was killed by her nephew Rudolf Hug on 9 September 1924.
A Young Girl's Diary (1921), published in New York by T. Seltzer, and prefaced with an enthusiastic letter from Sigmund Freud dated 27 April 1915, is thought to be probably by Hug-Hellmuth.
