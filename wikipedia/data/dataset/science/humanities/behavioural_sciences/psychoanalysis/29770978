Oliver Feltham is an Australian philosopher and translator working in Paris, France. He is known primarily for his English translations of Alain Badiou, most notably Badiouâ€™s magnum opus Being and Event (2006). Feltham's own writings are drawn from many of his research interests including Marxism, critical theory, and the history of metaphysics. His recent work has also focused on psychoanalysis and Jaques Lacan.
Feltham received his B.A. at the University of Sydney. In 2000, he completed his doctoral thesis at Deakin University in Melbourne, writing his dissertation on the ontological distinction between praxis and work in ancient and modern philosophy (with a focus on Badiou and Michel Foucault) based on research Feltham conducted in Paris.
Feltham teaches at the American University of Paris (AUP) where he has been since 2004 and where he became a full-time associate professor in 2006, teaching in the comparative literature and "Global Communications" departments and in the Philosophy Program. Feltham is also a researcher at the Circle for Lacanian Ideology Critique at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht.
