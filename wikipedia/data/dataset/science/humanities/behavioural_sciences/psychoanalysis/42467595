Allen Wheelis (October 23, 1915 â€“ June 14, 2007) was a psychoanalyst and writer who lived in San Francisco, CA. He achieved renown and success with his psychoanalytic practice, which spanned five decades despite the fact that he expressed ambivalence and doubt about the field and his own work in it (Merkin, 2007). Wheelis died on June 14, 2007 at the age of 91 in a San Francisco hospital after receiving back surgery(Squatriglia, 2007).
