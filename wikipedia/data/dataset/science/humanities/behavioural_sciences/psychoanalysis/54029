Cubomania is a surrealist method of making collages in which a picture or image is cut into squares and the squares are then reassembled without regard for the original image, either automatically "or at random." The word can also mean the collage made using this method, a "rearrangement... suffic[ing] to create an entirely new work." The technique was invented by the Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca. It has been described as a "statistical method". Robert Hirsch has seemed to imply that this process can be done with digital photography. Although seemingly a contradiction in terms, at least one cubomania has been made with triangular shapes, rather than rectangles.
Penelope Rosemont and Joseph Jablonski have suggested that cubomania, with other surrealist methods, can "subvert the enslaving 'message' of advertising and to free images from repressive contexts."
Using cubomania as a method for arranging soundscapes has been suggested.
