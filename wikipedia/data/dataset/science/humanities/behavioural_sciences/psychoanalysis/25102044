Identified patient, or "IP", is a term used in a clinical setting to describe the person in a dysfunctional family who has been unconsciously selected to act out the family's inner conflicts as a diversion. This person, often a child, is "the split-off carrier of a breakdown in the entire family system," which may be a transgenerational disturbance or trauma.
The term is also used in the context of organizational management, in circumstances where an individual becomes the carrier of a group problem.
