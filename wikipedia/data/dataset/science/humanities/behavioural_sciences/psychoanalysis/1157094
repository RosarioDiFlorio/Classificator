Judith Miller (French: [milɛʁ]; 3 July, 1941 – 7 December, 2017) was a French psychoanalyst. She was the daughter of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and Sylvia Bataille. Her spouse was Lacanian Jacques-Alain Miller.
As a Maoist philosophy lecturer at Vincennes in Paris, her radicalism was used as a reason for her philosophy department to be decertified. This occurred after she handed out course credit to someone she met on a bus, and subsequently publicly declared in a radio interview that the university is a capitalist institution, and that she would do everything she could to make it run as badly as possible. After this, she was demoted by the French education department to a lycée teacher.
