Sandor Rado (Hungarian: Radó Sándor; 8 January 1890, Kisvárda – 14 May 1972, New York City) was a Hungarian psychoanalyst of the second generation, who moved to the United States of America in the thirties.
According to Peter Gay, "Budapest produced some of the most conspicuous talents in the analytic profession: in addition to Ferenczi, these included Franz Alexander, [&] Sándor Radó."
Rado is known for having coined the term "schizotype" in 1956 as an abbreviation of "schizophrenic phenotype".
