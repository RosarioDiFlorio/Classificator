Judith Ida Kestenberg (née Silberpfennig; 17 March 1910 in Tarnów, Poland – 16 January 1999 in Sands Point, New York) was a child psychiatrist who worked with Holocaust survivors. She founded the International Study of Organized Persecution of Children (ISOPC) an organization that coordinated the psyologically informed interviews of over 1500 child survivors throughout much of the world. She was also the lead creator of the Kestenberg Movement Profile (KMP), used to create a psychological profile based exclusively on movement patterns.
