Self and Others is a psychological study by R. D. Laing, first published in 1961. It was re-issued in a second edition (1969), which (in Laing's words) was “extensively revised, without being changed in any fundamental way”.
The book formed part of a series of writings by Laing in the Sixties on the relationship of madness to the self within a social context or nexus, writings which created something of a cult of Laing at the time.
