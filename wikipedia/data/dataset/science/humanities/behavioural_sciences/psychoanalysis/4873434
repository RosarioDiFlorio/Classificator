Mann de Dayán describes the "Sensory Oversaturation Syndrome" as Isaias Lopez's main contribution to the psychodynamics of adolescence. According to this phenomenon, the adolescent manages to move away from his own narcissistic needs by overstimulating himself, as a first step before he projects his needs to outside sources.
Manuel Isaias Lopez died from complications of lung cancer in New York City on November 29, 2017.
