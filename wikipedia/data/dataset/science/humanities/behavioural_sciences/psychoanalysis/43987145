Psychoanalytic infant observation is a distinctive experiential approach to training that was developed at the Tavistock Clinic in London by Child psychoanalyst Esther Bick. In 1948 she collaborated with Dr John Bowlby to develop the approach to training psychotherapy students in conducting an infant observation. It has since become an essential feature of pre-clinical training in child and adult psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and related fields throughout the world.
The practice of psychoanalytic infant observation usually involves a weekly observation over a two year period of an infant from soon after birth and until their second birthday. This naturalistic form of enquiry provides a unique opportunity to enrich and extend observation skills. Students learn at first-hand how a relationship begins between babies and their families and enables them think about how babies grow physically, mentally and emotionally. This experience of observing ordinary family life is valuable for professionals who work with difficult, complex and disturbing presentations.
