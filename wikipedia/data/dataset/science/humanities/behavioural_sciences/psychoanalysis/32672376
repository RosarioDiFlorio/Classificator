Aerography is a surrealist method in which a stencil used in spraypainting is replaced by a three-dimensional object, sometimes in extreme cases male artists have used their genitals as stencils. The aerography technique is most recognizable as a blended and photorealistic style. The method has been used to decorate tiles from the Victorian era  and in the works of Man Ray.
