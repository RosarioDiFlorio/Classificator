Interpersonal psychoanalysis is based on the theories of American psychiatrist Harry Stack Sullivan (1892â€“1949). Sullivan believed that the details of a patient's interpersonal interactions with others can provide insight into the causes and cures of mental disorder.
Current practitioners stress such features as the detailed description of clinical experience, the mutuality of the interpersonal process, and the not-knowing of the analyst.
