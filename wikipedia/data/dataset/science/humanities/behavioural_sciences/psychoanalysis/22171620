A lay analysis is a psychoanalysis performed by someone who is not a physician; that person was designated a lay analyst.
In The Question of Lay Analysis (1927), Freud defended the right of those trained in psychoanalysis to practice therapy irrespective of any medical degree: he would strive tirelessly to maintain the independence of the psychoanalytic movement from what he saw as a medical monopoly for the rest of his life.
