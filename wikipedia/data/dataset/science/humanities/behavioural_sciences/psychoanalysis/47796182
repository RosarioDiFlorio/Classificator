Multimedia psychotherapy is a new form of psychotherapy created by psychoanalyst Domenico A. Nesci (member of the International Psychoanalytic Association) and his son, producer artist Filippo A. Nesci, in Rome, Italy, in 2007.
The method was originally conceived as a technique to help mourning patients suffering from grief and bereavement.
