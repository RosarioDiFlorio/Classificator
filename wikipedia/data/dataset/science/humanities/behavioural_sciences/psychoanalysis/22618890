Mohammed Masud Raza Khan (21 July 1924 â€“ June 1989) was a Pakistani British psychoanalyst. His training analyst was Donald Winnicott. Masud Raza Khan was a protege of Sigmund Freud's daughter Anna Freud, and a long-time collaborator with Donald Winnicott. Indeed, Anna Freud insisted that Khan understood her father's work better than anyone else and spoke in defence of her star student whenever he aroused the Society's ire.
