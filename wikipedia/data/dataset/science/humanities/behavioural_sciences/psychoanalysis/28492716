Evenly-suspended attention is the kind of direction-less listening – removed from both theoretical presuppositions and therapeutic goals – recommended by Sigmund Freud for use in psychoanalysis. By attaching no preconceived importance to any particular part of the analysand's discourse, and allowing his or her unconscious complete freedom to act, the analyst can best profit from the counterpart rule of free association on the part of the analysand.
Such "hovering" attention (as Freud put it in 1909 in the case of Little Hans) was a technical development on his part from the more aggressive listening and interpretation of the 1890s, as his shift from hypnosis to psychoanalysis took gradual shape.
