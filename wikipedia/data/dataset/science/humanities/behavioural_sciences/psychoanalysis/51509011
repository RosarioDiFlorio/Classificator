The Family romance is a psychological complex identified by Sigmund Freud in 1908, whereby the young child or adolescent fantasizes that they are really the children of parents of higher social standing than their actual parents.
More broadly, the term can be used to cover the whole range of instinctual ties between siblings, and parents and children.
