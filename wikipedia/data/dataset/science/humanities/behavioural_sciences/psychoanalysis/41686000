Structure & Dynamics of the Psyche is Volume 8 in The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, a series of books published by Princeton University Press in the U.S. and Routledge & Kegan Paul in the U.K. It is a revised translation of one of Jung's most important longer works. There is an appendix of four shorter papers on personality type, published between 1913 and 1935.
This volume traces an important line of development in Jung's thought from 1912 onwards. It first elaborates Freud's concept of sexual libido into Jung's own concept: psychic energy. Then it shows how Jung slowly arrived at a concept even more controversial than psychic energy was in its day: psychic reality. The book has Jung's first mention of the archetype, as well as his later views on its nature. There is also a 1916 essay on the therapeutic uses of active imagination.
Several important chapters elucidate Jung's ideas on synchronicity. These were later published separately as Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle.
Extensive detailed abstracts of each chapter are available online.
