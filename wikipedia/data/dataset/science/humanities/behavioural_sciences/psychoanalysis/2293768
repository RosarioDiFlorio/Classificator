Maryse Choisy (1903â€“1979) was a French philosophical writer.
Choisy followed an atypical path in life. Fascinated by psychoanalysis, she had the idea of introducing its concepts into her novels to better develop their characters; she then undertook to see what else could be brought to literature from other disciplines. She founded a movement which she named Suridealism to indicate the conceptual foundation on which it rested.
