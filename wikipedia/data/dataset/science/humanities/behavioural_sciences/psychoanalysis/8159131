Camille-Pierre Pambu Bodo, known as Bodo (1953 – March 5, 2015), was a painter from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Bodo currently preaches, lives, and works in Kinshasa. He was born in 1953 and raised in Mandu. He finished his secondary schooling in Mandu in 1970, and moved to Kinshasa the same year in order to partake in the landmark exhibition Art Partout. In 1980, Bodo converted to Christianity and became the pastor of world evangelism within the Pentecostal Church and was convinced that it would change his life. Bodo Pambu is one of the founders and key proponents of the Zaïre school of popular painting. His works, along with those of other artists, vigorously exemplify their belief in their capacity to create art that could change history.
