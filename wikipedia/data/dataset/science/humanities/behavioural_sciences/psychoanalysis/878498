Sir Harold Jeffreys, FRS (22 April 1891 â€“ 18 March 1989) was a British mathematician, statistician, geophysicist, and astronomer. The book that he and Bertha Swirles wrote Theory of Probability, which first appeared in 1939, played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability.
