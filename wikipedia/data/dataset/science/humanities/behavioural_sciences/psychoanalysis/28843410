Claude Nachin (born 1930) is a French psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, the majority of whose writings have affiliations with the joint work of Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, particularly with respect to their concept of the intergenerational "phantom".
"The vast majority of clinical case studies of phantom formations and their sequelae have appeared in France. See, especially, Claude Nachin, Les Fantomes de l'Ã¢me[Ghosts of the Soul]"
