Lacanian Ink is a cultural journal based in New York City and founded in the Autumn of 1990 by Josefina Ayerza to provide the American intellectual scene with the theoretical perspective of European post-structuralism. It features major analyses of psychoanalytic theory, poetry, philosophy and contemporary art. A distinctive element of its contents is the dissemination of the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, whereby the seminars given by Jacques-Alain Miller at Paris VIII on Lacanian theory have become available in English.
Richard Kostelanetz in his book The Decline and Fall of a Soho Art Community notes that Lacanian Ink, together with a number of other journals involved in contemporary culture, have been witnesses to the century's last decade phenomena. "Today, there are but three of these magazines that continue... Bomb Magazine and Lacanian Ink are two of them."
