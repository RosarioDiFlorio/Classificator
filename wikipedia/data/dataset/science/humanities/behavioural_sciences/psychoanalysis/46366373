Catherine Millot (born 1944) is a French Lacanian psychoanalyst and author, professor of psychoanalysis at the University of Paris-VIII.
Millot studied philosophy before turning to psychoanalysis. In 1971 she started an eight-year analysis with Lacan, and attended his seminars from 1971 until his death. Her thesis, turned into the book Freud anti-p√©dagogue, argued that pedagogy could not be based on psychoanalysis, since the role of analyst involved a radical openness to lack which was incompatible with the role of teacher. In 1975 she started teaching in the department of psychoanalysis at Paris VIII.
She has written on transsexuality, arguing controversially that a woman's transsexuality is hysteric while a man's transsexuality is based on psychotic identification with the inaccessible completeness of woman as an ideal woman.
