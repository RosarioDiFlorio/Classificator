Hypnoanalysis is the technique of using hypnosis in the practice of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. It attempts to utilize the trance state induced by hypnosis to effect a conscious understanding of a person's unconscious psychodynamics.
Early proponents of hypnoanalysis were Lewis Wolberg in 1945, followed by Erika Fromm who in collaboration with Daniel Brown and Michael Nash wrote on the benefits of hypnoanalysis in the 1980s and 1990s.
