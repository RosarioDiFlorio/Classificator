The apprentice complex is a psychodynamic constellation whereby a boy or youth resolves the Oedipus complex by an identification with his father, or father figure, as someone from whom to learn the future secrets of masculinity.
The term was introduced by Otto Fenichel in 1946, and has since been developed by postmodern writers on the construction of masculinity.
