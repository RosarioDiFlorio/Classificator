Sergei Konstantinovitch Pankejeff (Russian: Серге́й Константи́нович Панке́ев; December 24, 1886 – May 7, 1979) was a Russian aristocrat from Odessa best known for being a patient of Sigmund Freud, who gave him the pseudonym of Wolf Man (der Wolfsmann) to protect his identity, after a dream Pankejeff had of a tree full of white wolves.
