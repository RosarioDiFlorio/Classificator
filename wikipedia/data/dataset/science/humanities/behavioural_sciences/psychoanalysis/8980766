Maria Torok (Hungarian: Török Mária; 10 November 1925, Budapest – 25 March 1998, New York City) was a French psychoanalyst, of Hungarian ascent.
Torok is best known for her idiosyncratic contributions to psychoanalytic theory, developed in the wake of first Freud, then Ferenczi, and also the critical study of Husserl, and often coauthored with Nicolas Abraham. With Abraham, Maria Torok has made significant advances in the study of the problem of pathological mourning and transgenerational influences.
