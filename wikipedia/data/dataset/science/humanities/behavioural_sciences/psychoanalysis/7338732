Abreaction (German: Abreagieren) is a psychoanalytical term for reliving an experience to purge it of its emotional excessesâ€”a type of catharsis. Sometimes it is a method of becoming conscious of repressed traumatic events.

Abreaction: concept introduced by Sigmund Freud in 1893 to denote the fact that pent-up emotions associated with a trauma can be discharged by talking about it. The release of affect occurred by bringing "a particular moment or problem into focus"... and as such formed the cornerstone of Freud's early cathartic method of treating hysterical conversion symptoms.

Freud's mentor, Josef Breuer, may have actually introduced the concept of abreaction. Early in his career, psychoanalyst Carl Jung expressed interest in abreaction, or what he referred to as trauma theory, but later decided it had limitations in treatment of neurosis. Jung said:

Though traumata of clearly aetiological significance were occasionally present, the majority of them appeared very improbable. Many traumata were so unimportant, even so normal, that they could be regarded at most as a pretext for the neurosis. But what especially aroused my criticism was the fact that not a few traumata were simply inventions of fantasy and had never happened at all.
