Barbara Low (1874 – 1955) was one of the first British psychoanalysts, and an early pioneer of analytic theory in England. She was born in London and named Alice Leonora, the eleventh and last child of Therese (née Schacerl) and Maximillian Loewe, who moved to Britain following Loewe’s part in the failed 1848 uprising in Hungary.
