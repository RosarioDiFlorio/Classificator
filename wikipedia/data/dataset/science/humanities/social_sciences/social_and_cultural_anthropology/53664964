Oikofobie. De angst voor het eigene (Oikophobia. The fear of home) is a 2013 Dutch book written by Thierry Baudet.
In the book Baudet follows Roger Scruton's criticism on cultural relativism and multiculturalism. Baudets comes up with the word Oikophobia and explains this as a term that stands for a type of self hate of the (left) elite towards their own traditional culture. According to Baudet this becomes visible in the society in the dominant preference for open borders within Europe, modern art, multiculturalism. The book forms, together with Baudets other book Aanval op de natiestaat, the fundament for his political program of his political party Forum voor Democratie.
Reviews about the book have appeared in De Groene Amsterdammer, Joop (VARA), Vlaams Belang, Trouw, Vrij Nederland, Nederlandse Publieke Omroep Kunststof, Propria Cures, De Dagelijkse Standaard.
