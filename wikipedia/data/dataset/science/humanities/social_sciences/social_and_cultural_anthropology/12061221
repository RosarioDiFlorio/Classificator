Melissa Hawach (nee Engdahl) is a Canadian woman who gained international attention following a complicated custody dispute with her former husband, Joseph Hawach, over the couple's two children. The children—who hold citizenship in Canada, Australia and Lebanon—were taken to Lebanon by their father in July 2006 in violation of Canadian custody orders and subsequently retrieved by their mother in December 2006 in defiance of Lebanese law. The ongoing situation has international implications as regards jurisdiction in cases of multinational custody disputes. Hawach released a book about the ordeal titled "Flight of the Dragonfly" in May 2008.
