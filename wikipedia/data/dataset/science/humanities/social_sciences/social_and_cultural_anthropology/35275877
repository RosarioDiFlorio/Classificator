Virgin boy eggs are a traditional dish of Dongyang, Zhejiang, China in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys, preferably under the age of ten. Named "tong zi dan" (Chinese: 童子蛋; pinyin: Tóngzǐdàn), the dish translates literally to "boy egg" and is a springtime tradition of the city where the urine is collected from prepubescent males. The eggs have been listed by officials in China as a part of the region's "local intangible cultural heritage".
