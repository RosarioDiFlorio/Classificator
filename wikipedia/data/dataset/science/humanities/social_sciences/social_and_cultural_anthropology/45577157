The Seven Men of Knoydart was the name given to a group of squatters who tried to appropriate land at Knoydart in 1948 by the press at the time, evoking the memory of the seven Jacobites who accompanied the Young Pretender on his voyage to Scotland in 1745. Comprising seven ex-servicemen, their claim was to be the last land raid in Scotland.
