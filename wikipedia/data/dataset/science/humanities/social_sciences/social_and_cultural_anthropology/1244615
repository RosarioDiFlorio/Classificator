A conjugal family is a nuclear family consisting of a married couple and their children (by birth or adoption) who are unmarried and underage. Conjugal means there is a marriage relationship. The family relationship is principally focused inward and ties to extended kin are voluntary and based on emotional bonds, rather than strict duties and obligations. The spouses and their children are considered to be of prime importance, and other more distant relatives less important. The marriage bond is important and stressed. Families have evolved over time by becoming more modern. There are now same sex parents, step parents, adoptive parents so, the name conjugal family was created. It is a much more modern term for nuclear family.
