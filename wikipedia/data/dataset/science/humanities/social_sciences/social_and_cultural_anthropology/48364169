The Ecocapsule is an egg-shaped, mobile dwelling designed to produce more electricity than it consumes and harvest more rainwater than its occupants use. It was developed by Nice Architects, a firm based in Bratislava, Slovakia. Shaped like an egg to minimize its surface-area-to-volume ratio, its walls are made of two layers of aluminum-reinforced polycarbonate with aerogel insulation sandwiched in between. Nice Architects describes the Ecocapsule as a "low-energy house packed into a compact form", although other potential applications include as a disaster-relief shelter, a scientific research station, and even as a "remote Airbnb".
