Sex change is a process by which a person or animal changes sex â€“ that is, by which female sexual characteristics are substituted for male ones, or vice versa. Sex change may occur naturally, as in the case of the sequential hermaphroditism observed in some species. Most commonly, however, the term is used for sex reassignment therapy, including sex reassignment surgery, carried out on humans. It is also sometimes used for the medical procedures applied to intersex people. The term may also be applied to the broader process of changing gender role ("living as a woman" instead of living as a man, or vice versa), including but not necessarily limited to medical procedures.
