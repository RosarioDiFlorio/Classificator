He has been described as "first Darwinian sociologist" or "the first sociobiologist".
He helped found academic sociology in the United Kingdom, becoming the first professor of sociology (with Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse) in 1907 in the University of London. Other chairs he held were in Helsinki and Turku.
A radical free thinker for his time, he critiqued Christian institutions and Christian ideas on the grounds that they lacked foundation.
In the UK, his name is often spelled Edward. His sister, Helena Westermarck, was a writer and artist.
