The Athletes Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games were situated on a 35 hectare site, in the east end of Glasgow. The whole project was designed by the Paul Stallan Studio @ RMJM.  At first the site was used as accommodation for up to 8000 athletes and officials from all over the Commonwealth nations, as well as providing a retail area, recreation area, dining hall and medical facilities for the athletes. After the commonwealth games the site was further developed and has up to 1,400 homes, a portion of which are available for social rental.
