Bread and salt is a welcome greeting ceremony in Slavic and other European cultures and in Middle Eastern cultures. The tradition, known by local Slavic names: Belarusian: Хлеб і соль; ; ; Croatian: Kruh i sol; ; Polish: Chleb i sól; Slovak: Chlieb a soľ; Czech: Chléb a sůl; Slovene: Kruh in sol; ,  was also adopted by three non-Slavic nations — Lithuanians, Latvians (both Baltic) and Romanians (Latin) — all three of which are culturally and historically close to their Slavic neighbours (Lithuanian: Duona ir druska. Latvian: Sālsmaize and Romanian: Pâine și sare). It is also common in Albania (Albanian: bukë, kripë e zemër), Armenia (Armenian: աղ ու հաց, agh u hats), the Jewish diaspora, and the Middle East. Nowadays, this tradition is sometimes observed in spaceflight.
