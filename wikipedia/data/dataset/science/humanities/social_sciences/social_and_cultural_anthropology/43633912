A bank number is a bank code used to identify a bank for electronic purposes in the United States. Bank numbers such as Bank Identifier Code (BIC), Bank Identification Number (BIN), and Routing transit number (RTN) categorizes a bank for machine-aided sorting of checks and so forth. The term is used in some deposit-slip instructions such as "List checks separately by bank number."
In the U.S.A. the first part stands for an area and the second part for a bank in that area. In the first half of the 20th century the area was either a major city or one of the 50 United States of America. After about 1950 the area was a central bank location. The old numbers were like 3-1, the new numbers were like 0310-0001 with hyphen now only implied. A ninth check digit was added to the end of the newer bank numbers. Since the 1950s a transitional form like 3-1/310 has also been printed on checks.
Some sample deposit slips say "List checks singly" with checks listed only by their amounts.
