Firdeusi (eng: Ferdowsi) Institute for Iranian and Persian Studies is a non-for-profit and non-governmental organisation, which scientific and research activity is conducted autonomously, and is not biased by political or religious matters. The Institute has been established in the form of “Center” (with no membership) by two founders: Marin Barleti University and Iranian Cultural Foundation “Saadi Shirazi”  thanks to the Cooperation agreement held in October 6, 2010. The ceremony of launching was held on 29 October 2010, initiating the functioning of the first research institute for Persian studies in Albania, at University level.
The Institute name “Firdeusi” (eng: Ferdowsi) comes the greatest Persian poets, thinkers and writers, Abul-Kasim Hasan Pur-Ali Tusi Ferdowsi, known otherwise as the Father of the Iranology Studies worldwide. The choice came also as a tribute to the “Ferdowsi Shahnameh Millenium” proclaimed by UNESCO in 2010. The Institute Logo has been inspired by the poet’s name and is interwoven with calligraphy elements from the Persian language. Logo represents an open book, being a metaphor of the scientific character of the Institute.
