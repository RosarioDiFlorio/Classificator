Western Christianity is the Christianity which developed in the areas of the former Western Roman Empire. Western Christianity consists of the Latin Church of the Roman Catholic Church (in contrast to the Eastern churches in communion with Rome), the Waldensians, Hussites, and a wide variety of Protestant denominations, including Anglicanism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, Lutheranism, and others. The name is applied in order to distinguish these from Eastern Christianity.
Western Christianity initially developed in Europe during the first centuries AD. With the expansion of European colonialism from the Early Modern era, it came to stretch throughout the Americas, much of the Philippines, Southern Africa, pockets of West Africa, and throughout Australia and New Zealand. Thus, when used for historical periods since the 16th century, the term "Western Christianity" refers collectively to the Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations combined, especially to their shared theological and liturgical traits, rather than to geographic location.
Today, the geographical distinction between Western and Eastern Christianity is not nearly as absolute, due to the spread of missionary activities, migrations, and globalisation. The adjectives "Western Christianity" and "Eastern Christianity" are typically used to refer to historical origins and differences in liturgy rather than present geographical locations.
