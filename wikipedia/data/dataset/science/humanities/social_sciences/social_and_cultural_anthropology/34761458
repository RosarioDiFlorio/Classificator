The Sekhmet Hypothesis was first published in book form in 1995 by Iain Spence. It suggested a possible link between the emergence of youth cultural symbols in relation to the 11-year solar cycles. The hypothesis was published again in 1997 in the journal Towards 2012 and covered in 1999, in Sleazenation magazine.
