Mormonism and Mormon adherents have been subjected to, as well as in a few instances themselves used, significant violence throughout much of the religion's history. In the early history of the United States, violence was used as a form of control. Many people of different faiths used violence in order to harass and persecute people who adhered to different religious beliefs. The members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, especially in its early history, were both the victims and sometimes the perpetrators of violence in much the same way as were the followers of other major religions. Mormons were violently persecuted and pushed from Ohio to Missouri, from Missouri to Illinois and from Illinois, they were pushed west to the Utah Territory. There were incidents of massacre, home burning and pillaging, followed by the death of their founder, Joseph Smith. Smith died from multiple gunshot wounds in a gun battle while jailed in Carthage; Smith defended himself a small pistol smuggled to him by Cyrus Wheelock. However, there were also a few notable incidents in which Latter-day Saints perpetrated violence, such as the Mountain Meadows Massacre.
The memory of this violence has affected both the history and the doctrines of the Latter Day Saint movement.
