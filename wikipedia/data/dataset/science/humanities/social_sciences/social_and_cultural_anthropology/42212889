Bava Duzgı (Kırmanckî) or Dızgun Bava (Kurmancî) is a popular character in Dersim Province. He symbolizes also a mountain in Nazımiye, nearby the village Qıl. The people believe that he disappeared atop this mountain which is known as Kemerê Duzgınî (the rock of Duzgı), Bımbarek (holy) or Kemerê Bımbarekî (holy rock) in Kırmanckî (Zazakî). According to local narrations he is the son of sayyid Kures/Kureş who was an ancestor of Kureşan community and his real name is not Duzgı/Dızgun, it is Haydar or Shah Haydar. But some researches suggest the opposite of this view.
