A clachan (Irish: clochán, pronounced [kʰl̪ˠoxɑːn] or clachan, pronounced [kʰl̪ˠɑxɘn]; Scottish Gaelic: clachan, [kʰl̪ˠaxan]; Manx: claghan, pronounced [kʰl̪ˠaxan̪]) is a small settlement or hamlet in Ireland, the Isle of Man and Scotland. Though many were originally kirktowns, today they are often thought of as small villages lacking a church, post office, or other formal building. It is likely that many date to medieval times or earlier – a cluster of small single-storey cottages of farmers and/or fishermen, invariably found on poorer land. They were often related to the rundale system of farming. According to David Lloyd, the Great Famine in Ireland (1845–49) caused such disruption to the social system that the clachans there virtually disappeared; many in the Scottish Highlands were victims of the Clearances. In some cases, they have evolved into holiday villages, or one or two houses have taken over, turning smaller houses into agricultural outhouses. Remains can be seen in many upland and coastal areas. Some are clustered in a dip in the landscape, to protect from Atlantic winds, but others stretch haphazardly along main roads.
