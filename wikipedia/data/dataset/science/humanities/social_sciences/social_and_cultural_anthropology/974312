Ssireum (Hangul: 씨름) or Korean wrestling is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea since the fourth century.
In the modern form each contestant wears a belt (satba) that wraps around the waist and the thigh. The competition employs a series of techniques, which inflict little harm or injury to the opponent: opponents lock on to each other's belt, and one achieves victory by bringing any part of the opponent's body above the knee to the ground.
