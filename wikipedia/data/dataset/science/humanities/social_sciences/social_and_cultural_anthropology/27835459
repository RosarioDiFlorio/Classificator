CAFFE stands for Coordinating Anthropological Film Festivals in Europe. It is an initiative geared towards better cooperation and communication between the existing anthropological film festivals in Europe.
There are now courses in, and even centres of visual anthropology at several universities in Europe. An increasing number of students are enrolling in these courses, even short-term courses that merely scratch the surface of either visual anthropology or ethnographic filmmaking.  Most importantly is the fact that we now have an abundance of film festivals in Europe that are linked to the fields of visual anthropology, visual culture, ethnographic film, and other forms of audio-visual media. Each event has its own features and foci, reflecting both trends in the academic environments from which they emanate, as well as the cultural diversity of the globalised world that surrounds them.
Currently CAFFE network brings together seventeen anthropological and ethnographic film festivals
