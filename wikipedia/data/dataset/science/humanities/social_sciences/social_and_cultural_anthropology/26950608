Gimjang (김장), also spelled kimjang, is the traditional process of preparation and preservation of kimchi, the spicy Korean pickled vegetable dish, in the wintertime. During the summer months, Kimchi is made fresh, from seasonal vegetables. For one month, starting from the tenth moon of the year, people prepare large quantities of kimchi, to provide nutrition throughout winter.
Gimjang was listed as an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in December 2013.
