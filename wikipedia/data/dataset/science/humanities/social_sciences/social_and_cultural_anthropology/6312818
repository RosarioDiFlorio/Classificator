A boma is a livestock enclosure, stockade, corral, small fort or a district government office used in many parts of the African Great Lakes region, as well as Central and Southern Africa. It is particularly associated with European colonial rule. It is incorporated into many African languages, as well as colonial varieties of English, French and German.
As a livestock enclosure, a boma is the equivalent of kraal. The former term is used in areas influenced by the Swahili language, and the latter is employed in areas influenced by Afrikaans.
In the form of fortified villages or camps, bomas were commonplace in Central Africa in the 18th and 19th century in areas affected by the slave trade, tribal wars and colonial conquest, and were built by both sides in such conflicts.
Apart from the neatly built stockades shown in illustrations of bomas, the term, in practice, more often resembled the structure shown in the cartoon accompanying this article. In that form, they often were referred to by the likes of J. A. Hunter and Henry Morton Stanley.
