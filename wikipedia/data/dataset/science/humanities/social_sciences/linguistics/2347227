In linguistics, a segment is "any discrete unit that can be identified, either physically or auditorily, in the stream of speech". The term is most used in phonetics and phonology to refer to phones and phonemes, but can be applied for any minimum unit of a linear sequence meaningful to the given field of analysis, such as a mora or a syllable, a morpheme in morphology, or a chereme in sign language analysis.
Segments are called "discrete" because they are separate and individual, such as consonants and vowels, and occur in a distinct temporal order. Other contrastive elements of speech, such as prosody (tone, stress), and sometimes secondary articulations such as nasalization, may coexist with multiple segments and cannot be discretely ordered with them. These elements are termed suprasegmental.
