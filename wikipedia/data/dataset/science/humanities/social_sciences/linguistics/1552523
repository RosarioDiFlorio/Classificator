In theoretical linguistics, a converb (abbreviated cvb) is a nonfinite verb form that serves to express adverbial subordination: notions like 'when', 'because', 'after' and 'while'.
Examples:
On being elected president, he moved with his family to the capital.
He walks the streets eating cakes.
Converbs are differentiated from coverbs, verbs in complex predicates in languages that have the serial verb construction.
Converbs can be observed in Turkic and Mongolian languages, especially Mongolian.
