Information packaging refers to the way phrases and clauses are structured to organize and highlight particular words. It is not about paragraph structure. For example, the difference between an active clause (e.g., the police want him) and a corresponding passive (e.g., he is wanted by police) is a syntactic difference, but one motivated by information packaging considerations. Other information packaging constructions include preposing (e.g., that one I don't like) and inversion (e.g., "the end", said the man").
A basic principle in information packaging is that old information is typically mentioned before new information. This explains why a sentence like the mirror was broken by me sounds so odd. Here me is old information (since the speaker is already part of the conversation).
