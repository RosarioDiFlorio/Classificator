In Latin and Greek poetry, correption (; Latin correptiō [korˈreptɪoː] "a shortening") is the shortening of a long vowel at the end of one word before a short vowel at the beginning of the next. Vowels next to each other in neighboring words are in hiatus.
Homer uses correption in dactylic hexameter:
Ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε·
— Odyssey 1.2
Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full
many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
— translation by A.T. Murray
Here the sequence η ε in bold must be pronounced as ε ε to preserve the long—short—short syllable weight sequence of a dactyl. Thus, the scansion of the second line is thus:
πλαγχ θε, ε | πει Τροι | ης ι ε | ρον πτο λι | εθ ρο νε | περ σε
