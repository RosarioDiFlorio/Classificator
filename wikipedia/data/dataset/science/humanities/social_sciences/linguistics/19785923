Fay Kee Bolee (Urdu: ف کی بولی‎‎, lit. Fay Language) is a language game used by Urdu-speaking people in Pakistan. It can be regarded as a trivial substitution cipher and it is sometimes used by adults to converse in (perceived) privacy in the presence of children. It is close to games found in other languages such as Farfallino alphabet (Italian), jeringonza (Spanish/Portuguese), and Pig Latin (English).
"Fay" (ف‎), Urdu language Alphabet corresponding to the sound of F in English, can be replaced by most other consonants to form another variety. Pay ki Boli is another more complex variation of the language game.
