The Proto-Human language (also Proto-Sapiens, Proto-World) is the speculative most recent common ancestor of all, or at least the large majority of, the world's languages.
The concept of "Proto-Human" presupposes monogenesis (evolution from a common ancestor) of all natural languages apart from pidgins, creoles, and sign languages. It does not presuppose a common ancestor of these languages with all extinct lineages, whether human or possible Neanderthal languages.
