In rhetoric, eunoia is the goodwill a speaker cultivates between himself/herself and his/her audience, a condition of receptivity. It comes from the Greek word εὔνοια, meaning "well mind" or "beautiful thinking". In book eight of Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle uses the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of goodwill a spouse has which form the basis for the ethical foundation of human life. Cicero translates εὔνοια (eunoia) with the Latin word benevolentia.
It is also a rarely used medical term referring to a state of normal mental health. Eunoia is the shortest English word containing all five main vowel graphemes.
