"Ancrene Wisse and Hali Meiðhad" is a 1929 essay by J. R. R. Tolkien on the thirteenth century Middle English treatise Ancrene Wisse ("The Anchoresses' Rule") and on the tract on virginity Hali Meiðhad ("Holy Maidenhood"). The essay has been called "the most perfect of Tolkien's academic pieces".
In this essay Tolkien first promulgated the AB language concept.
Tolkien and Ker later (in 1962) edited a volume of the text for the Early English Text Society.
