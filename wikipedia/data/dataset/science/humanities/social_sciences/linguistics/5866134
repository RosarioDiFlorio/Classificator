A tussenvoegsel (pronounced [ˈtɵsə(n)ˌvuxsəl]) in Dutch linguistics is a word that is positioned between a person's first name and the main part of the last name similar to Irish or Scottish surname prefixes, French particules or German von. The most common tussenvoegsels are "van" (as in Vincent van Gogh; see also van (Dutch)) meaning "from" and "de" (as in Greg de Vries), meaning "the". If a tussenvoegsel is present it forms an integral part of a surname, to separate it from similar Dutch surnames that include no tussenvoegsel (e.g. as in Jan de Boer versus Albert Boer and Frits de Kok versus Wim Kok).
The use of tussenvoegsels differs between the Netherlands and Belgium.
