The natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on the conception of Polish professor Andrzej Bogus≈Çawski. The theory was formally developed by Anna Wierzbicka at Warsaw University and later at the Australian National University in the early 1970s, and Cliff Goddard at Australia's Griffith University.
