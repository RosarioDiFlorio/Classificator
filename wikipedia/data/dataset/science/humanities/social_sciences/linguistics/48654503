Gergely Czuczor (17 December 1800 - 9 September 1866) was a Hungarian Benedictine monk, a poet and linguist, member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Baptized István (the equivalent of which is Stephen) he took Gergely (George) as his monk name.
As down-to-earth common sense a poet as Petőfi: his national poems also quickly became folk songs and popular. Both poets tended to emulate the rhythm of folk songs in their poems, which served the Nationalist cause in the popular common sense way.
He participated in the fight for freedom against Habsburg rule. One of his most famous poems, "Riadó" i.e. 'Alarm', was published in Kossuth's newspaper on December 21st 1848 while the Austrian troops were already closing in on Pest-Buda. It was also published on flyers, separately, and it quickly propagated amongst soldiers and the people as a sort of a march of the revolution quite as Petőfi's poems would.
