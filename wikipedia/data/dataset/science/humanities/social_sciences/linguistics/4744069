Lexiko was a word game invented by Alfred Butts. It was a precursor of Scrabble. The name comes from the Greek lexicos, meaning of "words."
Lexiko was played with a set of 100 square cardboard tiles, with the same letter distribution later used by Scrabble (see Scrabble letter distributions), but no board. Players drew nine tiles at random, and attempted to construct words from them.
