Contrastive rhetoric is the study of how a person's first language and culture influence his or her writing in a second language. The term was first coined by the American applied linguist Robert Kaplan in 1966 and widely expanded from 1996 to today by Finnish-born, US-based applied linguist Ulla Connor, among others. Since its inception the area of study has had a significant impact on the teaching of writing in both English as a second language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL) classes, bringing attention to cultural and linguistic differences in the writing of English L2 students. This attention to writing was especially welcomed in the area of ESL instruction, as an emphasis on spoken-language skills had previously dominated ESL contexts in the United States.
