Phonetically Intuitive English (PIE) is a scheme and a Chrome browser extension that automatically adds diacritics to English words on Web pages to show pronunciation, intended for English-as-a-second-language (ESL) learners to learn correct pronunciations as they browse the Web, and for children in English-speaking countries to learn to read. The free project has been reported by PCWorld and other media outlets and invited to National Education Association Exposition 2013, receiving very positive feedback from educators nationwide.
