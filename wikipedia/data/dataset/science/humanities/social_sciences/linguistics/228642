In certain languages, the final form is a special character used to represent a letter only when it occurs at the end of a word.
In the Hebrew alphabet the final form is called sofit (Hebrew: סופית‎, meaning "final" or "ending"). The following Hebrew letters
kaf כ, mem מ, nun נ, pe פ, and tsadi צ
have the final forms
kaf sofit ך, mem sofit ם, nun sofit ן, pe sofit ף, and tsadi sofit ץ.
Some languages that use final form characters are:
Arabic
Hebrew
Manchu
Greek
The lowercase Latin letter "s" had separate medial (ſ) and final (s) in the orthographies of many European languages from the medieval period to the early 19th century; it survived in the German Fraktur script until the 1940s.
