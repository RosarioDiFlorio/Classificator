The velar lateral tap is an allophone of the velar lateral approximant in some languages of New Guinea, such as Kanite and Melpa. The extremely short duration of the [ʟ] in intervocalic position (20–30 ms) warrants calling it a tap, according to Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson.
There is no specific symbol for this sound. However, an IPA capital el with a breve for extra-short, [ʟ̆], would capture Ladefoged and Maddieson's description.
