The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is 450-million-word corpus of American English. It is one of the largest currently available corpora, and is the only publicly available corpus of American English to contain a wide array of texts from a number of genres.
It was created by Mark Davies, Professor of Corpus Linguistics at Brigham Young University.
