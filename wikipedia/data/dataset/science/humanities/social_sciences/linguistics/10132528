Intimacy is the degree to which a person can share feelings with another in a relationship. Intimacy is occasionally linked with sex but it can also occur in a nonsexual or unromantic relationship. The dialectics of connection-autonomy and openness-closedness manipulate the communication of intimacy between partners.
