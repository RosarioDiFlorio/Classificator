Ilunga is a relatively common personal name in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In June 2004, "ilunga" was reported as being a Bantu word meaning "a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time, to tolerate it a second time, but never a third time", and - in the opinion of 1,000 linguists surveyed on the subject â€“ the world's most difficult word to translate.
