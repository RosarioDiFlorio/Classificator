The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (; MOHT-sart; German: [ˈvɔlfɡaŋ amaˈdeːʊs ˈmoːtsaʁt] ( listen)) went by many different names in his lifetime. This resulted partly from the church traditions of the day, and partly from the fact that Mozart was multilingual and freely adapted his name to other languages.
