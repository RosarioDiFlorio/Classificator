The Kurdish varieties mostly are written in either of two alphabets: a Latin alphabet introduced by Jeladet Ali Bedirkhan in 1932 (Bedirxan alphabet, or Hawar after the Hawar magazine), and an Perso-Arabic-based Sorani alphabet, named for the historical Soran Emirate of the present-day Iraqi Kurdistan.
While the Latin script is dominating Kurdish mass media everywhere; the Sorani script is just confined in Iraq and Iran. Two additional alphabets, based on the Armenian and Cyrillic scripts, were once used in Soviet Armenia.
