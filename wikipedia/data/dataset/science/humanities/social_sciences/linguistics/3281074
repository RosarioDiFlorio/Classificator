The voiceless retroflex sibilant affricate is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is ⟨ʈ͡ʂ⟩, sometimes simplified to ⟨tʂ⟩, and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is ⟨ts`⟩.
The affricate occurs in a number of languages:
Asturian: Speakers of the western dialects of this language use it instead of the voiced palatal fricative, writing ḷḷ instead of ll.
Slavic languages: Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Old Czech, Serbian; some speakers of Russian may use it instead of the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate.
a number of Northwest Caucasian languages have retroflex affricates that contrast in secondary articulations like labialization.
Mandarin and other Sinitic languages.
