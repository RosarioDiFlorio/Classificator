There are several crucial differences between Lojban and Loglan, two constructed languages. The main one is of the sounding of the core words, which, however, have similar phonotactics in both languages. Most grammatical particles also sound differently. Lojban alphabet lacks the letters q, w, h, but has the letter x and ' (apostrophe) (the last two absent in Loglan).
