In linguistics, the comparative is a syntactic construction that serves to express a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality,or degree. See comparison (grammar) for an overview of comparison, as well as positive and superlative degrees of comparison.
Ex: " This sofa is more comfortable than that one. " "James is smaller than Chris." The syntax of comparative constructions is poorly understood due to the complexity of the data. In particular, the comparative frequently occurs with independent mechanisms of syntax such as coordination and forms of ellipsis (gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, verb phrase ellipsis). The interaction of the various mechanisms complicates the analysis.
