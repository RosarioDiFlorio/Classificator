In linguistics, an echo answer or echo response is a way of answering a polar question without using words for yes and no. The verb used in the question is simply echoed in the answer, negated if the answer has a negative truth-value. For example:
"Did you go to the cinema?" (or "Didn't you go to the cinema?")
"I did not." or "I didn't go."
