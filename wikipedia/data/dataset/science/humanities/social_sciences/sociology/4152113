The "theory of the productive forces" should not be confused with the Marxist analysis of productive forces.
The theory of the productive forces (sometimes referred to as productive force determinism) is a widely disseminated variation of historical materialism and Marxism that places primary emphasis on technical advances as the basis for advances and changes in the social structure and culture of a given civilization. The relative strength assigned to the role of technical (or technological) progress in impacting society and social advancement differs among different schools of Marxist thinkers. A related concept is technological determinism.
On a prescriptive level, this view places a strong emphasis on the necessity of strengthening the productive forces of the economy as a precondition for the realization of socialism, and within a nominally socialist economy, essential to achieving communism. This theory was held by many Orthodox Marxists as well as Marxistâ€“Leninists; as a result, it played a crucial role in informing the economic policies of current and former socialist states.
