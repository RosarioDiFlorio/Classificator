Environmental risk transition is the process by which traditional communities with associated environmental health issues become more economically developed and experience new health issues. In traditional or economically undeveloped regions, humans often suffer and die from infectious diseases or of malnutrition. As economic development occurs, these environmental issues are reduced or solved, and people begin to suffer more often from diseases of excess or sedentism. When speaking specifically about associated change in diets, this process is often referred to as nutrition transition.
