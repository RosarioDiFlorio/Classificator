Feminist Hulk (@feministhulk) is a parody Twitter account written from the perspective of a feminist incarnation of the Hulk, a Marvel Comics superhero with boundless rage and strength but a limited vocabulary. Feminist Hulk incorporates feminist theory into tweets, notably threatening to smash the patriarchy and gender binary. Blogger Christopher Shea observed that part of the humor "comes from hearing feminist theory spouted by such a hypermasculine figure."
