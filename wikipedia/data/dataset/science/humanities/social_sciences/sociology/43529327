Postnormal times or "PNT", a concept developed by Ziauddin Sardar, is a description of the turbulent and changing times we are living in. Sardar defines PNT as "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense." This period is characterized by three Câ€™s: chaos, complexity and contradictions, which come together to produce uncertainty and different varieties of ignorance.
