Feminist Digital Humanities is a more recent development in the field of Digital Humanities as a whole. Feminist Digital Humanities has risen partly due to recent criticism of the propensity of Digital Humanities to further patriarchal or hegemonic discourses in the Academy. Some of the research in feminist digital humanities centres on the exclusion of women from histories of technology and the use of technology to promote feminist scholarship. Feminist Digital Humanities emphasizes the role of women, feminists, and cyberfeminists in technology, overturning ideas such as “Men invented the Internet”, as written in a June 2012 New York Times article.
Scholars Wendy Chun, N. Katherine Hayles, and Claire Potter are feminist digital humanities scholars.
