Technology trajectory refers to a single branch in the evolution of a technological design of a product/service, with nodes representing separate designs.
Movement along the technology trajectory is associated with research and development. Due to institutionalisation of ideas, markets and professions, a technology development can get 'stuck' within one trajectory, and firms and engineers unable to adopt to ideas and innovation from outside.
