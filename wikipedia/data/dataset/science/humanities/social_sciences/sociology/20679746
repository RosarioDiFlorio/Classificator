Rewilding means to return to a more wild or natural state; it is the process of undoing domestication. The term emerged from the green anarchism and anarcho-primitivism political theories, in which humans are believed to be "civilized" or "domesticated" by industrial and agricultural progress. Supporters of rewilding argue that through the process of domestication, human wildness has been altered by force.
Rewilding is about dismantling the culture of human domestication and returning to the lifeways of pre-agrarian human cultures. Though often associated with primitive skills and learning knowledge of wild plants and animals, it emphasizes regenerative land management techniques employed by hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists, as well as development of the senses and fostering deepening personal relationships with members of other species and the natural world. Rewilding intends to create permanently wild human cultures beyond domestication.
Rewilding is considered a holistic approach to living, as opposed to skills, practices or a specific set of knowledge.
