The term "glass escalator" was introduced by Christine L. Williams in her research "The Glass Escalator: Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Profession" published in August of 1992. The glass escalator refers to the way men, namely heterosexual white men, are put on a fast track to higher up positions when entering women dominated sex-segregated professions. It is most present in lower levels of the profession. This idea is a parallel to the popular idea of the glass ceiling, where women face troubles advancing in the workplace.
