A Critique of Soviet Economics (读苏联《政治经济学教科书》的谈话) is a work of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy written by Mao Zedong. It was written between 1958 and 1959 and includes a critique of two Soviet works: Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, a short 1951 work by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and Political Economy: A Textbook, an official publication of Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR published in 1957. First published in 1967, the book is regarded as an early polemic of the Sino-Soviet split which emerged in the late 1950s and the 1960s.
