Daily life requires people to decide constantly how they ought to act, and they are observed to decide in two ways. Sometimes they decide to re-act without reasoning, responding to emotion or habit. And sometimes they decide to act after reasoning in two ways. They reason about means to achieve their ends, and about ends they ought to pursue.
Actions explained by reasoning about means are often called "instrumentally rational". They are supposed to be efficient means or tools for achieving consequences. Actions explained by reasoning about ends are often called "value-rational". They are treated as action rules, legitimate in themselves, such as "Honesty is the best policy" or "Justice requires taking an eye for an eye."
Evidence of the distinction between these two kinds of rational action is everywhere. Consider actions expected in various professions. Engineers, physicians, teachers and coaches are expected to reason constantly about efficient means, but not about the legitimacy of their professional ends. Police, clergy, lawyers, and accountants are expected always to obey existing rules, but not to reason about the efficiency of those rules.
To clarify meanings of and problems with these two kinds of rational action, this article reports how Max Weber, the German sociologist who coined these labels, and three later scholars—Talcott Parsons, Jurgen Habermas, and John Dewey—explained and used them.
