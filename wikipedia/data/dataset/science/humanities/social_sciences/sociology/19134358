Libertarian perspectives on revolution include the disparate views held by various libertarians on the desirability of creating fundamental change in power or organizational structures in a relatively short time. Some varieties of libertarianism have revolutionary goals that often include dissolution of current states, creation of new states on the ocean (seasteading), secession and even the abolition of states.
