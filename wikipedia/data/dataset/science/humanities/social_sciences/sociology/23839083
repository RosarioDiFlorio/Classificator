Super-imperialism is a Marxist term with two possible meanings. It refers either to the hegemony of an imperialist great power over its weaker rivals, who then are called sub-imperialisms, or to a comprehensive supra-structure above a set of (theoretically) equal-righted imperialist states. The latter meaning is the older one and had become rare by the middle of the 20th century.
