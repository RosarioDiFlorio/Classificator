The British Sociological Association (BSA) is a scholarly and professional society for sociologists in the United Kingdom, and was founded in 1951. It publishes the academic journals Sociology, Work, Employment and Society and Cultural Sociology (with SAGE Publications) as well as its membership newsletter Network and a monthly eNewsletter. Formerly, the British Journal of Sociology was the BSA's official journal, but it was replaced by Sociology some years after the latter had been established.
It is a registered charitable company (charity no: 1080235) which states its mission is to "represent the intellectual and sociological interests of our members."
