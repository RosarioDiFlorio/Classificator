Orthodox Marxism is the body of Marxist thought that emerged after the death of Karl Marx (1818–83), and which became the official philosophy of the socialist movement, as represented in the Second International until the First World War, in 1914. Orthodox Marxism aims to simplify, codify and systematize Marxist method and theory, by clarifying the perceived ambiguities and contradictions of Classical Marxism.
The philosophy of orthodox Marxism includes the understanding that material development (advances in technology in the productive forces) is the primary agent of change in the structure of society and of human social relations, and that social systems and their relations (e.g. feudalism, capitalism, etc.) become contradictory and inefficient as the productive forces develop, which results in some form of social revolution arising in response to the mounting contradictions. This revolutionary change is the vehicle for fundamental society-wide changes, and ultimately leads to the emergence of new economic systems.
In the term Orthodox Marxism, the word orthodox refers to the methods of historical materialism and of dialectical materialism, and not the normative aspects inherent to Classical Marxism, without implying dogmatic adherence to the results of Marx’s investigations.
