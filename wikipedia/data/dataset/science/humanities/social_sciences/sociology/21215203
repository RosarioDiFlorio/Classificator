Causation is a belief that events occur in predictable ways and that one event leads to another. If the relationship between the variables is non-spurious (there is a third variable that is not causing the effect), the temporal order is in line (cause before effect), and the study is longitudinal, it may be deduced that it is a causal relationship.
