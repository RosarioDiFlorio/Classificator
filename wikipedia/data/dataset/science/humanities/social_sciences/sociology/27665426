The term charisma (; pl. charismata, adj. charismatic) has two senses:
compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others
a divinely conferred power or talent
In discussing sense 1, scholars in sociology, political science, psychology, and management reserve the term for a type of leadership seen as extraordinary;   in these fields, the term "charisma" is used to describe a particular type of leader who uses "values-based, symbolic, and emotion-laden leader signaling".
In some theological usages, the term appears as charism, with a meaning the same as sense 2.
Since the 1950s, the term has become widely used, with varying meanings, in religion, the social sciences, the media, and throughout Western societies.
