Repudiation is the formal or informal act by which a husband renounces his wife in certain cultures and religions. For example:
In Islam, a talaq divorce allows a man to divorce his wife by saying "I divorce you" (in Arabic, talaq), otherwise known as the formula of repudiation.
In Babylonian law a husband could repudiate his wife, at the cost of returning the dowry.
