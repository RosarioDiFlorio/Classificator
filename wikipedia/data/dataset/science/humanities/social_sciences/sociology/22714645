A Familienbuch (German: [faˈmiːli̯ənˌbuːx], "Family-book") was a family register, a genealogical summary that was issued in Germany by the local civil registry upon marriage and contained data on birth, marriage and death of the couple as well as the birth data of any children stemming for this marriage.
Since January 1, 2009, Familienbücher have no longer been issued.
