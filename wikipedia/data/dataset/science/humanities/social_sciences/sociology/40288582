A wedlease is a proposed type of marital contract in which two spouses agree to a marriage of limited duration for a set period of time with renewal options.
The concept and term were introduced by a 2013 opinion piece in The Washington Post. It has since been discussed in numerous other publications. In 2011, lawmakers of Mexico City proposed introducing marriage contracts that lasted two years in order to assess compatibility and cut divorce rates.
