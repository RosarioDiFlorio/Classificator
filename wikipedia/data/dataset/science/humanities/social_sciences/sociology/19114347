Honor culture involves a collectivist society where there are expectations and pressure to put the interests of the family, relatives or an even larger collective before that of the individual. Individuals may be forced to relinquish their basic human rights. Those who do not conform may be forced, persecuted or pressured into conformance. Transgressors are punished physically or psychologically by relatives.
In an honor culture offspring are not free to choose a partner for themselves but may instead be expected to enter into an arranged marriage or if the offspring resists, into a forced marriage or child marriage.
The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together. Males and females In an honor culture may act as either persecutors and the oppressed, for instance a son in a family may be forced to enter into an arranged marriage by his older relatives while controlling his sisters.
