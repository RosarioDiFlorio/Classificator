A drop-in center is a service agency for homeless people, teenagers, and other communities that offers a place where people can go to obtain food and other services. As opposed to a homeless shelter, a drop-in center usually does not provide a temporary residence; rather, it aims to provide other services to endangered or disadvantaged groups in the community, including the homeless, people with addictions, or teenagers. Drop-in centers are usually open during the daytime. Some drop-in centers double as warming centers or cooling centers in the winter or summer, and may provide overnight shelter during these months.
Many drop-in centers provide free services, and some offer services for a nominal fee.
