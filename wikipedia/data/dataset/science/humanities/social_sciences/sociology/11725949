In sociology, feminization is the shift in gender roles and sex roles in a society, group, or organization towards a focus upon the feminine. This is the opposite of a cultural focus upon masculinity.
Scholar Ann Douglas chronicled the rise of what she describes as sentimental "feminization" of American mass culture in the 19th century, in which writers of both sexes underscored popular convictions about women's weaknesses, desires, and proper place in the world.
It can also mean the incorporation of women into a group or a profession that was once dominated by men.
Potential examples of feminization in society can include:
Feminization of education â€“ Majority female teachers, a female majority of students in higher education and a curriculum which is better suited to the learning process of women.
Feminisation of the workplace
Feminization of migration
