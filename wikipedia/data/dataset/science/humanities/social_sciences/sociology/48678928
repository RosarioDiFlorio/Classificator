Technology readiness refers to people’s propensity to embrace and use new technologies for accomplishing goals in home life and at work. The construct can be viewed as an overall state of mind resulting from a gestalt of mental enablers and inhibitors that collectively determine a person’s predisposition to use new technologies.
The Technology Readiness Index can be viewed as a variation on the Technology acceptance model (TAM). It is a multidimensional psychographic construct, offering a way to segment online customers based upon their underlying positive and negative technology beliefs.
Technology readiness has four underlying dimensions:
optimism, a positive view of technology and a belief that it offers people increased control, flexibility, and efficiency
innovativeness, the tendency to be a technology pioneer and thought leader
discomfort, perceived lack of control over technology and a feeling of being overwhelmed by it
insecurity, distrust of technology and skepticism about its ability to work properly.
While optimism and innovativeness are contributors to technology readiness, discomfort and insecurity are inhibitors.
