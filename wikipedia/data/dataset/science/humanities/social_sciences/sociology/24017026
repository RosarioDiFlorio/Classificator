Inchiesta (Italian for inquiry) is a genre of social research. It is usually focused on a specific topic of analysis or case study. Another typical aspect of inchiestas is their independent nature. In Italy, since the 1960s a tradition of social inchiesta with strong political consciousness and a commitment to changing social reality has developed.
