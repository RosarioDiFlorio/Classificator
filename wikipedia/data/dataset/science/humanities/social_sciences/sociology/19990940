Social currency refers to the actual and potential resources from presence in social networks and communities, including both digital and offline. The concept derives from Pierre Bourdieu's social capital theory and relates to increasing one's sense of community, granting access to information and knowledge, helping to form one's identity, and providing status and recognition.
