With the Strength of the People (Portuguese: Coligação Com a Força do Povo), until 2014 named For Brazil to Keep on Changing (Portuguese: Para o Brasil Seguir Mudando, standard/colloquialPortuguese pronunciation: [ˈpaɾɐ u bɾɐˈziw seˈɡiʁ muˈdɐ̃du] ~ [ˈpaɾʊ bɾaˈziw siˈɡiɦ muˈdɐ̃ⁿ(d)u]), was a centre-left electoral coalition formed around the democratic socialist Workers' Party (PT) in Brazil for the 2010 presidential election. It comprised ten parties: the Worker's Party (PT), Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB), Democratic Labour Party (PDT), Brazilian Republican Party (PRB), Party of the Republic (PR), Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Social Christian Party (PSC), Christian Labour Party (PTC) and National Labor Party (PTN). On October 14, they were unofficially joined by the Progressive Party (PP). The coalition's presidential candidate was Dilma Rousseff from PT and the vice-presidential candidate was Michel Temer from PMDB. They were finally elected on October 31, 2010.
For the 2014 election, the coalition changed its name to With the Strength of the People and was joined by the newly created Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Republican Party of the Social Order (PROS); PSB departed from the Dilma administration in order to launch the candidacy of Eduardo Campos, while PSC launched the candidacy of Pastor Everaldo. PTC and PTN both decided to support Aécio Neves, from the rival centrist Change Brazil coalition.
