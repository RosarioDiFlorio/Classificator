The Second Great Rectification Movement refers to a 1992 ideological campaign initiated by the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) wherein an effort was made to "identify, repudiate and rectify the errors of urban insurrectionism, premature big formations of the New People's Army and anti-infiltration hysteria". The rectification movement resulted in the once monolithic Filipino communist party fragmenting into at least eight warring factions during the 1990s.
Luis Jalandoni, formerly a negotiator for the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, has stated that from 1985 until 1991, a renegade group within the party leadership of the CPP was responsible for major errors that caused serious losses in the revolution's mass base. These errors included the implementation of a program to root out infiltrators called Kampanyang Ahos ("Kahos") and the adoption of an erroneous political line brought about by modern revisionism. The loss in mass base was estimated to be 50%-60% in Mindanao alone. The "Second Great Rectification Movement" was meant to correct these errors.
