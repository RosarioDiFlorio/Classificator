Libertarian possibilism (sp: posibilismo libertario) was a political current within the early 20th century Spanish anarchist movement which advocated achieving the anarchist ends of ending the state and capitalism with participation inside structures of contemporary parliamentary democracy. The name of this political position appeared for the first time between 1922-1923 within the discourse of catalan anarcho-syndicalist Salvador Segui when he said "We have to intervene in politics in order to take over the positions of the bourgoise".
