Eliticide or elitocide refers to "the killing of the leadership, the educated, and the clergy of a group." It is usually carried out during the beginning of a genocide and done to cripple a possible resistance against perpetrators. Examples include the Armenian genocide, Cambodian genocide, German-Soviet occupation of Poland, and instances in the Yugoslav Wars. The term was first used in 1992 by British reporter Michael Nicholson to describe the Bijeljina massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Bosnian War local Serbs would point out prominent Bosniaks to be killed afterwards by Serb soldiers.
