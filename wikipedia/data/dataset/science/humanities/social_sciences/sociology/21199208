In sociology, biological determination is the principle that behavioral differences are the result of inherited physical characteristics.

The natural-masculinity thesis requires strong biological determination of group differences in complex social behaviors (such a creating families and armies). There is no evidence at all of strong determination in this sense. There is little evidence even of weak biological determination of group differences in simple individual behaviours. And the evidence of cross-cultural and historical diversity in gender is overwhelming.
