In sociology, a dyad (from Greek δύο dýo, "two" or Sanskrit दयाद "Dayadaha") is a group of two people, the smallest possible social group. As an adjective, "dyadic" describes their interaction.
The pair of individuals in a dyad can be linked via romantic interest, family relation, interests, work, partners in crime, and so on. The relation can be based on equality, but may be based on an asymmetrical or hierarchical relationship (master–servant).
The strength of the relationship is evaluated on the basis of time the individuals spend together, as well as on the emotional intensity of their relationship.
A dyad can be unstable because both persons must cooperate to make it work. If one of the two fails to complete their duties, the group would fall apart. Because of the significance of marriages in society, their stability is very important. For this reason marital dyads are often enforced through legal, economic, and religious laws.
Dyadic friendships refer to the most immediate and concrete level of peer interaction, which is expanded to include new forms of relationships in adolescence – most notably, romantic and sexual relationships. Already Ferdinand Tönnies treated it as a special pattern of gemeinschaft, 1887, as community of spirit.
