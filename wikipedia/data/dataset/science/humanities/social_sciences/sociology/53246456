Go Grrrls is a gender-specific intervention curriculum for early adolescent girls that tries to promote a positive transition to adulthood. It is a social skills building and psychoeducational program administered in a group settingâ€”targeted towards girls in their early teens. When compared to a control group using a self-reported evaluation, the program has shown a positive effect on girls' self-efficacy, body image and assertiveness. A pilot program was launched in 1995 and a final version was published in 1999. It is administered by a team of two or more co-facilitators. The program was designed by Craig LeCroy and Janice Daley. LeCroy also published an experimental evaluation of the program.
