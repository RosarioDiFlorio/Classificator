Mobile privatization can be described as an individual's attachment to a mobile device which leads to a feeling of being "at home," while connected to this device in a mobile setting. An individual can travel anywhere while still feeling comfortable because of the connectivity of their mobile device. The connection creates a sense of familiarity which results in the individual's identity becoming attached to their mobile service provider. This concept leads to the idea that "home" need not be a domestic structure featuring walls and a roof, but that the mobile sense of connection provides a portable community similar to a home environment.
