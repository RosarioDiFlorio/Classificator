Bolivarianism is a mix of pan-American, socialist, and national-patriotic ideals fixed against perceived injustices of imperialism, inequality, and corruption. It is named after Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century Venezuelan general and liberator from the Spanish monarchy then in abeyance, who led the struggle for independence throughout much of South America.
