The Red Shirts are a political movement in Thailand, formed following the 2006 coup d'Ã©tat against then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Originally synonymous with the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), a group formed to protest the coup and military government, the movement has since expanded to included various groups with diverse political priorities. Its members range from Left-wing and/or liberal activists and academics to the large number of Thaksin's rural and working-class supporters.
