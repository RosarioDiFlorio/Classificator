Trudeauism refers to the liberal political ideology associated with former Liberal Party of Canada leader and Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Trudeauism involves social liberal, economic nationalist and Canadian nationalist policies. Trudeauism supports social justice, advocating a just society.
It is concerned with historical dienfranchisement for cultural and linguistic minorities in Canada, such as Francophones and advocates bilingualism and multiculturalism in Canada though it opposes distinct society status for Quebec as advocated by some Canadian federalists. Trudeau's policy on First Nations affairs included the White Paper that controversially advocated the end of economic and political autonomy of First Nations within Canada that had been granted for centuries, this policy failed and was later removed from the Trudeau government's agenda.
