EA WorldView is a blog specializing in coverage and analysis of Iran, Syria, the Middle East, and Russia.
The blog was started in 2008 by Scott Lucas, a professor of American Studies at the University of Birmingham, who maintains the blog. It was originally known as Enduring America, where its archives can still be read.
During the 2009-10 Iranian election protests it live blogged the demonstrations. EA later live blogged the civil uprising phase of the Syrian civil war. With the end of the Iranian protests and as the situation in Syria moved to a complex "dynamic stalemate", EA has since moved to providing a daily updated blog monitoring mainstream and social media coverage of the region, though provided a live blog of the 2013 Iranian Presidential election.
The blog has been referenced by Reuters, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Daily Mail, The Times of Israel and The Daily Telegraph, with journalist Richard Spencer of The Daily Telegraph describing the blog as "a blog of admittedly variable quality".
