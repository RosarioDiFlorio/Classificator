In politics, the "revolving door" is a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators in the industries affected by the legislation and regulation.
In some cases, the roles are performed in sequence but in certain circumstances may be performed at the same time. Political analysts claim that an unhealthy relationship can develop between the private sector and government, based on the granting of reciprocated privileges to the detriment of the nation and can lead to regulatory capture.
