This is a timeline of Philippine elections, in which the parties of the President, Vice President, Senate President and House Speaker at the time of the elections are displayed.
Note that in-house "coups" are common in the bicameral legislature in which several members jump ship to another party which would alter the balance between the parties and can lead to new house leaders, or they simply refuse the follow their party lines. Also, with the advent of the multi-party system in 1986, not one party was able to form a majority hence they instead formed coalitions from other parties.
