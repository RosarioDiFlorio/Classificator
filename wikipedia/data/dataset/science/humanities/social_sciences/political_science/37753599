"Strong" was a political advertisement issued by then-Texas Governor and current Secretary of Energy Rick Perry's presidential campaign in December 2011 for the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries.
The ad was targeted to American Christian, socially conservative voters. It raised controversy for addressing gays in the military and religion in public schools, largely due to Perry's disapproval of the former. The video went viral, inspiring a number of parodies. During the primaries, it became one of the most disliked videos on YouTube.
