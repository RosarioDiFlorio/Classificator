The Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which established the devolved Scottish Parliament with tax varying powers and the Scottish Government (then Scottish Executive). It was the most significant constitutional piece of UK legislation to be passed since the European Communities Act 1972 and is the most significant piece of legislation to affect Scotland since the Acts of Union in 1707 which ratifed the Treaty of Union and led to the disbandment of the Parliament of Scotland.
