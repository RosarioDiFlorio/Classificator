For the Ffestiniog Railway's use of the word "deviationist", see Ffestiniog Railway#The Llyn Ystradau Deviation.
In political ideology, a deviationist is a person who expresses a deviation: an abnormality or departure. In Stalinist ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led to purges. Forms of deviationism included revisionism, dogmatism, bourgeois nationalism, and rootless cosmopolitanism.
Mao Zedong in a 1953 speech referred to both "left" and "right" deviationists. Years later, in 1976, the so-called Gang of Four would strike out against "rightist deviationism" in China.
