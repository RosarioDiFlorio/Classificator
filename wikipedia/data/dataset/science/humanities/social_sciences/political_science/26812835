The Anarchist Encyclopedia was an encyclopedia initiated by Sebastien Faure, between 1925 and 1934, published in 4 volumes.
The original project was to be in five parts:
an anarchist dictionary
a history of anarchist thought and action
biographies of militants and thinkers
biographies of individuals having contributed by their works to human emancipation
a catalogue of anarchist books and reviews
Only the first part in four volumes of 2893 pages was made. It included many anarchist tendencies. There were several hundred collaborators including, in addition to Sebastien Faure himself, Luigi Bertoni, Pierre Besnard, Emile Armand, Han Ryner, Augustin Souchy, Max Nettlau, Voline, Aristide Lapeyre, GÃ©rard de Lacaze-Duthiers, etc.
