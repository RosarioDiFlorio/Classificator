The Kanslergade Agreement (IPA: [ˈkanˀslɐˌɡæːðə]; Danish: Kanslergadeforliget), named after Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning's Copenhagen street where it was reached, set in motion the reforms that would establish the Scandinavian welfare model for state welfare services in Denmark. Ratified on January 30, 1933, it expanded labor rights, devalued the Krone and extended state subsidies to farmers. Charges for social services were also fixed to affordable levels. As part of the agreement, the Liberal party withdrew its objections to the social welfare model advocated by the social democratic government.
The agreement was, at the time, the most extensive agreement yet in Danish politics, with the possible exception of the 1894 Budget agreement.
