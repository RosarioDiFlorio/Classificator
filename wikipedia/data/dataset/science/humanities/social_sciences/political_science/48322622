Nwannekaenyi "Nnamdi" Kenny Okwu Kanu (born September 1967) is a British-Nigerian political activist. He is a leading member of one of several Biafran separatist organisations, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and the director of a London-based radio station Radio Biafra. Kanu was arrested on treason charges in Lagos on 14 October 2015 and was detained in a Nigerian jail without trial for more than a year-and-a-half, despite various court orders that ruled for his release. When in court, Kanu appeared regularly wearing a Jewish prayer shawl and head covering. He said in court that he "believes in Judaism" and considers himself a Jew. On 28 April 2017 Kanu was released from prison on bail.
