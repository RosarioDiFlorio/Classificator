Fieldwork Under Fire: Contemporary Studies of Violence and Survival is a book length collection of recorded experiences; each of which was contributed by an anthropologist who had to strategize and innovate, while directly living through the emotion, stress, and abnormal ordeal of political violence in the field, to gather ethnographic data and descriptions for their individual studies. The "Introduction" is written by the editors, Carolyn Nordstrom and Antonius C. G. M. Robben. This book was first published by the University of California Press in 1997.
