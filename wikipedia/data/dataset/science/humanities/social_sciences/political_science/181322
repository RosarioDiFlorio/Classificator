The culture war or culture conflict refers to the conflict between traditionalist or conservative values and social democracy, progressive or social liberal values in the Western world, as well as other countries. Beginning in the 1990s, culture wars have influenced the debate over public school history and science curricula in the United States, along with many other issues.
The expression culture war entered the vocabulary of United States politics with the publication of Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America by James Davison Hunter in 1991. Hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed United States politics and culture, including the issues of abortion, federal and state gun laws, global warming, immigration, separation of church and state, privacy, recreational drug use, LGBT, and censorship.
In Canada, culture war refers to differing values between Western versus Eastern Canada, urban versus rural Canada, as well as conservatism versus liberalism. A divide between French and English is also a consistent part of Canadian society.
