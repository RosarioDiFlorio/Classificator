The Japanese Anarchist Federation (JAF; Japanese: 日本アナキスト連盟) was an anarchist union that existed in Japan from May 1946 to 1968.
The JAF was plagued by disputes between anarcho-communists and anarcho-syndicalists and in October 1950 it split into two groups, the Japan Anarchist Club and the Anarchist Federation, the latter of which reclaimed the name Japanese Anarchist Federation in 1955. Starting in 1956, this new syndicalist JAF produced and distributed a publication titled Kuro Hata (Black Flag) which was later renamed Free Association.
The Japanese Anarchist Federation dissolved in 1968. A new Anarchist Federation formed in October 1988.
