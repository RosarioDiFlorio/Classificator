Elections for the Glasgow City District Council took place on 3 May 1977, alongside elections to the councils of Scotland's various other districts. These was the second election to the Glasgow City District Council, and saw Labour losing their control of the council, losing nearly half of their councillors. Among the losing councillors was Dick Dynes, the Labour group leader. Dynes was replaced as leader by Jean McFadden.
