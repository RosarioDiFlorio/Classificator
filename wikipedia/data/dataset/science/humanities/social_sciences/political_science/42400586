The Bratislava Declaration was the result of the conference held on 3 August 1968 for the representatives of the Communist parties and Worker's parties of Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia. The declaration was a response to the Prague Spring. It affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism–Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and declared an implacable struggle against "bourgeois" ideology and all "anti-socialist" forces. The Soviet Union also expressed its intention to intervene in any Warsaw Pact country if a "bourgeois" system – a pluralist system of several political parties – was ever established.
The Bratislava Declaration and Roadmap is also the outcome of an informal meeting of the 27 heads of state or government on September 16, 2016, chaired by Donald Tusk.
