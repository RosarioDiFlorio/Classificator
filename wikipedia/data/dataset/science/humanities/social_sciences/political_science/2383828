Protocol can mean any logbook or other artifact (forged or authentic) of a political meeting between persons from different nations. The most notorious example of a forged logbook is "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion".
In international law, a treaty that supplements or adds to a pre-existing treaty is often given a name that includes "Protocol" in its title. For example, the Kyoto Protocol was supplemental to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Protocol I, Protocol II, and Protocol III supplement the 1949 Geneva Conventions; and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is supplemented by an Optional Protocol.
