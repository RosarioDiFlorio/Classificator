The Bannu Resolution (Pashto: د بنو قرارداد‎) or Bannu Declaration was a formal political statement adopted by the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, Faqir of Ipi, and other tribal chiefs at a loya jirga held at Bannu on June 21, 1947, just seven weeks before the Partition of India. The resolution demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.
