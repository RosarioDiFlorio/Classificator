The Souper Bowl of Caring utilizes Super Bowl weekend in America to mobilize young people to fight hunger and poverty in their local communities. Its vision is to transform Super Bowl weekend (the weekend of the first Sunday in February) into America's largest youth-led weekend of giving and serving. Young people collect monetary and food donations during the week leading up to Super Bowl Sunday. 100% of the money and food is then given directly to local charities of the group's choice.
Started at Spring Valley Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, the Souper Bowl of Caring has branched out to include schools, businesses and congregations of all faiths. Together, they have raised more than $50 million in monetary and food donations. In 2008 alone, more than 14,000 groups collected over $10 million.
The Souper Bowl of Caring has gained national attention, securing partnerships with nine different NFL Teams, in addition to finding National Advocates in former President and Mrs George H.W. Bush and former President and Mrs Jimmy Carter.
