Maoism (Third Worldism) (often stylized as Maoism–Third Worldism or simply MTW), not to be confused with Third Worldism generally, is a broad tendency which is mainly concerned with the infusion and synthesis of Marxism—particularly of the Marxist–Leninist–Maoist persuasion—with concepts of non-Marxist Third Worldism, namely dependency theory and world-systems theory.
There is no general consensus on part of Maoist-Third Worldists as a whole. However, the majority of proponents typically argue for the centrality of anti-imperialism to the victory of global communist revolution, as well as against the idea that the working class in the "First World" is majority-exploited (sometimes arguing that it experiences no exploitation at all), and therefore, it is not a part of the international proletariat.
