NGP VAN is a privately owned American company specializing in helping progressive campaigns and organizations leverage technology to meet their goals. In 2009, the company was the largest partisan provider of campaign compliance software, used by most Democratic members of Congress. The company's services have been utilized by clients such as the Obama 2008 presidential campaign, the Obama 2012 presidential campaign, the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, the British Liberal Democrats, and the Liberal Party of Canada. Its current president and CEO, Stuart Trevelyan, was a veteran of the 1992 Clinton-Gore War Room, providing research, analysis, and whip counts to the Clinton Administration as a member of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.
The Wall Street Journal wrote in 2014 “NGP VAN is something of a secret weapon for the Democratic Party and the labor unions and progressive groups that use it.” In 2017, WIRED Magazine referred to NGP VAN's software as "the central nervous system of every Democratic campaign."
