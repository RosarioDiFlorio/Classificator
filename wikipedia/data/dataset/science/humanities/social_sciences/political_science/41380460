The Australian Young Greens is a federation of Young Greens groups from each Australian state and territory. Together they form the Youth Wing of the Australian Greens. Like the Australian Greens, the Australian Young Greens are underpinned by the four pillars of ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence.
