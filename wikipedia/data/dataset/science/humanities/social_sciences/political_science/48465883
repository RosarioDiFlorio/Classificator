A comeback, in terms of publicity, is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.
A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.
