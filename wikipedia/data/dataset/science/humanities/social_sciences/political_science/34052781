Equal Time is an American political talk show that was broadcast on CNBC from 1995 to 1999. One of the main hooks of the show was its aim to include more female voices in the typically male-dominated world of Beltway politics. Throughout the show's run, both co-hosts were female, starting in 1995 with Republican strategist Mary Matalin as the conservative co-presenter and journalist Jane Wallace as her liberal counterpart. Wallace left the show in 1995 and was replaced by the former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. Matalin in turn left in 1996 and was replaced by Bay Buchanan. In 1997, Myers was replaced by the comedian Stephanie Miller. (A rotation of liberal co-hosts faced off with Buchanan between the time that Myers left the show and Miller was officially hired as her replacement some months later.)
During its four-year run, the show eventually morphed from a softball interview format into a more hard-hitting political forum, not unlike Crossfire.
