Stone Hotel: Poems From Prison by Raegan Butcher is a collection of poetry by Raegan Butcher published by the CrimethInc. Ex-Workers Collective. The poems record the author's seven years in prison and are influenced by Charles Bukowski and Edward Bunker. Clamor identified Stone Hotel as among CrimethInc.'s best work, calling it a "great start" for Butcher and "commendable in many ways". Published as the first of the CrimethInc Letters series in 2003, the initial print run of Stone Hotel sold out, and the book is now out of print.
