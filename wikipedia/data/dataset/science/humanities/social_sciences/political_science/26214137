The Development Loan Fund (DLF) was the lending arm of the United States International Cooperation Administration. It was established in 1957 as part of a revision of the Mutual Security Act. Its main purpose was extending loans to foreign nations, mostly for capital projects, repayable in the local currency of the borrower. In 1961, it merged into the United States Agency for International Development.
At its creation, its legislative mandate ordered that it not "compete" with "private investment capital", the Export-Import Bank or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
