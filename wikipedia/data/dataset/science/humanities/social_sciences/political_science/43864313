The 1990 London summit was the 10th NATO summit since 1949, and the 4th in 6 years. It was held in London on 5â€“6 July 1990. The principal outcome of the summit was the London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance.
The declaration, shaped in the midst of a changing Europe, called for substantial changes in the organization to ensure it could adapt to a rapidly evolving political landscape. Additionally, the declaration called for reductions in short-range nuclear capabilities, and re-focusing its long-term strategic plans with associated changes to the structure and quantity of its military.
Notably, the declaration also reinforced a message given days earlier stating that NATO no longer saw the Warsaw Pact countries as enemies, and opening up channels for communication and aid with the former eastern bloc states. NATO extended a "hand of friendship" to eastern European nations.
One year later, on 20 December 1991, NATO and former members of the Warsaw Pact formed the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), now called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.
