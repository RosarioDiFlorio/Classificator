The Revolutionary Coordinating Junta or JCR (Junta Coordinadora Revolucionaria) was an alliance of leftist South American guerrilla organizations in the mid-1970s. The JCR was composed of the Chilean Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), the Argentine People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), the Uruguayan Tupamaros, and the Bolivian National Liberation Army (ELN).
The alliance was targeted by Pinochet's Operation Condor in 1975.
