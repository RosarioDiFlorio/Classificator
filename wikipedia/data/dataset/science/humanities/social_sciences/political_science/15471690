Miscellaneous left (divers gauche, DVG) in France refers to left-wing candidates who are not members of a large party. They either include small left-wing parties or dissidents expelled from their parties for running against their party's candidate. Numerous divers gauche candidates are elected at a local level, and a smaller number at the national level.
