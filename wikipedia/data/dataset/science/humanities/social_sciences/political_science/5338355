Melayu Islam Beraja (Malay Islamic Monarchy, MIB; Jawi: ملايو اسلام براج) was officially proclaimed as the national philosophy of Brunei (Negara Brunei Darussalam) on the day of its independence on 1 January 1984 by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
MIB is described as "a blend of Malay language, culture, and Malay customs, the teaching of Islamic laws and values and the monarchy system which must be esteemed and practiced by all". Islam is the official and state religion of Brunei; MIB opposes the concept of secularism.
