Dr. Hiew King Cheu (simplified Chinese: 邱庆洲; traditional Chinese: 邱慶州; pinyin: Chiū Chìng Zhōu; born 1 March 1952) is a Malaysian politician. He is currently the Member of the Sabah State Assembly for the constituency of Luyang, sitting in the assembly for Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) - Barisan Nasional after being an independent a while in 2013. From 2008 to 2013 he was the Member of the Parliament of Malaysia for the Kota Kinabalu constituency in Sabah, representing the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP).
Hiew had contested the federal Kota Kinabalu seat in the 2002 by-election and Malaysian general election, 2004 losing on each occasion. He won the seat in the 2008 election. In a four-way election, he narrowly defeated Christina Liew of fellow opposition party PKR and Barisan Nasional's Chin Teck Meng. The election was regarded as an unexpected loss by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition.
Hiew relinquished his federal seat in 2013, instead contesting, and winning, the State Assembly seat of Luyang. In September 2013, he resigned from the DAP to become an independent in the State Assembly due to his defiance of the party in supporting Lajim Ukin over Wilfred Bumburing to be the leader of the opposition in the assembly.
Hiew joined the Malaysian Chinese Association in 2014 after an invitation by the party in June that year.
