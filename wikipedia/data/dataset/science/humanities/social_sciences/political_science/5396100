Left-wing terrorism (sometimes called Marxist–Leninist terrorism or revolutionary/left-wing terrorism) is terrorism meant to overthrow conservative or capitalist systems and replace them with Marxist–Leninist, socialist, or anarchist societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.
