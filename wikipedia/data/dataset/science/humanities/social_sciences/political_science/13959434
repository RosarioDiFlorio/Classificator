Escrache is a type of demonstration to publicly shame those who are above the law or who refuse to represent those who have elected them, usually by congregating around their homes, chanting and publicly shaming them. In Argentina the term was coined in 1995 by the human rights group HIJOS, to condemn the genocides committed by members of the PROCESO who were pardoned by Carlos Menem.
In Chile these actions are known as funa. In Peru they are known as roche and are often signed "El roche".
In Spain in 2013, a number the Platform of Mortgage Victims (PAH) held escraches against members of the parliament who were not willing to sign a popular legislative initiative (ILP) supported by 90% of the population, to allow the repossession of homes to cancel out mortgage debt, a law without which homeless former owners would be forced to continue paying the banks after losing their homes. The PAH's campaign - "There are lives at stake" - referred to the high rates of suicide among those evicted and detailed strict guidelines of how escraches were to be conducted in nonviolent manner, without insults or affecting the children of the deputies.
In 2017, Venezuelans around the world began to use this form of protest as result of the brutal dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. Escraches or Protests have occurred in the USA, Spain, Mexico, Switzerland, Colombia and Panama among others, in response to the Venezuelan crisis.
