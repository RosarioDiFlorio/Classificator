The Raven: Anarchist Quarterly was a quarterly anarchist review founded in 1987 by Heiner Becker and consisting of 43 issues published by Freedom Press from 1987 to 2003. Each edition usually focused on a specific issue such as food, health, economics, genetic engineering, psychology, land and so on, from an anarchist viewpoint. Contributors included Colin Ward and Nicolas Walter.
After a lull in the publishing of the review, in September 2003, Freedom Press announced that it would no longer be publishing The Raven. The Press cited both a review of costs (in a letter to Raven subscribers) and changes in the direction and content of the Freedom newspaper: "Our intention is that changes in this newspaper will allow it to do some of the more reflective work that was previously The Raven's lot."
