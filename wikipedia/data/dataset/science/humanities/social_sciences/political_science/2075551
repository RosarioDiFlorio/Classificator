The term ultra-leftism has two overlapping uses. One usage is a generally pejorative term for certain types of positions on the far-left that are extreme or intransigent. The term is also used—pejoratively or not—to refer to a particular current of Marxist communism, which is closely related to council communism and left communism.
Ultra-left currents within left communism are often subject to criticisms from other factions of the left. The left communist organization International Communist Current refuses to work with leftist groups except for other left communists or anarchists. Gilles Dauvé (also known as Jean Barrthot), a left communist theorist, argues that all bourgeois regimes should be opposed and that revolutionaries should not defend liberal democracy against fascism.
