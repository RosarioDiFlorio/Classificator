American singer Madonna has created a large amount of controversy with The MDNA Tour. It is her ninth concert tour which supports her twelfth studio album, MDNA (2012). The tour has generated many newspaper headlines and news coverage for its use of fake firearms during performances, Madonna's nudity on stage, and her promotion of LGBT rights, freedom of speech and political issues.
Madonna was threatened with a lawsuit in France for using an image of French far-right politician Marine Le Pen with a swastika on her forehead during a video interlude and also in Russia for her promotion of the rights of the LGBT community by giving free pink wristbands to people attending her concert.
