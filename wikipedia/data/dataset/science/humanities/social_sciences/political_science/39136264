This list of genocides by death toll includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by genocide. It does not include non-genocidal mass killing such as the Thirty Years War (7.5 million deaths), Japanese War Crimes (3 to 14 million deaths), the Atrocities in the Congo Free State (3 to 13 million deaths), the 1965â€“1966 Indonesian Politicide (0.5 to 3 million deaths), the Great Purge (0.68 to 1.75 million deaths) or the Great Leap Forward (15 to 55 million deaths).
The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group". Various other definitions can be found in scholarly literature, but they have no legal weight.
