Forced speech refers to any sort of speech which is coerced from an individual by legal or extrajudicial means. This is not the same as free speech (although forced speech may often be applied as an accompaniment to non-forced or free speech), while forced speech is not necessarily the same as censorship (as no free speech has been restricted from being expressed).
