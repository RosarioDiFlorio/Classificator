"Binders full of women" is a phrase used by Mitt Romney on October 16, 2012 during the second U.S. presidential debate of 2012. Romney used the phrase in response to a question about pay equality, referring to binders with resumes of female job applicants submitted to him as Governor of Massachusetts. The awkward phrase was seen by many as demeaning and insensitive toward women in general, causing a backlash and mockery. This prompted the phrase's use for political attacks on Romney's positions on women's issues, as well as the development of an Internet meme.
