The Walter Lippmann Colloquium, in French Colloque Walter Lippmann, was a conference of intellectuals organized in Paris in August 1938 by French philosopher Louis Rougier. After interest in classical liberalism had declined in the 1920s and 1930s, the aim was to construct a new Liberalism as a rejection of collectivism, socialism and laissez-faire liberalism. At the meeting the term neoliberalism was coined by Alexander RÃ¼stow referring to the rejection of the (old) laissez-faire liberalism.
