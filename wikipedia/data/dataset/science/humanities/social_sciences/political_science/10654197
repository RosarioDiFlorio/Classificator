The Rashtra Sevika Samiti (National Women Volunteers Committee) is a Hindu nationalist women's organisation that parallels the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for men. Even though it is often referred to as the "women's wing" of the RSS, the organisation claims that it is independent of the RSS while sharing its ideology. Membership and leadership is restricted to women and its activities are directed to nationalist devotion and mobilisation of Hindu women.
The current Chief (Sanskrit: Pramukh Sanchalika) of the Samiti is V. Shantha Kumari (referred to informally as "Shanthakka") and its General Secretary (Pramukh Karyavahika) is Sita Annadanam.
