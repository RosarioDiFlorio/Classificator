In the field of ageing studies, activist ageing refers to activism and research that empowers the elderly. This approach investigates how ageing is imagined (in mostly Western societies), how ageism operates, and how elders respond to exclusion.

Many elders, and especially women, are involved in organizations that aim to effect social change on issues related to ageing or in general. Retirement engenders a form of social exclusion. In this context becoming an activist or a volunteer represents one's agency and participation in social change, outside the market system. Instead of assuming a passive role, they act. As elder rights activists and members of community organizations, they try to prevent elder abuse, raise awareness, build resources and networks. Activist ageing is different from active ageing.
