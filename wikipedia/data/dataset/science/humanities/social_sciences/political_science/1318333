In Algerian politics, the term Kabylist may be used to refer to Kabyle nationalist parties, such as the MAK, which support self determination for Kabylie, or argue that the Kabyles constitute a people unto themselves and distinct from other Algerians.
Kabylism, or Kabyle nationalism, is a political and cultural movement for the recognition of national aspirations of Kabylia and the empowerment of kabyle-speaking people in Kabylia. Its political corollary is the kabyle sovereign, various trends (autonomy, federalism, independence) with the goal: creating a Kabyle sovereign state with Kabyle as the only official language. Kabylism differs from Berberism by affirming the kabyle specific identity and its primacy over all others, including in all berber-speaking territory. The Kabylism belongs to the family of nationalism called "liberation", along with Catalan or Basque nationalism. Its antithesis is Algerianism , ideology that Algerians as a whole, beyond linguistic and religious differences, would form a historical nation.
