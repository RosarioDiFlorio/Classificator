In lower power systems, Hierarchical Value Cache refers to the hierarchical arrangement of Value Caches (VCs) in such a fashion that lower level VCs observe higher hit-rates, but undergo more switching activity on VC hits. The organization is similar to Memory Hierarchy, where lower-level chaches enjoy higher hit rates, but longer hit latencies. The architecture for Hierarchical Value Cache is mainly organized along two approaches: Hierarchical Unified Value Cache (HUVC) and Hierarchical Combinational Value Cache (HCVC).
