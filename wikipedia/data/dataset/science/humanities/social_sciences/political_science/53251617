Far-Right subculture or Neo-nazi subculture refers to the symbolism, values and traits that hold relevance to various politically extreme right-wing groups and organisations. There is not the 'classic' far-right, or neo-nazi, nowadays. There are a lot of different cultures and lifestyles, which make it harder to identify them and can be seen as part of the far-right strategy. There are three kinds of subcultures within far-right movements to distinguish: subcultural parasitism, subcultural creation around ideology and subcultures that are networking with far-right movements, as the football Hooligans did with the neo-nazis.
