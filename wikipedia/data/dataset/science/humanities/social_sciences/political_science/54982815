Equality Statute between Brazil and Portugal (or Estatuto da Igualdade entre Brasil e Portugal, in Portuguese) is an agreement signed between Brazil and Portugal in Porto Seguro on April 21, 2000, at the time of the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil.
The Statute guarantees that between the two countries the two nationalities have equivalence of rights. That is, a Brazilian can travel to Portugal without a visa (and vice versa), and a Portuguese can offer a public contest (and pursue a political career) in Brazil (and vice versa).
The only exception that exists is the respective economic blocs of each country: A Brazilian does not have freedom of movement within the European Union, while the Portuguese do not have the rights of Brazilians within Mercosur, that is, the agreement is only within the respective countries, it is not an agreement between economic blocs.
