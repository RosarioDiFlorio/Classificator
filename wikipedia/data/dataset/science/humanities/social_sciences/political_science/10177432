The Designated Suppliers Program (DSP) is a procurement standard proposed by the Worker Rights Consortium and United Students Against Sweatshops. The program was designed to promote the use by US universities of suppliers that make use of a defined set of fair labor practices. It was established in response to the widespread use of sweatshop labor in the production of university-branded clothing and other goods. A full description of the DSP, as it currently stands, can be accessed here.
The DSP has been endorsed in principle by a number of universities in the US, and is under active consideration by others.
Attempt to convince the administration at the University of North Carolina resulted in a sit-in by members of the UNC chapter of Student Action with Workers.
