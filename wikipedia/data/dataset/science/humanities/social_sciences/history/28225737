Nanyang Style is a regional art movement expressed solely in the form of visual art. The first attempts to define the Nanyang Style were made by art historians, Redza Piyadasa and T.K. Sabapathy, in 1979, during a retrospective study of Nanyang artistsâ€™ works. This study was done in tribute to the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). The Nanyang style of painting was practised by migrant Chinese painters in Singapore in the 1950.
