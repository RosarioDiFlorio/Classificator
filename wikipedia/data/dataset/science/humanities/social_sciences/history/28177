Simony  is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after Simon Magus, who is described in the Acts of the Apostles 8:9â€“24 as having offered two disciples of Jesus, Peter and John, payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone on whom he would place his hands. The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things." Simony was one of the important issues during the Investiture Controversy.
