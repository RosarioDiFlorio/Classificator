A husbandman in England in the medieval and early modern period was a free tenant farmer or small landowner. The social status of a husbandman was below that of a yeoman. The meaning of "husband" in this term is "master of house" rather than "married man".
It has also been used to mean a practitioner of animal husbandry, or in perhaps more modern language, a rancher.
