The "Azes era" (also known as the Aja/Ajasa era), was named after the Indo-Scythian king, "King Azes the Great" or Azes I. As a number of inscriptions are dated in this era it is of great importance in dating the reigns of several kings and events in early Indian history.
Earlier, some scholars believed that the Azes era was same as the Vikrama Samvat (57 BCE) used in India. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of Vijayamitra, which is dated in two eras. Research by Falk and Bennett (2009) shows that these two were indeed separate eras, and that the Azes era can be dated with a high degree of likelihood to c. 48/47 or 47/46 BCE, depending on whether it began in the spring or the autumn.
