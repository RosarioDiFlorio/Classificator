Edelin (?â€“1293) ruled over the Alsatian abbey of Weissenburg as its abbot from the year 1262 until his death on 15 October 1293. During his time of office, work started on the Gothic abbey church which still stands today. Because the monastery had had the majority of its possessions confiscated since the 10th century, Edelin had an inventory of estates prepared, using older documents, called the Codex Edelini or Liber Possessionum, in order to index the existing estate and prevent further losses (which, as it turned, out was not successful).
