A concert party, also called a Pierrot troupe, is the collective name for a group of entertainers, or Pierrots, popular in Britain during the first half of the 20th century. The variety show given by a Pierrot troupe was called a Pierrot show.
Concert parties were travelling shows of songs and comedy, often put on at the seaside and opening with a Pierrot number.
