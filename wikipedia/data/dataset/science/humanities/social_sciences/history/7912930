The "eternal return" is an idea for interpreting religious behavior proposed by the historian Mircea Eliade; it is a belief expressed through behavior (sometimes implicitly, but often explicitly) that one is able to become contemporary with or return to the "mythical age"â€”the time when the events described in one's myths occurred. It should be distinguished from the philosophical concept of eternal return.
