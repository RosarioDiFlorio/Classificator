The History Aptitude Test (HAT) is a standardized test used as part of the admissions process to Oxford University for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.
The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.
