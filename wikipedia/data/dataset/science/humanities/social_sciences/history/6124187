The Classical Tripos is the taught course in classics at the Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge. It is equivalent to Literae Humaniores at Oxford. It is traditionally a three-year degree, but for those who have not studied Latin and Greek at school a four-year course has been introduced. It is not essential to have a Greek A-Level to study for the three year degree as intensive Greek teaching is available, but most students will have a Latin A-Level.
Classics at Cambridge consists of Language (Greek and Latin), Classical Literature, Ancient History, Classical Art and Archaeology, Classical Philosophy, and Linguistics.
