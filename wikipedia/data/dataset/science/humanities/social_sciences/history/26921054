Grand Mughal or Mogul, also Great Mughal, is a title coined by Europeans for the ruler of the Mughal Empire of India. It is especially associated with the third in the line, Akbar the Great (1542-1605). The Mughals themselves used the title Padishah.
In the same way the Ottoman sultan was known as the "Grand Turk".
