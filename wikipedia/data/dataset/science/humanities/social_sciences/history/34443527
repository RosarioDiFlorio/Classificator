The Cambridge School of historiography was a school of thought which approached the study of the British Empire from the imperialist point of view. It emerged especially at the University of Cambridge in the 1960s. John Andrew Gallagher (1919-80) was especially influential, particularly in his article with Ronald Robinson on "The Imperialism of Free Trade".
Leaders of the School include Anil Seal, Gordon Johnson, Richard Gordon, and David A. Washbrook.
