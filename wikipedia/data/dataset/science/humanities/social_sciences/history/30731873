This article lists the oldest free-standing buildings constructed in the world, including on each of the continents and within each country. "Building" is defined as any human-made structure used or interface for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous occupancy. In order to qualify for list a structure must:
be a recognisable building;
incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in height;
be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.
contains an enclosed area with at least one entry point.
This consciously excludes ruins of limited height and statues. The list also excludes:
dolmens—a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone—unless they were originally covered over to form a barrow and used for collective burials. (Neolithic dolmens are extremely numerous, with over 1,000 reported from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany alone.)
cairns which are simply large piles of loose stones (as opposed to chambered cairns.)
Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate.
