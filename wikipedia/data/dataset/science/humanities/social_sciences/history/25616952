Red Tail Reborn is a 2007 historical documentary film by Adam White about the Commemorative Air Force's Red Tail Project. The project involves the restoration, exhibition and maintenance of a World War II P-51 Mustang flown by the United States Air Force 332d Fighter Group. The exhibition of this plane is considered to be a traveling and flying tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. In addition to increasing awareness of the travails of the Tuskegee Airmen, this film served to highlight the Red Tail Project fundraising effort to rebuild the plane after a 2004 crash.
The film was initially broadcast and released on DVD in 2007 in the director's home state of Ohio, winning local Emmy Award recognition. The following year, it was broadcast nationally for the first time on Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) stations. The film had a sequel called Flight of the Red Tail.
