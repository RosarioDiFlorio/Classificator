Comparative historical research is a method of social science that examines historical events in order to create explanations that are valid beyond a particular time and place, either by direct comparison to other historical events, theory building, or reference to the present day. Generally, it involves comparisons of social processes across times and places. It overlaps with historical sociology. While the disciplines of history and sociology have always been connected, they have connected in different ways at different times (see 'Major researchers' below). This form of research may use any of several theoretical orientations. It is distinguished by the types of questions it asks, not the theoretical framework it employs (see 'Illustrations' below).
