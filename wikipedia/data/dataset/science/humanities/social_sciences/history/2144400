The loss of the Titanic in 1912, with about 1500 lives, attracted so much controversy that several alternative theories about its sinking have gained support.
One version suggests that the sunken ship was actually the Olympic, near-identical sister-ship of the Titanic, which was the subject of a large insurance claim, and that the two vessels were secretly switched before the voyage. Another was that the Titanicâ€™s owner, J.P. Morgan, wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank.
