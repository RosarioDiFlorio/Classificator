The Socialist History Society (SHS) is a British-based organisation which publishes a twice-yearly journal (Socialist History) mainly about the history of the socialist and labour movements in Britain. It also publishes a series of pamphlets on single themes once or twice a year, and a members' newsletter. It holds lectures, film screenings and similar events in London, on its own and jointly with other groups, and organises occasional conferences. It was founded in 1992 as the successor to the Communist Party Historians Group, but the SHS is not now linked to any political party or ideological tendency.
