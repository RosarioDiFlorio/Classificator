The 'Bosnian pyramid complex' is a debunked, pseudoarchaeological notion which has been promoted by author and businessman Semir Osmanagić. He claims that a cluster of natural hills in central Bosnia and Herzegovina are the largest human-made ancient pyramids on Earth. Osmanagić opened excavations in 2006 which have since reshaped one of the hills, making it look like a stepped pyramid.
Direct study of the site by geologists, archeologists and other scientists have demonstrated that the hills are natural formations known as flatirons and that there are no signs of human construction involved. The European Association of Archaeologists has condemned the so-called 'Bosnian pyramids' as a "cruel hoax". Many scholars have noted that the claims are used for serious ideological, political and economical gains in Bosnia.
Despite being completely disowned by the scientific community, Osmanagić is still pursuing his project in 2017.
