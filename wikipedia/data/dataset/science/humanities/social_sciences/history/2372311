Paleodemography is the study of human demography in antiquity and prehistory. More specifically, paleodemography looks at the changes in pre-modern populations in order to determine something about the influences on the lifespan and health of earlier peoples.
Reconstruction of ancient population sizes and dynamics are based on bioarchaeology, ancient DNA as well as inference from modern population genetics.
