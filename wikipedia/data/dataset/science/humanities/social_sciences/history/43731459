First 100 Years is a campaign owned and managed by Spark21, a charity registered in England & Wales. Initially, the campaign was launched by Obelisk Legal Support Solutions, in partnership with The Law Society and the Bar Council. It is a five-year project which seeks to discover the stories of pioneering and inspiring women in the legal profession. The project was launched in 2014 and will run to 2019, culminating with the 100-year anniversary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. The official launch took place at the House of Lords in March 2015.
