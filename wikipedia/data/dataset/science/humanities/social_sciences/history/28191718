The Oral History Society promotes the collection, preservation and use of recorded memories of the past.
As well as offering practical advice and support, the Society aims to raise standards in oral history practices across a range of activities and disciplines.
Through an annual conference, other meetings, a web site and the Oral History journal the Society encourages individuals to share ideas, experience and good practice.
The Society also provides a voice for oral historians advising and collaborating with national organisations and research councils on oral history
