Strangeways is an area of inner north Manchester, around Strangeways Prison, which took its name from the place; but its name is commonly used to mean the prison.
Until the 19th century it was rural. In it were Strangeways Hall and Park and Gardens. Strangeways was recorded in 1322 as Strangwas, from the Anglo-Saxon Strang and gew√¶sc meaning "[a place by] a stream with a strong current". Old spellings of the name vary.
