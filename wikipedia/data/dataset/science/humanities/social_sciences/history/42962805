Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from plastics. When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer.
Objects made from plastics were created mostly for artistic, technical, and domestic uses. The act of conservation and restoration strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use.
