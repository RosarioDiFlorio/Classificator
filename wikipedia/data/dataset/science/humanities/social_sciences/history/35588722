Paraloid B-72 or B-72 is a thermoplastic resin that was created by Rohm and Haas for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for flexographic ink. Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by conservator-restorers, specifically in the conservation and restoration of ceramic objects and glass objects, and can also be used for labelling museum objects.
