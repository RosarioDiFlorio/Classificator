The Australian Made and Australian Grown trade mark logos signify products whose ingredients or production mostly originate from Australia. This programme was established in 1986 with a logo created by Ken Cato and is conducted by the Australian Made Campaign Limited, a not-for-profit public foundation created by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and various Australian business chambers.
The logo is accompanied by one of the following phrases, either Australian Grown, Australian Made or Product of Australia.
