United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 was a measure adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on 26 February 2011. It condemned the use of lethal force by the government of Muammar Gaddafi against protesters participating in the Libyan Civil War, and imposed a series of international sanctions in response.
The Security Council resolution marked the first time a country was unanimously referred to the International Criminal Court by the council.
It has been alleged by Le Figaro that France openly violated the resolution by parachuting weapons to Libyan rebels (see lower).
