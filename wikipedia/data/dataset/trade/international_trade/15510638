The United Kingdom v Norway [1951] ICJ 3 also known as the Fisheries Case was the culmination of a dispute, originating in 1933, over how large an area of water surrounding Norway was Norwegian waters (that Norway thus had exclusive fishing rights to) and how much was 'high seas' (that the UK could thus fish).
