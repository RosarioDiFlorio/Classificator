United Nations Security Council resolution 917, adopted unanimously on 6 May 1994, after recalling resolutions 841 (1993), 861 (1993), 862 (1993), 867 (1993), 873 (1993) and 875 (1993) and 905 (1994) on the situation in Haiti, the Council imposed further international sanctions on the country after the military authorities refused to implement the Governors Island Agreement to hand over power and instances of violations of human rights.
The Security Council confirmed the intention of the international community to restore democracy in Haiti and the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The need for free and fair elections, as called for in the constitution, was stressed. Killings, illegal detentions, abductions, disappearances, instances of rape, the denial of freedom of expression and the impunity under which armed citizens operated were all condemned. The Council recalled that further measures would be considered if the Haitian authorities continued to impede the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and failed to implement the Governors Island Agreement.
