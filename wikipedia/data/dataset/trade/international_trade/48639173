Mochileros (Spanish: "backpackers") are low-level drug couriers in the Latin American cocaine trade. They move cocaine on foot from areas where it is produced, such as the Valle de los Rios Apur√≠mac, Ene y Mantaro in Peru, to pick-up points from which it can be collected by the next link in the transport chain. The work is highly dangerous.
