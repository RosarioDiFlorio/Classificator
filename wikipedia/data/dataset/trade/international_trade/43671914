The Import of Live Fish (England and Wales) Act 1980 is an Act of Parliament which controls the release of non-indigenous species of fish, affording protection to native species of fish within the boundaries of England or Wales.
It is an offence (unless under a granted licence), to import, keep or release, of any live fish or shellfish (or their eggs), of a species (not native to England and Wales) and which may threaten the ecosystem or habitat of any indigenous freshwater or migrating fish, or shellfish in England and Wales.
Not holding a licence or failing to comply with the licence requirements will result in a possible conviction and the destruction of the non-indigenous animals.
