The Egyptian Ali Sayyid Muhamed Mustafa al-Bakri (Arabic: علي سيد محمد مصطفى البكري‎) alias Abdul-Aziz al-Masri ( عبد العزيز المصري ) (b. 1966 in Bani Suwayf) is a member of majlis al-shura of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, and a former member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, from which he migrated to al-Qaeda along with Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al-Bakri is at large, and the United States Department of State is offering up to US$5 million for information about his location. The State Department wanted poster reads

Ali Sayyid Muhamed Mustafa al-Bakri is an al-Qaida member and an explosives and chemical weapons expert. He is a member of the al-Qaida Shura council and is a close associate of al-Qaida leaders Saif al-Adel and Ayman al-Zawahiri. Prior to joining al-Qaida, al-Bakri was a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad terrorist group, under the direction of Ayman al-Zawahiri. He served as an instructor in al-Qaida's camps in Afghanistan, providing terrorist recruits with training in the use of explosives and chemical weapons. Al-Bakri also unsuccessfully attempted to hijack a Pakistani Air passenger flight in December 2000. It is likely that he continues to train al-Qaida terrorists and other extremists.

For his membership in al-Qaeda, al-Bakri (under the surname Bakri) is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations Security Council Committee 1267. The UN entry about him, from 2005, says that al-Bakri may be in Iran.
