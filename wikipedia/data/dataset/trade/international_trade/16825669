The International Trade Awards, held for the first time in 2007, are the UKs premier awards devoted exclusively to recognising excellence in import, export and international trade achievement.
The Awards are a series of twelve regional International Trade Awards. Winners from each region are announced at presentation ceremonies held from February through to December with the winners automatically progressing as national finalists.
