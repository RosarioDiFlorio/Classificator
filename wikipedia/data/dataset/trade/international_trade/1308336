The Fairtrade certification initiative was created to form a new method for economic trade. This method takes an ethical stand point, and considers the producers first, in an attempt to emphasise equality in the market place. The Fairtrade organization forms a partnership between the consumer and the producer, and aims to eliminate other parties within the supply chain. Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO) uses fair trade benefits to make certain that the producers who take part in the initiative are not being exploited by buyers in developed countries, who try to reduce their own costs to make a bigger profit and/or cover the cost of higher taxes and employee benefits imposed on companies in developed countries. The second part of Fairtrade International is the independent certifier, FLOCert. FLOCert ensures that companies and producers all comply with FLO's standards of trade. Fairtrade International was initially made up of other national fair trade initiatives from around the world, who came together to form one international umbrella organisation (FLO). Fairtrade International started with the coffee industry, but now covers a range of products such as cocoa, fruit, cotton, flowers, tea and others. The established buyers of these products make up a niche market, which makes marketing for Fairtrade a challenge.
Retail sales of Fairtrade certified products have grown steadily over the last decade and are expected to continue growing but Fairtrade certified products make up a relatively minuscule share of the global market for agricultural goods. As of 2011, 827 producer organizations in 58 developing countries were Fairtrade certified, representing over 1.2 million farmers and workers. The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; and in some cases workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.
