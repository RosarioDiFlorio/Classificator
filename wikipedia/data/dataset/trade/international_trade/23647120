Modalities are the formulas, targets, or specific measures used to accomplish objectives in trade negotiations. An example of modalities in the current World Trade Organization agriculture negotiations would be a percentage phase-out over a specified time period of agricultural export subsidies or the use of the Swiss formula for tariff reduction and harmonization.
