The Company of the Occident (French: Compagnie de l'Occident) was a French Crown corporation that existed from 1664 to 1667. Its purpose was to exploit the resources of the French colonies and compete with the powerful Dutch and English companies.
Louis XIV had ambitions to develop his new colony of New France. This was seen as a way of funding these efforts. Spearheaded by Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the letters patent creating the Compagnie de l'Occident were issued in May 1664. All property rights in French possessions in North and South America, and also the west coast of Africa, were vested in the company.
The company was shut down in 1674.
A Compagnie d'Occident was founded en 1718 by French Banker Antoine Crozat after the Compagnie de la Louisiane's bankruptcy.
