An Eco-tariff, also known as an environmental tariff, is an import or export tax placed on products being imported from, or also being sent to countries with substandard environmental pollution controls. They can be used as controls on global pollution and can also be considered as corrective measures against "environmental races to the bottom" and "eco-dumping".
The result of eco-tariffs is the increase in Environmentally Preferable Products (EPPs). EPPs are â€œproducts which cause significantly less environmental harm at some stage of their life cycle than alternative products that serve the same purpose."
