The following contains a list of trading losses of the equivalent of USD100 million or higher. Trading losses are the amount of principal losses in an account. Because of the secretive nature of many hedge funds and fund managers, some notable losses may never be reported to the public. The list is ordered by the real amount lost, starting with the greatest.
This list includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent losses, but excludes losses associated with Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which is estimated in the $50 billion range, because Madoff did not lose the majority of this money in trading.
