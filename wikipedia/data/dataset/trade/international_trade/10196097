The Nandigram violence was an incident in Nandigram in the West Bengal state of India, in the aftermath of a failed project by the Government of West-Bengal under the erstwhile Communist rule to acquire land for SEZ (Special Economic Zone).
The policy led to an insurgency in the region, followed by the death of 14 people by the Police Forces.
This incident played an important role in the politics of West Bengal for the next few years. Mamata Banerjee and her political party widely mentioned this issue along with the political war cry Ma Mati Manush in their election campaigns.
Later the CBI gave a clean chit to the entire Buddhadeb Bhattacharya govt on Nandigram firing.
