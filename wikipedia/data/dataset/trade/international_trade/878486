In the context of Spain's New World Empire, its mainland coastal possessions surrounding the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico were referred to collectively as the Spanish Main. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the southern portion of these coastal possessions were known as the Province of Tierra Firme, or the "mainland province" (as contrasted with Spain's nearby insular colonies).
