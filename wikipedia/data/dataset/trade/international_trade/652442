FOB, "Free On Board", is a term in international commercial law specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms 2010 standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce. FOB is only used in non-containerized sea freight or inland waterway transport. FOB terms do not define transfer of ownership of the goods.
The term FOB is also used in modern domestic shipping within the USA to describe the point at which a seller is no longer responsible for shipping cost.
Ownership of a cargo is independent from Incoterms. In international trade, ownership of the cargo is defined by the bill of lading or waybill.
