An Open General Licence (OGL) is a type of export licence issued by a government to its domestic suppliers. In most countries, they are the licences with minimal restrictions. This is to be contrasted with other licences such as the Open General Trade Control Licence in the UK which put restrictions on the amount or type of goods or services being exported.
