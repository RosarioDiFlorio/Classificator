This is a list of countries by net oil exports based on The World Factbook and other sources. "Net export" refers to the export minus the import. Note that the net export is approximate, since the import and export data are generally not for same year (though year-to-year changes are generally small). Many countries are missing data for either imports or exports, but this generally indicates that the missing number is small.
