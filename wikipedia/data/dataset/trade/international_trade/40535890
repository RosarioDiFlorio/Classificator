Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZA) was established as a free economic zone in 1996 as part of the Dubai Governmentâ€™s strategic plan to be an investment driven economy. Today it is one of the fastest growing free zones in the region contributing 4.7 per cent of Dubai's GDP (gross domestic product).
DAFZA provides international investors with 100 per cent tax exemption, 100 per cent foreign ownership and no currency restrictions. The inner-city DAFZA is currently home to 1,600 companies from across the globe. These companies cover a vast number of key industry sectors including electronic and electrical, IT and telecommunications, pharmaceutical and cosmetics, engineering and building materials, aerospace and aviation, logistics and freight, food and beverage, jewelry and precious stones as well as luxury items.
The free zone itself stretches over an area of 696,000 square meters, which includes 13 buildings and 256 warehouses however when it was first established, it was only two central buildings and one warehouse facility.
