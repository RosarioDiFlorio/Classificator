International financial transactions are based on several financing philosophies, whose application is affected by the course of economic growth and development within an individual national economy. This is demonstrated by the evolution of the financing technique known as International structured trade & commodity finance (STCF).
STCF is "cross-border trade finance in emerging markets where the intention is to get repaid by the liquidation of a flow of commodities."
