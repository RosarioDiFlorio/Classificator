The Secretariat of the Caribbean Community is the principal administrative organ for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and is headed by the Secretary General who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Community.
The Mission Statement of the Secretariat is: To provide dynamic leadership and service in partnership with Community Institutions and groups, toward the attainment of a viable, internationally competitive and sustainable Community, with improved quality of life for all.
The original home of the CARICOM Secretariat (and its precursor the CARIFTA Secretariat) was at Colgrain House (specifically the southern half of the building, while the northern half was used as the residence of the Secretary-General) on Camp Street, Georgetown, Guyana. Ground was broken for a new CARICOM Secretariat headquarters on February 25, 1998 at Liliendaal/Turkeyen. Construction of the CARICOM Secretariat Headquarters Building commenced in May 2001 and on 19 February 2005 the building was officially commissioned in an inauguration ceremony. The building was officially handed over to the CARICOM Secretariat on 15 July 2005 and the Secretariat commenced operations in the building on 26 July 2006.
