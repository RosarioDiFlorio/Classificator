Interop is an annual trade fair for information technology organised by UBM. It takes place at five different locations at various times of the year: Mumbai (India), Tokyo (Japan), London (UK) and Las Vegas (NV, USA). 2011 marked Interop's 25th anniversary and throughout that time, Interop has promoted interoperability and openness, beginning with IP networks and continuing in today's emerging cloud computing era. For every US event, Interop volunteers build a network (called the InteropNet) using tools from various vendors to demonstrate the latest technologies and interoperability.
