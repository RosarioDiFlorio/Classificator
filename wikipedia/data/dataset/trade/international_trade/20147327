Labuan International Business and Financial Centre (IBFC) is a special economic zone of the Malaysian government based on the island of Labuan off the Borneo coast. It was established in 1990 and has been marketed as having a unique position to tap investment opportunities in Asia and beyond.
The Labuan IBFC shares a common time zone with many large Asian cities and its location between China and India as well as its proximity to several other financial centres has been used to promote the Labuan IBFC as a convenient location for business dealings. Labuan has been designated as a financial centre and free trade zone by the Malaysian government.
