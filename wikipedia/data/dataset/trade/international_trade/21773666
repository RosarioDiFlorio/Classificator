Cross-Strait Economic Zone (simplified Chinese: 海峡经济区; traditional Chinese: 海峽經濟區; pinyin: hǎixiá jīngjì qū) is a proposed economic zone by the People's Republic of China which includes economic linkages between the three coastal provinces of mainland China and Taiwan. This includes coastal cities along Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang provinces such as Xiamen, Quanzhou, Fuzhou, Wenzhou and Shantou. In Taiwan, this would include Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung. The proposed zone aims to increase economic ties between Taiwan and mainland China. 
The ROC positions this Cross-Strait Economic Zone as an implementation of the proposed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (EFCA) between Taiwan and mainland China.
