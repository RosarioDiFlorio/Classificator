Trade Costs & Facilitation: The Development Dimension is an ongoing research project on trade facilitation reform carried out by the Development Economics Research Group of the World Bank.
The project is focused on expanding knowledge about the relationships between trade costs and private sector growth and export competitiveness in developing countries. A major focus is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance (net benefits) of related reform measures. The project has two primary parts: research and policy relevant analysis, and support for new data.
The project analyzes trade facilitation effects in a broad sense, as its analysis spans the entire realm of a typical international trade transaction; this includes, among other topics, the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments, the efficiency of supply chain-related infrastructure, the harmonization of product standards, and conformance to international or regional regulations.
