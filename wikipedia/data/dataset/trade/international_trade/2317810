Colbertism is an economic and political doctrine of the 17th century, created by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of finance under Louis XIV. Colbertism is a variant of mercantilism that is sometimes seen as its synonym. It is more a collection of economical practices than a true current of economic thought.
