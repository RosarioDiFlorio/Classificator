The Agusta scandal or Agusta affair (French: Affaire Agusta, Dutch: Agustaschandaal), alternatively known as the Agustaâ€“Dassault Case, was a corruption scandal in Belgium during the 1990s. It resulted from the discovery that the aviation firms Agusta and Dassault had bribed various Belgian office-holders in 1988 in order to secure a large order of Agusta A109 helicopters from the Belgian Army and the deals for refitting Belgian F-16 Fighting Falcon jets respectively. Several politicians from the Walloon and Flemish Socialist parties, including the incumbent Secretary General of NATO Willy Claes, were to resign as a result of the scandal and its subsequent investigation.
