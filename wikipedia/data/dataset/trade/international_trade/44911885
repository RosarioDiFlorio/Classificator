Colonial goods (German: Kolonialwaren) was a term used in the first instance by retailers, wholesalers and economists/statisticians during the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. The term chiefly refers to foods and other consumer goods imported from European colonies, as opposed to commodities produced domestically or imported from nearby countries.
The term was widely used in Germany and in export oriented countries that traded with Germany, notably Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, as well as in the Nordic countries. It referred to food and other widely traded commodity items with good storage properties that were consumed in Europe but for the most part produced in other continents, notably sugar, rice, coffee, tea, cocoa and tobacco. These goods tended to be sold in specialist “colonial goods” shops, which were regarded as a distinctive sector.
