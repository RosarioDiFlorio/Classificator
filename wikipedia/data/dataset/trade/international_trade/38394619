Trade globalization is a type of economic globalization and a measure (economic indicator) of economic integration. On a national scale, it loosely represents the proportion of all production that crosses the boundaries of a country, as well as the number of jobs in that country dependent upon external trade. On a global scale, it represents the proportion of all world production that is used for imports and exports between countries.
For an individual country, trade globalization is measured as the proportion of that country's total volume of trade to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP):

  
    
      
        
          
            
              I
              m
              p
              o
              r
              t
              s
              +
              E
              x
              p
              o
              r
              t
              s
            
            
              G
              D
              P
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {Imports+Exports}{GDP}}}
  

For the world as a whole, trade globalization is the share of total world trade in total world production (GDP), where the sums are taken over all countries:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ∑
              E
              x
              p
              o
              r
              t
              s
            
            
              ∑
              G
              D
              P
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\sum Exports}{\sum GDP}}}
