After demanding the Croatian Army respect the article 4 of the Resolution 752, the Council stated that all states should abide by the following rules, until Resolution 752 had been implemented. It demanded that all Member States should:
(a) prevent the import of all products and commodities from Yugoslavia or any activities by their nationals to promote such exports;
(b) prevent the sale of all products and commodities to Yugoslavia, except for humanitarian need;
(c) not make available any commercial, industrial, or public utility, funds or financial resources to Yugoslavia;

(f) reduce the level of diplomatic and consular staff in Yugoslavia;
(g) limit participation in sporting events in the country;
(h) suspend scientific, technical and cultural exchanges and visits.
The Council further decided that the sanctions should not apply to the United Nations Protection Force, the Conference on Yugoslavia or European Community Monitoring Mission. It also called for a security zone to be established in Sarajevo and its airport, further calling on the Security Council Committee established in Resolution 724 should monitor the arms embargo, and that the Council as a whole will keep the situation under review.
