Horizontal integration is the process of a company increasing production of goods or services at the same part of the supply chain. A company may do this via internal expansion, acquisition or merger.
The process can lead to monopoly if a company captures the vast majority of the market for that product or service.
Horizontal integration contrasts with vertical integration, where companies integrate multiple stages of production of a small number of production units.
