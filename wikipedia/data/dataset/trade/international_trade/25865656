United Nations Security Council Resolution 1904, adopted unanimously on December 17, 2009, after reiterating its "unequivocal condemnation" of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda for "ongoing and multiple criminal terrorist acts", the Council adopted new measures to its decade-old regime of sanctions on the groups and others associated with them. The decision to adopt new measures originated from questions arising since Resolution 1267 (1999) and subsequent resolutions which imposed travel restrictions, asset freezes and an arms embargo on Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other associated groups which were placed on a "Consolidated List" compiled by the Security Council Committee established by Resolution 1267.
