Aliyah Bet (Hebrew: עלייה ב'‎, "Aliyah 'B'" – bet being the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was the code name given to illegal immigration by Jews to Mandatory Palestine between 1934 and 1948 in violation of the restrictions laid out in the British White Paper of 1939. In modern-day Israel it has also been called by the Hebrew term Ha'pala (Hebrew: הַעְפָּלָה‎; ascension). The Aliyah Bet is distinguished from the Aliyah Aleph ("Aliyah 'A'", Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) which refers to the limited Jewish immigration permitted by British authorities during the same period. The name Aliya B is also shortened name for Aliya Bilty Legalit (Heberw: עלייה בלתי-לגאלית - illegal immigration).
