The Community Friendly Movement aims to create demand for community friendly products and save communities around the world in a manner similar to the eco friendly movement's attempt to save the environment.
Currently about 70% of the retail price paid for home furnishings is retained by retailers and 30% goes to producers. The SuVyapar (Sanskrit for Good Trade) prototype developed at Stanford University shows that it is possible to reverse this and have 70% go to the producers. Some people call this "fair trade on steroids" and say that it has the potential of answering the objections of opponents of fair trade.
