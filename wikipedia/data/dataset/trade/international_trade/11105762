The ELSA Moot Court Competition (EMC²) on WTO Law is a simulated hearing in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system. Participating teams represent both the complainant and respondent parties to the case by presenting oral submissions in front of a panel.
EMC² panels consist of WTO law experts and are referred to as panellist. The competition provides students with the opportunity to put theory into practice, thereby completing formal legal education.
The WTO, which was established in 1995, is based on the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and creates a system for efficiently regulating international trade. Despite the controversies, the present structure looks to promote and enhance international trade for years to come.
The aim of the competition is both to encourage further development on the subject matter in the curriculum of academic institutions and also to contribute to the ongoing discussion about globalisation in the context of the WTO agreements.
