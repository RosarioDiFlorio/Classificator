The Scorpene deal scam was an Indian bribery scandal, in which USD 175 million (Rupees 1,100 crores) were alleged to have been paid to government decision makers by Thales. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had approved a deal to build Scorpene-class submarines worth US$ 6 billion (Rupees 19,000 crores) with Thales, France in October 2005. The investigating agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), found no evidence of corruption in the deal in 2008. Scorpene submarines are now being built in India under a technology transfer agreement that was part of that contract.
