The Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) is the executive body of the Eurasian Economic Union responsible for implementing decisions, upholding the EEU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the Eurasian Economic Union. The main task of the Eurasian Economic Commission is to ensure the functioning and development of the EEU, and to prepare proposals for its further integration.
The Board of the Commission operates as a cabinet government, with 14 members of the Commission ("commissioners"). There are three members per member state (and until 1 January 2016: 2 from Kyrgyzstan). The Chairman of the commission (currently Tigran Sargsyan) is nominated by the heads of state of the member states of the EEU. The Commission includes an administrative body composed of 23 departments, 18 consultative committees, and 2000 civil servants. The usual working language of the Commission is Russian.
The EEC was constituted by the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Commission, signed on November 18, 2011 and which entered into force on 1 January 2012. It began it operations on February 2, 2012. On 1 January 2015 it became the principle organ of the Eurasian Economic Union, upon entry into force of the Treaty on the European Economic Union.
