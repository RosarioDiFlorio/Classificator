The Ouchy Convention was negotiated at Ouchy (Switzerland) in June 1932, but signed at Geneva on 18 July 1932 between the two BLEU countries (Belgium and Luxembourg) and the Netherlands. At the convention the three countries agreed to a gradual reduction of economic barriers and the creation of a customs union. The convention was based on the Oslo Agreements of 1930 and aimed in addition at the reduction of trade tariffs.
