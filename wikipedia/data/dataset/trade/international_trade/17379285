National champion is a governmental policy in which large organisations are expected not only to seek profit but also to "advance the interests of the nation"; the government sets policies which favour these organisations. The policy is practised by many governments, in some sectors more than others (such as defense), but by giving an unfair advantage against market competition, the policy promotes economic nationalism domestically and global pre-eminence abroad contrary to the free market. The policy also deters or prevents venture capitalism.
As the policy is the collective form of inequality of opportunity, it is irreconcilable with the paradigm liberal economy advocated by 18th century economist Adam Smith. It was a key plank of the Dirigiste policy of 1945-1975 France.
