The African Diamond Producers Association (ADPA) is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to strengthen the level of influence African diamond-producing countries have on the world diamond market.
ADPA implements policies, strategies and laws that assist the generation of diamond profits from foreign diamond mining companies to its Member States.
The organization was formed on 4 November 2006 as a continental branch of the African Diamond Council, Africa's supreme diamond governing body.
The initiative to establish the ADPA was initially adopted and backed by Angolan President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos.
Angola is the interim executive secretariat as well as home to the organization's headquarters.
Both the ADC and ADPA organization's executive secretariat and headquarters are in the Republic of Angola.
