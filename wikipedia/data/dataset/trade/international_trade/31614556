In certain countries illegal importing, exporting, sale, or possession of drugs constitute capital offences that may result in the death penalty. According to a 2011 article by the Lawyers Collective, an NGO in India, "32 countries impose capital punishment for offences involving narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances." A 2012 report by Harm Reduction International "documents the 33 countries and territories that retain death penalty for drug offences, including 13 in which the sentence is mandatory."
A 2009 CNN article lists penalties for drug-related crime in Asia by country. Since then President Thein Sein of Myanmar commuted all of the countryâ€™s death sentences to life imprisonment in January 2014. South Korea has the death penalty for drugs. But South Korea has a de facto moratorium on the death penalty since it has not executed anybody since 1997, even though there are still people on death row, and even though new death sentences have been handed down in the last few years.
A 2015 article by The Economist says 32 countries have the death penalty for drug smuggling, but only 6 really carry it out.
