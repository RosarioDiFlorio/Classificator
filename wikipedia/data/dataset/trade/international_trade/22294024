Ajman Free Zone (Arabic: منطقه عجمان الحره‎) is a free trade zone in Ajman, one of seven emirates in the United Arab Emirates located on the Arabian Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf. The zone was established in 1988 and was granted autonomous status under the Amiri decree No. 3 of 1996 issued by Sheikh Humaid Bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, ruler of Ajman. Ajman Free Zone Authority has been named as the sole regulatory agency for Free Zone in the Ajman.
The formation of the Free Zone Authority in 1996 has given impetus to industrial activity in the Free Zone which has resulted in quadruple growth in the number of companies during the last few years.
A multi-million dirhams development plan on over a million square metre area is under progress at the Free Zone, which on completion will be able to accommodate 9000 companies.
Situated at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, Ajman Free Zone is well placed to serve the eastern and western markets.
Ajman's proximity to Sharjah and Dubai provides easy accessibility to the two international airports and four ports. Ajman port serves over 1000 vessels per year, with twelve berths.
Ajman Free Zone also promotes its services through international offices (http://afz.gov.ae/contact-us). It has opened its offices in India also.
