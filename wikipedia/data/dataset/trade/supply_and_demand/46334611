A predatory educator is an organization that exploits people by selling them education that cannot live up to the promises made.
In many cases predatory educators are most expert at helping students access various forms of financial aid â€“ helping them complete paperwork that will free up financial assistance that will allow the student to purchase more education. In the US it is common for such schools to get as much as 90% of their revenue from federal student aid programs.
