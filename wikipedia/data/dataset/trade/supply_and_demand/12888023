The Eurohypothec can be defined as a "common mortgage for Europe"; that is, a common mortgage instrument to secure loans transnationally and European-wide. Another (but improper) way in calling it is "Euromortgage".
It is currently a research project undertaken by several researchers European-wide. The Eurohypothec has appeared for the first time in an official document of the European Union in the Green Paper about the Mortgage Credit in the EU  and has found a degree of acceptance among the European mortgage market stakeholders, scientific authors and authorities.
