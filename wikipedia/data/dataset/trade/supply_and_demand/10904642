Student financial aid in Sweden consists of grants and loans administered by the Swedish National Board of Student Aid, a Swedish government agency. Students living with their parents often only take the student grant, while other students tend to take both the student grant and the student loan. The loans and grants are normally approved for a maximum of twelve semesters, or 240 weeks. As of 2016, weekly student aid when you are a full-time student is as follows:
No income tax is paid on student grants and student loans.
You must meet basic requirements to receive financial aid.
You must meet the age requirements. You may receive student aid until the year that you turn 56, but your right to take out a loan will be limited from the year that you turn 47. For upper secondary education, there is also a minimum age of 20.
You must be attending a school or course that qualifies you for student aid.
You must be studying at least half-time.
You must study for at least three weeks.
In Sweden, application and tuition fees apply for students who are not citizens of an EU/EEA/Nordic country or Switzerland and who apply for or enroll on studies at the bachelor’s or master’s level.
