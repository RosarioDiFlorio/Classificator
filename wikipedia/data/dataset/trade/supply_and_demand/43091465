Unpaid principal balance (UPB) is the portion of a loan (e.g. a mortgage loan) at a certain point in time that has not yet been remitted to the lender.
For a typical consumer loan such as a home mortgage or automobile loan, the original unpaid principal balance is the amount borrowed, and therefore the amount the borrower owes the lender on the origination date of the loan.
The unpaid principal balance will decrease as time goes on for the loans that are structured with level payments. For these common loans, each monthly payment includes both interest and principal. The unpaid principal balance at the beginning of a given month is reduced by that portion of the level payment that is designated principal for that month; so that the unpaid principal balance at the end of the month is the beginning UPB less the principal paid for the month. Hence, the UPB decreases over time.
