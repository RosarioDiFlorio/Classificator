The mortgage assumption value (MAV) is the cash equivalent, at the current point in time, of all future savings that could be achieved by assuming an existing low-interest-rate home mortgage loan rather than taking out a new higher interest rate loan and accounting for the time value of money.
This value is associated with a specific mortgage and fluctuates as currently available interest rates vary relative to the subject mortgage. Value is created and grows whenever the prevailing interest rate for a new mortgage loan is greater than and increasing when compared to the interest rate of the assumable mortgage. Similarly, the mortgage assumption value shrinks as market rates fall and hits zero if the market rate is less than or equal the rate on the assumable mortgage.
