A parallel loan is two loans taken out by two pairs of companies in different countries from local lenders with the aim of swapping the resulting loans in different currencies. It was an early form of currency swap.
In a parallel loan there is an exchange of currencies between four parties which promises that the loan will be repaid at a specified future date and predetermined exchange rate. It consists of two pairs of the affiliated companies and two pairs parents companies in two different countries. It occurs between two companies simultaneously when a company has a relative advantage in the cost of funds and then borrows those funds to a foreign affiliate in its own country at a rate lower than the foreign affiliate would have to pay at its parent company’s country. Besides that, the parallel loan is “similar to cross-border loan, but there are no currencies in the foreign exchange markets”.
The parallel loan is very similar to a back-to-back loan. The parallel loan was one of the proactive management of operating exposure that offsetting expected foreign exchange exposure. Two business companies in different countries will borrow currency to each other for a particular period of time and they will return the borrowed currencies on the date they agreed to with the same loaned amount. The two loans will be valued at the prevailing spot rate and the prescribed period. The currencies borrowing activities conducted outside the foreign exchange market to avoid foreign exchange risk and legal limitations.
