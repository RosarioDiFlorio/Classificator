Mortgage origination, a specialized subset of loan origination, in consumer lending is the process by which a lender works with a borrower to complete a mortgage transaction, resulting in a mortgage loan. A mortgage is a loan in which property or real estate is used as collateral. During this process, borrowers must submit various types of financial information and documentation to a mortgage lender, including tax returns, payment history, credit card information and bank balances. Mortgage lenders use this information to determine the type of loan and the interest rate for which the borrower is eligible. The process in the United States has become complex due to the proliferation of loan products and consumer protection regulations.
