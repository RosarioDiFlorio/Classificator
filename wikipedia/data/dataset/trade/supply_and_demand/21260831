A mohatra contract is way of loaning money with interest without breaking the letter of the usury laws. The lender sells the borrower a trivial object to be paid for on the loan due date. The borrower then sells the same object back immediately for cash at the price minus the interest.  An example would be a lender selling a pencil for $120 to be paid in a year's time and immediately repurchasing it for $100 in cash. The borrower has effectively borrowed $100 at a 20% interest rate.
