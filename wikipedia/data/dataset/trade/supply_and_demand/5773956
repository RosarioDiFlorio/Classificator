The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (also called FDLP, FDSLP, and Direct Loan Program) as defined by the United States Department of Education "provides another way to borrow money to pay for education after high school. Schools that participate in Direct Loans receive loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education, and disburse them to eligible students."
