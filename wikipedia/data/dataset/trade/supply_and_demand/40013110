A loan closet is a program that allows people to borrow durable medical equipment and home medical equipment at no cost or at low cost. The loan closet may be offered through an organization, an individual, or some other entity, often a non-profit organization. Because medical equipment is expensive and often needed for only a short time, loan closets help people receive equipment that they may not otherwise be able to afford.
