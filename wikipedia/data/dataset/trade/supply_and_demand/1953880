John Angelo Gotti (born February 14, 1964) known as "Junior" Gotti, is a former New York City mobster who, according to law enforcement claims, was acting boss of the Gambino crime family from 1992 to 1999 after his father, John J. Gotti, was sent to prison. Between 2004 and 2009 Gotti was a defendant in four racketeering trials which all ended in mistrials. In January 2010, federal prosecutors announced that they would no longer seek to prosecute Gotti for those charges. He has been referred to as "Teflon Jr." for evading conviction like his father.
