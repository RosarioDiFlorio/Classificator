Student loans and grants in France are primarily provided by the government through the Centre régional des œuvres universitaires et scolaires (CROUS), an Établissement public à caractère administratif. The CROUS is responsible for Student Finance France. Most undergraduate university students resident in France are eligible for student loans.
