Michael R. Mastro (born June 1, 1925), is a former American real estate developer who was in business for forty years managing apartments and midsize office parks in Seattle. He declared bankruptcy in 2009. Mastro and his wife, Linda, a former Bellevue grade school teacher, moved to France in 2011. They were arrested in Lake Annecy of the French Alps in 2012 where they faced extradition hearings. After several months of house arrest, they were freed in June 2013, by a French court that denied extradition back to the United States.
Mastroâ€™s bankruptcy has been described as the largest personal bankruptcy in the history of Washington state. Prior to the bankruptcy, the Mastros' moved many of their assets, including a $15 million home in Medina, into an Irrevocable Trust in Belize.
