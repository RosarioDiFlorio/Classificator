A loan shark is a person or body who offers loans at extremely high interest rates usually without holding relevant authorisation from the local financial regulator (illegally). The term usually refers to illegal activity, but may also refer to predatory lending with extremely high interest rates such as payday or title loans.
Unfortunately, an unintended consequence of poverty alleviation initiatives can be that loan sharks borrow from formal microfinance lenders and lend on to poor borrowers. Loan sharks sometimes enforce repayment by blackmail or threats of violence. Historically, many moneylenders skirted between legal and extralegal activity. In the recent western world, loan sharks have been a feature of the criminal underworld.
