Student loans in Norway are issued by Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund (Norwegian: Statens lånekasse for utdanning, commonly referred to as Lånekassen). Lånekassen provides both loans and grants. Loans are issued to students following studies at Norwegian universities and colleges. Qualified applicants studying abroad outside the Nordic region can also receive loan and grant support from Lånekassen. The status of a grant is conditional on passing all exams every semester. Portions of student loans can be converted into additional grant funding if the student achieves a high grade point average for the semester.
Loan and grant funding levels by Lånekassen are calculated using multiple variables including (but not limited to) tuition costs, income status, and whether or not the applicant is living with parents or other hosts rent-free.
