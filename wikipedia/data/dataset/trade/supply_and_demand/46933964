Prodigy Finance is a platform that enables financing for international postgraduate students who attend a participating business school or postgraduate institution, whilst delivering financial and social returns to alumni, institutional and private investors.
This borderless model enables educational loan financing to international students from across the globe, whilst using predicted post-degree affordability rather than present-day salary. Since 2007, Prodigy Finance has disbursed over US$325 million (as of August 2017) through the platform to fund students from 118 nationalities, with repayment rates in excess of 99%. Prodigy Finance is registered in London with offices in London, Cape Town and New York.
