Loanscribe is a platform for healthcare professionals to consolidate and refinance their student loans. It was co-founded by a pair of mortgage professionals, Jason Doshi and Samip Joshi. It is a student loan refinancing platform to focus on medical and healthcare professionals. Through its simplified process, Loanscribe reduces the physical burden of paying back multiple loans and the emotional stress of paying high interest. It has been mentioned in Bank Innovation and MedTech Boston.
Loanscribe's model was implemented through risk-based pricing and a vision that someone with a higher probability of paying back debt deserves to pay less interest. This model factors short- and long-term potential income, degree, and job stability, in addition to standard underwriting criteria such as FICO scores.
