Cajun Pawn Stars is an American reality television series on the History channel that debuted January 8, 2012, at 10 pm ET.
The show was the second spin-off of Pawn Stars, but unlike fellow spin-offs American Restoration and Counting Cars, it is entirely unrelated to the venue and staff of Pawn Stars.
Following its fourth and final season in 2012, the show went on hiatus, before effectively being canceled as the contract option date passed without renewal.
