In economics, an 'inverse demand function', P = f−1(Q), is a function that maps the quantity of output demanded to the market price (dependent variable) for that output. Quantity demanded, Q, is a function of price; the inverse demand function treats price as a function of quantity demanded, and is also called the price function. Note that the inverse demand function is not the reciprocal of the demand function—the word "inverse" refers to the mathematical concept of an inverse function.
