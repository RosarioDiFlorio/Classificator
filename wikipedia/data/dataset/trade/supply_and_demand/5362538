A PIK (Payment In Kind) loan is a type of loan which typically does not provide for any cash flows from borrower to lender between the drawdown date and the maturity or refinancing date, not even interest or parts thereof (see mezzanine loan), thus making it an expensive, high-risk financing instrument. PIK is to be interpreted as interest accruing until maturity or refinancing.
PIK loans are typically unsecured (i.e., not backed by a pledge of assets as collateral) and/or with a deeply subordinated security structure (e.g., third lien). Maturities usually exceed five years and in a standard offer, the loan carries a detachable warrant (the right to purchase a certain number of shares of stock or bonds at a given price for a certain period of time) or a similar mechanism to allow the lender to share in the future success of the business, making it a hybrid security.
