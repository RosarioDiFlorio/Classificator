The Saudi Arabian Interbank Offered Rate (SAIBOR) is a daily reference rate, published by SAMA (Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority), based on the averaged interest rates at which Saudi banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks in the Saudi Riyal wholesale money market (or interbank market).
On 20 November 2016 Thomson Reuters was approved as the SAIBOR administrator and calculation agent by SAMA.
