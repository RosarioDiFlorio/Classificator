The risk-free interest rate is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with no risk of financial loss, over a given period of time.
Since the risk-free rate can be obtained with no risk, any other investment having some risk will have to have a higher rate of return in order to induce any investors to hold it.
In practice, to infer the risk-free interest rate in a particular situation, a risk-free bond is usually chosenâ€”that is, one issued by a government or agency whose risks of default are so low as to be negligible.
