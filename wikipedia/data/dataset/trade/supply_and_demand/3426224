An amortization calculator is used to determine the periodic payment amount due on a loan (typically a mortgage), based on the amortization process.
The amortization repayment model factors varying amounts of both interest and principal into every installment, though the total amount of each payment is the same.
An amortization schedule calculator is often used to adjust the loan amount until the monthly payments will fit comfortably into budget, and can vary the interest rate to see the difference a better rate might make in the kind of home or car one can afford. An amortization calculator can also reveal the exact dollar amount that goes towards interest and the exact dollar amount that goes towards principal out of each individual payment. The amortization schedule is a table delineating these figures across the duration of the loan in chronological order.
