The annual effective discount rate expresses the amount of interest paid/earned as a percentage of the balance at the end of the (annual) period. This is in contrast to the effective rate of interest, which expresses the amount of interest as a percentage of the balance at the start of the period. The discount rate is commonly used for U.S. Treasury bills and similar financial instruments.
For example, consider a government bond that sells for $95 and pays $100 in a year's time. The discount rate is

  
    
      
        
          
            
              100
              −
              95
            
            100
          
        
        =
        5.00
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {100-95}{100}}=5.00\%}
  
The interest rate is calculated using 95 as the base

  
    
      
        
          
            
              100
              −
              95
            
            95
          
        
        =
        5.26
        %
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {100-95}{95}}=5.26\%}
  
For every effective interest rate, there is a corresponding effective discount rate, given by

  
    
      
        d
        =
        
          
            i
            
              1
              +
              i
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d={\frac {i}{1+i}}}
  
or inversely,

  
    
      
        i
        =
        
          
            d
            
              1
              −
              d
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i={\frac {d}{1-d}}}
  
Given the above equation relating 
  
    
      
        
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,d}
   to 
  
    
      
        
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,i}
   it follows that

  
    
      
        d
        =
        
          
            
              1
              +
              i
            
            
              1
              +
              i
            
          
        
        −
        
          
            1
            
              1
              +
              i
            
          
        
         
        =
        1
        −
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle d={\frac {1+i}{1+i}}-{\frac {1}{1+i}}\ =1-v}
   where 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is the discount factor
or equivalently,

  
    
      
        v
        =
        1
        −
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle v=1-d}
  
Since 
  
    
      
        
        d
        =
        i
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,d=iv}
   ,it can readily be shown that

  
    
      
        i
        d
        =
        i
        −
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle id=i-d}
  
This relationship has an interesting verbal interpretation. A person can either borrow 1 and repay 1 + i at the end of the period or borrow 1 - d and repay 1 at the end of the period. The expression i - d is the difference in the amount of interest paid. This difference arises because the principal borrowed differs by d. Interest on amount d for one period at rate i is id.
