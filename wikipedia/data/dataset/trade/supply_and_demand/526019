In finance and economics, the nominal interest rate or nominal rate of interest is either of two distinct things:
the rate of interest before adjustment for inflation (in contrast with the real interest rate); or,
for interest rates "as stated" without adjustment for the full effect of compounding (also referred to as the nominal annual rate). An interest rate is called nominal if the frequency of compounding (e.g. a month) is not identical to the basic time unit (normally a year).
