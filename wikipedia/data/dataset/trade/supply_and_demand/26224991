A loan modification company, also known as a mortgage modification company, is a business that helps homeowners modify the terms of their home loans or mortgages. When a mortgage is modified, the original terms of the home loan contract between a lender and a borrower are renegotiated and then altered, usually in the favor of the borrower.
Many homeowners choose to obtain modifications to their home loans when they are struggling to pay their mortgages or hope to avoid foreclosure. In order to expedite the loan modification process, homeowners may rely upon the services of a local loan modification company. By working with company that handles loan modifications, homeowners "receive the advice, resources and services they need to obtain the best terms possible for their modification while avoiding scams, which are prevalent in the loan modification industry."
