Demand vacuum in economics and marketing is the effect created by consumer demand on the supply chain. The term refers to an analogy whereby consumer demand for a product or service creates a "vacuum" at the end of the supply chain which "pulls" the product through the chain by causing the suppliers to provide more product.
The marketing strategy of pull strategy aims to create a demand vacuum through advertising and promotion to the consumer. This is to be compared with push strategy that tries to push the product through the supply chain by promoting the product to sellers and encouraging them to carry it.
