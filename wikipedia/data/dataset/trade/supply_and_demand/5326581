A demand set is a model of the most-preferred bundle of goods an agent can afford. The set is a function of the preference relation for this agent, the prices of goods, and the agent's endowment.
Assuming the agent cannot have a negative quantity of any good, the demand set can be characterized this way:
Define 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   as the number of goods the agent might receive an allocation of. An allocation to the agent is an element of the space 
  
    
      
        R
        +
        l
      
    
    {\displaystyle R+l}
  ; that is, the space of nonnegative real vectors of dimension 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
  .
Define 
  
    
      
        >
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle >p}
   as a weak preference relation over goods; that is, 
  
    
      
        x
        >
        p
        
          x
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x>px'}
   states that the allocation vector 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is weakly preferred to 
  
    
      
        
          x
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x'}
  .
Let 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   be a vector representing the quantities of the agent's endowment of each possible good, and 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   be a vector of prices for those goods. Let 
  
    
      
        D
        (
        >
        p
        ,
        p
        ,
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle D(>p,p,e)}
   denote the demand set. Then: D(>p,p,e) = {x: px <= pe and x >p x' for all affordable bundles x'.
