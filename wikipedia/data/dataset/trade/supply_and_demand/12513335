Loan Officers, also referred to as "Mortgage Loan Originators," are people who work for banks and other financial institutions with the main objective to recommend individual and business loan applications for approval and participate in the front end of the mortgage origination process. Loan officers specialize in commercial, consumer and mortgage loans. 
Although they are employed by financial institutions, they can be seen as intermediaries between lending institutions and borrowers. They solicit loans, represent creditors to borrowers, and represent borrowers to creditors.
