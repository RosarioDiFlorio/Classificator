Xbox Games Store (formerly Xbox Live Marketplace) was a digital distribution platform used by Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360 video game consoles. The service allows users to download or purchase video games (including both Xbox Live Arcade games and full Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles), add-ons for existing games, game demos along with other miscellaneous content such as gamer pictures and Dashboard themes.
The service also previously offered sections for downloading video content, such as films and television episodes; as of late 2012, this functionality was superseded by Xbox Music and Xbox Video (now known as Groove Music and Microsoft Movies & TV respectively).
On September 12, 2013, a technical problem caused many games and applications in the store to be delisted. Additionally, a live event that was scheduled to be broadcast on Xbox Live had to be cancelled, as the Live Event Player was unavailable to download due to the glitch.
In October 2017, Microsoft merged the Xbox Store and the Windows Store to create Microsoft Store, creating a single online destination for downloadable apps and games, as well as PCs, Surface devices, Xbox consoles and games, Microsoft and third-party software, and accessories sold at Microsoft.com and in its retail stores around the world. Customers can now download or purchase from Microsoft Store all the same content that was previously available in the Xbox Store, including video games encompassing both Xbox Live Arcade games and full Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles, add-ons for existing games, game demos along with other miscellaneous content such as gamer pictures, Dashboard themes, hardware, accessories and other content.
