Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4 is a Looney Tunes collection on DVD. Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes, it was released on November 14, 2006.
This Looney Tunes collection is the first one where every disc in the collection has a special theme. Disc one is all Bugs Bunny. Disc two is devoted to cartoons directed by Frank Tashlin. Disc three is all Speedy Gonzales cartoons. Disc four features feline characters, including the well-known Sylvester plus the lesser known Conrad the Cat and Claude Cat among others. Previous Golden Collections included at least one All-Stars disc with no common theme.
Like Volume 3, Volume 4 contains a warning about the politically incorrect humor and racial stereotypes in some of the cartoons, but unlike Volume 3's warning, which was a filmed introduction done by Whoopi Goldberg, Volume 4 simply presents a title card before the main menu with the following:

The cartoons you are about to see are products of their time. They may depict some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that were commonplace in American society. These depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. While the following does not represent the Warner Bros. view of today's society, these cartoons are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise is the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.

The Region 2 version contains only 53 shorts; 11 on Disc 2, and 14 on each of the others.
