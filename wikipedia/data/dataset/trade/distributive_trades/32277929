A mailer is an individual employed by a newspaper publisher to handle newspapers from the point where they emerge from the press to where it is loaded onto trucks or other means of transporting the newspapers. 
Preparing newspapers involves identifying the bundles by edition and inserting advertising supplements as well as the physical movement of bundles.
