The Omaha Bolt, Nut and Screw Building is a warehouse building at 1316 Jones Street in Omaha, Nebraska, that was built in 1889. It was designed by architect Henry Voss for the Omaha Bolt, Nut & Screw Company, a hardware distributor based in Omaha. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 as part of a multiple property submission with other warehouses in Omaha that were part of an economically important "wholesale jobbing" industry that sprang up, taking advantage of Omaha's location and transportation links.
