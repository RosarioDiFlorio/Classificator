Mill Creek Entertainment is an American home video company founded in 2002 by Ian Warfield, Robert Zakheim and Scott Moss in Minnetonka, Minnesota.
The Mill Creek Entertainment catalog draws from over 12,000 hours of owned and licensed content, including contemporary and classic feature films, as well as television, animations, documentary, special interest, family entertainment and fitness content. The company's licensing partnerships with major studios include Buena Vista Home Entertainment (until 2016), Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, NBCUniversal, and Warner Home Video.
The company is known for its multi-film DVD collections, which draw heavily (but not exclusively) from material in the public domain in the United States. The company also produces its own original documentary programming, including the National Parks Explorer Series, Up from Slavery, Gangster Empire: Rise of the Mob, The Ultimate Civil War Series, America's Serial Killers, and The Decade You Were Born series. Mill Creek acquired the library of Crown International Pictures from now defunct Navarre Corporation subsidiary BCI Home Entertainment.
