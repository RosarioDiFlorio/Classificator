2 Entertain (stylised as 2 | entertain) is was a British video and music publisher formed by the merger of BBC Video and Video Collection International in 2005. Under CEO Richard Green, the company operated as a joint venture between BBC Worldwide and the Woolworths Group until BBC bought out Woolworths' share following the latter's administration in 2008. As of November 2013, the 2 Entertain branding is only used on non-BBC releases; BBC DVD has been used since instead. In late 2013, 2 Entertain closed down and the BBC now make the dvds themselves for BBC Worldwide.
