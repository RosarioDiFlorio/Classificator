Looney Tunes Super Stars' Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote: Supergenius Hijinks is a DVD containing 15 Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons which was released on October 4, 2011. It was released earlier in Czech Republic on September 8, 2011 and on October 3, 2011 it was available early in the US at Walmart stores.
The DVD contains 15 shorts, all of which star Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Some of them have previously been released on DVD in some fashion, with an asterisk denoting those shorts. The shorts will be presented in both full screen and widescreen aspect ratios (widescreen aspect ratio only on Blu-Ray (three cartoons on Blu-Ray 3D)), similar to Foghorn Leghorn: Barnyard Bigmouth. Like the rest of the Super Stars releases, there are no special features or extras.
It has been previously reported that the disc would include 3 Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote webtoons, Freeze Frame, and Soup or Sonic. However, an update on February 2 reported that the disc would instead include the 3 2010 CGI shorts, Coyote Falls, Fur of Flying, and Rabid Rider.
