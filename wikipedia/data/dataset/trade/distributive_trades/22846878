United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has announced a new rule, known as the Importer Security Filing (ISF) or more commonly called 10+2; which requires containerized cargo information, for security purposes, to be transmitted to the agency at least 24 hours (19 CFR section 149.2(b) before goods are loaded onto an ocean vessel headed to the U.S. (i.e. mother vessel, not feeder vessel) for shipment into the U.S. 10+2 is pursuant to section 203 of the SAFE Port Act, and requires importers to provide 10 data elements to CBP, as well as 2 more data documents (Container Status Messages and the vessel's Stow Plan)from the carrier.
The new rule, published on November 26, 2008, went into effect on January 26, 2009. CBP is taking a phased-in approach in terms of implementation and enforcement. During the first 12 months, importers will be warned of infractions instead of being fined, with the hope that the importers will establish a filing system. All ISF filings are required to be submitted electronically via the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) or the Automated Manifest System (AMS). For shipments on the water on or after June 30, 2016, CBP had ended the phased-in approach and ISF compliance is in full effect. If compliance is not met, liquidated damages penalties up to $5,000 may be issued by the local port for each violation.
The following 10 data elements are required from the importer:
Manufacturer (or supplier) name and address
Seller (or owner) name and address
Buyer (or owner) name and address
Ship-to name and address
Container stuffing location
Consolidator (stuffer) name and address
Importer of record number/foreign trade zone applicant identification number
Consignee number(s)
Country of origin
Commodity Harmonized Tariff Schedule number to six (6) digits
From the carrier, 2 data elements are required:
Vessel stow plan
Container status messages
The above information is required for the Department of Homeland Security to "push out" U.S. borders.
