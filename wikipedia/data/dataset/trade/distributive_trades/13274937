This is a page containing all available sales and awards from industrial rock and industrial metal artists.
This list is far from complete. Many countries were excluded from it because their Industry Associations lacked a searchable, online database. Belgium, Iceland and Mexico are some of them. Some European countries who do have it (Greece, Hungary and Spain) were excluded anyway, because their databases showed no relevant sales pertaining industrial rock and metal groups. Latin American countries with online databases (Argentina and Brazil) were excluded over the same principle.
