Garfield is a U.S. comic strip created by Jim Davis that has been the subject of numerous television specials. Many of these have been compiled on DVD releases.
In July 2004, the DVD Garfield as Himself, was released. DVD Talk critic Randy Miller judged the Garfield as Himself specials to be "quite enjoyable." The DVD debuted 35th in sales. That year, Garfield Holiday Celebrations appeared 23rd in TV DVD sales for the week of November 10, 2007. In 2014, Entertainment Weekly reported copies of the DVD "were selling on eBay like rare collectorâ€™s items."
The Garfield Holiday Collection was released on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year. Davis explained that in compiling the DVD, he went beyond the holiday-themed specials to include personal favorites.
