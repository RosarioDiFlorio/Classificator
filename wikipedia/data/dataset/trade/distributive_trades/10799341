The Big Event was a professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on August 28, 1986, at the Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, Ontario. It drew a crowd of over 74,000 fans, which was an outdoor attendance record at the time. This stood as an attendance record for a wrestling show until WrestleMania III drew a reported 93,173 fans just seven months later to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. A VHS tape of the event was released later by Coliseum Home Video, with commentary by Gorilla Monsoon, Johnny Valiant, and Ernie Ladd. In 2014, WWE Network made the event available on demand in the pay-per-view section (although the event was not originally broadcast via pay-per-view).
