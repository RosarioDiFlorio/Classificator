Ximenes Redoubt (Maltese: Ridott ta' Ximenes) is a redoubt in Salina Bay, Naxxar, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715-1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands, and it was originally called Salina Right Redoubt. Two warehouses were grafted on the redoubt in the second half of the 18th century so as to store salt from nearby salt pans. It was eventually renamed after Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada, whose coat of arms can be seen on one of the warehouses. The redoubt and warehouses have been recently restored.
