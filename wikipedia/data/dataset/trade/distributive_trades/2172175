Planograms, also known as plano-grams, plan-o-grams, schematics and POGs, are visual representations of a store's products or services. They are considered a tool for visual merchandising. According to the Oxford Dictionary, "It is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves in order to maximize sales." Planograms therefore help dictate a retail store's layout. The ultimate effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by sales volume.
