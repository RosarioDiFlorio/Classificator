In retail marketing, an endcap is a display for a product placed at the end of an aisle. It is perceived to give a brand a competitive advantage. It is often available for lease to a manufacturer in a retail environment. Products placed on an endcap for sale will sell at a much faster pace than products not on the endcap. The display of products on the endcap is sometimes also called a feature.
