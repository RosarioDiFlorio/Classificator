PAR Technology Inc. was founded in 1968 in New Hartford, New York, as a high tech, government contracting firm. PAR Technology Inc. was founded by John W. Sammon. Ten years later, PAR utilized government funded research and development initiatives and applied them to the commercial sector as viable products with real business applications. PAR then used this transferred technology to develop a stand-alone POS terminal for McDonaldâ€™s Corporation, which was installed in four test McDonald's restaurants in 1978. After a successful test run, McDonald's named PAR Technology Inc. their official vendor on October 15, 1980. As of 2017, McDonald's remains one of PAR's customers.
