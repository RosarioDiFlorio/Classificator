Sexy Sailor Soldiers (奈美SOS！ファースト・バトル, Nami SOS! First Battle) is an erotic original video animation (OVA)  based on the manga Nami SOS! created by Chataro in 1995. The animation was given a different name in North America for several reasons. The manga on which it is based was largely unknown in the Western world. The title "Sexy Sailor Soldiers" was chosen for its similarity to another popular anime, Sailor Moon, which had achieved commercial success in the West. The author took inspiration from that show for many features of his manga books.
Currently, the adaptation consists of a single episode, which contains the majority of the first manga's plot, with some slight changes in the scenes. It was developed by A.P.P.P., Moonrock Studios and released on October 25, 2003, in Japan, and on July 27, 2006, in North America, licensed by Critical Mass. The main features of the show are its supernatural elements, the characters' big breasts, armed combat, and sexual acts both with and without tentacles.
