WWE Workout Series is a series of fitness workouts by WWE, released on December 2, 2014 on DVD in Region 1. The Workout Series was designed by Joe DeFranco and based on similar workouts he designed for Paul Levesque (better known as Triple H) and Stephanie McMahon. Unlike other WWE Home Video releases, the Workout Series has nothing to do with either professional wrestling nor WWE Studios, but rather physical fitness.
