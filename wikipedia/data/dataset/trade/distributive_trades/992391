Vermaport is a registered trademark brand of a shopping cart conveyor system built by Vermaport Limited of Nottingham, England. The Vermaport SC system is designed to transport shopping carts between floors of a retail establishment, the Vermaport LC system is a Luggage Cart System for Airports to help travellers navigate multi-levels at Airports and works in a similar way to the Vermaport SC. The Vermaport RS is a Luggage Return System to transport or store luggage carts at airports or other transportation hubs (currently in operation in Schipol Airport, Amsterdam). The Vermaport systems are safer alternatives to inclined moving walkways, where a Vermaport system will take up about half as much space as a moving walkway.
