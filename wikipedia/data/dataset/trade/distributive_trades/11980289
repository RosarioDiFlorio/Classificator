Supply chain management software (SCMS) is the software tools or modules used in executing supply chain transactions, managing supplier relationships and controlling associated business processes.
While functionality in such systems can often be broad â€“ it commonly includes:
Customer requirement processing
Purchase order processing
Sales and Distribution
Inventory management
Goods receipt and Warehouse management
Supplier Management/Sourcing
A requirement of many SCMS often includes forecasting. Such tools often attempt to balance the disparity between supply and demand by improving business processes and using algorithms and consumption analysis to better plan future needs. SCMS also often includes integration technology that allows organizations to trade electronically with supply chain partners.
Also tight integration with the Finance system is must for most of the companies who are into Supply Chain Management. Hence most of the software systems available today are integrated with the Finance - Accounts Payables, Accounts Receivables and General Ledger. This makes it easy to manage book keeping for the organisations with ease. A tightly integrated Purchasing & Sales process enables the organizations to handle their day to day activities with less effort.
