WWE Tagged Classics is a series of two-disc DVD sets that were produced by Silver Vision and World Wrestling Entertainment for retail markets in Region 2 in PAL format. The sets featured a WWE pay-per-view event from one year on one disc, paired (or "tagged") with another disc that featured the same event from the following year, or two consecutive pay-per-views.
