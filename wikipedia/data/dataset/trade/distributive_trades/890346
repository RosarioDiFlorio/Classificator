A discount store is a retail store which sells products at prices that are lower than the typical market price. A "full-line discount store" or "mass merchandiser", such as Aldi or Lidl, may offer a wide assortment of goods with a focus on price rather than service, display or wide choice within lines; a "speciality", "single line" or "category killer" discount store, such as Toys "R" Us or Staples, may specialise in specific merchandise such as jewellery, electronic equipment or electrical appliances, relying on bulk purchase and efficient distribution to keep down costs. Discount stores are not variety stores, which sell goods at a single price-point or multiples thereof (Â£1, $2, etc.). Discount stores differ from variety stores in that they sell many name-brand products, and because of the wide price range of the items offered. After World War II, a number of retail establishments in the U.S. began to pursue a high-volume, low-profit-margin strategy designed to attract price-conscious consumers. This strategy has received renewed interest from retailers and customers alike stemming from the Great Recession that began in 2007 that forced buyers to revisit the approach to the products they wanted.
Currently Aldi, the largest retailer in the world (Planet Retail Ranking; June 2014), operates more than 10,121 discount stores worldwide.
