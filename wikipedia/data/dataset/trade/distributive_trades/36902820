Scream Factory is a subsidiary of Shout! Factory. The label releases a number of genre films, mostly horror and science fiction, with dedicated cult followings, many of which having never been available on Blu-ray prior. Certain titles are released in a "Collectorâ€™s Edition" with new and archival bonus content, a collectible slipcover featuring newly rendered retro-style artwork, and a reversible artwork wrap with a film's original theatrical or home video key art. Nearly all are exclusively on Blu-ray, while some are packaged in a Combo Pack with both Blu-ray and DVD with others sometimes being released separately as both.
Announced on May 31, 2012, the label was launched on September 18, 2012 with Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray releases of Halloween II and Halloween III: Season of the Witch. In February 2015, Scream Factory made a deal with IFC Films to release their titles on their IFC Midnight label. This included the Blu-ray and DVD releases of The Babadook and Backcountry, among others.
