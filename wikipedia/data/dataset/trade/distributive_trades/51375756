Agile retail is a direct-to-consumer retail model that uses big data to try to predict trends, manage efficient production cycles, and faster turnaround on emerging styles. Agile retail applies concepts from Agile and Lean in the retail business, and aims to respond faster to customer needs. This retail model is used by Amazon. The concept turns e-commerce retailers into on-demand platforms that identify stock and deliver desired products directly to the consumer, thereby reducing costs. The main focus of Agile retail is to identify trends that are popular with consumers at a given moment and deliver those products using Agile production concepts.
Experts in the fashion industry argue that Agile retail is the next step for fashion retail, especially with rising online sales. Agile Retail gives more options to customers, usually at a lower price, and delivers the product directly to them. Agile retail is a new form of fast fashion that applies the concepts of “Agile” and “Lean” in the fashion retail business. It is also all about serving customers better by aligning to their changing needs.
