Drug distribution is the process by means of which people get access to drugs. Because governments regulate access to drugs, governments control drug distribution and the drug supply chain more than trade for other goods. Distribution begins with the pharmaceutical industry manufacturing drugs. From there, intermediaries in the public sector, private sector, and non-governmental organizations acquire drugs to provide them to other intermediaries. Eventually, the drugs reach different classes of consumers who use them.
An illegal drug trade operates to distribute illegal drugs. The trade of illegal drugs overlaps with trade in contraband of all sorts. Illegal drug distribution does not overlap in obvious ways with the legal trade of legal drugs.
It is challenging to determine the size of markets which consume drugs. A 2002 report said that contemporary global pharmaceutical industry trade caused the exchange of US$500 billion, but actually, only US$25 billion was trade among different markets.
Drugs require cold chain management in their distribution.
Drug distribution has special safety considerations.
