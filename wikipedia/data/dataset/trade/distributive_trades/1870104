Sokihei M.D. Geist (Japanese: 装鬼兵MDガイスト, Hepburn: Sokihei M.D. Gaisuto, literally "Demon-Garbed Soldier M.D. Geist") is an anime and comic series about a post-apocalyptic world.
Geist (the main character) is MD-02, a Most Dangerous Soldier, genetically engineered to function as a killing machine, but every one of the MDS units went homicidally insane. As a result, Geist was placed in suspended animation in a stasis pod orbiting the planet Jerra until it crashed several years later, awakening him and bringing him into another war on the planet.
