MCA Inc. (which stands for Music Corporation of America) was an American media company. Initially starting in the music business, the company next became a dominant force in the film business, and later expanded into the television business. MCA published music, booked acts, ran a record company, represented film, television and radio stars, and eventually produced and sold television programs to the three major television networks, but had an especially good relationship with NBC. MCA, Inc., is the legal predecessor of Vivendi Universal and thereby NBCUniversal, which since March 2013 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast. MCA's other legal successor is Universal Studios Holding I Corp, an holding company owned by Vivendi, who also owns MCA's former music assets through Universal Music Group (which has absorbed PolyGram and EMI) and Universal Music Publishing Group.
