GKIDS (Guerrilla Kids International Distribution Syndicate) is an American film distributor based in New York with a focus on "sophisticated, indie" animation. GKIDS uses a "bespoke" distribution method to release critically acclaimed, hand-drawn, international films—such as the works of renowned Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki—to North American audiences.
The company has gained prominence since 2010 by garnering a series of Academy Award nominations for little-known, "underdog" films, beating out big-budget American films such as The Lego Movie, The Peanuts Movie and Finding Dory.
