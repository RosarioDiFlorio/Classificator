Imouto Paradise! 2: Onii-chan to Go nin no Imouto no Motto! Ecchi Shimakuri na Mainichi (妹ぱらだいす！2 ～お兄ちゃんと5人の妹のも～っと！エッチしまくりな毎日～) is a Japanese erotic visual novel developed by Moonstone Cherry and released on May 31, 2013 for Windows PCs and later ported as a DVD TV game. Imouto Paradise! 2 is a sequel to the visual novel Imouto Paradise!, featuring a new cast of characters, but with a similar plot. Both games depict incest.
The gameplay in Imouto Paradise! 2 follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. A majority of the scenes portray sexual acts between characters. The story follows Keiichi Nanase who is left alone with his five younger sisters when his parents leave to go on an overseas trip. Imouto Paradise! 2 premiered as the sixth best selling visual novel at the time of its release on Getchu.com, and charted once more in June.
Following the visual novel's release, Imouto Paradise! 2 made transitions into other media, one of these being a manga serialized in Enterbrain's Tech Gian magazine between the August 2013 and February 2014 issues. The manga was later published as a single bound volume by Kadokawa Shoten. There was much controversy regarding the manga's content, leading to Kadokawa recalling the publication. An adult original video animation (OVA) series was adapted from Imouto Paradise! 2, spanning two episodes. A light novel, an art book, and audio CDs were also released.
