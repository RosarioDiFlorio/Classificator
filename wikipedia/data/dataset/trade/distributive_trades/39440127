Pro-Active Entertainment Group was a United States movie distributing company based in Rancho Mirage California and founded by Leonard Levy. In the early 2000s, the company distributed or re-distributed many movies, including The Satanic Rites of Dracula, Lost on Mars and The Fat Spy. The company had several notable contracts with Raven Moon Entertainment, Inc, Ingram Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Baker & Taylor. Under its contract with Raven Moon Entertainment, Inc., it purchased DVDs such as Gina D's Kids Club, Sing A Long With Gina, and Smile-Ability, and distributed them to major retail and video stores such as Family Video, Premiere Video, Blockbuster Video, Costco, Hollywood Video, Best Buy, Ingram, Music Land, Borders, Circuit City, Sam's Club, K-mart, Wal-Mart, Sun Coast, Albertsons, Kroger and County Market. Improved technology such as inexpensive computer software, cameras and other equipment helped to lower production costs, enabling many filmmakers without significant financial backing to produce films, especially for the direct-to-video or direct-to-television markets. Pro-Active Entertainment Group was among the distribution leaders for these new markets. Video recording, once viewed as a threat, proved to be a new source of income for home entertainment distributors. In addition to new releases, distributors re-mastered and re-released older films. Using the internet and help from other major distributors such as Ingram Entertainment and Baker & Taylor, the Pro-Active Entertainment Group helped many film makers distribute their products. Pro-Active Entertainment Group operated in California and Tennessee, managed by Levy's associate, Richard Mendelson. The company closed after running into legal troubles with Backyard Wrestling, Inc.
