Beavis and Butt-Head: The Mike Judge Collection is a series of three-disc DVD sets from MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment, each containing 40 Beavis and Butt-Head episodes handpicked by series creator Mike Judge plus supplements. The first entry in the series was released on November 8, 2005, while the final two volumes were released in 2006.
In 2007, the complete box set was released, which includes the content from all three volumes as well as the film, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America: the blurb on the back jokingly says that "if you're the kind of dedicated, determined Beavis and Butt-Head fan who eagerly bought Volumes 1, 2, and 3 of The Mike Judge Collection, well, uh... you just got screwed".
In 2012 the three volumes were reissued in a single DVD case format, as opposed to the earlier issues which included three DVD cases in a box.
The Mike Judge Collection was also released in three volumes in UMD format on the PlayStation Portable. Due to the limited space available on UMDs, the interviews, music videos, and other content was removed and the number of episodes on each collection was reduced.
On February 14, 2017, MTV released Beavis and Butt-Head - The Complete Collection, a 12-disc set containing all four previous released volumes of The Mike Judge Collection, along with a special collector's edition of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.
