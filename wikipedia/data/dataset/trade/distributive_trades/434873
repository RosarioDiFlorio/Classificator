Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, known in Japan as Mobile Armored Riot Police: Stand Alone Complex (攻殻機動隊 Stand Alone Complex（スタンド・アローン・コンプレックス）,, Kōkaku Kidōtai Sutando Arōn Conpurekkusu), is a Japanese anime television series produced by Production I.G and based on Masamune Shirow's manga Ghost in the Shell. It was written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with original character design by Hajime Shimomura and a soundtrack by Yoko Kanno. The first season aired from October 2002 to October 2003 and was positively received by critics. A second season titled Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, known in Japan as Mobile Armored Riot Police: S.A.C. 2nd GIG (攻殻機動隊 S.A.C. 2nd GIG（エス・エー・シー セカンド ギグ）,, Kōkaku Kidōtai Esu Ē Shī Sekando Gigu), aired from January 2004 to January 2005.
The series centers on the members of an elite law enforcement unit known as Public Security Section 9 as they investigate cybercrime and terrorism cases; these cases often are connected to their pursuit of an elite "Super Class A" hacker and corporate terrorist known as "The Laughing Man". A series of associated short comic animations, titled Tachikomatic Days, aired after each episode. These shorts star the Tachikoma "think-tanks" from the main series, and they typically relate directly to the story of the preceding Stand Alone Complex episode.
The first season was adapted into a feature-length OVA titled The Laughing Man, which was released in 2005. The series had also received video game spin-offs for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phones. 2nd GIG was also later adapted into a feature-length OVA entitled Individual Eleven, which was released in 2006. Solid State Society, a TV-film sequel to the Stand Alone Complex series, was also released in that year.
