Customer value maximization (CVM) is a real-time service model that, proponents say, goes beyond basic customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities, identifying and capturing maximum potential from prospects and existing customers. Proponents claim that a well-devised CVM program helps companies offer the right things to the right people at the right time. The CVM framework uses creative, technology, media and process along with robust measurement systems to help marketers maximize returns from their marketing investments.
