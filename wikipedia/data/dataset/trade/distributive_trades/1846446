2006 in home video is considered something of a watershed for home media technology, with VHS being phased out as Blu-ray fought to replace the presently dominant DVD format. 2006 marked the end of the VHS era with the release of A History of Violence, the last VHS release for a major Hollywood film. Major retailers were switching to DVD-only sales while tapes were being sent to discount stores. This time marked the beginning of a major format war between Blu-ray and HD DVD which would be quickly won by Blu-ray.
