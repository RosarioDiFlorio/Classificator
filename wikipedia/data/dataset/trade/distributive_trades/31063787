Anaplan is a cloud-based planning and performance management platform with documented use cases in finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, IT and HR. The company competes in the business planning market, which for decades has been dominated by the “big four” legacy vendors: IBM, Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft. Anaplan CTO Michael Gould developed Anaplan as a response to these legacy systems. At the core of Gould's technology is a single hub where business users can build, deploy, maintain, and share models without coding or reliance on IT personnel. Founded in the United Kingdom, the company is now headquartered in the United States.
Anaplan is headquartered in San Francisco, with further American offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York City. There are three offices in the United Kingdom including the founding office in York, plus London, and Maidenhead. Additional global offices are located in France, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria, Russia, Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore.
