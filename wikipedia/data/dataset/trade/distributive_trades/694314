Hollywood Entertainment Corporation (Nasdaq: HLYW), known as Hollywood Video, was a home video and video game rental shop company started in 1988. The chain was the largest direct competitor to Blockbuster Video until it was purchased by Movie Gallery in 2005.
Hollywood Video ceased operations in May 2010, when Movie Gallery, its parent company, declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Its last US store closed its doors on July 31, 2010, whereas the last one in Canada closed on August 8 of that year.
As of late 2011, the HollywoodVideo.com site had been relaunched as a blog, which was discontinued in October 2014.
