Supply Chain Engineering (SCE) describes lot of a method for the conceptual construction and realization of logistics and product oriented supply chains within a company and beyond its borders. According to SCE the focus should not be limited to optimizing the parts of supply chain for effective and efficient functioning, but the complete value chain needs to be considered in a holistic fashion to yield the desired efficiency and effectiveness. The most essential ingredient of SCE is its integral view embodying
• Local Customization
• Engineering
• Information Technology
The engineering character is not only visible in the SCE’s content but also in its name.
As SCE is still a very young method only few standard works have been published so far; however, Kukkuk C, (Snr) in his opening address to the South African mining industry in 2015, sites "SEC should be regarded as an upstream practice and should not be a silo business unit, it may well be integrated with other key disciplines that form part of the 'value chain' some principles we apply are interactive sessions for front end planning, industry lessons learned, lean optimization strategies and updated ERP/MRP solutions"
The following definition therefore mainly refers to the standard work, “Supply Chain Engineering – methods of integrated logistics planning”, published in July 2010 by Dr. Joachim Miebach and Dominik Bühring. Herein SCE is defined as an independent and overall method to design supply chains.
