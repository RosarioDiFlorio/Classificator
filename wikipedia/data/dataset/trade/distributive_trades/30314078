The Warner Archive Collection is a manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVD series started by Warner Home Video on March 23, 2009, with the intention of putting previously unreleased catalog films on DVD for the first time. In November 2012, Warner announced that the Archive collection would begin releasing some titles on Blu-ray, with all discs being pressed, unlike the DVD series.
Using recordable DVDs, they custom burn discs for each order sold directly to the consumer, rather than the traditional business model of pressing batches of discs that ship to "brick and mortar" retailers. This saves on the costs of storing unsold stock in a warehouse and mitigates the risk of a retailer being stuck with unsold merchandise, especially since the majority of the films in the archive do not have widespread public demand. Some Warner Archives releases previously had a pressed DVD release but have lapsed out of print before since being re-released on MOD DVD discs.
In addition, Warner Archive also sell films and television shows as downloadable Windows Media files, and operates a subscription-based streaming video service, Warner Archive Instant, which allows members to stream many of the Warner Archive properties in a format similar to Netflix.
