Walt Disney's Funny Factory is a series of DVDs by Walt Disney Home Video. Very similar to the Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites line, each release would feature around one-hour of Disney animated short films, grouped by a starring character, or set of characters. As opposed to the chronological nature of the Walt Disney Treasures line, each release would feature various cartoons in no particular order. The series featured two waves of releases, on August 17, 2005 and November 21, 2006.
