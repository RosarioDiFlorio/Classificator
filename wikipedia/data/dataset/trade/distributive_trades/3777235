A deleted scene (or cut scene) is footage that has been removed from the final version of a film or television show.
A related term is "extended scene," the longer version of a scene that was shortened for the final version of the film. Often, extended scenes are included in collections of deleted scenes or are referred to as deleted scenes themselves, as is the case with for instance, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Serenity.
