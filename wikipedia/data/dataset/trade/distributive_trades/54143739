Sources Sought is a notice used by agencies of the government of the United States to solicit interest in a project under consideration by that agency. They are not requests for proposals or invitations to bid; they come earlier in the procurement process.
Such notices are useful to the agency as market research, by determining the availability of contractors to perform the project. They are useful to the contractors as their responses may influence the terms used by the agency in defining the requirements for the project. The notices are published online by the General Services Administration of the federal government.
