A video mixtape (VMT) is a stock footage movie consisting of clips from movies, television or home videos that are generally circulated as bootleg videos. Also called party tapes or video compilations, this phenomenon comes from the days of Betamax and VHS, when home editing and duplication became possible for the masses. Video mixtapes are distributed on VHS or DVD, or by one of the many distribution methods the internet has to offer. The concept and "feel" of a video mixtape is derived from the audio mixtape phenomenon.
