The Confirmed Line Item Performance (CLIP) is one of the diagnostic metrics for perfect order fulfillment which defines the supply chain delivery reliability measurement between facilities within a supply chain. Those facilities may belong to one company or span over several companies. CLIP is an analog measurement taking the portion of fulfillment into account using customer commit date as reference date. This intends a usage within a supply chain part with a fixed-period demand pattern (e.g. daily or weekly) and a permanent material flow (e.g. between production and distribution center), which is later on again split to be sent to different customers and locations.
