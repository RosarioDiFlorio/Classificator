Return fraud is the act of defrauding a retail store via the return process. There are various ways in which this crime is committed. For example, the offender may return stolen merchandise to secure cash, or steal receipts or receipt tape to enable a falsified return, or to use somebody else's receipt to try to return an item picked up from a store shelf. Return abuse is a form of “friendly fraud” where someone purchases products without intending to keep them. Perhaps the most well-known form of this abuse is “wardrobing” or “free renting” – in which the person makes a purchase, uses the product(s), and then returns the merchandise.

The retail industry experiences a significant fraud and abuse problem, losing money in the range of $50 billion per year. A 2015 report published by the NRF states total merchandise returns accounted for over $260.5 billion in lost sales for US retailers in 2015.
The problem of retail fraud has caused retailers to raise prices for shoppers in order to offset and recover the losses incurred from fraudulent returns. Alternatively, many stores have created stricter return policies such as “no receipt, no return” or imposed return time restrictions such as a 30-day limit on all returns that impact all shoppers.
A certain percentage of returned merchandise must be marked down or discarded in order to sell the product. After being returned, out-of-season clothing may have to be placed on the sale rack, for example. Or retailers may be forced to discard items such as returned lingerie due to sanitary or health reasons.
