Starting on September 2, 2003, 4Kids Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment began distributing 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated TV series to DVD, and originally also to VHS. The latest VHS release occurred on June 7, 2005, while the original run of DVD releases continued until October 21, 2008. Many fans heavily criticized Funimation's erratic release patterns, and while a more traditional seasonal release pattern began in 2007, production ceased following Nickelodeon purchasing the entire TMNT franchise in October 2009. In June 2015, Nickelodeon began once again releasing DVDs of the series. However, they too have begun an erratic release pattern, with several months between volumes and each volume containing only three non-sequential episodes. This guide describes all current and slated DVD releases.
