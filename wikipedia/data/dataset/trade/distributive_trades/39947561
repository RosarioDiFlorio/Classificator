Demand modeling uses statistical methods and business intelligence inputs to generate accurate demand forecasts and effectively address demand variability. Demand modeling is becoming more important because forecasting and inventory management are being complicated by the increasing number of slow moving items, the so–called “long-tail” of the product range, many of which have unpredictable demand patterns in which the typical “normal distribution” assumption used by traditional models is totally inadequate. In these scenarios, successfully managing forecasts and inventories requires advanced demand and inventory modeling technologies in order to reliably support high service levels.
