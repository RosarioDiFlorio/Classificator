Trade marketing is a discipline of marketing that relates to increasing the demand at wholesaler, retailer, or distributor level rather than at the consumer level. However, there is a need to continue with Brand Management strategies to sustain the need at the consumer end. A shopper, who may be the consumer him/herself, is the one who identifies and purchases a product from a retailer. To ensure that a retailer promotes a company's product against competitors', that company must market its product to the retailers as well. Trade marketing might also include offering various tangible/intangible benefits to retailers. The alignment of sales and marketing discipline to profitability can be another explanation for trade marketing.
Trade marketing is the basic idea of marketing your products through the value chain and at the point of sale i.e. the store. Consider it the idea of creating a demand for your products across the channel and before it reaches the consumer. This traditionally exists in a brick and mortar environment and can be argued to be one of the oldest forms of marketing.
