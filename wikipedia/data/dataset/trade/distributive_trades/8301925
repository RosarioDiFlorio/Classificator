In accounting, inventory shrinkage (sometimes shortened to shrinkage or shrink) is when a retailer has fewer items in stock than in the inventory list due to clerical error or goods being damaged, lost, or stolen between the point of manufacture (or purchase from a supplier) and the point of sale. This affects profit: if shrinkage is large, profits decrease. This leads retailers to increase prices to make up for losses, passing the cost of shrinkage onto customers.
In 2008 the retail industry in the United States experienced shrinkage rates of around 1.52% of sales. During the same year, retailers in Europe and Asia Pacific reported average shrinkage of about 1.27% and 1.20% of sales, respectively.
