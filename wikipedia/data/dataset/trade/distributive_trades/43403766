NESiCAxLive (Japanese: ネシカ　クロス　ライブ, Hepburn: Neshika Kurosu Raibu) is a digital distribution system for arcade video games made by Taito Corporation. It is similar to the SEGA ALL.Net game distribution system. The system was first revealed in September 2010 at the 48th Amusement Machine Show in Chiba, Japan, as the Taito Vewlix NESiCA arcade cabinet, and was launched on 9 December 2010. The first game to be released for the system was Arc System Works' BlazBlue: Continuum Shift II.
Currently 8 games are operated as alone running titles and 29 titles as downloadable titles on candy cabinets.
The NESiCAxLive system consists of an arcade system board combined with a dedicated router to access and download games. The system currently works on the Taito Type X2, Taito Type X Zero and Taito Type X3 arcade boards. The connected machines access the Taito NESYS online network to allow arcade operators to download games from Taito's servers directly to the arcade cabinet; previously arcade operators had to purchase new game boards (as well as dispose of old ones) to run a new game. Games can also be downloaded to a local server to allow quicker distribution to machines, as well as allow rapid swapping in and out of games according to player demand. Taito allows arcade operators to download games free, as part of a revenue sharing system, with income split with Taito and the game developer. The system is currently only available in Japan.
Whilst Taito has developed NESiCAxLive and uses it to distribute its own games, it also allows other companies to distribute their games on the system. On its introduction SNK Playmore, Cave, and Arc System Works had agreed to distribute games on the platform.
