1983 was a time when home video players were becoming affordable for use in homes, the price of them having dropped by half in a few years to around US$500. Pre-recorded tapes remained expensive, creating the video rental industry and with rentals sometimes including the player.
It was also a time known as the "format wars" with two major standards Sony's Betamax and JVC's VHS competing for dominance. Consumer camcorders were also gaining popularity with prices dropping below $1000.
