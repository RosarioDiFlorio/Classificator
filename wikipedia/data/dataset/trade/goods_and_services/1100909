LYNX is a bus system run by the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority, serving the greater Orlando, Florida area, Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties with limited service to Polk county. Bus routes are referred to as Links. The standard adult one-way fare is $2 with free single transfers valid for 90 minutes (not valid on the same Link or for round trips). Lynx runs the zero-fare Lymmo Bus (Links 60, 61, 62, and 63) in Downtown Orlando, connecting many downtown destinations to parking and the Lynx Central Station by controlling traffic signals on a three-mile route along a fully separate right-of-way (Link 60) or a combination of separate right-of-way and mixed traffic (Links 61, 62, 63). All Lynx buses (Links), except the Lymmo, have bike racks (2 - 3 bike capacity) for use at no extra charge.
Other LYNX services include, a commuter assistance Vanpool program; ACCESS LYNX paratransit Service; NeighborLink (formerly PickUpLine) community circulators; KnightLYNX, a transportation option on and near the UCF campus that operates on Friday and Saturday nights only; and the Road Rangers sponsored by State Farm roadside assistance program on Interstate 4.
Bus stop signs are designed with a lynx paw in place of the traditional bus stop signs, which show a bus; although, some new signs have been placed, adding the paw to the traditional sign. Also, the route numbers (Links) are usually attached to the bus stop signs.
