Sputnik is a web search engine owned by the Russian state-owned telecommunications company Rostelecom. It markets itself as an engine geared towards "local services". At the end of the week of the launch, it was responsible for 0.01% of the search engine traffic in Russia, compared with 62% for Yandex and 28% for Google. It went through the maximum in February 2016, with 11 thousands hits (compared with 121 million hits of Yandex). In January 2017, Sputnik was the 15th most popular search engine in Russia, with 32,000 times less hits than Yandex. The experts generally consider Sputnik as a failed project and note that it only exists because of the state funding.
