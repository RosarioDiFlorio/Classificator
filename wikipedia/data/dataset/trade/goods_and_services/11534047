The Sydney Observer Magazine, previously known as the Ku-ring-gai Observer, is the North Shore's premium monthly magazine. It is a free publication distributed in the council areas of Ku-ring-gai, Hornsby and Willoughby.
The Sydney Observer Magazine has been part of Kamdha Pty Ltd. since 2003. It is a lifestyle magazine which contains news and current affairs relating to the North Shore and has various sections related to property and finance, health, travel, fashion and beauty, dining, music and theatre, arts and entertainment, puzzles, and a diary of local events.
It contains news related to local items of interest and covers additional topics of broader interest to people within the greater Sydney metropolitan area. In the past, articles have been submitted to the Australian Senate for further discussion.
It is distributed free of charge to households, retail stores, major shopping centres, libraries, and community centres.
In February 2016, Sydney Observer magazine was redesigned.
