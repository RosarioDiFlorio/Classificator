MyRocks is open-source software developed at Facebook in order to use MySQL features with RocksDB implementations. It is based on Oracle MySQL 5.6.
Percona is making MyRocks more accessible to users by bringing it to Percona Server. Starting from version 10.2.5, MariaDB includes MyRocks as an alpha-stage storage engine. 

The library is maintained by the Facebook Database Engineering Team.
