The Massoud Foundation (founded as the Ahmad Shah Massoud Foundation; Dari Persian: بنیاد شهید احمد شاه مسعود) is a non-profit and non-governmental organization operating in Afghanistan. It was established in Kabul in 2003 to preserve and spread the values, leadership, and ideals of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud, the Lion of the Panjshir, who was a founding father of the resistance against the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and then against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1990s until he was assassinated by Al-Qaeda just two days prior to 9/11.
In Afghanistan, the Massoud Foundation has been involved in humanitarian and cultural efforts to improve the living standards of Afghan citizens, increase the literacy rate, and build schools, libraries, and computer labs. The Foundation funds Mandegar Daily, an independent daily newspaper in Afghanistan that advocates for democracy, anti-terrorism, and for the elimination of government corruption and inefficiency. The Foundation has held numerous seminars and conferences in Kabul and London on anti-terrorism, democracy, education, and other political issues that the Afghan government is facing.
