WikiStage is a video platform and a network of event organisers managed by the non-profit WikiStage Association. It aims to create a collaborative video platform for debate. Conferences around the world use the WikiStage platform to share their speakerâ€™s videos. To connect talks with those of other speakers, the videos are grouped into a debate according to their topic. The debate wall allows users to watch and vote for short videos from different sources on the topic in question.
In addition to partnering with conferences around the world, WikiStage allows the members of its community to organise WikiStage branded conferences under the WikiStage license for free. The talks filmed at these conferences are then published on the WikiStage website and YouTube to ensure unlimited, free access. A community of over 100 volunteers in 12 countries is spread over 4 continents to curate the video library.
