SciDev.Net is a not-for-profit organisation that produces news, views and analysis about science and technology in the context of global development. It primarily engages with development professionals, policymakers, researchers, the media and the informed public.
The organisation was founded in 2001 in response to the significant gap in scientific knowledge between rich and poor countries and with the understanding that â€œthose who stand to benefit the most from modern science and technology are also those with the least access to information about it". SciDev.Net seeks to redress this imbalance via its free-to-access website, regional networks and specialist workshops.
SciDev.Net aims to help individuals and organisations apply evidence and insights from science and technology to decision-making in order to have a positive impact on equitable and sustainable development and poverty reduction.
The global edition is based in London and there are six regional desks based in Latin America & Caribbean (Spanish), Middle East and North and West Africa (Arabic), South Asia, South-East Asia & Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa (English and French).
SciDev.Net is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in England and Wales (registered charity number 1089590).
