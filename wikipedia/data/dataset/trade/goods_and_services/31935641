The Printed Blog is a print magazine composed entirely of blogs and other aggregated online content that operates out of its offices in Chicago.
Published monthly, It offers a wide range of content from the web, chosen by a team of staff and guest editors active in the fields of blogging and photography. If it's on the internet, you can find it in The Printed Blog which means that content ranges from music, to sex, to politics, to humanitarian issues, to pop culture commentary, to anything in between.

“Too much of the world is created for the lowest common denominator, and frankly, I’m tired of homogenized, dumbed down content, that I’m expected to enjoy because it was written to appeal to the masses. The Printed Blog is not for the lowest common denominator. If you’re not impacted by our content — by a blog post or photograph — then we haven’t done our jobs. If we don’t lose a few subscribers each time we release an issue, it means that we were gutless and lazy.”
