Batley Grammar School is a co-educational free school located on Carlinghow Hill in Upper Batley, West Yorkshire, England.
The school was founded in 1612 by the Rev. William Lee. An annual founder's day service is held in his memory at Batley Parish Church, as he requested in his will, although it is not held on the date originally specified.
The school (then affectionately known as BGS) selected boys on their performance in the eleven-plus exams, regardless of family background. Following the comprehensivisation of secondary education, the school became independent and entry became restricted to boys whose parents could afford its fees. It was originally a boys' school but introduced girls into the sixth form in 1988 and became co-educational in 1996. More recently, the school has returned to the maintained sector and was one of the first free schools to open in the country.
Batley Grammar School is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.
A Junior and Infants school, named Priestley House (after Joseph Priestley, an old Batelian, see below) is set in the grounds and is also part of the Free School.
