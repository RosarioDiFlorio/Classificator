Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. et al. v. Wikileaks et al. was a lawsuit filed by Bank Julius Baer against the website WikiLeaks.
In early February 2008, Judge Jeffrey White of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California forced Dynadot, the domain registrar of wikileaks.org, to disassociate the site's domain name records with its servers, preventing use of the domain name to reach the site. Initially, the bank only wanted the documents to be removed (WikiLeaks had failed to name a contact person).
The judge's actions roused media and cyber-liberties groups to defend WikiLeaks' rights under the First Amendment and brought renewed scrutiny to the documents the bank hoped to shield.
The judge lifted the injunction and the bank dropped the case on 5 March 2008.
