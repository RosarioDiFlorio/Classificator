Graphite, a free open-source software (FOSS) tool that monitors and graphs the performance of computer systems. Graphite was developed by Orbitz and released as open source software in 2008.
Graphite collects, stores, and displays time-series data in real time.
The tool has three main components:
carbon - a Twisted daemon that listens for time-series data
whisper - a simple database library for storing time-series data (similar in design to RRD)
graphite webapp - A Django webapp that renders graphs on-demand using Cairo
Graphite is used in production by companies such as Booking.com, GitHub, Etsy and Electronic Arts.
