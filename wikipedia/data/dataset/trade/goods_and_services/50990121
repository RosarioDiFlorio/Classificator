The Kijani Commodity Fund is the largest cell within Brighton SPC, a Cayman Islands based fund. The fund had positive returns for investors in 49 of the 51 months it was trading, which was attributed to strategies such as commodity trading arbitrage. It was seized by Cayman authorities for an inability to verify its assets in June 2015.
