Sir Thomas Fremantle School is a Secondary Academy free school that opened in Winslow, Buckinghamshire in September 2013. It was proposed by a group of local parents and educationalists, all keen to improve the quality and choice of available secondary education in north Buckinghamshire. The school opened in the former Winslow Centre, previously the site of Winslow Secondary Modern School. The school is to move into a large purpose built site off Buckingham Road in 2017.
The school is a non-denominational, fully comprehensive school for students between 11 and 19.
Opening with 100 students, the school quickly expanded to around 120 by early 2014 and admitted an additional 80 students in September 2014. In September 2016, numbers stood at 385. The school is named after Sir Thomas Fremantle, a naval officer in the time of and a good friend of Lord Nelson.
The school is divided into three houses, each bearing the name of a ship Sir Thomas Fremantle captained: Neptune, Hussar and Spitfire.
The school has a focus on 3-D printing, and works closely with Black Country Atelier to deliver this.
The school's first headmaster, Mr D J Lyon, was appointed on 1 January 2013. Mr Lyon had previously worked at schools in Northampton and Milton Keynes. The deputy, Mr Neale Pledger has considerable experience in Milton Keynes schools.
