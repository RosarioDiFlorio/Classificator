idiomag is an early product created by idio, a UK-based technology company founded in 2006 by two Warwick Business School graduates, Andrew Davies and Ed Barrow. The idio platform allows publishers and brands to personalise their content and distribute it across multiple platforms, which is intended to improve audience engagement and revenue.
Using this platform, a consumer site is run at idiomag.com, which delivers digital music content to its users, in the form of a daily personalised music magazine. This magazine is viewed through the user’s browser, using the Adobe Flash Player, and can contain the full spectrum of text, images, and video chosen for each reader based on their tastes. The user can then find concert dates, download music, and buy tickets.
The site also provides a widget, allowing the user’s magazine to be delivered on popular social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and Bebo, or on individual blogs. The site aggregates content from a range of sources, both from the mainstream music press and the blogosphere, like a “glossy RSS feed”. Content is selected based on the user’s listening history, either manually entered or drawn from music sites such as Last.fm, Pandora, and iLike.
In 2009, the site released their API, making idiomag's content-delivery model available to web application programmers.
