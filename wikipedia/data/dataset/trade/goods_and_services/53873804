WikiTribune (stylized as WikiTRIBUNE) is a news website in which professional journalists research and report news stories alongside volunteers who curate articles by proofreading, fact-checking, suggesting changes, and adding sources. Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, announced the site in April 2017 as a for-profit site, not affiliated with Wikipedia or its support organisation, the Wikimedia Foundation.
"This will be the first time that professional journalists and citizen journalists will work side-by-side as equals writing stories as they happen, editing them live as they develop and at all times backed by a community checking and rechecking all facts", said Wales. Wales intends for the project to help fight fake news online; he was reportedly motivated to address this problem after hearing the Counselor to the U.S. president, Kellyanne Conway, use the expression "alternative facts" during an interview in January 2017.
Initial crowdfunding for the site was completed in May 2017 for a public launch expected in the same year. In August 2017, Peter Bale was announced as the first editor of the site on their temporary publishing platform at Medium.com. They followed up this announcement with their first teaser article posted to Medium on September 18.
The site opened to the public on October 30, 2017, with a focus on "political, business and economic news, bolstered by weekly in-depth articles".
