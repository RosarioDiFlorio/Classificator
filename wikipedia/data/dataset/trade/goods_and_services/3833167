Latin America Connexions is a free bi-monthly newspaper published in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, founded in 1986.
Published in a bilingual format of English and Spanish, the paper is an alternative, volunteer-run collective which "support[s] movements which resist the current global system of economic injustice and social, political and cultural oppression."
Contents include news articles letters, and reviews of labour and political issues - particularly, as noted by the title, issues related to Latin America and the relationship with Canada.
Latin America Connexions ceased to publish in 2007.
