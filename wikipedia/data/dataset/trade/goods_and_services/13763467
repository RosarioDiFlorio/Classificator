The Gaudie is a Union Affiliated, student-run newspaper at the University of Aberdeen covering campus and local news. It has been in circulation since 1934 and is currently free-of-charge. It aims to print unbiased, student-focussed articles.
The Gaudie is partially funded by Aberdeen University Students' Association, and partially by its own advertising revenue. It currently consists of twenty four pages split into the sections News, Features, Opine, Puzzles, Satire, Life and Style, Arts, Listings and Sports.
Between 2012 and 2014, The Gaudie saw a raft of changes. The website was given a full redesign (2012/13) and released alongside an app (2014). The paper itself has also had a major redesign for the Graduation edition. Since then, each edition has had some notable minor changes. It is also now a member of the SPA.
