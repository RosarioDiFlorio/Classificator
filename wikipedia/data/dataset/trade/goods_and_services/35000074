IMOD is an open-source, cross-platform suite of modeling, display and image processing programs used for 3D reconstruction and modeling of microscopy images with a special emphasis on electron microscopy data. IMOD has been used across a range of scales from macromolecule structures  to organelles  to whole cells  and can also be used for optical sections. Included in IMOD are tools for image reconstruction, image segmentation, 3D mesh modeling and analysis of 2D and 3D data.
IMOD was developed at the Boulder Laboratory for 3-D Electron Microscopy of Cells. IMOD was first released in 1995, is free to download and use for any purpose.
