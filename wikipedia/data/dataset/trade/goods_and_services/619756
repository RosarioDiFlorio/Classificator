Pegasus Mail is a donationware (previously freeware), proprietary, email client that is developed and maintained by David Harris and his team. It was originally released in 1990 for internal and external mail on NetWare networks with MS-DOS clients, and was subsequently ported to Microsoft Windows, which became the most widely used version. A version for Apple Macintosh also used to be available.
