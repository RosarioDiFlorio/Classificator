Cura is a 3D printer slicing application. It was created by David Braam; he was later employed by Ultimaker to maintain the software. Cura is available under LGPLv3 license. It was initially released under the open source Affero General Public License version 3 but on 28 September 2017 the license was changed to LGPLv3. Development is hosted on GitHub. Cura is the preferred slicer software for Ultimaker 3d printers, but can be used with other printers as well.
