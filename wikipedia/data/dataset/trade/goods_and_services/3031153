Metroshuttle is a free bus system that operates in Greater Manchester. The system was first introduced in the Manchester city centre in 2002, with three routes linking the city's major thoroughfares and stations with its main commercial, financial and cultural districts.
In later years, similar services were introduced in Stockport and Bolton. An Oldham service ran temporarily in 2012 until a Metrolink line was constructed through the town.
