Tacoma Link is a 1.6-mile (2.6 km) light rail line located in Tacoma, Washington. Completed in 2003, this streetcar line connects the downtown core to the Tacoma Dome Station combined parking garage and transit hub. The service is currently free of charge, but a $1.50 fare is planned to be collected after the opening of the Hilltop extension in 2022.
