xdelta is a command line program for delta encoding, which generates the difference between two files. This is similar to diff and patch, but it is targeted for binary files and does not generate human readable output.
It was first released in 1997. The developer of xdelta is Joshua MacDonald and the program is currently maintained by him. The algorithm of xdelta1 was based on the algorithm of rsync, which is developed by Andrew Tridgell, and using smaller block size than rsync.
xdelta3 can generate standardized VCDIFF format, and it realized the compatibility among other delta encoding software which supports the VCDIFF format. It runs on Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows. xdelta can handle up to 264 byte files, and it is suitable for large backups.
