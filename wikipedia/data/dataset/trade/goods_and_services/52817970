The Studentenreisproduct is a form of free public transport for students in the Netherlands. Introduced in 1991, the system is a solution for students who don't live near their university or college. The central government intends for this to stimulate teenagers in the development of their education.
Studentenreisproduct is loaded as a product on the OV-chipkaart, a contactless travel card.
Students can choose either free transport on weekdays and a 40% discount on the weekend, or vice versa.
