Al-Madinah School is a co-educational Muslim faith based free school for pupils aged 4 to 11 located in Derby, Derbyshire, England, and run by the Al-Madinah Education Trust. First opened in 2012 as an all-through (ages 4 to 16) school, it has made headlines for its strict Islamic practices, alleged discrimination to female pupils and staff, financial irregularities and nepotistic practices. Following government concerns about the quality of teaching at the school, it was placed in special measures in October 2013. In February 2014 Education Minister Lord Nash announced that secondary education at the school would cease in the summer of 2014.
