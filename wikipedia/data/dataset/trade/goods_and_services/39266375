The PCGamingWiki is a collaboratively edited, free Internet encyclopedia focused on collecting game behavior data (such as save locations and startup parameters) to optimizing gameplay and fixing issues found in PC video games. Intended fixes and optimizations range from simple cutscene removals to modifications that allow for wide-screen resolutions and more. The wiki runs on MediaWiki software and was created by Andrew Tsai. The site was founded on February 9, 2012. As of March 2017, the PCGamingWiki has more than 13,000 registered users and 15,000 content pages. Since its inception, the PCGamingWiki has been featured on numerous gaming focused websites including Kotaku, Destructoid, and Rock Paper Shotgun. It regularly receives more than 10,000 unique page views a day.
Andrew was motivated to create the site due to his experiences seeing countless people on forums asking for help with the computer games LA Noire and Titan Quest.
