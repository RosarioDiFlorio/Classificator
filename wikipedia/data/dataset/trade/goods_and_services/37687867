The Strathclyde Telegraph is a student newspaper which was founded in 1960 and is edited, written and produced by students at the University of Strathclyde. It is the University of Strathclyde’s only student newspaper and is produced on campus by students from start to finish. It aims to report on the activities of Union groups and elected officers and in so doing inform Strathclyde students about their Union as well as topics of wider concern and national significance.
There are eight editions of the newspaper published per year- a new edition is published each month of the academic year (from September until April), including a special Fresher’s edition published in September.
