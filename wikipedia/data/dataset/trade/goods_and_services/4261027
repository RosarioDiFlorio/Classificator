V was a Finnish free-of-charge magazine launched in 2006 aimed at the young adult generation of 20- to 30-year-olds. Its content was mostly similar to other similar magazines such as City, NÃ¶jesguiden and Metropoli. Because of low popularity, V was discontinued in 2007 as a separate magazine and incorporated into Metro.
