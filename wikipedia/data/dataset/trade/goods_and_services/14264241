In computing, Ceph (pronounced  or ) is a free-software storage platform, implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, and provides interfaces for object-, block- and file-level storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available.
Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant, using commodity hardware and requiring no specific hardware support. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.
On April 21, 2016, the Ceph development team released "Jewel", the first Ceph release in which CephFS is considered stable. The CephFS repair and disaster recovery tools are feature-complete (snapshots, multiple active metadata servers and some other functionality is disabled by default).
The August, 2017 release (codename "Luminous") introduced the production-ready BlueStore storage format which avoids many shortcomings of the old filesystem-based filestore, providing better latency and additional storage features.
