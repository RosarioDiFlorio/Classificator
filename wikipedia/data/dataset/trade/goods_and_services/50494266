PrecisionFDA (stylized precisionFDA) is a cloud-based next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data platform developed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was designed as part of President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015. The platform allows researchers to upload and compare data against reference genomes, bioinformatics pipelines, and genomic data. Users may also use the service to verify their genetic tests against reference genomes. The platform's code is open source and available on GitHub.
