Rigveda Wiki is a Korean Otaku wiki which started on March 1, 2007. As of July 17, 2013, it had more than 200,000 articles, making it the fourth-largest Korean-language wiki, following Korean Wikipedia, Korean Wiktionary and the Namu Wiki, forked of Rigveda Wiki. It focuses on a wide range of topics. 
On August 2, 2013, Rigveda Wiki opened its beta service, and the layout of the website was changed. Since then, people have been able to use Rigveda Wiki from mobile devices.
Their server had been offline since April 25, 2015 because of license trouble resulting from a conflict between CCL and the site system. On May 17, 2015, the server came online again, but only owners and registered users could contribute.
After April 2015, almost all users left Rigveda Wiki and went to Namu Wiki, which is one of the biggest forked wikis in the world, forked from the Rigveda Wiki. Their license was updated in June 2015 to mitigate the allegations about the license.
