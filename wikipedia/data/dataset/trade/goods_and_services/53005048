The Resistance Manual is a Wiki-style site that crowdsources information and resources to resist the Trump/GOP agenda in America. It was created by activists Samuel Sinyangwe, DeRay McKesson, Johnetta Elzie, Brittany Packnett, and law student Aditi Juneja. The manual includes information on policy areas such as immigration, policing, mass incarceration, and disability rights, and tracks Trump's executive orders and various controversies including Russian hacking during the election. In the days since it launched, the manual had over 400 pieces of content contributed to it from users, and been featured in NBC News, Huffington Post, MSNBC, International Business Times, The Fader, and as one of Teen Vogue's "10 Ways to Continue The Fight for Women's Rights."
