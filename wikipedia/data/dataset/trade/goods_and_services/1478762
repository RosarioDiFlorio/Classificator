The Cambridge Student, commonly known as TCS, is one of Cambridge University's student newspapers (Varsity and The Tab are the others). The newspaper is owned and published by the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) but is editorially independent.
The paper was founded in October 1999 and has since continued to produce a weekly print run of 10,000 copies during university term time. TCS is also downloaded around 10,000 times per issue.
The paper boasts several Guardian Student Media Awards, and has interviewed public figures including United Nations Weapons Inspector Hans Blix, director Ridley Scott, politician Ian Paisley, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner and journalist David Frost.
TCS was the first newspaper to break the story of the threatened closure of Cambridge's architecture department, which later featured in the national press.
Since then, it made national headlines with news of Animal rights abuses at the University. The newspaper's photography of the tuition fee riots also won plaudits. In March 2011 the paper became embroiled in controversy when its Editor, Philip Brook, forged a letter insinuating unfounded sexual allegations against a fictional fellow at St. John’s.
In April 2016, TCS announced that CUSU was preparing to pass a budget which would cut its print funding, and turn it into an online newspaper, with occasional print editions. Sections of an internal letter, leaked to Varsity, said that CUSU had ended up in “difficult situation” financially, which lead to the need for cuts. The budget was ratified at a meeting of CUSU’s council on 16 May 2016, bringing TCS’s print run to an end.
