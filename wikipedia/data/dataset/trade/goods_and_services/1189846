Rip It Up is a bi-monthly New Zealand music magazine. Started in June 1977 as a free monthly giveaway, it grew rapidly, with its monthly print run reaching 30,000 copies by the mid 1980s. The new magazine arrived at an opportune moment, with the musical revolutions of punk rock and new wave arriving in New Zealand in the first few years of its existence - two genres which the new magazine was to champion, alongside local music trends such as the Dunedin Sound. For many years it was unequalled as a New Zealand source of information on rock music. The magazine's back-catalogue also provides an unrivalled reference for information about the history of New Zealand's rock music.
The brainchild of Murray Cammick and Alistair Dougal, and sister title to Creme magazine, Rip It Up was circulated free via record shops for fourteen years as a music rag produced on a meagre budget. In 1991 the quality of the publication improved, making the transition from newsprint to a gloss medium, a direct result of the NZ$2 charge. Today the publication is a bi-monthly magazine that delivers relevant music features and reviews that extend past music into other media such as television, gaming and books.
