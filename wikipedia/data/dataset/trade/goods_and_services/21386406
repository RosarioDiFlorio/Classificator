Heroes Wiki is a wiki-powered reference site for NBC's science fiction drama Heroes. Launched on October 10, 2006, the site uses MediaWiki software to maintain a user-created database of information. Heroes Wiki is supported by revenue from advertising, part of which is donated to various charities. As of June 28, 2010, the site contained over 5,500 articles created and edited by approximately 9,400 registered users, with over 157 million page views.
On October 18, 2008, Heroes Wiki announced that it had officially partnered with NBC. NBC now directs those interested in a wiki on Heroes to Heroes Wiki, and directly funds the site in exchange for on-site advertisements. The show has another wiki, a site from Wikia, also entitled Heroes Wiki.
