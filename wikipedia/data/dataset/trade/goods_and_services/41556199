The Comité National de Secours et d'Alimentation ("National Relief and Food Committee"; Dutch: Nationaal Hulp- en Voedingscomité), abbreviated to CNSA, was a relief organization created in 1914 to distribute humanitarian aid to civilians in German-occupied Belgium during World War I. It was directed by the Belgian financier Émile Francqui. The CNSA acted as the network by which the aid brought in by the international Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB) could be distributed within Belgium itself.
