Baike.com (Chinese: 互动百科; pinyin: Hùdòng Bǎikē), formerly Hudong and Hoodong, is a for-profit social network in China, including the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia/news website. It is China's largest wiki site, using paid advertising, with over 7 million articles and more than 5 million volunteers, as of April 2013. However, Baike.com is a news/neologism encyclopedia, and hence, it does not restrict articles to only long-term, sourced text with balanced point-of-view content. The contributors agree to release their writings with perpetual royalty-free license to publish their content, but it is not free for re-use on other websites. As of January 2017, it had more than 16 million articles.
