The Open Goldberg Variations is a non-profit project that created a high quality studio recording and typeset score of Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations, and placed them directly into the public domain. By releasing an entirely free version of the classical masterpiece, the project aims to change a common problem: in theory, classical music is a common property due to advanced age, yet it is hard to find quality recordings of it online due to copyrighted restrictions on the performances. Open Goldberg Variations cemented a free, quality version into the public domain, making the music available for everyone and everything, including schools, universities, musicians, private persons and even commercial productions.
To ensure a high quality, the typeset was produced using open-source technology and an open peer reviewing process that allows everyone to edit the script and suggest improvements. Open Goldberg Variations embraces open standards and coined the term "Open Source Bach" in reference to the ideals of Open Source Software.
The score and the recording were released into the public domain using the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license tool on May 28, 2012.
