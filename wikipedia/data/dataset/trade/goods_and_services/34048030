rara was a music streaming service that operated between December 2011 and March 2015. It offered ad-free, on-demand music streaming from a range of major and independent record labels, including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, EMI Music and Warner Music Group, global rights agency Merlin and independent digital distributors The Orchard, INgrooves Fontana, Believe Digital, [PIAS] and VidZone Digital Media.
Launched in December 2011 by British company rara Media Group Limited, the service featured an initial music catalogue of approximately 10 million tracks. As of October 2013, the catalogue offered 22 million tracks and was available in 32 countries. The system was accessible on both PC and Mac via the web with apps for Windows 8, iOS, and Android. A rara "web" subscription provided unlimited music streaming via the web to PC and Mac while a "premium" subscription enabled access to rara mobile apps as well as offline access to music.
In between February and March 2015, rara stopped accepting new subscribers and announced that the service was up for sale. Music streaming stopped on March 29.
