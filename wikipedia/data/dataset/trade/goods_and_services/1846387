Password Safe is a free and open-source password manager program for use with Microsoft Windows.
A beta version is also available for Ubuntu (including the Kubuntu and Xubuntu derivatives), Debian and FreeBSD operating systems. A Java-based version is also available on SourceForge. On its page user can find links to unofficial releases running under Android, BlackBerry and other mobile OS.
The port for macOS and iOS, pwSafe (not to be confused with "pwsafe password database", a compatible unix commandline program), is compatible with Password Safe files. It uses iCloud or Dropbox to keep password databases synced between iOS devices and computers.
