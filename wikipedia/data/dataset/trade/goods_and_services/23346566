The Cardiff Big Weekend took place annually from 1994 to 2011 as part of the Cardiff Festival organised by Cardiff Council. Billed as the UK’s biggest free outdoor music festival, it offers three days of quality live music and entertainment. Alongside the live music stage runs the UK’s largest travelling funfair around Cardiff's Civic Centre.
In 2017 the Big Weekend was resurrected and integrated with Cardiff's LGBT Pride parade to form Pride Cymru's Big Weekend.
