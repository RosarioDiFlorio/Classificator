Ssamzie Sound Festival is an annual indie music festival held in South Korea since 1999. The first version of the festival was held in Yonsei University, with 20 local bands performing. The festival started out as a free one-day-festival, but as the festival got more attention it grew. The "Sumun Gosu" is gateway to success in a career for Korean indie band.
