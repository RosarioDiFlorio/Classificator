The Signpost (formerly The Wikipedia Signpost) is the English Wikipedia's online newspaper. Managed by the Wikipedia community, it is published online with contributions from Wikipedia editors. The newspaper reports on the Wikipedia community and events related to Wikipedia, including Arbitration Committee rulings, Wikimedia Foundation issues, and other Wikipedia-related projects.
It was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedian Michael Snow. Originally called The Wikipedia Signpost, the newspaper's title was later shortened to The Signpost. Snow continued as a contributor until his February 2008 appointment to the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees.
Former editor-in-chief, The ed17, noted that during his tenure from 2012 to 2015, the publication expanded its scope to report on the wider Wikimedia movement in addition to Wikipedia and its community. In January 2015, Wikipedia editors Gamaliel and Go Phightins! succeeded The ed17 as editors-in-chief. After reporting on the changes to European freedom of panorama law in June 2015, The Signpost was consulted by a number of publications for further information.
The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in Sociological Forum, the social-movements journal Interface, and the New Review of Academic Librarianship, and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College. It has been covered by The New York Times, The Register, Nonprofit Quarterly, and Heise Online. The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading for ambitious new Wikipedia editors.
