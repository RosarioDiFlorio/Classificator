Glad Tidings (full title: Glad Tidings of the Kingdom of God) is a free Bible magazine published monthly by the Christadelphians (Brethren in Christ). The magazine was launched in 1884.
The stated aims of the magazine are:

to encourage study of the Bible as God's inspired message to men;
to call attention to the Divine offer of forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ;
to warn men and women that soon Christ will return to Earth as judge and ruler of Godâ€™s worldwide Kingdom.

To this end the magazine contains articles such as A Closer Look at Bible Prophecy, Jews and Arabs to Find Lasting Peace and Three Steps to a Happier Life.
