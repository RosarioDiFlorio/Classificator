Conservapedia  is an English-language wiki encyclopedia project written from an American conservative point of view. The website was started in 2006 by American homeschool teacher and attorney Andrew Schlafly, son of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, to counter what he perceived as a liberal bias present in Wikipedia. It uses editorials and a wiki-based system to generate content.
Examples of Conservapedia's ideology include its accusations against and strong criticism of former U.S. President Barack Obama, the Democratic Party, evolution, and Wikipedia's alleged liberal bias, as well as views of the theory of relativity as promoting moral relativism, claims of a proven link between abortion and breast cancer, praise for a number of Republican politicians, support of celebrities and artistic works that it views as promoting moral standards in line with Christian family values, and acceptance of fundamentalist Christian doctrines such as Young Earth creationism. Conservapedia's "Conservative Bible Project" is a crowd-sourced version of the Bible which Conservapedia claims will be "free of corruption by liberal untruths".
The site has received negative reactions from the mainstream media, as well as from notable political figures, including commentators and journalists, and has been criticized by liberal and conservative critics alike for bias and inaccuracies.
