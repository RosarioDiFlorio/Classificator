jGRASP is a lightweight development environment created specifically to provide automatic generation of software visualizations to improve the comprehensibility of software. It produces static visualizations of source code structure and visualizations of data structures at runtime.
jGRASP is implemented in Java, and runs on all platforms with a Java Virtual Machine (Java version 1.6 or higher). GRASP (Linux, UNIX) and pcGRASP (Windows) were written in C/C++, whereas jGRASP is written in Java. The "j" in jGRASP essentially means it run on the JVM. The jGRASP web site offers downloads for Windows, Mac OS, and as a generic ZIP file suitable for Linux and other systems.
For languages other than Java, jGRASP is a useful source code editor. It can be configured to work with most free and commercial compilers for any programming language.
