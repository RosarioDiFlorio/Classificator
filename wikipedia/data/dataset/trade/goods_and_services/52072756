Stagebill was a monthly U.S. magazine for theatregoers. Most copies of the publication were printed for particular productions and distributed at the door as the show's program. It was launched as a direct rival to the highly successful monthly Playbill. But after five years of head-to-head tough competition with Playbill, Stagebill became insolvent and was acquired by its rival who also kept the Stagebill trademark.
