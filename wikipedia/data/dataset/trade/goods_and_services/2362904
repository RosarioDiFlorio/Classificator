Clemson Area Transit, a zero-fare bus line known locally as CAT or the "CAT Bus", it is the most frequently used transit system in South Carolina. Areas with bus service include Clemson University, the City of Clemson, the County of Anderson, City of Seneca and the Towns of Central and Pendleton. The fare-free system is made possible by federal grants and matching funds from the city and University. CAT now boasts the most modern fleet of buses east of the Mississippi River, including 5 new 40' long NOVA low-floor buses, and a 62' long articulated NOVA bus dubbed the "Bendy Bus"- the first and only articulated bus currently operated in South Carolina.
Utilizing multiple routes and lines, CAT Buses help shuttle students from satellite parking to the heart of campus, transport citizens and students from campus or downtown to surrounding neighborhoods and apartment complexes, and move travelers from the Clemson area to surrounding communities.
The service is jointly operated by the City of Clemson and Clemson University.
