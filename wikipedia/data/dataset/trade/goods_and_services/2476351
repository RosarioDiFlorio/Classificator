Exeposé is the official student-run newspaper of the University of Exeter. With an estimated print circulation of around 3,500. Exeposé is free and published fortnightly during term time. Its sections include news, features, lifestyle, science, and sport, with review sections covering films, music, arts and literature, games, and technology.
Exeposé is compiled by a team of around 46 section editors, two photographers, a publicity officer and a technical manager, headed by four editors, two print and two online, and two deputies. It was the winner of the NUS Student Publication of the Year 2008 and is used as a forum for reportage and debate of both national and student-related issues. As of the 2006–2007 academic year it became a full colour fortnightly paper available to all students at the Streatham and St. Luke's campuses. From 2010 onwards it has increased online presence through Twitter and Facebook as well as online viewing platforms such as Issuu.com. In September 2012 Exeposé launched its own website, after the now-defunct Xmedia Online site had stopped operating as a news service.
