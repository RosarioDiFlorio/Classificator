English State-funded schools provide education to pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 without charge. Approximately 93% of English schoolchildren attend approximately 20,000 such schools. There are a number of categories of English state-funded schools including academy schools; community schools; faith schools; foundation schools, free schools (essentially academy schools established since 2011 including but not limited to 'studio schools' and University technical colleges; free schools don't have to follow the national curriculum); a small number of state boarding schools; and 3 of the 15 City Technology Colleges established in the 1980s still remain (12 have converted to academy schools). In 2011, about 7,000 (one third) of English state-funded schools were faith schools; ie. affiliated with religious groups, most often from the Church of England (approximately 2/3 of faith schools), or the Roman Catholic Church (just under a third). There were 42 Jewish, 12 Muslim, 3 Sikh and 1 Hindu faith schools. These faith schools include sub-categories such as faith-academy schools, voluntary aided schools, and voluntary controlled schools: most voluntary controlled schools are faith schools.
All of these are funded through national and local taxation. A number of state-funded secondary schools are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects in which the school specialises. State schools may request payment from parents for extracurricular activities such as swimming lessons and field trips, provided these charges are voluntary.
