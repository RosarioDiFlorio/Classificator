The Donauinselfest (German for Danube Island Festival) is an open-air free music festival taking place annually at Donauinsel in Vienna, Austria. It usually takes place in mid or end of June. Only in 2008, the event was scheduled in September in order to prevent clashing with the European Football Championship, which was co-hosted by Austria. With over 3 million visitors in 3 days, it's the biggest open-air music festival of the world .
