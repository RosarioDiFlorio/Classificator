VSee is a proprietary low-bandwidth, group video chat and screen-sharing software tool. It came out of a Stanford University PhD project addressing the problem of making virtual teamwork easy and conveying trust over video.
The service allows multiple users in various locations to communicate in real-time by video and audio. Its interface is able to concurrently display video faces and allow users annotate on shared screen content. VSee sends video at rates as low as 50 kbit/s and is capable of real-time video communication over 3G cellular networks.
VSee is based in Sunnyvale, California with remote staff located worldwide.
