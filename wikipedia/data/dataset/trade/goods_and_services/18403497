The Gene Wiki is a wiki that aims to describe the relationships and functions of all human genes. It was established to transfer information from scientific resources to Wikipedia stub articles.
The Gene Wiki project also initiated publication of gene-specific review articles in the journal Gene, together with the editing of the gene-specific pages in Wikipedia.
