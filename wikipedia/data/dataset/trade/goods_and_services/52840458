Mastodon is a federated social network, with similar microblogging features to Twitter, but administrated as a decentralized federation of independently operated servers running open source software. Users belong to a single Mastodon server, known as an "instance", but can communicate with users on other instances as well. Users post short messages, called toots for others to read, subject to the completely adjustable privacy settings of the user and their particular instance. The service seeks to distinguish itself from Twitter through its orientation towards small communities and community-based, rather than top-down, moderation. Like Twitter, Mastodon supports direct, private messages between users, but unlike "tweets" posted on Twitter, Mastodon "toots" can be private to the user, private to the user's followers, public on a specific instance, or public across a network of instances. The network of federated Mastodon instances forms one part of the Fediverse, a federated network that includes servers running any social network software that uses OStatus.
The Mastodon mascot is a brown or grey Proboscidean sometimes depicted using a tablet or smartphone.
