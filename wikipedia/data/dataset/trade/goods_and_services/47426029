Onya Magazine is an online Australian news, culture and lifestyle magazine. Founded by Editor-in-Chief Sandi Sieger in 2009, Onya showcases the heart and spirit of Australia, with the aim of bringing real Australian issues and achievements into the online media landscape. The free online publication attracts an average readership of 30,000 individuals a month, and covers a broad range of topics including Arts, Politics, Fashion and Travel.
Onya Magazine was founded in 2009, out of a discontent with Australia's representation in the then current online media-scape. Out of her passion to present the world with an example of an authentic Australia, Sieger created a magazine that would serve to rectify the problem. Onya employs journalists from across the country, resulting in a publication that discriminates not between city, state or territory, providing insight into the events and achievements of the nation as a whole.
