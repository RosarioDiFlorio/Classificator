Ethos is a 2011 documentary film directed and written by Pete McGrain and hosted by Woody Harrelson. The main point of the film is to encourage people to engage in ethical consumerism.
The film uses many video interview segments from other films at length, including the Zeitgeist movies and, predominantly, The Corporation.
Hosted by twice Oscar nominated actor and activist Woody Harrelson, Ethos lifts the lid on a Pandora’s box of systemic issues that guarantee failure in almost every aspect of our lives; from the environment to democracy and our own personal liberty: from terrifying conflicts of interests in politics to unregulated corporate power, to a media in the hands of massive conglomerates, and a military industrial complex that virtually owns our representatives. With interviews from some of today’s leading thinkers and source material from the finest documentary film makers of our times Ethos examines and unravels these complex relationships, and offers a solution, a simple but powerful way for you to change this system.
