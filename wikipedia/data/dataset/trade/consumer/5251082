A gripe site is a type of website devoted to the critique and or mockery of a person, place, politician, corporation, or institution. They are also known as "complaint" or "sucks" sites. The Internet provides a low-cost public platform for anyone, even of modest means, to reach a global audience via a "gripe" website. The web gives ordinary individuals the opportunity to publicly criticise the rich and powerful, including multinational corporations.
The following definition of a "gripe site" is from comments by an American lawyer Paul Levy, published online by Public Citizen: "A 'gripe site' is a web site established to criticize an institution such as a corporation, union, government body, or political figure. Not surprisingly, powerful institutions often do not take kindly to being criticized, and they have invented a variety of ways to try to suppress the speech of their adversaries."
In an attempt to shut down a gripe site, companies have sued the gripe site owner alleging defamation, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, libel, and copyright infringement.
