TTXGP are the official promoters of FIM eRoadRacing, the world's premier electric motorsport race series. Founded by Azhar Hussain MBE in 2008, TTXGP started life as the first zero-carbon, clean-emission race to take place at the Isle of Man TT as teams from around the globe raced electric motorbikes.
TTXGP then grew to become a world championship before the company took up the official role as promoters of FIM eRoad Racing when TTXGP and FIM e-Power joined forces in 2013.
