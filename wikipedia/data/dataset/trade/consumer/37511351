The Federation of Danish Motorists (Danish: Forenede Danske Motorejere, abbreviated FDM) is an organisation created in 1909 as a spin-off from the Danish automotive interests magazine Motor (Danish for Engine), which was published since 1906. With the exception of 2009, FDM has had a rising number of members since its creation, and in 2010 had 238,000 members.
The organisation offers both technical and legal assistance and advice to its members, and has taken several legal cases to court on behalf of its members, covering seat malfunctions, parking fines and used car sales.
