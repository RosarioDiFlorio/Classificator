Motorcycle Outreach is a charitable non-profit organisation which works to introduce effective healthcare delivery in remote areas of developing countries. Motorcycle Outreach was inspired by Riders for Health and applies the best practices from that organisation's success to countries outside the African continent.
Motorcycle Outreach (MoR) supports an established project in East Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia. Health for All (HfA) provides primary healthcare transport for a catchment area of over fifty thousand people living in over fifty villages.
Healthcare delivery by motorcycle has significantly improved the general health of the population in the areas served.
