Dugald Semple (1884 â€” 1964), was a Scottish advocate of "simple living", a naturalist, prolific author, and fruitarian. He is sometimes credited with cofounding the vegan movement in 1944 (with Dorothy and Donald Watson and other friends) without using the term 'vegan'. Semple's mother hailed from a farm near Beith, and his father worked as a tailor. He was born in Johnstone near Paisley, Scotland. Cathie Amos was his wife who predeceased him, dying of heart failure in 1941, Dugald died in Fairlie. They had no children, although Cathie had a son named Ian who was killed in World War I.
