The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC, stands for French “Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs”) is an umbrella consumers' group, founded in 1962. Based in Brussels, Belgium, it brings together 42 European consumer organisations from 31 countries (EU, EEA and applicant countries).
BEUC represents its members and defends the interests of consumers in the decision process of the Institutions of the European Union, acting as the “consumer voice in Europe”. BEUC does not deal with consumers’ complaints as it is the role of its national member organisations.
The organisation is funded by an EU grant, its member fees and other specific projects (see “External links”). In 2010, the operational budget of BEUC amounted to €2.9m. In 2012, it reached €3,160,000. In 2012, the EU funding represented 43% of the operational BEUC budget.
BEUC has subscribed to the European Union’s Transparency Register.
