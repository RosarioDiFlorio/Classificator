The National Board for Consumer Disputes (Swedish: Allmänna reklamationsnämnden, ARN) is a Swedish government agency that answers to the Ministry of Integration and Gender Equality. The agency is headquartered in Stockholm. Its main task is to issue non-binding recommendations on the resolution of disputes between consumers and business operators. A person can, free of charge, file complaints against a company. If the company does not follow the recommendation from ARN, the consumer has the possibility to take the matter to court.
