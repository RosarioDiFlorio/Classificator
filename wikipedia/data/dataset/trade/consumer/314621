Snog is a band that was formed by Australian musician David Thrussell, along with fellow art school friends Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke in 1989. The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to "kissing and cuddling," and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell also records as Black Lung, which started as a brand to release extra Snog recordings.
