The Federation of European Motorcyclists (FEM) was a motorcycling advocacy group based in Brussels, Belgium. It was formed in 1988 by representatives of various national motorcyclists' representative organisations at a meeting in Strasbourg which followed the 'Eurodemo' of that year, a major demonstration by motorcyclists against what they perceived to be anti-biker European legislation. FEM's first General Secretary was the Briton Frank Pearson who served in the post until 1992 when he was succeeded by another Briton, Simon Milward. The Federation of European Motorcyclists merged with the European Motorcyclists' Association on 10 January 1998 to form the Federation of European Motorcyclists Associations (FEMA).
