Sustainable consumption (SC) shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms sustainable production and sustainable development. Sustainable consumption as part of sustainable development is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against sustainability challenges such as climate change, famines or environmental pollution.
Sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as:
Effective use of resources, and minimisation of waste and pollution
Use of renewable resources within their capacity for renewal
Fuller product life-cycles
Intergenerational and intragenerational equity
