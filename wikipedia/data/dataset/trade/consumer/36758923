Can't Pay? Won't Pay! (Italian: Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!, also translated We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay! and Low Pay? Don't Pay!) is play originally written in Italian by Dario Fo. Regarded as Fo's best-known play internationally after Morte accidentale di un anarchico, it had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.
Considered a Marxist, political farce, it is one of Fo's most famous plays. A comedy about consumer backlash against high prices, it was written by Fo in 1974.
It was first translated into English in 1975 by Lino Pertile. A North American English-language adaptation of the play was created by R. G. Davies around 1984. The American premiere was performed by the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
The title of the original English translation, Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, has passed into the English language.
