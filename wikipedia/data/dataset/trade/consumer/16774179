Saint Pharmutius, according to The Prologue from Ochrid, was the spiritual mentor of Venerable John the Hermit of Armenia circa the fourth century. Pharmutius' holiness was such that angels brought him his daily bread, which in Christian love he shared with his hermit brother John who lived in strict seclusion.
Saint Pharmutius is remembered along with John the Hermit by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 29 March.
