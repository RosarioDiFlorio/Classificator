Thiruvalluvar, also known as Valluvar, was a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher. He is best known for Tirukkuṛaḷ, a collection of couplets on ethics, political and economical matters, and love. The text is considered as one of the finest works of the Tamil literature.
Much of the information about Thiruvalluvar comes from legendary accounts, and little is known with certainty about his family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He lived in present-day Tamil Nadu state of India, and his flourit is dated variously from 4th century BCE to 7th century CE based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings.
