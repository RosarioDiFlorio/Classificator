The Association for Urban Mobility on Bicycle (in Portuguese Associação pela Mobilidade Urbana em Bicicleta, known by its acronym MUBi) is a Portuguese cyclists association whose aims are to promote the bicycle and other active means of transportation in urban areas, as well as sustainable mobility. MUBi was legally established on the 22nd of June, 2009 and it has influenced and worked with the parliamentarians for the revision of the traffic code in Portugal that took place in 2013, in order to make it more respectful to more vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Other than that, MUBi has kickstarted a movement called "Friday by Bike" (Sexta de Bicicleta, in Portuguese), whose goal is to encourage new users to use the bicycle at least once per week on their daily errands.
MUBi is also a full member of the European Cyclists' Federation supporting as well the Critical Mass cycling event.
