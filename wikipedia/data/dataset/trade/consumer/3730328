A laundry ball or washing ball is a product that is promoted as a substitute for laundry detergent. Producers of laundry balls often make pseudoscientific claims about how these balls work and exaggerate the extent of their benefits.
In the US as of 1998 the product was often sold on home shopping channels or by participants in multilevel marketing, although this is not the case in all countries.
While many individuals report that these balls work, most test results show them to be similar to or less effective than washing in water without any detergent. Most of the effect can be attributed to the mechanical effect of the ball or to using hot water instead of cold water.
The US Federal Trade Commission has taken action against some of the manufacturers of these products because of their misleading claims. Consumer organizations from several countries have recommended against buying this type of product.
