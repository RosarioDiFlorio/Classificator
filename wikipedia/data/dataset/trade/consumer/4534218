Everyone in Silico is a 2002 post-cyberpunk novel written by Jim Munroe. It was promoted partly by Munroe's attempt to invoice corporations mentioned in the novel for product placement. The title is an intentional reference to an advertising campaign previously run by clothing retailer Gap, one of the companies Munroe sent invoices to.
The novel was published by Munroe's own publishing company, No Media Kings, and an e-book version is available under a Creative Commons license.
