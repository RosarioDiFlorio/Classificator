The Motorcycle Industry Council, or MIC, is a not-for-profit, national trade association representing manufacturers and distributors of motorcycles, scooters, motorcycle/ATV parts and accessories and members of allied trades in the United States, located in Irvine, California. The MIC was incorporated in 1970, but the association has roots extending back to the early days of motorcycling when it existed under other names since 1914.
The MIC was created to promote and preserve motorcycling and the U.S. motorcycle industry. This is accomplished through its activities in government relations, statistics, communications, technical, and aftermarket programs. They represent the off-highway vehicle industry and enthusiasts. More than 300 members represent manufacturers and distributors of motorcycles, scooters, parts and accessories, as well as allied trades such as publishing, insurance and consultants that support the continued development of statistics, effective governmental efforts and industry relations. While dealers, clubs and individuals are not eligible for membership, the MIC works with these groups on issues of mutual interest.
