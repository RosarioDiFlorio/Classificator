Jewish Motorcyclists Alliance (JMA) is an umbrella organization for Jewish motorcycle clubs. The JMA's affiliate clubs consist of official, organized motorcycle riding clubs with JMA membership criteria. A member club designates a delegate to serve on the JMA Council.
The JMA is the home of Jewish motorcyclists from around the world. The JMA is a worldwide association of Jewish motorcycle clubs that upon its formation included organized groups in the United States, Canada, Israel, England and Australia, representing over 2,500 Jewish motorcycle enthusiasts. The common thread is the religion; however membership or admittance to the member clubs is not dictated by faith or brand of motorcycle: riders of any denomination or brand of bike are welcome.
