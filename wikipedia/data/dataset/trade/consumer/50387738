The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an Irish state agency established in 2014, combining the previous functions of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. The amalgamation was effected by the Fine Gaelâ€“Labour coalition government as part of a reduction in state spending in response to the post-2008 Irish economic downturn; the new body also has increased powers.
