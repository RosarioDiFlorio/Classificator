A green guide (or sustainability guide) is a set of rules and guidelines provided for the use of a general or selective population to achieve the goal of becoming more green or sustainable. In this, the guide serves to direct individuals, agencies, companies, businesses, etc. to resources that can help them become more sustainable (or ‘green’) as sustainability becomes a more popular and growing lifestyle choice. Guides are available in many ways, but the most popular being through websites as to avoid using paper. There has also been a surge of guides in university websites as to encourage students towards a more sustainable way of life.
