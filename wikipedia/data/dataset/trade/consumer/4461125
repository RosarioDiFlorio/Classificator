New Dream – previously known as The Center for a New American Dream — is a nonprofit organization with a stated mission to “empower individuals, communities, and organizations to transform the ways they consume to improve well-being for people and the planet." [1]
The organization works with individuals and communities to "counter the commercialization of our culture, support community engagement, and conserve natural resources." It seeks to change social norms around consumption and consumerism and to support the movement of individuals and communities pursuing lifestyle change and community action. New Dream’s overall goal is to change behavior, attitudes, and social norms to reduce consumption, build community, and improve quality of life.
The organization states that it embraces sustainability and a celebration of non-material values. One of New Dream's goals is "to shift the culture from an emphasis on more to an emphasis on more of what matters.” It is up to the individual to determine what matters in his or her life, but the organization offers, by way of example, more time, nature, family, community, fairness, and fun as appropriate points of emphasis over material goods. The organization's informal motto is "More Fun, Less Stuff."
Overall, New Dream strives to create a vision of life beyond overconsumption, disposable lifestyles, and perpetual marketing, and to provide the tools to help families, citizens, educators, and activists rein in consumerism in their own lives and in broader society.
