Surplus: Terrorized Into Being Consumers is an award-winning 2003 Swedish documentary film on consumerism and globalization, created by director Erik Gandini and editor Johan SÃ¶derberg. It looks at the arguments for capitalism and technology, such as greater efficiency, more time and less work, and argues that these are not being fulfilled, and they never will be. The film leans towards anarcho-primitivist ideology and argues for 'a simple and fulfilling life'.
