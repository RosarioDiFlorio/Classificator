The Central Motorcycle Roadracing Association, CMRA for short, is an amateur level motorcycle racing league that holds races and rider schools in the south central region of the United States. It is one of the most active motorcycle racing clubs in America.
The CMRA is a non-profit organization with approximately 800 members. It is managed by a seven-member Board of Directors, half of whom are elected each year to a two-year term by a vote of the full membership.
To race in the series, a rider must have passed an accredited racing school and purchased a racing license. CMRA offers a Rider's School that is taught on Friday of every race weekend race. The main purpose of the school is to prepare newcomers for their first race. Motorcycle riders who don't wish to race often take the course to improve their skills and receive their licenses which enables them to rent local race tracks for personal use. The School on Friday is run in conjunction with either a CMRA or Lone Star Track Days open practice day.
The CMRA also welcomes volunteers to help with corner working on race weekends.
CMRA, once known as CRRC (Central Road Racing Club), has had more motorcycle roadracing champions (National and International) than any other road racing club in the world.
