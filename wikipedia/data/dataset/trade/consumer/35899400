The New Zealand Hot Rod Association (Inc) or NZHRA is an umbrella organisation of car clubs in New Zealand, dedicated to encouraging and enhancing its members participation and enjoyment of safe Hot Rodding and its related activities, to foster the development, achievement and success gained through involvement with unique and individual automobiles and, in doing so, positively promoting the sport of Hot Rodding to those outside of our organisation.
The NZHRA has a history of cooperation with motoring authorities, culminating in the adoption of the NZHRA-written New Zealand Hobby Car Technical Manual as the legally accepted criteria for registration of low-volume vehicles in New Zealand.
