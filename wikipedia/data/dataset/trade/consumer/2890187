The National Association for Bikers with a Disability or NABD is a Registered Charity (No. 1040907) in the United Kingdom and (No. SC039897) in Scotland. The NABD gives technical advice and financial grants to help to adapt motorcycles, sidecars and trikes for use by disabled riders. It also gives advice on training and rider assessments. It owns a fleet of learner-legal motorcycles adapted for various disabilities, which it loans free of charge for training and tests.
The NABD is routinely consulted on issues relating to disabled motorcycling by the DVLA, DfT, VOSA, DSA, and MAVIS (the Mobility Advice and Vehicle Information Service).
