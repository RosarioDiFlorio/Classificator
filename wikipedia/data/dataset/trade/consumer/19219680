Marketing buzz or simply buzz—a term used in viral marketing—is the interaction of consumers and users of a product or service which amplifies or alters the original marketing message. This emotion, energy, excitement, or anticipation about a product or service can be positive or negative. Buzz can be generated by intentional marketing activities by the brand owner or it can be the result of an independent event that enters public awareness through social or traditional media such as newspapers. Marketing buzz originally referred to oral communication but in the age of Web 2.0, social media such as Facebook and Twitter are now the dominant communication channels for marketing buzz.
In the 16th-early-20th centuries, nearly every town had its local weekly or monthly newspapers, and subscribed editions of larger publications were regularly carried by post riders to distant populations, where their key news stories from nearby county seat or capitols and far off cities were regularly read aloud in local taverns—which were much more a part of daily life than today's bars. On a predictable schedule, these subscriptions readings would occur on various nights, giving the tavern an attraction to draw in visitors, and a gathering place for men to discuss the implications of such news.
