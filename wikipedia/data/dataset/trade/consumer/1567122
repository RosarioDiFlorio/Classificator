Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale (G.A.S., Italian for ethical purchasing groups) are an Italian-based system of purchasing goods collectively. These groups are usually set up by a number of consumers who cooperate in order to buy food and other commonly used goods directly from producers or from big retailers at a price that is fair to both parties.
