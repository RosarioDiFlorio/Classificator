Post-consumerism is often suggesting that there is a growing willingness to assert that well-being, as distinct from material success, is the aim of life. Post-consumerism can also be viewed as moving beyond the current model of addictive consumerism. This personal and societal strategy utilizes each individual's core values to identify the "satisfaction of enough for today." The intent and outcome of this basic strategy to date has "reached people where they are rather than simply where we are."
