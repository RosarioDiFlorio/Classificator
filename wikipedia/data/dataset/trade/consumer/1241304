Call For Action is the name given to telephone "help lines" maintained by media outlets in the United States and abroad. The mission of Call For Action is to empower consumers by giving them a voice larger than their own. This is accomplished by volunteers across the country, who are trained to assist consumers through mediation and education in order to resolve problems with businesses, government agencies and other organizations. The services are free, confidential and available to all individuals and small businesses. Call For Action provides broadcast partners with a highly effective, low cost way to serve their community, while generating unique localized content.
