The psychological continuum model (PCM) is a framework to organise prior literature from various academic disciplines to explain sport and event consumer behaviour.     The framework suggests four stages â€“ awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance to describe how sport and event involvement progressively develops with corresponding behaviours (e.g., playing, watching, buying). The PCM uses a vertical framework to characterise various psychological connections that individuals form with objects to explain the role of attitude formation and change that directs behaviours across a variety of consumption activities. Explaining the how and why of sport and event consumer behaviour, it discusses how personal, psychological and environmental factors influence a wide range of sport consumption activities.
