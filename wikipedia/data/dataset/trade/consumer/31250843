Disposable towels are a relatively new invention in the field of disposable convenience products , made from nonwoven fibres. They were first popularised by the hospital supply industry, but now relatively common in resorts, hotels, beauty salons, day cares and similar fields. Their main advantage is the hygiene and cleanliness that they guarantee for each user. Often, they are made from some recycled content, and can be recycled after use. Disposable towels save hotel and salon owners times and money by preventing the necessity of washing and drying traditional, cotton towels.
