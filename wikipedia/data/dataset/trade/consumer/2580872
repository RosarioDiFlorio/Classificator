ntl:hell was an independent consumer lobby group designed by customers of NTL to discuss issues and create a community where people could submit their own views of the company, and how to make products or services better.
Running for close to five years ntl:hell was the largest ntl: focused customer support forum in the UK with over 15,000 members. There were numerous forums available for members, for each different type of service which NTL provided, such as Digital TV, Telephone and Internet.
The community was very active, and had a very relaxed atmosphere.
