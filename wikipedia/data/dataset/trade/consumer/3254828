ANEC, the European Association for the Co-ordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation (known informally as 'the European consumer voice in standardisation'), is an organisation promoting and defending consumer interests in the process of standardization, and in related fields such as conformity assessment (e.g.certification), market surveillance and enforcement. ANEC also aims to influence legislation that makes reference to standards or standardization. In November 2008, ANEC adopted the strapline 'Raising Standards for Consumers' as part of an initiative to improve the visibility of the association.
ANEC provides technical expertise and advice drawn from a network of consumer representatives across Europe. The organisation's experts contribute directly to the work of more than 155 technical committees and working groups of the European Standards Organisations, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI and international standards organisations, ISO and IEC.
