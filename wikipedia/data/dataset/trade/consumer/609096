Cotton swabs (American English) or cotton buds (British English) consist of a small wad of cotton wrapped around one or both ends of a short rod, usually made of either wood, rolled paper or plastic. They are commonly used in a variety of applications including first aid, cosmetics application, cleaning, and arts and crafts. The cotton swab is a tool invented in the 1920s by Leo Gerstenzang after he watched his wife attach wads of cotton to toothpicks. His product, which he named "Baby Gays", went on to become the most widely sold brand name, "Q-tips", with the Q standing for "quality". The term "Q-tips" is often used as a genericized trademark for cotton swabs in the USA and Canada. The Q-tips brand is owned by Unilever and had over $200 million in sales in the US in 2014. Although doctors have said for years that use of the cotton swab for ear cleaning or scratching is not safe, such use remains the most common.
