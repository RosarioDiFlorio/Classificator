Motor clubs, also referred to as motoring clubs, motoring associations, automobile associations or similar, are organizations, either for-profit or non-profit, which motorists (drivers and vehicle owners) can join to enjoy certain benefits provided by the club relating to driving a vehicle. There is typically an annual membership fee to join. A membership identification card, valid for the time period of membership paid, is typically issued to the member.
