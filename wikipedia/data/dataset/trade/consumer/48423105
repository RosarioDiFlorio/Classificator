The Witness Service (also known as Citizens Advice Witness Service) is a support organisation in England and Wales for witnesses who have to give evidence in criminal courts. The Witness Service offers practical and emotional support and is a free service. The Ministry of Justice awarded the Â£24m contract to run the service to Citizens Advice in 2014. Prior to this Victim Support ran this service. The Law Society Gazette reported that the Citizens Advice Service will not get any additional funding to run the organization.
