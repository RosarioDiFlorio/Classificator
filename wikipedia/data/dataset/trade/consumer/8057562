The Amateur Motorcycle Association (AMCA) is a non-profit making governing body for off road motorcycling sport in the United Kingdom. Based in Cannock, Staffordshire, the organisation has over 200 affiliate clubs, catering for motocross, trials, enduro and historical motocross.
The organisation is based around amateur riders, with one of the organisation's main objectives being that motorcycles ridden by members and all modified parts fitted are on general sale.
Initially formed in 1932, the organisation was based primarily around the West Midlands, but has since spread across the United Kingdom. The organisation is part of the IMBA (International Motorsport Bond for Amateurs) and some of the AMCA's top motocross rider compete in European championships against European counterparts from similar organisations.
The AMCA also owns several race tracks in the UK, along with ancillary equipment that is regularly used by AMCA clubs to stage race meetings.
