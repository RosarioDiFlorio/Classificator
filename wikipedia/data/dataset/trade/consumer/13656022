The American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association (AHRMA) is a vintage motorcycle racing origination that puts on mostly motorcross races, but also holds road racing, dirt flat track, and trials events. The AHRMA was formed in 1984 as a private business. In 1989 it was reorganized as a member owned non profit organization.
During the 70s and 80s groups of riders began emerging around the nation organizing vintage motorcycle racing events. This started primarily with vintage roadracing clubs who were then joined by motocross, trials, dirt track and concours enthusiasts. Two of the most prominent of these organizations were the California Vintage Racing Group and in the southeast, the Historic Racing Association. It was decided that vintage motorcycle racing was now large enough to require a national organization the coordinate events, so in 1986 AHRMA was formed as a private-held business corporation, bringing together other groups in the first few years and becoming a non profit organization in 1989.
