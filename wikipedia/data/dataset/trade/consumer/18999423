The Vintage Sports-Car Club or VSCC is a British motor racing club. It was established by five founder members: Colin Nicholson, Bruce Nicholson, Ned Lewis, Harry Bowler and Vivian Brookes. The VSCC was known initially (October 34) as the Veteran Sports-Car Club, and from November 1934 was known as The Vintage Sports-Car Club, to distinguish it from the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain. Its aim was to promote the pastime of motoring- the VSCC was first started in order to allow the "not so rich" to enjoy historic motoring. Tim Carson joined the committee in 1935 and Tom Rolt in 1938, with S. C. H. Davis having become president in 1937. General guidelines made the club principally for cars built before 1931. This guideline generally remains in force, although cars built before the Second World War but conforming to standards set in 1931 are also allowed.

As well as social events (tours, and 'Concours' gatherings), the club, which has a membership of some 7,500, organises a range of motoring competitions such as driving tests, hill climbs, races, road rallies and sprints. Their most famous race is held at Silverstone Circuit in April of every year.
