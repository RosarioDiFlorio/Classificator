Rotherham abuse scandal: no charges against senior council figures	
No charges will be brought against any senior figures at Rotherham borough council despite “various and substantial organisational failings” that left 1,400 children at risk of sexual abuse, a set of reports has concluded.

The decision, in six long-awaited reports published on Wednesday, was condemned by the Rotherham MP, Sarah Champion as a “complete wasted opportunity to allow the town to move forward”.

The reports concluded that no senior council managers from 1997 to 2013 should face any action despite the independent experts finding “there may have been errors of judgment or missed opportunities”.

Child E went on to suffer from mental illness including at least one psychotic episode that led to her being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.
