Food and drink
This is a modern gastronomic pub and the food here is truly magnificent. Head chef Ben McKellar (who also runs the Ginger Man, the Ginger Dog, and the Ginger Fox restaurants elsewhere in Sussex) offers designer food that is both easy on the eye and entirely wholesome and delicious. The menu offers traditional dishes such whole plaice with Jersey potatoes and roast sirloin and a most scrumptious apple crumble.

There is a separate space where breakfast is served. It’s bright and airy and leads to a courtyard. There is no buffet, but there is a range of interesting breakfast choices from scrambled eggs on toast, a Ginber Pig Full English to Irish Rock Oysters. There’s also champagne for those with indulgent breakfast tastes.

Of course, this is a pub and one with a great atmosphere, so you may as well enjoy a swift half (or whatever your tipple is) before heading to bed.
