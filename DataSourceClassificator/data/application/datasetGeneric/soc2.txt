OnPolitics Today: Trump makes a good deal. For Democrats, at least.
Donald Trump was a Democrat just eight years ago. And for a few moments on Wednesday, as an alternate universe seemingly tore through our own, President Trump sided with Democrats over his own party on the debt ceiling.

Republicans stood shocked, while Trump referred to Democratic dealmakers Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi as simply, "Chuck and Nancy."

Another thing about Bizzaro World Trump: He makes good deals. For Democrats, at least.

Trump reportedly took the first offer Dems plunked down, one pairing hurricane relief funds with an extension of the debt limit and government funding. But that extension runs out in December, when Democrats may again use their leverage amid lawmakers' end-of-year rush.

House Speaker Paul Ryan called such a deal "ridiculous." Trump called it "a very good meeting."
