Hotel Review: The Ginger Pig, Brighton & Hove, England, UK
This isn’t exactly a hotel, more a pub with rooms. It’s a modern establishment whose ethos harks back to the bygone idea of a room at the inn where travellers would stop to eat, drink, make merry and later, lay their weary head.
It’s a stylish yet casual affair at the Ginger Pig: checking in is by way of telling the bar tender that you have arrived and thereafter a bevy of people look after your needs.

Entry to the rooms is via a small courtyard to the side of the pub, where two monumental dogs welcome you in, while candles and flowers offer some eye candy. It’s quaint.
