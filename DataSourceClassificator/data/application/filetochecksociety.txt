Cognitive Behavioural Prevention of Suicide in Psychosis: A Treatment Manual
This practical and informative text lays out the product of a number of years of clinical research into suicide behaviour and its prevention. While the focus is on non-affective psychosis and the schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the mechanisms underlying suicide behaviour in this group may well underlie or at least influence suicide behaviour in other disorders. The authors describe methods of assessment through individual formulation, and a cognitive behavioural intervention through case studies, to reduce the risk of suicide.This book argues that:· Suicide behaviour lies on a cognitive-behavioural continuum from ideation, through intention to action. · Mechanisms based on biased information processing systems, the development of suicide schema, and appraisal styles are likely to be fruitful in explaining suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· A psychological theory of suicide behaviour is needed in order to develop a mechanism of suicide and to understand the components of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· Suicide risk can be reduced through the use of the intervention methods described within the text Cognitive Behavioural Prevention of Suicide in Psychosis evaluates practical applications of contemporary research on this topic, and will therefore be of interest to practitioners, post-graduates in training, and researchers studying suicide and/or psychosis.

Ethnic nominalism and civic religiosity: Christianity and national identity in Britain
The relationship between religion and national identity is a contested topic in public debates about cultural diversity and immigration. In sample surveys only a minority the British population identify themselves as belonging to a Christian religion, and far fewer practise their faith. Nevertheless, nearly a quarter of the population think it is important to be Christian to be truly British. This study explores the complex relationships between religious and national identities in Britain, using data from the 2008 British Social Attitudes Survey. Three different forms of national identity were identified through factor analysis: civic-symbolic, cultural-aesthetic and ethnic national identity. Ethnic national identity is the only dimension of national identity that is positively associated with thinking it is important to be Christian to be British. While churchgoing Christians are more likely to feel national in response to secular cultural symbols, they are less likely to associate religion with nationality than those with a nominal Christian affiliation. The results indicate that Christianity has cultural significance for national identity primarily as a proxy for ethnic identity.

'Birthright Citizenship and the ‘Mother-Child’ Subject: Reproducing the Nation/Reproducing the Self'
This paper considers critical responses to arguments regarding ‘anchor babies’ and ‘citizenship tourists’ in the context of ongoing changes to birthright citizenship legislation in recent years. This scholarship has emphasized the failure of such arguments to recognize the increasing permeable and fluid nature of national boundaries. The need to rethink the boundaries of political community in this context has been conceptualized predominantly through the question of therights which immigrant women and their children hold as individuals vis-à-vis the state. This paper, however, considers how citizen-subjectivity is not always exclusionable or inclusionable in political community as ‘individual’ woman or child in the last instance, as is presumed here. Rather, it explores how citizen-subjectivity often presents itself as a more ambiguous ‘motherchild’subject which is neither entirely one nor the other but “betwixt and between” (Shandy 2008). Drawing on the work of Julia Kristeva, this paper discusses how we can think through this fluidity of citizen-subjectivity in addition to the already highly emphasized fluidity of political community. It suggests that rethinking the boundaries of political subjectivity reconfigures our understanding of what citizenship (political community) can be in this context. For, although weare dealing with subjects who are citizens, they are citizens in a very different way to how this is normally conceptualized via commonality. Instead of being able to mark out and overcome exclusion, citizenship is defined here through processes of exclusion.

Public policy, participation and the third position: The implication of engaging communities on their own terms.
Policy development and implementation should be fundamental for community psychologists in their endeavors to create social change. Policy necessarily isengaged at broad social and political levels, but it is mediated through communities and individuals, and thus appealing for our discipline. We argue that there are increasing opportunities for social input in liberal democracies with the growing awareness of the need to consider social factors in policy. Public participation is one aspect of policy development, but it can be problematic and can disempowered communities, especially disadvantaged communities. Using the framework of the ‘third position’, a case study of attempts to ameliorate institutional oppression of Australian Aboriginal people through policy change is described. Structural reform to community engagement is described in terms of empowerment and capacity building. Power relationships are deconstructed toallow understandings of the dynamics of policy change, and the broader implications for community psychological praxis are discussed.

Safe recruitment, social justice, and ethical practice: should people who have criminal convictions be allowed to train as social workers?
<p>Decision making in relation to admitting people to train as social workers is, either explicitly or implicitly, an ethical activity. This paper considers ethical and practical issues related to the processing of applicants to social work training in England who have criminal convictions. These issues are explored by focusing on policies that strengthen regulations that exclude ex-offenders from working with children and vulnerable adults. The admissions processes for social work education are analysed in terms of how they contribute to, or counteract, processes of social exclusion. The advice and guidance from the General Social Care Council of England (GSCC) is summarised and analysed. A case study of a social work education partnership grounds the ethical discussion by illustrating the complexities of engaging with combating social exclusion whilst seeking to ensure that the public is protected.</p>
