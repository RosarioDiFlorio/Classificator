We examined the social and clinical characteristics of pact cases in England and Wales using a national clinical survey sample of people who died by suicide pact and who had been in recent (<12 months) contact with mental health services. Over the study period (1996-2005), there were 278 cases of suicide who had died in a pact, 77 (28%) of whom had been in recent service contact. The most common cause of death overall was by carbon monoxide poisoning, but those in contact with services were more likely to use more violent methods compared with other pact victims. Nearly half (47%) had affective disorder and 68% had previously self-harmed. Over a quarter (29%) had died within 3 months of discharge from psychiatric care and 36% had missed their last service appointment. Pact cases were more likely than solitary suicide cases to have experienced recent adverse life events, typically family problems. Measures that may prevent suicide pacts in the mentally ill include the effective treatment of depression and closer supervision in both in-patient and community settings. Awareness of the family environment may contribute to reduced risk." ],

However, previous studies identified that consumption tracks income partially.

  "texts" : [ "Addition of novel degenerate electrical waveform stimulation with photodynamic therapy significantly enhances its cytotoxic effect in keloid fibroblasts: first report of a potential combination therapy.", "BACKGROUND: We recently reported use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating keloid disease (KD). However, in view of high recurrence rates post any treatment modality, adjuvant therapies should be considered. Additionally, we previously demonstrated the effect of a novel electrical waveform, the degenerate wave (DW) on differential gene expression in keloid fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic effect of PDT at 5J/cm(2) and 10J/cm(2) of red light (633 ± 3nm) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) with and without DW, on keloid fibroblasts compared to normal skin fibroblasts. METHODS: The rate of intracellular photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PPIX) generation and disintegration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, LDH cytotoxicity, WST-1 cytoproliferation, apoptosis by Caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential assessment by JC-1 aggregates, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry and In-Cell Western Blotting were performed. RESULTS: PPIX accumulation and disintegration rate was higher in keloid than normal fibroblasts after incubation with MAL compared to ALA. Increased cytotoxicity and decreased cytoproliferation were observed for keloid fibroblasts after PDT+DW treatment compared to PDT alone. ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) and collagens I and III gene down-regulation were higher in keloid compared to normal skin fibroblasts after MAL-PDT+DW treatment. An increase in the number of cells entering apoptosis and necrosis was observed after PDT+DW treatment by flow cytometry analysis. All positive findings were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic effect of PDT on keloid fibroblasts can be enhanced significantly with addition of DW stimulation, indicating for the first time the utility of this potential combinational therapy." ],

We explore supplier market knowledge acquisition, relationship learning, systems collaboration, and technological uncertainty as antecedents of supplier innovation generation, which is in turn hypothesized to positively affect the relationship performance of the supplier. Furthermore, supplier dependence on the buyer is investigated as a moderator of the effects of such antecedents on supplier innovation generation.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Manipulation of the Carbon Storage Regulator System for Metabolite Remodeling and Biofuel Production in Escherichia coli", "AbstractBackgroundMicrobial engineering strategies that elicit global metabolic perturbations have the capacity to increase organism robustness for targeted metabolite production. In particular, perturbations to regulators of cellular systems that impact glycolysis and amino acid production while simultaneously decreasing fermentation by-products such as acetate and CO2 make ideal targets. Intriguingly, perturbation of the Carbon Storage Regulator (Csr) system has been previously implicated in large changes in central carbon metabolism in E. coli. Therefore, we hypothesized that perturbation of the Csr system through the CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex might increase production of biofuels and their intermediates from heterologous pathways.ResultsWe engaged the CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex of E. coli via overexpression of CsrB. CsrB is a 350-nucleotide non-coding RNA that antagonizes CsrA, an RNA-binding protein that regulates translation of specific mRNA targets. By using shotgun proteomics and targeted metabolomics we established that elevation of CsrB levels leads to alterations in metabolite and protein levels in glycolysis, the TCA cycle and amino acid levels. Consequently, we show that such changes can be suitably applied to improve the production of desired compounds through the native fatty acid and heterologous n-butanol and isoprenoid pathways by up to two-fold. We also observed concomitant decreases in undesirable fermentation by-products such as acetate and CO2.ConclusionsWe have demonstrated that simple engineering of the RNA-based Csr global regulatory system constitutes a novel approach to obtaining pathway-independent improvements within engineered hosts. Additionally, since Csr is conserved across most prokaryotic species, this approach may also be amenable to a wide variety of production hosts." ],

Although there is no definitive causal link between alcohol use and risky sexual behavior, the two behaviors are highly correlated. Design : A randomized control trial was designed to test a brief alcohol intervention against an attention-placebo control intervention. A sample of 152 MSM were recruited over 13 weeks at a local gay bar. Sober bar patrons were recruited prior to entering the bar and asked to complete a brief assessment and receive feedback. Patrons were randomly assigned to receive feedback on their planned alcohol use or on their carbon footprint (attention-placebo control condition). This scripted feedback, based on the health belief model, was tailored to the individual through a brief assessment. Participants were asked to complete a brief survey and give a breath sample at exit from the bar. Participants were followed-up within one week to assess alcohol-related problems and sexual activity following the interview night. Findings : Breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) at exit from the bar were not significantly different between those in the experimental alcohol feedback condition and those in the attention-placebo control condition. Among participants receiving the experimental brief alcohol intervention, those categorized as high-risk for alcohol-related problems at entrance drank significantly less than planned as compared to participants categorized as low-risk for alcohol related problems (F=13.9, p<0.001). Further, participants categorized as high-risk at entrance drove at a significantly lower rate than participants categorized as low-risk and at-risk (x2=8.9, p<0.05). Discussion: This brief alcohol intervention did not significantly reduce BrAC at exit from the bar for the group as a whole. However, evidence indicates that this intervention was more appropriate for those who planned to drink at rates that would put them at higher risk of alcohol related problems as compared to those who were at low-risk of alcohol related problems" ],

  "texts" : [ "Queer Monsters Within: Trauma and the Emergence of Gothic Queer Discourse in U.S. Cultural Production, 1945-2011", "This project explores how gothic metaphors appear in American cultural productions concerned with non-normative gender and sexuality and why this gothicism spikes when American experience becomes traumatic. I claim that there are particularly gothic periods in the cultural production that follows collective trauma, and I focus on a single gothic trope for analysis in each of these historical moments--sadomasochism in performances responding to insidious trauma, haunting in historical fiction following the Watts riots of 1965, live burial in AIDS literature, containment in cold war lesbian pulp fiction, and vampirism in post-9/11 popular culture. Trauma shatters established notions of normalcy, disrupting the status quo and creating an anxious flurry of discourse--steeped in gothic tropes and metaphors--that often renegotiates gender and sexual norms. I identify the repressive uses of gothicism in these contexts and then examine activist redeployments in texts by LGBTIQ writers, artists, and theorists, such as Lee Edelman, Ron Athey, Ann Bannon, Migdalia Cruz, and Jack Halberstam. This analysis is concerned with questions such as: What are the temporal and causal links between the traumatic historical moment and the gothic-themed productions that follow? In what ways are gothic symbols used to negotiate concepts of gender and sexuality? Are they used to contain and regulate non-normative sexual or gender expressions, subvert popular understanding of \"normal\" gender and/or sexuality, or both? What other factors intersect with gender and sexuality to create this discourse (such as race, class, and ability), and how can an intersectional analysis deepen our understanding of the phenomenon? Finally, how has the subversive redeployment of gothic metaphors been used to speak to issues of social justice in response to oppression? In spite of the presence of this phenomenon in American literature and culture, the implications of gothicism in relation to American LGBTIQ experience have not been explicitly addressed within queer theory nor within American literary studies. My project builds on scholarship in queer Gothic literature by identifying gothic queer theory as a mode of literary and critical discourse and by constructing a crisis-based historical trajectory for repressive and redeployed gothicisms in U.S. cultural production." ],

  "texts" : [ "How Do Auditors Behave During Periods of Market Euphoria? The Case of Internet IPOs", "The study of periods of market euphoria, such as Holland’s seventeenth-century tulip\nmania, England’s eighteenth-century South Sea Company, America’s nineteenth-century\nrailroads, or, most recently, the U.S. housing market, is a topic of long-standing interest to economists. Theorists specify conditions under which market participants and institutions cause \"bubbles\" to arise and persist and empiricists test participant-centric or institution- centric explanations (Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong 2008; Schultz 2008; Greenwood and Nagel 2009). In this paper, we study a different participant other than one that stands to gain from price fluctuations. We are interested in how auditors behave during periods of market euphoria. Given their gatekeeper responsibility to act in the public’s interest, along with the seeming inevitability of bubbles (Rampell 2009), it is important to study how auditors behave during euphoric market conditions. To address this question, we examine auditor going-concern (GC) opinions around the time of the wave of stressed Internet firms filing to go public on NASDAQ, the capital markets entry point for the companies that went on to constitute \"dotcom mania\"." ],

The adage “build it and they will come”, we argue, holds for bicycle improvements every bit as much as other forms of urban transportation infrastructure.  Pro-active partnerships between transit agencies, local municipalities, and bicycle advocacy organizations are critical to ensuring such improvements are made. " ],

The aim is to extend accounts of the inequalities and exploitation created by the credit bubble beyond the credit relations between lenders and borrowers. In doing so, it highlights three factors contributing to young adults and senor citizens indebtedness: (1) Persistently slow income growth over the past two decades is a major, and often overlooked, contributor to mounting household debt levels; (2) The culture of homeownership in the United States that was intimately bound up with the recent credit boom, which made sense of young adults becoming highly leveraged homeowners and senior citizens using their homes as ATMs; (3) In addition to funding consumption, debt is used as safety net to replace eroding public expenditure for social insurance and services. The emphasis here is on the cumulative effects of these three factors. Certainly the young and retired were affected in different ways, but with similar outcomes: rising indebtedness and growing financial insecurity. When we move beyond framing the excesses of the recent credit bubble using the narrow conception of the ‘subprime’ experience, we see that a wide cross-section of American society was made significantly worse off, both now and arguably well into the future." ],

Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data obtained from the questionnaire administered. The research found out that the youth associations helped in the improvement of standard of living of the people in the study area. The study also revealed that the youth associations contributed in political awareness, construction of drainages and culverts and also mobilizes people on the importance of community efforts. The major constraints faced by the youth associations included financial problem and lack of full participation by members. It was recommended that fund raising committees should be created by the youth associations and government should provide assistance to the youth association members as motivation and encouragement measures. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Contribution; Youth association; community development; Igabi Local Government; Kaduna State." ],

I draw from my experiences dating from January of 2010 to the present. I begin by mapping out the student mobilizations that occurred between February 15th and March 4th of 2010 at UCSD in response to the UC budget crisis and the underrepresentation and under-servicing of black students on campus. This context provides a deeper understanding of the conflicts that Art Collective grappled with in our performances and activism. Next, I uncover some of the historical issues of racial and economic elitism that underscore UCSD's history and how this context informs the current power dynamics in the university's spaces. Using spatial and postcolonial theory, in addition to my personal reflections as a member of Art Collective, I assert that our public music making is a means through which we bodily reclaim institutional space and rearticulate our voices and identities on our own terms. Finally, after outlining some of our key performances, I situate Art Collective within a realm of processes: reflection, coalition building, and sharing subjectivities and experiences. These processes make the collective's performance style distinct, as it cultivates common bonds that strengthen community and foster personal growth. In essence, this thesis is a representation and an extension of my praxis as an artist-activist engaging in reflexive community work" ],

These measures were the most drastic set of changes to take place during the company’s 41-year history.  Through its campaign, company leadership downsized managers and hourly workers by the thousands, outsourced in-store operations, amalgamated departments, and all but eliminated full-time hourly work.  In my research based on over 50 interviews and three months of participant-observation, I found that the consequences of labour flexibilisation reverberated in ethnographically palpable ways throughout the social world of the workplace, affecting not only the role and status of workers, but also their relationships to each other and to the work that they do.  This paper suggests that while in some cases workers have responded to de-skilling and the fragmentation of workplace community by generating surprising new forms of social solidarity, overall the cuts have brought about a drastic reduction in job quality.  Ultimately, I suggest that Hometown’s participation in this ‘race to the bottom’ raises serious questions about the inevitability of these changes and the future of blue-collar jobs in deindustrialised America." ],

The aim of this study was to investigate whether evidence for the presence of bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, can be demonstrated in the peripheral blood of patients with guttate and/or chronic plaque psoriasis. Peripheral blood samples from 20 patients with psoriasis, seven guttate, six chronic plaque and seven chronic plaque with associated guttate flare and from 16 control subjects were studied for the presence of bacteria by PCR using universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers and specific primers for S. pyogenes. Sequence analysis of amplified 16S rRNA sequences was used to determine taxonomic identity. Ribosomal bacterial DNA was detected in the blood of all 20 patients with psoriasis, but in none of the controls. Streptococci were detected in six of seven patients with guttate psoriasis, but none had staphylococci. In contrast, staphylococci were identified in 9 of 13 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, whilst only 2 demonstrated streptococci. In three psoriasis patients, species other than streptococci and staphylococci were identified. These findings suggest that psoriasis is associated with bacteraemia, with distinct taxonomic groups present in guttate and chronic plaque psoriatic subtypes. The causes of the bacteraemia and its implications in psoriasis have yet to be determined." ],

  "title" : "THE CHINESE MARKET FOR U.S. PORK EXPORTS",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "THE CHINESE MARKET FOR U.S. PORK EXPORTS", "China feeds twenty-two percent of the world's population on seven percent of its arable land. In contrast, the U.S. and Canada own seventeen percent of the world's arable land, but feed only five percent of its people. As China's income increases, its people will demand more livestock products, including poultry, dairy, beef, and eggs, and more alcohol. Potential Chinese import demand for pork is examined in this paper. The question facing Chinese policymakers is whether to follow their current policy of food self-sufficiency or allow imports of pork muscle and variety meats. Projections of Chinese production and consumption indicate that, by the year 2007, China could import up to 9.1 million metric tons (product weight equivalent) of pork. The current Chinese government is very opposed to food imports of any kind. However, China has applied for entry into the World Trade Organization. Negotiations on China's entry could include access to China's pork market, and it is most likely that access could be gained to the variety meat market. The implications of two opposing scenarios are examined in this paper: first, China continues its policy of self-sufficiency; or second, China allows imports of pork variety meats. Self-Sufficiency Scenario: The anticipated increase in livestock production will cause feed grain consumption in China to increase more rapidly than production. Once China becomes a permanent net importer of feed grains, its prices will rise to reflect world feed grain prices plus transportation costs. This development will make China's pork products more expensive than imports. This simple line of argument means that China is about to modernize and expand the world's largest pork industry in the wrong place. Expanding pork production in China instead of allowing imports from efficient producers will cause an enormous misallocation of world resources. The Chinese people would benefit more if China concentrated on labor intensive crops and allowed for the free importation of livestock products. Import Access Scenario: Where the pork market is concerned, U.S. and Chinese consumers complement each other. Chinese people like variety meats, whereas U.S. consumers prefer pork muscle meats. Because of its dominance in the world market, China would be able to determine world prices if it allowed free importation of variety meats. The drop credit, which is the value of the pork variety package, is estimated to increase by 45 percent. However, the increase in the value of the pork variety package would not imply an increase in prices in the U.S. domestic market which largely consumes pork muscle meats. Implications for U.S. Producers: Even if China does not allow imports of pork, U.S. producers will still benefit from increased Chinese demand. Due to projected increased consumption over the next ten years, it is likely that China will stop exporting its current level of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of pork muscle meat. If China does allow free importation of pork variety meats, the increased value of the U.S. drop credit would add $4.72 to the value of each hog carcass or about $1.90 per hundredweight. For the U.S. pork industry, the net annual benefit of access to the Chinese market would be approximately $300 million per year. Hayes argues that opening this market may be feasible as part of negotiations over China's entry to the World Trade Organization. Regardless of how Chinese pork market policy evolves, the demand for U.S. feed grain will increase, causing some movement of land in the U.S. from wheat production into feed grain production.China trade, livestock, feedgrains, meat, International Relations/Trade, F1," ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The High Cost of Flat Fares: An Examination of Ridership Demographics and Fare Policy at the Los Angeles MTA", "The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) currently uses a flat fare structure, with several types of special passes, to collect passenger revenues. The fare structure is termed \"flat\" because each passenger pays the same base fare regardless of time, direction, or distance of travel. This analysis of MTA's ridership demographics shows that this fare structure is neither efficient, effective, nor equitable, though it does offer some operations simplicity. Typically transit dependents -- riders who are more likely poor, non-white, young or old, and female -- maker shorter trips, more non-work trips, and use regular monthly passes less than other comparable passenger groups. As a result, these transit dependent groups, on average, pay relatively more for transit service on a per mile basis, while covering a larger portion of the costs of providing the service, than do choice (or discretionary) riders. This report suggests that switching to a differentiated fare structure, where fares vary by mode, time of day, and/or distance traveled, could improve cost efficiency by more closely matching fares to the actual cost of service provision, increase service effectiveness by increased short distance and off-peak travel, and increase social equity by substantially reducing the cross-subsidy of higher-income riders by lower-income riders." ],

The evaluation of the collected data, and the discussion within the group, permitted the formulation of comments and resulted in a revised framework of material considerations, useful during the design and selection process of a material.

Schultz</div></p><div style=\"text-align: center;\">Crystallographic Analysis of a Hammerhead Ribozyme Variant and Its Impact on Catalytic Activity</div></p>Over the past two decades, the hammerhead ribozyme has been extensively studied leading to many new insights regarding the biochemical and structural properties of catalytic RNAs.  Despite these insights, the role metal ions in catalysis is still of great debate.  We have obtained a 1.55Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme from <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> in conditions that permit detailed observation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions binding in the ribozyme's active site.  A Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the N7 of G10.1 and the adjacent A9 phosphate in a manner identical to that previously observed for divalent cations.  A second Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the Hoogsteen face of G12, the general base in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction, thereby potentially dissipating the negative charge of the catalytically active enolate form of the base.  We have also obtained a 2.2Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme variant containing adenine substituted for the general base that displays a structurally perturbed active site.  Our results suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> directly and specifically substitutes for divalent cations in the hammerhead active site.  Additionally, we suggest that hammerhead ribozyme substituted with adenine for the general base may compete between two conformational states: an active state in which A12 is situated for deprotonation of the 2'H of C17; and an inactive state in which A12 makes a non-canonical base pair A9, causing a perturbation in the active site, disrupting metal ion binding.  These results permit us to estimate the contribution that structural perturbation has on the catalytic activity of other hammerhead ribozyme variants containing nucleobase substitutions for the general base." ],

Here, records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919–2008 are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the distributions of the number of unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder between geographic regions connected through social and communication networks.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Between Orientalism and Affective Identification: A Paradigm and Four Case Studies Towards the Inclusion of the Moor in Cuban Literary and Cultural Studies", "This dissertation proposes an interpretive paradigm to explore the Moorish, Arab, Islamic and Algerian presence in Cuban literature and cultural studies, and it offers four case studies in which to do so.  The interpretative paradigm involves a dynamic between two coexisting approaches in Cuban cultural history.  The first is akin to Edward Said's notion of Orientalism, an exotization of the other that invites a critical stance.  The second, here called \"affective identification,\" signals the recognition of and connection with the other as an element of national identity.  The four case studies, which correspond to the chapters of the dissertation, are organized with a chronological movement from the nineteenth century until the present, and each is intended to underscore the links between the specific historical moment in question and significant aspects of Cuban literature and cultural studies. Chapter 1 argues that the intersection between the dominant white sector's view of an exclusively white Cuban national identity and specific historical and geopolitical circumstances of the early nineteenth century informs the representation of Muslim pirates in Cirilo Villaverde's <italic>Excursión a Vueltabajo</italic>. Chapter 2 proposes that changing attitudes towards slavery in the second half of the nineteenth century, as well as the rising importance of the eastern region of the country, among other factors, contributed to the representation of Moors and Arabs in Martí's poetic and political discourse (specifically, <italic>Ismaelillo</italic> and \"Los Moros en España\"), in keeping with the notion of affective identification.   Chapter 3 argues that the general interest in North Africa before the twentieth century, and the presence of the Moor in Cuban literature and nationalist discourse, contributed to the ways in which Algeria and Algerians were represented in Cuban print and television in the 50s and 60s. It gives pride of place to two works:  Jorge \"Papito\" Serguera's  <italic>Che Guevara, la clave Africana: Memorias de un embajador de Cuba en Argelia</italic> and Delia Fiallo's <italic>Bajo el cielo de Argelia</italic>, a soap opera about the Algerian struggle for liberation, broadcast in Cuba in 1962.  Chapter 4 relies on theories of loss to address the affective identification with the Moor in Abilio Estévez's <italic>Los palacios distantes</italic>, and with the Arab figure in Jesús Díaz's short story \"El pianista árabe\" that involves the experience of exile and loss at the turn of the twenty-first century.  The dissertation concludes suggesting several ways in which the inclusion of Arab and Islamic elements can enrich the study of both Cuban and Latin American literary and cultural studies." ],

Primed T cells are required for virus clearance, but are causally implicated in the enhanced pathology seen following RSV infection of some infants and experimental animals vaccinated against the virus.

Lung eosinophilia was associated with enhanced local recruitment of CD4+ cells in G sensitized mice, while CD8+ cells dominated in mice vaccinated with the viral fusion protein (F) or second matrix protein (M2). Lung eosinophilia was also associated with a localized reduction in IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA transcription as well as elevated RSV specific IgG1 antibody production. Th2 cytokine protein production by T cells showed no apparent change. Although IFN-gamma production diminished in eosinophilic mice, it remained the major cytokine found in lung T cells. It was concluded that lung eosinophilia can develop despite abundant IFN-gamma production by local T cells, but is associated with a shift in the balance between Th2 and Th1 cytokine production." ],

  "texts" : [ "SADIe:Structural-Semantics for Accessibility and Device Independence (SADIe Technical Report)", "The World Wide Web (Web) has evolved from a predominantly text-based resource into a visually complex, dynamic, multimedia system that incorporates images, video and scripting languages. Most Web designers make use of this multimedia to think of elaborate ways of presenting their data in a visual manner. Visually impaired users, who access the Web through alternative devices such as screen readers, find it difficult to access Web content because it is not designed with their needs in mind. Screen readers access Web content via the explicit underlying structure of the Web page. Implicit information designed for sighted users is inaccessible to screen readers and therefore visually impaired users. In order to cope with this difficulty, users' employ coping strategies, which are techniques designed to improve access to inaccessible Web pages.   The Semantic Web is an evolution of the current Web, through which the meaning of data and information is available to both machines and humans. Technologies such as XML, RDF and OWL have been developed to support machine understanding of information on the Web. SADIe uses Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontologies, to explicate implicitly rendered information. The ontology consists of two parts. The first is an upper ontology containing high level abstract concepts representing the potential roles of Web page elements. The second is a Website specific extension to the upper ontology. This contains the elements found within the CSS plus the roles that they play. SADIe uses the ontology combination to apply transcoding to pages within a Website in order to improve access for people with visual impairments, and hence reduce the need for coping strategies.   SADIe's approach of using upper level ontologies to offer site wide transcoding offers a \"high gain, low pain\" technique. SADIe improves access to the Web for people with visual impairments, without overly impeding Web designers in their primary job of creating visually stunning and interesting Websites." ],

The study was a systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that used Ca supplementation as an intervention in persons 18 or more years of age, and that reported body weight as a final outcome. A total of thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. There was no association between the increased consumption of either Ca supplements or dairy products and weight loss after adjusting for differences in baseline weights between the control and intervention groups (P=0.19 and 0.85, respectively).

This study stems from the achievement gap noticed in students of color or in situations that place them at risk of dropping out of school. In order to explore the achievement gap, much prior research has relied on statistical data taken from adults or outside agencies. These sources often negate the voice of the students that make up these gaps. This study will examine students' perceptions and connections to perceptions and student success in the classroom. The literature reviewed in this case study examines (1) the achievement gap as a phenomenon, (2) students' perspectives, and (3) student voice. An examination of these areas of literature provides substantive support for research needed in the area of the impact of students' perspectives on their academic achievement. Participants in this study include 30 11th- and 12th-grade students attending an alternative high school in south Riverside County, California. Data for this research will be collected through student surveys, interviews, and student writing samples. A modified method of analysis of phenomenological data was used to analyze, group, and derive themes from the data provided from participants' responses. Research findings are presented in this study to inform present and future educators about ways to reach student groups that are most at risk of failing in school" ],

This study tested the effects of personalised feedback on fat intake in a general population. Hospital workers (n = 801) were randomised to receive personalised feedback or no personalised feedback. Personalised feedback consisted of one sentence expressing current fat intake as a percentage of total calorific intake. Changes in fat intake from baseline to five months post-intervention were evaluated. The personalised intervention produced significant decreases in total and saturated fat intake, compared with the control group. Total-fat decreased by 8.6% (versus 0.2% in the control group); saturated fat decreased by 9.3% (versus 1.7% in the control group). Fat intake as a proportion of total calorific intake did not decrease significantly in either condition. Findings also revealed differential effects of feedback on high- versus low-fat consumer groups. Personalised feedback significantly reduced fat intake in high-fat consumers, and prevented low-fat consumers from increasing their fat intake. Personalised fat feedback therefore represents an efficacious and low-intensity approach to the reduction of fat intake in the general population." ],

This work dealt with improving methods of measuring particle export\nand measuring export on different scales to assess its spatial variability. First, the\nassumption of 238U linearity with salinity, used in the 238U–234Th method, was reevaluated\nusing a large sample set over a wide salinity range. Next, neutrally buoyant and surface-tethered\nsediment traps were compared during a three-year time series in the subtropical\nAtlantic. This study suggested that previously observed imbalances between carbon\nstocks and fluxes in this region are not due to undersampling by traps. To assess regional\nvariability of particle export, surface and water-column measurements of 234Th were\ncombined for the first time to measure fluxes on ~20 km scales. Attempts to relate\nsurface properties to particle export were complicated by the temporal decoupling of\nproduction and export. Finally, particle export from 234Th was measured on transects of\nthe Atlantic Ocean to evaluate basin-scale export variability. High-resolution sampling\nthrough the water-column allowed for the identification of unique 234Th features in the\nintermediate water column.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution February 2013I was\nsupported by NASA Headquarters under the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship\nProgram (Grant NNX10AO72H).

This initiative was aimed at improving outcomes for youth in communities where chronic school failure had become entrenched. Specifically, this study investigated how the phenomenon of teacher collaboration both catalyzes and fosters teachers' sense of shared responsibility for student success and well being, their perceptions of collective efficacy, and their trust in colleagues to both internalize and implement the school's mission. I used a single-case study as the mode of inquiry in order to create a detailed portrait of teacher collaboration based on how teachers both talk about and implement their work. I drew from five principle information sources: (a) all 19 faculty members completed three surveys aimed at understanding teachers' perceptions of collective efficacy, faculty trust, and shared responsibility; (b) I conducted 16, hour-long interviews to understand collaborative practices relative to trust, collective efficacy, and shared responsibility; (c) I conducted one focus group that focused on the nature of collaboration at the site; (d) I observed four collaborative teacher meetings; and (e) five teachers wrote twice-weekly reflections on their collaborative practices. I conclude this study with recommendations for teacher-led school transformation as one approach to turning around failing schools." ],

The discussion of physicalsymptoms, especially pain, formed the core of eachobserved encounter. Nurses primarily focused on medicinesmanagement (dose, frequency, suitability), other approachesto symptom management were infrequent. Nurses wereskilled at using informal conversational assessment styles,but the non-use of formal assessment tools could narrowthe range of issues assessed.

  "texts" : [ "Effect on skin hydration of using baby wipes to clean the napkin area of newborn babies: assessor-blinded randomised controlled equivalence trial.", "BACKGROUND: Some national guidelines recommend the use of water alone for napkin cleansing. Yet, there is a readiness, amongst many parents, to use baby wipes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials, of the effect of baby wipes on newborn skin integrity is lacking. We conducted a study to examine the hypothesis that the use of a specifically formulated cleansing wipe on the napkin area of newborn infants (<1 month) has an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with using cotton wool and water (usual care). METHODS: A prospective, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled equivalence trial was conducted during 2010. Healthy, term babies (n=280), recruited within 48 hours of birth, were randomly assigned to have their napkin area cleansed with an alcohol-free baby wipe (140 babies) or cotton wool and water (140 babies). Primary outcome was change in hydration from within 48 hours of birth to 4 weeks post-birth. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in trans-epidermal water loss, skin surface pH and erythema, presence of microbial skin contaminants/irritants at 4 weeks and napkin dermatitis reported by midwife at 4 weeks and mother during the 4 weeks. RESULTS: Complete hydration data were obtained for 254 (90.7 %) babies. Wipes were shown to be equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration (intention-to-treat analysis: wipes 65.4 (SD 12.4) vs. water 63.5 (14.2), p=0.47, 95% CI -2.5 to 4.2; per protocol analysis: wipes 64.6 (12.4) vs. water 63.6 (14.3), p=0.53, 95% CI -2.4 to 4.2). No significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes, except for maternal-reported napkin dermatitis, which was higher in the water group (p=0.025 for complete responses). CONCLUSIONS: Baby wipes had an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with cotton wool and water. We found no evidence of any adverse effects of using these wipes. These findings offer reassurance to parents who choose to use baby wipes and to health professionals who support their use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN86207019." ],

The question of responsibility towards the environment is one, which tourism operators generally seem reluctant to accept but one operator that appears to have taken a proactive approach to environmental issues in mountain regions is heli-operator Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH). This paper expands on the limited amount of research that exists on the complex relationship between tourism and the environment by applying a responsible marketing model to CMH. This model is grounded on previous literature in marketing, and strategic and environmental management. Interviews with key stakeholders, observational research, and content analysis of communication materials, were used to identify how near CMH is to finding a balance between responsible action and the communication of these activities.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Common Motifs in Scientific Workflows: An Empirical Analysis", "While workflow technology has gained momentum in the last decade as a means for specifying and enacting compu- tational experiments in modern science, reusing and repurposing existing workflows to build new scientific experiments is still a daunting task. This is partly due to the difficulty that scientists experience when attempting to understand existing workflows, which contain several data preparation and adaptation steps in addition to the scientifically significant analysis steps. One way to tackle the understandability problem is through providing abstractions that give a high-level view of activities undertaken within workflows. As a first step towards abstractions, we report in this paper on the results of a manual analysis performed over a set of real-world scientific workflows from Taverna and Wings systems. Our analysis has resulted in a set of scientific workflow motifs that outline i) the kinds of data intensive activities that are observed in workflows (data oriented motifs), and ii) the different manners in which activities are implemented within workflows (workflow oriented motifs). These motifs can be useful to inform workflow designers on the good and bad practices for workflow development, to inform the design of automated tools for the generation of workflow abstractions, etc." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Emergence of a Finance Culture in American Households, 1989-2007", "As the financial economy has expanded beginning in the mid 1980s, it has done so in part by selling more products to individuals and households, such as mortgages, second mortgages, mutual funds, student loans, car loans, insurance, and various forms of retirement products. This has allowed households access to new forms of assets and debts and new ways to fund their lifestyles. This giant expansion of the financial services sector occurred at the same time that income inequality and job insecurity increased dramatically in the U.S. This paper seeks to tease out empirically the relationship between these trends by examining data on the activities of households in the past 20 years. There are two views, one that focuses on how households reacted defensively to preserve their lifestyles and the other which focuses on households developing a more financial mindset to the management of their assets, debt, and consumption and thereby using the new opportunities to invest and borrow money to increase their consumption. We show some support for both views. The use of financial products and debt has increased at all levels of the income distribution. Attitudes toward risk and indebtedness have generally become more lax. But, there is also evidence that people at the top of the income distribution are using their growing income to consume more while people lower down are struggling to keep up. The meaning of new financial culture is quite different depending on where you stand in the income hierarchy." ],

Scenario-based study one, with retail employees/applicants, shows differential effects on organizational attractiveness of SWOM with positive vs. negative messages and tangible vs. intangible information, if obtained from strong vs. weak social ties.     In study two, a survey of retail pre-hires demonstrates mediation and moderation effects on organizational attractiveness of job-seekers’ pre-commitment, fit perceptions with the retailer, and mentoring/aspirational ties.   Retailers are urged to develop the potential of SWOM through improved understanding, responding, motivating, and keeping employees informed.

In the lineage's absence, women in Burma today who wish to renounce lay-life now become thila-shin.  These women follow a similar discipline and lifestyle as their bhikkhuni forbears, but do not enjoy the prestige and legitimacy that accompanied bhikkhuni ordination.  By contrast, the monks' legitimacy remains indisputably intact, and they enjoy supreme religious social status.\n\nWhile thila-shin still live highly meaningful and rewarding lives, their lack of full legitimacy burdens their day-to-day lives and long-term spiritual aspirations in very concrete ways (e.g., scares resources, limited career opportunities).  However disadvantaged their situation, I argue that the thila-shin are indeed making modest gains in establishing legitimacy and respect for themselves in the eyes of the Burmese laity.\n\nIn the fall of 2005 I carried out ethnographic research among thila-shin in Bodh Gaya, India and Sagaing Hills, Burma.  Based on my experience living with the thila-shin, it seems that, rather than voicing objections, thila-shin are working quietly within the existing power structure to negotiate a dignified social space for themselves as legitimate nuns.  I will discuss strategies that thila-shin employ on a daily basis to improve their collective status.  These strategies include observing a code of discipline stricter than the monks', maintaining harmony with the monks, and cultivating positive relations with the lay community." ],

This idiom points to multidisciplinary nature of biophysics but what really is the biophysics? And who is the biophysicist?  Biophysics was  defined as: \"that branch of knowledge that applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical analysis and computer modeling to understand how the mechanisms of biological systems work” in homepage of Biophysical Society . Biophysics may be thought of as the central circle in a two-dimensional array of overlapping circles, which include physics, chemistry, physiology, and general biology. Two wings of Biophysics are Biology and physics. Organisms are made of biomaterials, which can be studied by physical laws, since physical principles and laws hold from microscopic level to macroscopic level. Biophysicist selects a part of biological problems that are pliable to interpret by physical principles and then formulate hypotheses that can be tested by experiment2. Historically, bioluminescence can be considered among the earliest biophysical phenomena. The modern biophysics appeared by discovering of molecular structure of myoglobin and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is no doubt that Biophysics as a multidisciplinary science covers wide spectrum of subjects as follows: Instrumental biophysics, Radiation Biophysics and radiobiology, Structural biology, Physiological biophysics, bio-cybernetics, Membrane Biophysics, Molecular biophysics, Bioenergetics, Mathematical and theoretical biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry.

In contrast, the impact of IL-4 on the activation and function of dendritic cells (DCs) is poorly understood. We report here that DCs respond to IL-4 both in vitro and in vivo by expression of multiple alternative activation markers with a different expression pattern to that of macrophages. We further demonstrate a central role for DC IL-4Rα expression in the optimal induction of IFNγ responses in vivo in both Th1 and Th2 settings, through a feedback loop in which IL-4 promotes DC secretion of IL-12. Finally, we reveal a central role for RELMα during T-cell priming, establishing that its expression by DCs is critical for optimal IL-10 and IL-13 promotion in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data highlight the significant impact that IL-4 and RELMα can have on DC activation and function in the context of either bacterial or helminth pathogens." ],

Hydronephrosis, however, is not always present and emergency physicians may not find it as useful as would be expected. Through this case series of seven patients, we present what we believe to be commonly present and easily acquired sonographic bladder wall findings in ureterolithiasis. These abnormalities are not routinely taught in emergency ultrasound and have not been reported in the emergency medicine literature. One variant, in fact, may be a novel finding unto itself. Due to their similar appearance, we propose to unify these findings under the name “bladder bulge.” This sign can be seen on axial views as an inward bulging or focal thickening of the bladder wall on the affected side, at the uretovesical junction.

Demand for automated routing and scheduling was found to be influenced directly by the need to re-route drivers, and indirectly by the need, generated by customers' schedules, to operate during congested periods.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "AN ONTOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IN UNREGULATED MARKETS", "Ontologies are a key factor of Information management as they provide a common representation to any domain. Historically, finance domain has suffered from a lack of efficiency in managing vast amounts of financial data, a lack of communication and knowledge sharing between analysts. Particularly, with the growth of fraud in financial markets, cases are challenging, complex, and involve a huge volume of information. Gathering facts and evidence is often complex.  Thus, the impetus for building a financial fraud ontology arises from the continuous improvement and development of financial market surveillance systems with high analytical capabilities to capture frauds which is essential to guarantee and preserve an efficient market.This thesis proposes an ontology-based approach for financial market surveillance systems. The proposed ontology acts as a semantic representation of mining concepts from unstructured resources and other internet sources (corpus). The ontology contains a comprehensive concept system that can act as a semantically rich knowledge base for a market monitoring system. This could help fraud analysts to understand financial fraud practices, assist open investigation by managing relevant facts gathered for case investigations, providing early detection techniques of fraudulent activities, developing prevention practices, and sharing manipulation patterns from prosecuted cases with investigators and relevant users.  The usefulness of the ontology will be evaluated through three case studies, which not only help to explain how manipulation in markets works, but will also demonstrate how the ontology can be used as a framework for the extraction process and capturing information related to financial fraud, to improve the performance of surveillance systems in fraud monitoring. Given that most manipulation cases occur in the unregulated markets, this thesis uses a sample of fraud cases from the unregulated markets. On the empirical side, the thesis presents examples of novel applications of text-mining tools and data-processing components, developing off-line surveillance systems that are fully working prototypes which could train the ontology in the most recent manipulation techniques." ],

Armando Barrientos begins by focusing on the ethical and conceptual foundations of social assistance, and he discusses the justifications for assisting those in poverty. He provides a primer on poverty analysis, and introduces readers to the theory of optimal transfers. He then shifts the focus to practice, and introduces a classification of social assistance programmes to help readers understand the diversity in approaches and design in developing countries. The book concludes with an analysis of the financing and politics of the emerging institutions and of their potential to address global poverty." ],

The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between alcoholic beverage preference and dietary intake in The Netherlands. Subjects/Methods: A total of 2100 men and women from the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey 2007–2010 were studied. A general questionnaire assessed alcoholic beverage preference and two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls assessed overall diet. Mean nutrient and food group intakes, and adherence to the 2006 Dutch dietary guidelines across categories of alcoholic beverage preference were compared and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), education, smoking, physical activity, energy intake and frequency and absolute alcohol consumption. Results: Largest differences in dietary habits were detected between persons who preferred wine and those who preferred beer. Persons with a beer preference had a higher absolute intake of meat, soft drinks, margarine and snacks. In contrast, persons with a wine preference had a higher absolute consumption of healthy foods. However, after multiple adjustments, wine consumers still consumed less energy and more vegetables and fruit juices compared with beer consumers. Adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines did not differ between preference categories after multiple adjustments. Conclusions: In this cross-sectional analysis in a representative sample of the Dutch population, a beer preference was associated with less healthy dietary behaviour, especially compared with wine preference. However, these differences were largely explained by other socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. These results suggest that alcoholic beverage preference may not be independently related to diet" ],

  "texts" : [ "La litterature et le cinema le cas de Jean Cocteau", "A poet and a movie director, Jean Cocteau brilliantly manifested surrealist inspiration in his poetry, in the performative art of his theatrical representation, and in his cinematography. His work is the best example to follow when asking the question how much the new art of cinematography inherited from other artistic expressions, especially from literature. This dissertation seeks to provide new and interdisciplinary inside into precisely those ways in which film, as an artistic expression, is intimately related to literature.\nThe thesis begins with an examination of the development of Cocteau's art from his first lyrics to his production of abstract films, showing how cinema can be directly related to his personal poetical mythology already manifested in literary works. I introduce the syncretism of Cocteau artistic expressions, examine the importance of literature in the later production of cinematography, and consider the main constructions in Cocteau's re-creation of the mythological and legendary figures of the poet. In this later endeavor I discuss myth, symbol and allegory, poetics that will be further defined in the second chapter.\nThe second part suggests that within the heterogeneous art of Cocteau, there is a profound relationship between his poetry and his films. His unique perspective goes beyond traditional genre frontiers in the lyric, in theatre, and in narrative, making for a singular representation of the very notion of artistic intuition and the role of the artist.\nWhether perceived as a form of art or an aesthetic debate, the creation of art movies become for this French poet and cineaste a perfect way to interrogate his destiny and to define his artistic personality. His visual work is populated by his literary characters and haunted by his obsession with death and sacrifice. The artistic expression he would invent by means of the cinematic image was a way, moreover, in which to attract a timeless public attention.\nAs Cocteau explored what it might mean to be a poet and the kind of destiny that a poet might secure, he raised the question of the artist's liberty, exemplifying this most fully in self-portrait we find in his re-construction of the Orpheus character in movies like The blood of the poet, Orpheus,  and The Testament of Orpheus. Creating in this way a mask for the artist's identity he also establishes an intimate link between his artistic expression in the domain of poetry and his creation in the field of dramatic representation.\nAlthough focused on the artist's ongoing concern with artistic identity, this second part of the thesis recognizes cinema as a longstanding art and analyzes its instruments and technique. Many of these are inspired by the other arts. As with literary texts cinema must attend to narrative creation, to the construction of plot and to the unfolding of character. As in theatre it involves declamation and the art of decorations. As in dance performance it relies on music, sound and animation. There are of course ways in which cinematography through special effects, for example, finds its own path as it provides a means for the poet to express his intuitive inspiration. In this Cocteau has been recognized as one of the most creative directors of all time." ],

  "texts" : [ "The new and everlasting order of marriage : the introduction and implementation of Mormon polygamy : 1830-1856", "When Joseph Smith quietly introduced polygamy to a few chosen followers in Nauvoo, Illinois in April 1841, the innovation was not welcomed by most adherents to Mormonism. How, then, did polygamy become the favored form of marriage in 19th century Mormon culture? The answer is that it happened through a complicated and contingent process that took many years. Early adherents expected the advent of the millennium, perhaps in their lifetime, and were thus primed to accept unusual doctrine, but their acceptance of polygamy nevertheless depended on the development of a supporting theological narrative that they found convincing. Since polygamy was introduced slowly and secretly through key members of the community, people were able to gradually become accustomed to the concept before they were formally asked to accept it. Polygamy, in turn, influenced the development of a family- centered theology of salvation and exaltation within Mormonism. It also caused considerable strife and dissension in the church and ultimately led to the 1844 arrest and murder of Joseph Smith. After his death, it played a significant role in the succession crisis that followed and in the decision to move to the American west where Mormons could establish their own society and marry as they chose. During the journey west and in early Utah, social norms and mores developed in a trial-and-error manner as individuals attempted to implement the new marriage patterns. Brigham Young and the hardy Mormons who trekked west with him eventually succeeded in institutionalizing polygamy, both in the theological narrative and in practice, to the degree that it became an important force in Mormon self-understanding and in community organization and cohesion. Mormons succeeded in institutionalizing polygamy so well that, just as they had resisted polygamy at the outset, many Mormons had a hard time giving it up after the church officially repudiated it in 1890. Sources include diaries, memoirs letters, pamphlets, minutes of meetings, sermons, newspaper accounts and a contemporary history of Mormonism compiled as events occurred" ],

  "texts" : [ "Developing Novel Biointerfaces and Biomaterials with Surface Plasmon Resonance and SPR Imaging", "Much research has focused on the development of analytical methods to monitor a multitude of biological interactions including protein-carbohydrate, protein-lipid, and protein-DNA among others. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) remains one of the most exciting techniques that allows for real-time data collection and label free detection amenable to many biological systems. This thesis focuses on the development of novel sensing interfaces/materials for biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA) with SPR and SPR imaging (SPRi).The first half of this work focuses on the development of unique surface chemistry designs to examine biological interactions. Firstly, in an effort to augment understanding of lectin (protein)-carbohydrate interactions, SPR spectroscopy is used to display differential binding of lectins to various synthetic carbohydrates. This biointerface was later adapted to a high-density array format for SPR imaging detection. Secondly, to expand the use of SPR to large bioparticle detection another interface based on the generation of a mass-enhancing product at the sensing interface for highly sensitive and fast detection of <italic>E. coli</italic> is presented. Results indicate a multi-fold signal enhancement of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in buffer and on spinach leaves.The second part of this thesis focuses on the development of new substrates for both SPR and SPR imaging experiments. Firstly, the fabrication of ultra-thin (ca. 5-8 nm) glass layers on top of a gold surface for SPR biosensing applications is demonstrated. This nanoglassy layer is created by employing a high-pressure, low-volume paint gun technique, resulting in ultra-thin and fracture-free substrates for biosensing applications including monitoring membrane protein interactions in real-time. Finally, the facile fabrication of gold-coated etched glass substrates for SPR imaging that reduces background resonance 5-fold <italic>in situ</italic> compared to the standard gold island array platform is presented. The etching of the glass substrate induces a variation in the resonance condition and thus in the resonance angle between the etched wells and the surrounding area, leading to the isolation of the array spot resonance with a significant reduction of the background resonance. Additionally, these chips enhance the SPR evanescent field intensity 3-fold compared to standard planar gold chips and significantly enhance SPR imaging surface sensitivity." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Improving disk array reliability and performance", "In this work we present a new data layout and associated scheduling policies to improve RAID reliability and performance. Our implementation uses multiple mirrors, utilizing n disks in a redundancy group thus providing fault tolerance for n -1 disk failures. As this is an extended form of RAID 1, we refer to this as RAID1nr, where n is the number of mirrors and r indicates the position of the data is rotated on each mirror. The rotated layout is such that a different 1/n of the data is located on the outer edge of each disk. The redundancy scheme is simple mirroring thus there is no added complexity introduced such as parity or other redundant encoding techniques. We then provide several scheduling policies for reads and writes that take advantage of the data layout. These policies can be set by the administrator for the desired level of performance and reliability. For example, all read requests for a particular block range may be serviced from the same disk. Writes may be scheduled to a subset of disks in order to improve performance using our immediate and eventual consistency policies. We also present load balancing policies for skewed workloads. While the RAID1nr system supports up to n -1 mirrors, we show that even adding a single extra mirror provides the increased reliability offered by an extra copy of the data, as well as a significant performance increase for read workloads, write workloads, mixed workloads, workloads with skewed distributions, and during degraded mode operation" ],

AIMS: To compare changing patterns of suicide risk in Scotland with those in England & Wales, 1960-2008. METHOD: For Scotland and for England & Wales separately, we obtained national data on suicide counts and population estimates. Gender-specific, directly age-standardised rates were calculated. RESULTS: We identified three distinct temporal phases: 1960-1967, when suicide rates in England & Wales were initially higher than in Scotland, but then converged; 1968-1991, when male suicide rates in Scotland rose slightly faster than in England & Wales; and 1992-2008, when there was a marked divergence in national trends. Much of the recent divergence in rates is attributable to the rise in suicide among young men and deaths by hanging in Scotland. Introduction of the 'undetermined intent' category in 1968 had a significant impact on suicide statistics across Great Britain, but especially so in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in temporal patterns in suicide risk between the countries are complex. Reversal of the divergent trends may require a change in the perception of hanging as a 'painless' method of suicide." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Adaptive Evolution and the Birth of CTCF Binding Sites in the Drosophila Genome", "Changes in the physical interaction between cis-regulatory DNA sequences and proteins drive the evolution of gene expression. However, it has proven difficult to accurately quantify evolutionary rates of such binding change or to estimate the relative effects of selection and drift in shaping the binding evolution. Here we examine the genome-wide binding of CTCF in four species of Drosophila separated by between ~2.5 and 25 million years. CTCF is a highly conserved protein known to be associated with insulator sequences in the genomes of human and Drosophila. Although the binding preference for CTCF is highly conserved, we find that CTCF binding itself is highly evolutionarily dynamic and has adaptively evolved. Between species, binding divergence increased linearly with evolutionary distance, and CTCF binding profiles are diverging rapidly at the rate of 2.22% per million years (Myr). At least 89 new CTCF binding sites have originated in the Drosophila melanogaster genome since the most recent common ancestor with Drosophila simulans. Comparing these data to genome sequence data from 37 different strains of Drosophila melanogaster, we detected signatures of selection in both newly gained and evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Newly evolved CTCF binding sites show a significantly stronger signature for positive selection than older sites. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that expression divergence of genes adjacent to CTCF binding site is significantly associated with the gain and loss of CTCF binding. Further, the birth of new genes is associated with the birth of new CTCF binding sites. Our data indicate that binding of Drosophila CTCF protein has evolved under natural selection, and CTCF binding evolution has shaped both the evolution of gene expression and genome evolution during the birth of new genes." ],

  "title" : "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Characterising the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response to Intestinal Helminth infection", "Abstract Gastrointestinal parasites are one of the most prevalent infections known to infect mammals, estimated to affect over one billion people globally. It is well established that the generation of a type two response, characterised by CD4+ T cell secretion of interleukin (IL)-13, IL-4 and IL-9 will expel most gastrointestinal helminths. Expulsion is mediated by a variety of effector mechanisms including altered mucin production, intestinal mast cell activation, increased epithelial cell turnover and increased muscle contraction. Protective immunity can be generated over time; however, infections can persist to chronicity following the modulation of a protective type two response, such as the generation of a type one response. This response, characterised by IFN-γ and IL 12 secretion, can lead to long lived infections, placing huge morbidity upon infected individuals. The mechanisms leading to the generation of a type one or type two response are not fully understood and are of paramount importance if a vaccine to helminth parasites is to be developed. In addition, the dysregulation of these responses is thought to be the cause of allergy and autoimmunity and understanding the regulation of type two responses will also add to our understanding of these diseases.Numerous labs have recently reported roles for new innate cells, such as nuocytes, as sources of IL 13, a cytokine critical to worm expulsion.  In addition, data from this lab has demonstrated that NK cell derived IL-13 is the cause of pathology during infection with Trichinella spiralis. It has also been shown that NK cells provide a supplementary source of IL-13 in Trichuris muris infected IL-4-/- mice. This thesis has used 2 strains of mice; the E4bp4-/- mouse and the Il13eGFP reporter mouse, in order to dissect the role of innate cells in the immune response to the related helminth parasites T. muris and T. spiralis. The transcription factor E4BP4 has been shown to control CD4+ T cell IL-5 and 13 secretion and the development of NK cells. Data presented in this thesis shows that following a low dose infection, which usually persists to chronicity in WT mice, E4bp4-/- mice were able to expel the parasite following the generation of an elevated type two response. This effect was abrogated following CD4+ T cell depletion, indicative of an essential role for these cells in this response. It was also shown that E4BP4 ablation was sufficient to delay expulsion of a high dose of T. muris, indicative of a key role for E4BP4 in regulating type two responses to T. muris. Contrary to the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that NK cells did not play a major role in protective immunity to T. muris.In addition, the data presented here shows, for the first time, the induction of nuocytes in the MLN following both T. muris and T. spiralis infection. Nuocytes made an early contribution to IL-13 secretion following T. spiralis infection; whereas low levels of Il13eGFP+ cells were observed only at day 18-21 post T. muris infection, with nuocytes making a less significant contribution to IL-13 levels. The levels of different cell lineages in the MLN post infection and their contribution to IL-13 expression was also mapped in detail.Finally, an analysis of the haematopoietic response in the bone marrow following T. muris infection was undertaken. The percentage and number of early progenitor Lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells in the bone marrow increased at day 21 post T. muris infection. LSK levels returned to normal after this time, indicative of an inflammation dependent response. Interestingly, E4bp4 ablation abrogated this effect, in line with the hypothesised role of IFN-γ in this expansion. Taken together, this data has added to our knowledge of the orchestration of immune responses to two intestinal helminth parasites; T. muris and T. spiralis." ],

  "texts" : [ "A Network of Multi-Tasking Proteins at the DNA Replication Fork Preserves Genome Stability", "To elucidate the network that maintains high fidelity genome replication, we have introduced two conditional mutant alleles of DNA2, an essential DNA replication gene, into each of the approximately 4,700 viable yeast deletion mutants and determined the fitness of the double mutants. Fifty-six DNA2-interacting genes were identified. Clustering analysis of genomic synthetic lethality profiles of each of 43 of the DNA2-interacting genes defines a network (consisting of 322 genes and 876 interactions) whose topology provides clues as to how replication proteins coordinate regulation and repair to protect genome integrity. The results also shed new light on the functions of the query gene DNA2, which, despite many years of study, remain controversial, especially its proposed role in Okazaki fragment processing and the nature of its in vivo substrates. Because of the multifunctional nature of virtually all proteins at the replication fork, the meaning of any single genetic interaction is inherently ambiguous. The multiplexing nature of the current studies, however, combined with follow-up supporting experiments, reveals most if not all of the unique pathways requiring Dna2p. These include not only Okazaki fragment processing and DNA repair but also chromatin dynamics." ],

  "texts" : [ "Effective Young's Modulus of Bacterial and Microfibrillated Cellulose Fibrils in Fibrous Networks", "The deformation micromechanics of bacterial cellulose (BC) and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) networks have been investigated using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of both BC and MFC networks exhibit a band initially located at similar to 1095 cm(-1). We have used the intensity of this band as a function of rotation angle of the specimens to study the cellulose fibril orientation in BC and MFC networks. We have also used the change in this peak's wavenumber position with applied tensile deformation to probe the stress-transfer behavior of these cellulosic materials. The intensity of this Raman band did not change significantly with rotation angle, indicating an in-plane 2D network of fibrils with uniform random orientation; conversely, a highly oriented flax fiber exhibited a marked change in intensity with rotation angle. Experimental data and theoretical analysis shows that the Raman band shift rate arising from deformation of networks under tension is dependent on the angles between the axis of fibrils, the strain axis, the incident laser polarization direction, and the back scattered polarization configurations. From this analysis, the effective moduli of single fibrils of BC and MFC in the networks were estimated to be in the ranges of 79-88 and 29-36 GPa, respectively. It is shown also that for the model to fit the data it is necessary to use a negative Poisson's ratio for MFC networks and BC networks. Discussion of this in-plane \"auxetic' behavior is given." ],

It addresses the traditional models of citizenship that have arisen in the national arena before turning its focus to supranational citizenship.\tThe development of quasi-citizenship rights at the European level between 1957 and 1992 are discussed whilst asking whether, in fact, these principles amounted to a de facto creation of citizenship as would be formally understood in a national model. Thereafter, post-1992 developments are considered via the activities of the European courts. The courts’ particularly activist role in expanding our understanding of Union citizenship by using existing Union legislation in imaginative ways is highlighted and used as a key factor in determining Union citizenship’s capacity to adapt and develop in the face of new challenges.\tThis thesis plays particular attention to the non-Member State nationals who reside in Union territory and find themselves ostensibly deprived of citizenship rights despite being actively involve in the Union’s activities. Supranational citizenship is viewed through the unusual lens of stateless persons and this thesis suggests that Union citizenship does not live up to its ideals by excluding them from its understanding of the citizenry. It formulates a novel conception of rights-based residence, as opposed to nationality-based, supranational citizenship that is predicated on the Union’s heritage of respect for rights and would include Member State nationals, alongside third-country nationals, the stateless and refugees (who would struggle to gain recognition under a conventional citizenship paradigm), with the aspiration of rendering Union citizenship a more inclusive and rounded conception." ],

  "texts" : [ "[[alternative]]Research for the Indicators Structure of Learning School Junior High and Elementary Schools", "[[abstract]]The purpose of this research is to construct the system for indicators weights and whose indicators content of learning school junior high and elementary schools.  To accomplish this target, Delphi technique and analytic hierarchy process were being adapted to collect, analyze and study the information.  Regarding the content, I focused on studying and discussing the development background, characteristics, relevant themes, model and composing content at the first place; then we analyzed the meaning and relevant studies of the learning schools.  I even proposed the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools; then I organized the questionnaire and proceeded the questionnaire survey for three stages of the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools based on the prototype and whose content of the indicators structure of the learning schools.  After that, I designed a questionnaire for indicators weights of learning schools according to the survey result of the Delphi questionnaire to form the indicators weights system for learning schools.           Two conclusions were found through the study and discussion of documentary, as well as the analyze and discussion of the questionnaire information in this research:           1.First degree indicators weights system for learning schools           The first degree indicators weights system mentioned in the system for indicators weights and whose index content of learning schools junior high and elementary schools constructing by my study includes the three indicators of [learning system], [knowledge management system] and [administration system].  Learning system indicators occupies the highest ratio of the total indicators weights at the rate of 43.6%.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the operation of the learning schools that individual learning, team learning, organizational learning and learning environment, the involvement and functional action must be taken into account.           The ratio distribution of the knowledge management system indicators ranks the second, occupying 32.8% of the total indicators of the learning schools.  Its purpose is to emphasize on the development of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the selection of knowledge, creation of knowledge and the establishment of knowledge storage mechanism to work with the learning system effectively to accomplish its target.  Whereas the ratio distribution of the administration system indicators occupies 23.6%, its purpose is to emphasize on the promotion of the learning schools that priorities must be put on the leadership of principal, the vision of school, the structure of school, the cooperation in administration and the organized operation of school culture to further reinforce and upgrade the efficiency of the learning schools.           2.The second grade indicators weights system and whose content of the learning schools           A. learninging system indicators           The second grade learning system index include four items of [individual learning], [team learning], [organizational learning] and [leraning environment].  Of which, [team learning] ranks the highest weights power at a rate of 36.7%, the second highest one is the [organizational learning] indicators at a rate of 31.8%, following by the [individual learning] indicators at a ratio power of 20.2%, whereas the [learning environment] occupies 11.3%.           B. Knowledge management system indicators           The second grade indices of knowledge management system includes [selection of knowledge], [creation of knowledge] and [storage of knowledge].  Among the distribution of indicators weights system, [creation of knowledge] ranks the highest at a rate of 41.3%, following by the [storage of knowledge] indicator at a rate of 30.9%, whereas [selection of knowledge] indicator ranks the last, occupying 27.8% of the knowledge management system indicators weights.           C.Administration system indicators           There are five items of [leadership of principal], [vision of school], [structure of school], [cooperation of administration] and [culture of school] under the dministration system indicators.  Of the ratio distribution for the administration system indicators weights system, [leadership of principal] ranks the highest at a rate of 29.1%, following by [vision of school] indicator at a rate of 22.6%, the succeeding one is [culture of school] indicator at a rate of 21.7%, [cooperation of administration] ranks the fourth with a rate of 16.9%, whereas the last indicator is [structure of school] with a rate of 9.7%.           Furthermore, I also propose references to educational administration authorities as well as junior high and elementary schools promoting the learning type schools, and those who intend to engage in further research according to the purpose, research result and discussion of this research.           A. Suggestion to educational administration authorities           1.Study and implement the methods to promote the learning school, supply financial aids to special project development to build a model school for learning organization.           2.By integrating the indicators weights system and content of school evaluation for learning school, it may help promote the development of learning school.           3.It is important to merge into the important things of index content of learning school so as to reinforce the review of indicator content for principal leadership to promote the development of learning schools while selecting the principals for junior high and elementary schools.           4.Promote cultivation plan for school team seed teachers to upgrade the quality of human resources in the aspect of learning system of the school.           5.The relevant staffs of the educational administration authorities should increase their understanding of the concepts and ways of the learning school so as to reinforce the promotion of learning school.           6.Educational administration authorities should stipulate autonomic extent of the school to promote the implementation of learning type school through the management of schools-based management.           B. Suggestion to junior high and elementary schools           1.Indicators weights system of the learning schools should be applied to review the present status of the existing schools, and design practical implementation plan by further using the indicators content.           2.The further study project for teachers should include the team, organizational and individual format, as well as the physical and psychological environment of learning to reinforce the operating mechanism of learning system.           3.Attend to the rebuilt cases formed by the organization after the learning system and knowledge management system are being integrated and operated.           4.The principal and the chiefs of each office should attend to the operation of administration system indicators to urge the school members to involve themselves in the practical operation of learning schools.           C. Suggestion to further research           1.Proceed the case study for the operation of indicators for learning schools.           2.Proceed the collection of substantial information to revise the indicators weights system for learning schools.           3.Proceed the establishment of quantitative index for the indicators of learning schools.           4.Proceed the research for the establishment of evaluation indicators for learning schools.           5.Proceed the research for the indicator establishment of all kinds of learning schools." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "An Audit of export services in England: developing business focused support", "<p>One of the key thresholds in the development of small and medium sized enterprises is exporting and trading internationally.  A brief review of the academic and practitioner literature highlights a number of benefits associated with exporting that include exposure to differing ways of ‘how to do’ business and opportunities for the development of joint ventures and strategic alliances.  However, several regions within the United Kingdom perceive that they have too few SMEs who trade internationally.  Recent estimates suggest that approximately three per cent of the SMEs in the United Kingdom are actively exporting (Bank of England, 1999).  Government policy makers have responded to such concerns by providing a range of support programmes to increase the number of SMEs who trade internationally and enhance the skills and capabilities of those SMEs who export, so that they can efficiently and effectively manage the exporting and market development process.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in the majority of the English regions, there are a range of publicly funded organisations providing advice, consultancy, information and training to SMEs wishing to trade internationally and those businesses already exporting.  In addition, SMEs can access a number of export services from private sector organisations such as banks, accountants, freight forwarders and export agents.</p>\n<p>There has been no overall national ‘stocktake’ or audit of such provision.  However, the need for such a stocktake is becoming increasingly important due to the introduction of a number of new support organisations into the institutional landscape and the re-organisation and re-branding of British Trade International as Trade Partners UK and the appointment of a series of Regional International Trade Directors.  The introduction of the Small Business Service will have a major impact on the coverage and nature of provision for exporting SMEs within each of the English regions.  The introduction of the Small Business Service, however, provides an opportunity to explore and examine alternative configurations of small business support and the types of organisation that are best placed to satisfy the needs of exporting SMEs.</p>\n<p>This paper presents the key findings to emerge from an audit of export services within each of the English regions. Based on a research and development project undertaken in conjunction with Trade Partners UK, the paper offers insights into:</p>\n<p>•\tThe coverage of export services available to SMEs within England;\n•\tThe effectiveness and appropriateness of current configuration of export services;\n•\tThe ways in which the effectiveness of the current configuration of export services could be enhanced. </p>\n<p>The audit was based on a series of face-to-face and telephone interviews with local, regional and national providers of export provision.  A key argument within the paper is that effective configurations of export and trade development support arise from insights into, and appropriate responses to, the exporting and trade development process as experienced by SMEs.  The paper concludes with a number of implications in terms of how business-driven forms of support can be developed.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Pulmonary arterial enlargement and acute exacerbations of COPD.", "BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with accelerated loss of lung function and death. Identification of patients at risk for these events, particularly those requiring hospitalization, is of major importance. Severe pulmonary hypertension is an important complication of advanced COPD and predicts acute exacerbations, though pulmonary vascular abnormalities also occur early in the course of the disease. We hypothesized that a computed tomographic (CT) metric of pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary artery enlargement, as determined by a ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to the diameter of the aorta [PA:A ratio] of >1) would be associated with severe COPD exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational trial that enrolled current and former smokers with COPD. We determined the association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history at enrollment of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and then examined the usefulness of the ratio as a predictor of these events in a longitudinal follow-up of this cohort, as well as in an external validation cohort. We used logistic-regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses and adjusted for known risk factors for exacerbation. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed a significant association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history of severe exacerbations at the time of enrollment in the trial (odds ratio, 4.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.43 to 6.65; P<0.001). A PA:A ratio of more than 1 was also independently associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations in both the trial cohort (odds ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.78 to 4.25; P<0.001) and the external validation cohort (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.11 to 3.71; P<0.001). In both cohorts, among all the variables analyzed, a PA:A ratio of more than 1 had the strongest association with severe exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery enlargement (a PA:A ratio of >1), as detected by CT, was associated with severe exacerbations of COPD.

However, as a scientific method employed in the study of ancient and mummified remains, it appears to have lost its popularity.This project explores the advantages and limitations of histology as a technique for such studies.  In order to do so, soft tissue and bone samples from ten early Roman Period mummies (30 BCE – 250 CE) from the Kellis 1 cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis have been histologically examined.While this project focuses on the scientific technique of histology, and its application for the study of ancient remains, it also aims to be cross-disciplinary by incorporating scientific results from the ten mummies with the historical data and archaeological remains uncovered during excavations of the Kellis site.  By bringing the results of science and Egyptology/archaeology together, it hoped that a better understanding of ancient Egyptian society could be achieved." ],

Teachers were surveyed during the Spring of 2010. Overall findings show that most of these Arizona teachers have a great deal of faith in their ELL students' ability to achieve at grade level but that the 4 hour ELD block to which they are assigned is not helping them to catch up with their English speaking peers academically and there is deep and overwhelming concern about the segregation they are experiencing as a result of this instructional model; 85% believe this separation from English speaking peers is harmful to their learning. Most also believe that the majority of their ELL students are not meeting grade level standards and more than half of teachers also note that their ELL students are stereotyped as slow learners by other students and that the 4 hour block program is harmful to their self-esteem. The study ends with a series of recommendations including that alternative modes of instruction need to be implemented to help ELL students to succeed academically.\n      Also available at http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu" ],

Recent investigations have revealed that the induction of LC migration following topical sensitization is dependent on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), an epidermal cytokine. While in transit to the lymph nodes LC are subject to both phenotypic and functional maturation which, by analogy with in vitro studies, is also effected by epidermal cytokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF and interleukin-1, IL-1). It is now apparent that Langerhans cell function, the induction of cutaneous immune responses and effective sensitization are dependent on the availability of such cytokines and that contact allergens are able to provoke their production by keratinocytes and by Langerhans cells themselves. The development of screening strategies for the evaluation of skin sensitization potential as a function of epidermal cytokine production is discussed." ],

Human cytochrome P450, particularly CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, play an important role in drug metabolism. The genes encoding the CYP enzymes are polymorphic, and extensive data have shown that certain alleles confer reduced enzymatic function. The goal of this study was to determine the frequencies of important allelic variants of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in the Jordanian population and compare them with the frequency in other ethnic groups. Genotyping of CYP1A1(m1 and m2), CYP2C9 (*2 and *3), CYP2C19 (*2 and *3), CYP3A4*5, CYP3A5 (*3 and *6), was carried out on Jordanian subjects. Different variants allele were determined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). CYP1A1 allele frequencies in 290 subjects were 0.764 for CYP1A1*1, 0.165 for CYP1A1*2A and 0.071 for CYP1A1*2C. CYP2C9 allele frequencies in 263 subjects were 0.797 for CYP2C9*1, 0.135 for CYP2C9*2 and 0.068 for CYP2C9*3. For CYP2C19, the frequencies of the wild type (CYP2C19*1) and the nonfunctional (*2 and *3) alleles were 0.877, 0.123 and 0, respectively. Five subjects (3.16 %) were homozygous for *2/*2. Regarding CYP3A4*1B, only 12 subjects out of 173 subjects (6.9 %) were heterozygote with none were mutant for this polymorphism. With respect to CYP3A5, 229 were analyzed, frequencies of CYP3A5*1,*3 and *6 were 0.071, 0.925 and 0.0022, respectively. Comparing our data with that obtained in several Caucasian, African-American and Asian populations, Jordanians are most similar to Caucasians with regard to allelic frequencies of the tested variants of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5." ],

A survey of their attitudes towards the patient activation programme was therefore undertaken. No significant differences were found between the attitudes of nurses according to grade or between experimental and control wards, but a significant difference was noted between each of the four wards when regarded as independent variables.

  "title" : "THE EFFECTS OF CARBONATED FLUIDS ON THE HUMAN CORTICAL SWALLOWING MOTOR SYSTEM",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "THE EFFECTS OF CARBONATED FLUIDS ON THE HUMAN CORTICAL SWALLOWING MOTOR SYSTEM", "AbstractSwallowing is a complex neurophysiological process involving the activation of several components of the central nervous system with bilateral but asymmetric representations of swallowing musculature in the motor cortex. Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) in stroke patients has been reported by up to 50% of victims, and can increase morbidity and mortality in this population due to the development of aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. One of the common factors that predispose patients to dysphagia after a stroke is believed to be the reduced sensory awareness in the oropharyngeal area, which affects the swallowing process. The uses of diet modification to reduce thin liquid aspiration have gained interest but are often unpalatable or have limited success. Carbonated liquid have shown some beneficial effects in swallowing behaviour. However, there is very little evidence to support this intervention. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the neurophysiological and behavioural effects of carbonated liquids on swallowing in healthy volunteers.The effects of carbonated solutions on swallowing performance compared to non-carbonated solutions (still water) was investigated in a pilot study and (still water and citric acid) in the main study using reaction time task (chapter 2). Carbonation appears to alter swallowing performance compared to other liquids by improving complex tasks. In addition, beneficial neurophysiological effects of carbonated liquids were evident after 10 minutes of carbonated liquid swallowing compared to still water and citric acid solution in healthy volunteers (chapter 3).In chapter 4, the response of the healthy swallowing motor cortex to carbonated liquids following application of a virtual lesion compared to still water and saliva swallowing, was investigated. Carbonated liquids were able to reverse the inhibitory effect induced by 1 Hz rTMS to the dominant pharyngeal motor representation. Moreover, the beneficial effects of carbonated liquids on swallowing performance, measured with a swallowing reaction times task after application of a virtual lesion was observed in a pilot investigation in healthy volunteers (chapter 5). These data demonstrate that carbonated liquids have beneficial neurophysiological and swallowing performance effects and support notion that the chemical properties of carbonated liquids may provide the required peripheral sensory information that alter the brain swallowing function, which leads to an improvement in the swallowing performance of stroke dysphagic patients.  These data lay the foundation for considering the use of carbonation as facilitating stimuli in dysphagic patients." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three essays on international trade and economic development", "This dissertation is composed of three self-contained chapters on international trade and economic development, with a special focus on the involvement of the government or public-funded sectors. The first chapter investigates international trade of higher education, specifically its impact on native students and native workers in the exporting country. Theoretically, I show that, in a general equilibrium model with non-profit publicly- subsidized higher education providers (HEPs) that care about both education quality and the enrollment of native students, serving foreign students may improve natives' access to higher education, which eventually benefits all native workers. Empirically, I find that, during the period 2001 to 2007, the enrollment of one more foreign student in an Australian university leads to the enrollment of around 0.75 more native students in this university. The impact is identified using an instrumental variable, generated from the interaction between demand for Australian higher education from different countries during the sample period and student networks these countries had in different Australian HEPs during 1989 to 1994. The second chapter studies commercial development in the presence of economic agglomeration of commercial goods and services, a result of consumers' love of varieties and transportation costs associated with commercial consumption. I show that a low-income community may be under-served with commercial goods and services because a developer cannot capture all the profits of a commercial project. A block grant to a developer can solve the market failure and generate a total profit bigger than the grant. Employment tax abatements alone are much less effective and much more costly. The third chapter examines the long- run impact of trade in higher education. In an overlapping generation (OG) model with a higher education sector composed of non-profit research institutions and for- profit teaching institutions, I show that importing teaching services benefits low-ability individuals by increased number of research workers in production, and that it may also benefit high-ability individuals by providing better training to skilled workers to complement research workers" ],

  "texts" : [ "Experience of hypoglycaemia is associated with changes in beliefs about diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "AIM: Hypoglycaemia may have a detrimental impact on quality of life for patients with Type 2 diabetes. There are few clinical studies exploring the impact of experiencing hypoglycaemia on beliefs about diabetes and health status. The aim of this study was to explore associations between experience of hypoglycaemia and changes in diabetes beliefs and self-reported health status in patients with non-insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes using a blood glucose meter. METHODS: One-year prospective cohort analysis of 226 patients recruited to a randomized trial evaluating the impact of self-monitoring of blood glucose. Self-reported hypoglycaemia over 1 year was categorized into three groups: (1) no experience of hypoglycaemia; (2) blood glucose measurements < 4 mmol/l with no associated symptoms of hypoglycaemia (grade 1); and (3) symptomatic hypoglycaemia (grade 2 and 3). Measures of beliefs about diabetes (Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire) and health status (EuroQol-5D) were assessed at baseline and 1 year. Differences in mean changes over 1 year were explored with analyses of covariance. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean score in beliefs about personal control (1.14; 95%CI 0.14-2.14) among those experiencing grade 1 hypoglycaemia compared with those not experiencing hypoglycaemia. There were no significant differences in changes in health status between groups, with small overall changes that were inconsistent between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide support for a long-term adverse impact on beliefs about diabetes or health status from the experience of mild symptomatic hypoglycaemia, in well-controlled, non-insulin-treated patients with Type 2 diabetes using self-monitoring of blood glucose." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Emergency Department Crowding is Associated with Reduced Satisfaction Scores in Patients Discharged from the Emergency Department", "Introduction: Emergency department (ED) crowding has been shown to negatively impact patient outcomes. Few studies have addressed the effect of ED crowding on patient satisfaction. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of ED crowding on patient satisfaction in patients discharged from the ED. \n      Methods: We measured patient satisfaction using Press-Ganey surveys returned by patients that visited our ED between August 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008. We recorded all mean satisfaction scores and obtained mean ED occupancy rate, mean EDWIN score and hospital diversion status over each 8-hour shift from data archived in our electronic tracking board. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was calculated to determine the effect of ED crowding and hospital diversion status on the odds of achieving a mean satisfaction score ≥85, which was the patient satisfaction goal set forth by our ED administration. \n      Results: A total of 1591 surveys were returned over the study period. Mean satisfaction score was 77.6 (SD±16) and mean occupancy rate was 1.23 (SD±0.31). The likelihood of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals was associated with an increase in average ED occupancy rate (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.59, P<0.001) and an increase in EDWIN score (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.55, P=0.015). Hospital diversion resulted in lower mean satisfaction scores, but this was not statistically significant (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05). In multivariable analysis controlling for hospital diversion status and time of shift, ED occupancy rate remained a significant predictor of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66, P=0.001). \n      Conclusions: Increased crowding, as measured by ED occupancy rate and EDWIN score, was significantly associated with reduced patient satisfaction. Although causative attribution was limited, our study suggested yet another negative impact resulting from ED crowding. [West J Emerg Med.2013;14(1):11-15.]" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "An Entrepreneurship Perspective on the  Formation and Growth of Business Groups  in the Small Business Sector", "This thesis is a contribution to our understanding of business groups in the small busi-ness sector. Specifically, its aim is to verify to what extent the consideration of entrepre-neurial processes can advance our understanding of this phenomenon. A ‘business group’ is a set of companies which are legally distinct but belong to the same person or people. Despite the significant presence of business groups in the small business sector, most of the literature on business groups addresses large groups. This study demonstrates that the available theories of business groups – the financial and the diversification theories – are not able to explain the presence and characteristics of business groups in the small business sector. Given the little work done on the issue, the research strategy involves the use of both, quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods are used to test propositions deduced from available models of business groups; qualitative methods, based on case studies and direct interviews, are used to get new insights about the phenomenon and develop theoretical propositions. Quantitative analyses refer to the population of Italian business groups; case studies and interviews refer to a sample of business groups in the Marche region (Italy). \nThe business group is an organizational form used by portfolio entrepreneurs to grow and diversify the businesses under their control. By using cross sectional and longitudinal analyses this study shows that in the small business sector diversification is a substitute strategy for growth in the original business. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the diversification theory is not able to explain the setting up of a business group as in most cases the degree of diversification observed in small groups is very low. \nThe thesis demonstrates that entrepreneurial processes associated with the exploitation of new business opportunities by portfolio entrepreneurs play a crucial role in explaining the formation and characteristics of  business groups. The start-up phase is critical for the success of a new business as it requires complete dedication of time and attention by the entrepreneur to continuously adjust the planned actions to the unforeseen events and un-predictable contingencies that are typical of this phase. The legal autonomy granted to the new venture helps focus resources and monitor results. In addition to this and more than anything else, legal autonomy allows entrepreneurs to modify the ownership structure of the new business and give minority shares to people involved in the start-up. The financial explanation of business groups stresses the importance of legal autonomy as a way for manipulating the ownership structure of new businesses, to raise outside equity. The thesis demonstrates that the causal relationship is the opposite of that hypothesised by the financial explanation: it is not so much the aim of raising outside equity that determines the involvement of external shareholders as the need to involve and motivate people in the start up of the new business that induces entrepreneurs to sell minority shares in it, thus enlarging the entrepreneurial team. By involving other people in the start-up of new ventures, portfolio entrepreneurs enhance their ability to enter new businesses while retaining ownership and control of the ones already established. The empirical analysis revealed the existence of three different patterns: joint venture with established entrepreneurs, employee involvement and intrapreneurship. The first is when new ventures are set up with other established entrepreneurs. The second is when the entrepreneur gives a share of the new company to an employee to secure his/her involvement in the start-up of a new venture (employee involvement). The third is when the new business is established as a result of the inspiration of an ‘intrapreneurial’ employee who takes major responsibility for the development of the business. As well as the discovery and analysis of these three forms, the thesis provides a theoretical explanation of entrepreneurial team development in business groups, based on the problems faced by portfolio entrepreneurs in allocating time and attention between the running of established businesses and the exploitation of new business opportunities. By integrating the latter explanation with other models of business groups the thesis provides a more general framework for understanding the formation and dynamics of business groups in the small business sector. The thesis also provides contributions to explain the formation and dynamics of entrepreneurial teams in a multi business context and in situations where there is a ‘dominant’ or ‘lead’ entrepreneur and one or more ‘associate’ or ‘sub’ entrepreneurs.\nStudying the formation and evolution of business groups poses several methodological problems, as groups are complex systems, characterised by the presence of several companies, different architectural structures and a multi-business context. The thesis provides methodological contributions on the ways to represent the current structure of business groups and on how to analyse their evolution over time." ],

Concepts of doctoral research supervision.", "<p>Literature about doctoral supervision has concentrated on describing the ever lengthening lists of functions that must be carried out. This functional approach is necessary but there has been little exploration of a different paradigm, a conceptual approach towards research supervision. This paper, based on interviews with supervisors from a range of disciplines, aims to fill this a gap. The main concepts identified are: Functional: where the issue is one of project management; enculturation: where the student is encouraged to become a member of the disciplinary community; critical thinking: where the student is encouraged to question and analyse their work; emancipation: where the student is encouraged to question and develop themselves; and developing a quality relationship: where the student is enthused, inspired and cared for. Supervisors of doctoral students are also trying to reconcile the tensions between their professional role as an academic and their personal self as well as encouraging students to move a long a path towards increasing independence. The concepts are examined in the light of each of these tensions. Finally the research illuminates the power of the supervisor’s own experience as a student and the paper suggests that supervisors need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of each of these conceptual approaches.</p>" ],

The purposive population was used which comprises of teachers, students and artisans. A random sampling technique was used to select 200 respondents for the study. Descriptive survey research design was used for the study. A twenty- item questionnaire was used to elicit responses from the respondents. Standard deviation and means scores were used to analyze the data. The result shows that the integration of indigenous skills in the teaching and learning of Vocational and Technical Education will improve the quality of skills acquired in schools to a greater extent. The level of acceptability of the infusion of indigenous skills by the stakeholders is very high in the area of exposing students of VTE to practical skills and collaborative efforts.

To produce this system we use the Parasite system, which produces morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of textual input, and extend it to provide error detection and diagnosis. The methodology we adopt  involves relaxing constraints on unification so that correct information contained in a badly formed sentence may still be used to obtain a coherent overall analysis. We look at a range of errors, drawn from experience with learners at various levels, covering word internal problems (addition of inappropriate affixes, failure to apply morphotactic rules properly) and problems with relations between words (local constraints on features, and word order problems). As feedback is an important factor in learning, we look into different types of feedback that can be used to evaluate which is  the most appropriate for the aim of our system." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Understanding the factors affecting e-business adoption and impact on logistics processes", "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize e-business adoption and to generate understanding of the range of factors affecting the adoption process. The paper also aims at exploring the perceived impact of e-business adoption on logistics-related processes. Design/methodology/approach: Case study research, by conducting in-depth interviews in eight companies. Findings: E-business adoption is not exclusively a matter of resources. Increased e-business adoption and impact are caused by increased operational compatibility, as well as increased levels of collaboration. In terms of e-business impact this mainly refers to cycle time reductions and quality improvements, rather than direct cost reductions as reported by other authors. Research limitations/implications: The intrinsic weakness of the research method and the way concepts are operationalized limits the ability to generalize findings. Practical implications: Managers should emphasize developing their relationships with theirsuppliers/customers, in an effort to do common e-business investments, and should aim to increase their partners' commitment to the use of these applications. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical evidence from a sector where limited research efforts have taken place. Explanations can be helpful to other researchers involved in the understanding of the adoption of e-business and its impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Nucleation and Cross-Slip of Partial Dislocations in FCC Metals", "Nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack and cross-slip of partial dislocations under general loading in FCC metals are analyzed based on a multiscale model which incorporates atomic information into continuum-mechanics approach. In both analyses, the crack and the slip planes are modeled as surfaces of displacement discontinuities embedded in elastic media. The atomic potentials between the adjacent atomic layers along the slip planes are assumed to be the generalized stacking fault energies, which are obtained based on atomic calculations. The relative displacements along the slip planes, corresponding to the configurations of partial dislocations and stacking faults, are solved through the variational boundary integral method. The energetics of partial dislocation nucleation at the crack and cross-slip in FCC metals Al and Cu are comparatively studied for their distinctive difference in the intrinsic stacking fault energy. For the analysis of nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack, several new features have emerged compared with nucleation of perfect dislocations in previous studies. Among them, the critical stress and activation energy for nucleation of partial dislocations are markedly lowered. Depending on the value of stacking fault energy and crack configuration, the saddle-point configurations of partial dislocations can be vastly different in terms of the nucleation sequence and the size of the stacking fault. The implications of these new findings on mechanical behavior of nanostructured crystalline materials are elaborated.For the analysis of cross-slip of partial dislocations, the conclusion from previous studies that cross-slip in FCC metals can be influenced by intrinsic stacking fault energy is confirmed. Furthermore, it is found that in Al, the preference of the gliding plane depends on the competition between the two resolved shear stresses on the slip planes. In Cu, the most preferred loading condition for cross-slip is that a lager compressing Escaig shear stress on the primary slip plane is accompanied with stretching Escaig shear stress on the cross-slip plane. The analysis of activation energy indicates that thermal motion plays an important role in cross-slip in FCC metals." ],

This has spurred numerous exploratory researches in the last decade, on technologies that can sustain Moore's law and eventually replace CMOS based devices. One such magnonics based, beyond CMOS device is called the spin wave device. A spin wave device is a low power magnetic logic device that uses a propagating wave of precessional spins, called a spin wave, to perform computations. Traditionally, spin waves have been generated using energetically inefficient, inductively coupled antennas. In order to attain atto-joule energy per operation, which is substantially lower than that of the current generation of CMOS devices, we propose and demonstrate a novel method of spin wave generation using the strain mediated magneto electric effect. We have conducted extensive experimental and numerical studies to design, engineer and fabricate such nano scale spin wave devices. These devices could in effect outperform and eventually replace the CMOS based logic devices." ],

  "title" : "CASES ON GLOBAL E-LEARNING PRACTICES:Successes and Pitfalls",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "CASES ON GLOBAL E-LEARNING PRACTICES:Successes and Pitfalls", "“Cases on Global E-Learning Practices: Successes and Pitfalls” look into the global practices of e-learning which has assumed a considerable role in the education sector recently. It is edited by Ramesh C. Sharma and Sanjaya Mishra from Indira Gandhi National Open University in New Delhi, India. It is published by Information Science Publishing, which is an imprint of Idea Group, an international publishing company specializing in research publications in the fields of technology, management and information science.  The book is consisted of 356 pages (+xiv) covering 23 articles. Articles are related to successes and failures of e-learning professionals. Practical experiences and research on e-learning are provided in the form of case studies by experts from all over the world. E-learning practitioners who are involved in the design, development and implementation of e-learning may find the book quite useful since it might back up their working knowledge on how to design appropriate instructional strategies for e-learning.  The book sheds light on the potential of e-learning in instruction through reader-friendly reviews followed by unique case studies. Case study approach is deliberately assumed since case studies have the potential to present authentic learning situations with a balance of both theory and practice. Both contributors and readers are encouraged to reflect on what, when, why and how an instructional endeavor has planned, designed and implemented. Such an approach seems to initiate continuous reflective thinking on the part of the authors. Case studies in the book are presented in three sections, namely, cases on completely online learning systems, cases on blended online learning systems and cases on resource-based online learning systems each sheltering relevant articles. The introduction provides an overview of the e-learning concepts, theories and practices. It is emphasized that e-learning is a system based on technology and a new generation of distance education, which provides opportunity for both synchronous and asynchronous interaction among the stakeholders of the instruction process. The chapter also enlightens the readers in terms of the benefits of e-learning, design and development of e-learning systems and pedagogy of e-learning.  Section I: Cases on Completely Online Learning Systems Chapter 1: Online Learning with the Use of WebCT VistaIn the chapter, authors offer reflections on various aspects of the use of WebCT Vista in online business education at Marshall University, U.S. It is claimed that if adequate technology, support and the cooperation of educational administrators are sustained, WebCT Vista can improve the current educational practices remarkably. Besides, it is argued that WebCT contributes to the effectiveness of distance learning by improving students’ critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, written communication, organization and analytical skills. Students’ feedback regarding their learning outcomes is also examined which reveals that most students positively evaluated the effect of WebCT on their learning.  Chapter 2: Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Distance Learning for Adult Training in Military Environments In the chapter, the territorial dispersion of military personnel in large geographical areas is presented as a major problem of military training. The traditional training camps require officers to gather in training camps and attend the lessons, which oblige them to leave their units. Such an approach is considered extremely costly. Thus, distance learning techniques are believed to solve such problems. A pilot study which aimed to train officers through a computer-based distance-learning system is presented along with the implementation, results and overall assessment of the study.  Chapter 3: A Case Study on Education Networks and Brokerage The chapter maintains that the educational market is influenced by the increasing importance of knowledge in society. In this respect, universities and professors need to serve existing customers better and to develop new business segments. Educational services can be delivered beyond the physical barriers of the educational institutions to a global target group through online learning systems. Besides, such an approach can transform potential competencies and marketable educational services into more profit. However, active participation of universities in the global education market is considered insufficient. Thus, several action alternatives for the German-speaking area are provided in order for public universities to transfer their core competencies to the global education market in return for more profit and global educational success. These alternatives are provided within the framework of a well-developed e-learning network example and a brokerage model among universities.  Chapter 4: Transitioning to E-Learning: Teaching the Teachers The study investigates the ongoing development of an online instructor training program initiated in 2002. Professional development instructors learning to teach online are involved in the design and the development of the program, which is considered a crucial determinant of the overall success. Academic and administrative issues are well reported each sheltering further critical subtitles. The program led to fruitful outcomes including a core group of experienced e-learning instructors, a new and well-developed professional development model and formation of an active learning community.  Chapter 5: Using E-Learning to Globalize a Teacher Education Program In the chapter, authors explore the use of online distance learning technology to add an international component to a teacher training program. A rationale for using online distance learning is presented along with academic and administrative issues that arose. An existing course in the current program is transformed into a fully online version which involved students from Namibian teacher education programs and students from New Jersey. The aim is mentioned as giving all students a chance to interact with peers. Besides, students had the chance to explore differences and similarities between their education systems. Pitfalls and successes in meeting the objective of sustaining interaction are provided along with implications for internationalization efforts.  Chapter 6: Delivery of a Social Science Online Program in India The chapter provides a narrative of an engagement with the open and distance learning system which leads to launching an online learning package in 2001. The aim is to integrate various components of the multimedia in course development. Using the information technology tools leads students to communicate and interact more effectively. Besides, meeting the various needs of diverse learners became possible through the information technology tools. Well-structured architecture of the program’s website and its discussion board has been accepted by learners. The program generated an interest in the institution to launch further online programs of study.  Chapter 7: Introducing Integrated E-Portfolio across Courses in a Postgraduate Program in Distance and Online Education The chapter presents an analysis of important issues related to the development of an integrated e-portfolio application which was implemented at Massey University. The aim is to help students track evidence of skills they developed during their study period. The e-portfolio project helped students to demonstrate their own conceptual understanding and identify the connections across different papers they prepared. Based on the experiences of the study, administrative issues and considerations for future developments are discussed as well.  Chapter 8: The Mediated Action of Educational Reform: An Inquiry into Collaborative Online Professional Development The chapter describes and evaluates the online collaboration of four teachers in four different cities in Missouri; U.S. Teachers collaborated online to implement an online constructivist learning environment with a problem-based learning unit design. The design of the study is shaped through prior research on technology adoption innovations in the classroom, new constructivist-based learning theories and relevant principles of professional development. Methodology of cultural historical activity theory is used in order to collect and analyze relevant data to identify how effectively each teacher played their roles based on their goals for adopting the new innovations during the online collaborative professional development process. Authors successfully evaluated the effectiveness of the model and developed best-practice concepts for the online professional development programs.  Chapter 9: VIPER (Voice Internet Protocol Extended Reach): An Evaluation of an Integrated Group VoiceIP Software Application for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education The chapter suggests that recent developments such as Internet conferencing and multipoint desktop conferencing may replace text-based and audio/video conferencing software. New Internet conferencing and multipoint desktop conferencing systems are claimed to have the ability to integrate interactive tools. They are considered more advantageous in terms of the cost in comparison to audio/video conferencing software. The author assesses an exploratory study of a multipoint desktop conferencing application called Voice Café in a business school setting. The academic application of the software is named VIPER which stands for voice Internet protocol extended reach. VIPER has been evaluated through involving several undergraduate business studies students, through a dissertation support group, an MBA student group and faculty staff. The software’s features, pedagogic aspects and how faculty and students considered its use have also been discussed. General views of both students and tutors who have used the system were positive. VIPER has proved to be a useful communication tool for both students and faculty.  Chapter 10: Investigating Patterns of Cognitive and Interactive Acts in an Online Student Cooperative Program In order to improve the employability skills of university students student cooperative programs have been increasingly used. Some higher education institutions started to offer such programs online. The study explores the implementation of a pilot program at Simon Fraser University, Canada. The transition from the face-to-face to the online version of the program has been explained adequately. Development and implementation of the online version have been discussed. To address the research questions of the study, participants’ messages and focus group interviews were transcribed and analyzed. The pilot group found the online program an effective tool to support cooperation and develop employability skills. Most participants believed that the program helped them to develop several skills such as problem defining and solving, planning and goal setting, interpersonal communication, self-assessment and peer-feedback skills. Several contributive recommendations regarding the packaging of the program have been presented as well.  Section II: Cases on Blended Online Learning Systems Chapter 11: Learning Sport Management through Interaction with the Real World The chapter describes the development of a course in sport administration. Eight sport organizations provided a variety of documents including real case studies which formed the basis of the learning activities. The documents and resources are provided to students through CD-ROMs. Students both interacted online and face-to-face. It is claimed that using real world scenarios increases students’ motivation and improves the learning outcomes. Some crucial practices are recommended for practitioners who want to use case studies in their online teaching.  Chapter 12: Experimentation and Challenge: Online Criminology at the University of Bologna The chapter discusses the implementation of an online criminology course at the University of Bologna, Italy. Face-to-face lesson, online collaboration, resources available on the Internet and online and face-to-face teacher tutoring constituted the basic components of a well-designed and didactic program. Similar to other studies in the book, administrative issues and program evaluation are well-reported. Authors believe that students not only appreciated the utilitarian side of the online activity but they also become more capable of identifying e-learning’s potential to be used in their professional life. Lessons learned from the practice are invaluable and should definitely be examined by those who are interested in e-learning practices.   Chapter 13: Learning Computer Science over the Web: The ViSCoS Odyssey The chapter first maintains that most of Finland’s land consists of sparsely populated rural areas. Thus, it is difficult for institutions in these rural areas to offer advanced levels of computer science studies. In order to meet this demand, the University of Joensuu in Finland has designed an e-learning program called ViSCoS (Virtual Studies of Computer Science) for students who are interested in computer science. The program allows students to study their first-year undergraduate computer science courses through the web. More than a hundred students enrolled in the program between 2000 and 2005. The formative development method with extensive action research orientation leads to the gradual development of the program. Authors also summarize their main experiences in developing and implementing the ViSCoS courses along with invaluable recommendations for best practice.  Chapter 14: Fiji Implements Blended E-Learning as Appropriate Flexible Learning The chapter focuses on an e-learning environment which promotes and adaptive approach toward e-learning. A sound theoretical model mentioning the interactive components of an e-learning environment is presented, which is believed to facilitate implementing an effective framework to support social aspects of human-computer interaction. Institutional and national context of the learning program have been presented followed by a brief description of organization offering the program. A zoom-lens approach is presented which is used to encourage students’ experiential learning. Several alternative instructional strategies are also mentioned to be used without computers when Internet becomes unstable. The author further mentions her positive and negative experiences regarding the program.  Chapter 15: Project-Based Learning in Chemical Engineering Education Using Distance Education Tools The chapter exhibits an experience of implementing project-based learning practices in chemical engineering education through utilizing distance education tools. Project-based learning is claimed to develop several invaluable skills along with technical ones, such as cooperation, communication, involvement, construction of knowledge, decision making and problem solving. These skills are supported through distance education tools in the study. The virtual environment supported student materials for the project development, facilitated communication and monitored student activity as well. The course organization is well reported along with the methodology applied. Valuable comments regarding the professor and student evaluations about the methodology of the program are presented. Positive aspects of motivation and interactivity observed in all participants are reported as well.  Chapter 16: The “Pastoral” in Virtual Spaces: A Tale of Two Systems, and How E-Learning Practitioners Re-Make Them In the study, two online undergraduate media and communications projects are examined and compared. One of the programs was implemented in Australia between the years 1999-2003 while the other one was implemented in New Zealand between 2004 and 2005. Background and contexts of the projects are presented first. Academic and administrative issues regarding both programs are mentioned along with a coherent comparison of the two. Programs are compared in terms of networking and collaboration as well. The chapter ends with valuable comments regarding the lessons learned from the endeavors along with best practice recommendations.  Chapter 17: Using Scenario-Based Learning for E-Learning in Vocational Education The study reports a multimedia Web-based scenario-learning package which is prepared for students of an engineering course. The package simulates a scenario which is close to students’ learning and future working environments. The scenario helps learners to virtually experience how the real work environment should be. The pilot study which is presented along with a brief and useful methodology reveals that all students gave positive feedback to the scenario-based learning package. Importance of animation, video, interactive elements and sound effects for the package along with further development suggestions are discussed in line with the comments of the participants.  Chapter 18: An E-Workshop Model for Teacher Training In the chapter, e-learning is claimed to play a crucial role in teacher training. Both e-learning and teacher training are presented as constantly changing domains integration of which might create several problems. In this respect, the study focuses on a teacher training model in an e-workshop form. Positive factors regarding the implication of the e-workshop model are presented along with several suggestions regarding the domains of teacher training and e-learning.  Section III: Cases on Resource-Based Online Learning Systems Chapter 19: Creating a Multimedia Instructional Product for Medical School Students In the study, it is maintained that most medical school textbooks do not address pain management adequately. An online textbook called TOP MED has been created in order to address the need. Besides, the textbook is believed to serve as an introductory book for pain management. The process of designing and producing the textbook is described by the author.  Content design of the book is well described with references to expert selection, content review, learning points, preparation of the storyboard and scriptwriting. System design is discussed along with technical requirements, user interface design and template creation. Production stage is discussed, valuable information regarding the client handover is provided, and actions that can be identified as best practices in the process are mentioned.  Chapter 20: Hard Fun: A Case Study on a Community Problem Solving Learning Resource The study describes the academic issues and logistics of a learning resource called Hard Fun, which is claimed to immerse students in authentic learning environments through community problem solving. Institutional and student frameworks for the learning resource are well discussed. The importance of keeping students on tasks is mentioned. Than, three critical components of the learning resource are discussed. Intrinsic motivation and cognitive engagement supported by civic engagement are considered keys to the success of the learning resource. The resource allowed learners to pursue personally relevant knowledge in their residential communities. The author further mentions that technology could be used effectively to increase intellectual self-esteem and digital literacy through allowing learners to create in Web environments.  Chapter 21: ESPORT Demonstration Project, Canada In the chapter, the purpose, processes and effects of an e-learning employment readiness system called ESPORT (Essential Skills Portfolio) are described. ESPORT is intended for adults with a high school education or less. It is currently being piloted in Canada. The system assists users to choose an occupation, evaluate their skills regarding the selected occupation, determine and ameliorate insufficient skills and prepare a résumé for their prospective employers. The piloting process is well-reported along with information on ESPORT’s design, delivery and implementation. The practice carries the properties of a critical reflection process through which the project’s components and the evaluation design have changed, which helped researchers to address pedagogical issues more effectively.  Chapter 22: EBS E-Learning and Social Integrity The study introduces the Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) e-learning which has been established by the Korean government. The system is particularly developed for high school seniors who are about to enter the Korean college entrance exam. Successes and pitfalls regarding the system are discussed. Particularly the program evaluation is discussed effectively with reference to several statistics, cost reduction effects, social integrity effects and the systems’ potential to support public education. Finally, invaluable implications for similar prospective endeavors are provided.  Chapter 23: Case Studies on Learners and Instructors in an E-Learning Ecosystem In the paper, authors present e-learning as a multifaceted ideology which is interpreted as a learning ecosystem where knowledge is constructed, analyzed and delivered to members of the system. Characteristics of a learning ecosystem are mentioned with reference to the nature of interactions and the flow of information across learning activities. Population of the ecosystem is introduced to the reader. Then, several case studies within an e-learning ecosystem in higher education are presented in terms of the learner subsystem and the instructor subsystem. The need to support learners during the activities and engaging learners in their own learning are mentioned as critical issues. The importance of increasing the quality of the learning experience is discussed as w" ],

The relationship formed between teachers and students early on may foreshadow adjustment and functioning of the student in later school years. A conditional latent curve model was fit to data from a subsample of the longitudinal Collaborative Family Study (n=84) and used to examine the effects of the student-teacher relationship (STR) change over time (ages 6-9) in predicting academic engagement at age 13 for both typically developing (TD) children and those with intellectual delays (ID). This model was then expanded to include the child characteristics of social skills and behavior problems in predicting STR.  Results indicated that age 6 STR's predicted academic engagement at age 13; students who experienced more positive STR's very early in elementary school had higher levels of academic engagement in middle school.  In addition, the child characteristics of social skills and behavior problems were predictive of the STR, and accounted for more variance within academic engagement than the STR alone.   These findings emphasize the impact of the student-teacher relationship during the early school years, and underscore its importance for later formative experiences." ],

This review examines the kinds of understandings that have been generated through studies of primary literacy and technology reported during the period 2000-2006. It uses Green’s distinction between ‘operational’, ‘cultural’ and ‘critical’ dimensions of primary literacy (Lankshear and Bigum, 1999; Snyder, 2001) to investigate the focus and methodology of 38 empirical studies. It explores ways in which research may be informed by assumptions and practices associated with print literacy, but also highlights the kinds of studies which are beginning to investigate the implications of digital texts for primary education. The paper concludes by arguing for further ethnographic and phenomenological studies of classroom literacy practices in order to explore the complex contexts which surround and are mediated by digital texts." ],

  "texts" : [ "Acute diarrhoea induces rectal sensitivity in women but not men.", "Some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome have increased rectal sensitivity. It is uncertain, however, whether the diarrhoea is a consequence of the rectal sensitivity or if it is sensitising the rectum in some way. The aim of this study was to assess whether inducing diarrhoea in normal healthy volunteers can sensitise the rectum and therefore be a potential or partial cause of the sensitive rectum seen in some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The anorectal responses to balloon distension were measured in 20 healthy volunteers (aged 20-43 years, 10 female) eight hours after laxative induced diarrhoea or under control conditions. Ingestion of an isoosmotic laxative increased stool output from 1.1 (0.7-2.3) (median (range)) to 8 (5-19) bowel movements per day with no significant differences between men and women. In women rectal sensitivity was significantly increased after diarrhoea compared with control conditions (vol to induce discomfort (ml): 116 (96, 136) v 153 (137, 168), mean (95% CI); p < 0.001). This was associated with a reduction in the volume to induce internal anal sphincter relaxation (16 (12, 20) v 28 (21, 36); p < 0.005), and volume to induce sustained internal anal sphincter relaxation (70 (56, 84) v 90 (67, 113); p < 0.03), but no significant change in rectal compliance (ml/cm H2O at 100 ml) 4.8 (3.5, 6.1) v 4.1 (3.0, 5.1) or distension induced motility (motility index) 994 (341, 1647) v 735 (46, 1424). Conversely, in men diarrhoea had no significant effect on anorectal physiology and their control values were not significantly different from those of the women. In conclusion, the results of this study taken with the finding that irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women, suggests that the male or female sex hormonal environment may be an important factor in allowing the gut to be sensitised to noxious stimuli." ],

The transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT. GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover, those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium." ],

Lowering the2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5.94) down to the averagelevel of the Euro minus the Euro-area peripheral countries (1.97), was associated with a larger crisisstimulus in 2009-11 of 2.78 GDP percentage points.

  "texts" : [ "Research on the Financing Problems of Taiwanese Firms Investing in Mainland China", "[[abstract]]During the process of economic development, Taiwan’s Investment in mainland China has gradually changed from traditional labor-intensive consumer industries to high-tech industries such as electronics and semi-conductor. These capital-intensive technological industries all have financing problem while making investments in China due to cross-strait policy restrictions and China’s dilapidated banking practices. China’s outdated banking industries were unable to improve their financial services to develop new product to satisfy much-needed financial demand from the fast-developing private sectors and, thus, creating financing difficulties for Taiwanese firms in China.\nThe financing sources for Taiwan subsidiaries in China are mainly from their parent companies. Taiwanese subsidiaries’ high dependence on parent company for financing forced parent company to continue to use home bank-financing which influenced unfavorably their parent-subsidiary operating financing and created worries that the problem of capital outflow into china went out of control.\nIn order to correct this problem, Taiwan subsidiary firms in China should be allowed to obtain financing or to raise fund locally to overcome the difficulties of cross-strait financing.\nTaiwan’s business communities have often criticized and recommended the Government to liberalize investment restrictions and allow Taiwan’s banking sectors to set up branch offices in China to provide financial services to Taiwanese business. China, however, still restricted Taiwanese and Foreign banks to operate local RMB financing business. After both Taiwan and China joined WTO, the problem might be corrected and national treatment on the financial industries be provided to Taiwanese as well as foreign banking industries.\nThis paper studies the financing problem of Taiwanese firms in China. Taiwanese firms’ use of home debt financing from the bank to invest in China has created high degree of worry from Taiwanese government as well as home banking communities.  As a result, Taiwan’s Central bank have asked its commercial banks to pay special attention to financing risks in China and indicated to these commercial bank to report detail account information regarding firms’ fund remittance into China.\nOn the other hand, local Chinese banks possess RMB depository resources to operate local currency guarantee loans, and become one of the ideal financing sources for Taiwanese firms. Foreign banks have the advantage in trade remittance and financing since they own branches across strait. As a result, Taiwanese firms’ financing strategy should focus on bank selection based on individual bank’s characteristics, historical background, fund-management capability, and build up firm-bank trust relationship with their debt-repayment capability to obtain local financing through private banking channels. Taiwanese firms should use portions of their operating capital to establish local banking relationship, use their long-term good will and business reputation to obtain local financing.\nWith Taiwan’s huge investment in China, Taiwan firms are scattered through out everywhere in China. These firms strive to continue their hard-working tradition and contributed significantly to cross-strait economic development. This study recommends that Taiwan government extends loan guarantee to Taiwanese firms in China and provide financial services to help Taiwanese firms to raise fund and to be listed in China’s stock market so that the financing problem may be resolved and a cross-strait win-win result may be achieved by Taiwanese firms in China." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Crossing the world's busiest border : transborder commuters, performance, culture and superación", "This thesis investigates the meaning of being a border crosser in the Tijuana-San Diego region. It presents a brief history of this region and a discussion of pertinent theory. The personal narratives of transborder commuters shaped and guided the research. This thesis focuses on the narratives of six transborder commuters and one person who was raised undocumented in the San Diego-Tijuana region but has crossed borders throughout her life. This work parts from the notion that 'border performativity,' theorized by Nancy A. Wonders, plays a central role in the meaning of being a border crosser. The border is performed everyday on commuters at the border crossing. Commuters also participate in border performativity in the everyday, mundane things that they go through in attempting to cross the border. The notion of 'superación,' bettering oneself, is central to the search for freedom of mobility. This thesis also argues that in order to discuss border crossing it is necessary to discuss the differential access to crossing the border. Lastly, this thesis interrogates how people situate themselves and construct their culture in the border region. This thesis does not purport to present a full representation of transborder commuters but rather what it means to be a border crosser for the people I interviewed" ],

Although many treatment options are available, they focus on the removal of symptoms rather than repair of the degenerate tissue. However, there is a growing interest in the potential of cell-based tissue engineering strategies for regeneration of the damaged IVD. To achieve this, investigators are now focusing on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which offer several advantages over more mature cell types. A number of problems must be overcome for MSC-based IVD regeneration to be successful, including determining a method for the differentiation of stem cells into nucleus pulposus-like cells. Although this is still a relatively new field, it offers huge potential for the clinical treatment of IVD degeneration and LBP in the future." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "ESSAYS ON MONETARY POLICY, CHINA'S ECONOMY AND EXCHANGE RATE", "This dissertation consists of the three essays that allowed me to investigate three different economics phenomena. The discussion focuses on topics related to U.S. bank deregulation, China's resource misallocation and currency carry-trade strategy. In particularly, the aim is to study how U.S. bank deregulation is related to Great Moderation in U.S. between the mid-1980s and the start of the subprime debt crisis in 2007, what the implication of monetary policy with China's resource misallocation is and how a new carry trade method can be constructed.The first paper models the effect of bank deregulation on the volatility of output and firms dynamics. By introducing a cost channel and bank sector into Bilbiee, Ghironi and Melitz (2007)'s model, we test the volatility change under various shocks before and after bank deregulation. Simulations show that with the bank spread decreases by 1/3, the volatility of output and number of producers decrease significantly. This can provide a potential explanation for why the Great Moderation starts from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s.The second paper constructs a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of China with heterogeneous sectors and resource misallocation. Recent literature has shown that there is significant resource misallocation between state-owned firms and private firms in China. We find the presence of resource misallocation alters standard monetary policy conclusions in important ways. We show that there is an additional real effect of monetary policy--- an allocation effect. This is different from the standard New Keynesian framework, where the real effect comes from the price rigidity. Monetary policy shocks also exert heterogeneous effects on private firms and state-owned firms. Given a common shock, the output volatility of private firms is higher than that of state-owned firms. The model can easily be extended to other developing countries with similar situations.The third paper employs two methods to construct a portfolio for carry trade strategy. The first one is the minimal variance, subject to specific return and weights constraints. The other is the maximal R square, subject to the weights constraints. Using MATLAB, we can calculate the optimal weights, returns and Sharpe ratio for these two methods. By comparing the Sharpe ratio for different time intervals, we find that the overall maximal R square strategy is relatively more accurate than the minimal variances strategy. This provides an alternative method to construct a carry trade portfolio." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Lateral Snow Transport, Fire and Changing Treelines in Mount San Gorgonio, California, U.S.A.", "The mountain tree line correlates with the limit of carbon gain in photosynthesis, a temperature dependent process linked to atmospheric lapse rates.  Studies of tree lines often do not focus on specific mechanisms that limit their distributions, including lateral snow transport (LST) and snow drifting, as well as wildfires. At Mount San Gorgonio (elevation 3505 m) in the eastern San Bernardino Mountains, 130 km east of Los Angeles, the subalpine forest tree-line (Pinus flexilis, P. contorta) has been stable over the 20th century.  Above 3000 m blowing snow and snow drifting associated with the jet stream, combined with topographic wind enhancement, including forests denuded by fires, can significantly affect timberline dynamics. The reduction of surface roughness due to tree removal accelerates LST and lowers the timberline on leeward slopes subject to increased snow deposition. This paper evaluates LST at three ridgeline timberline sites in the San Gorgonio Wilderness that were burned in 1863, 1869 and 1951. Post-fire tree growth response is measured by using 200 m long sampling quadrats that traversed from windward to leeward slopes. Metrics include tree cover, height and diameter data. The results indicate that the LST is enhanced by fire which increases wind speeds, windward slope snow ablation, and leeward slope snow deposition, slowing tree establishment and growth. In the krummholz zone near San Gorgonio summit, recurrent damage from wind, snow and ice produce shear injury to windward slope tree canopies downwind (northeastward), result in continuous LST.  On leeward slopes, late summer or perennial snow cover, maintains bare zones (tree lines) due to tree mortality, the snow decrease the growing season and increase the probability of tree death.  At global scales, the tree line is predicted to ascend mountain slopes with planetary warming because the upper elevation boundary of woody vegetation is assumed to represent temperature limitations to positive net photosynthesis.  An essential issue in the growth of plant canopy is the separation of intrinsic productivity from physical dieback over ecological time scales:  What is carbon gain in canopy versus the rate of canopy removal due to wind-driven disturbances and snow burial over the life of the tree that reduces photosynthetic capacities?  Without mass loss from LST, a hypothetical increase in forest canopy would permit tree colonization to higher elevations than the modern empirical limit.  These findings are applicable to other mountain ranges at temperate latitudes subject to jet stream induced LST, and must be accounted for in the observation and prediction of tree lines in response to global climate change." ],

We find that major gaps exist between estimates of road gasoline, the quantity most often used to represent automobile fuel use in economic studies of transport fuel use, and the actual sales data of gasoline, diesel and other fuels used for automobiles. We note that significant uncertainties exist in values of both the number of automobiles in use and the distance each is driven, which together yield total automobile use. We present our own calculations for total automobile fuel use for a variety of OECD countries. We comment briefly on the impact of these gaps on econometric estimates of the price and income elasticities of automobile fuel use. We show that improper use of the circularity often leads to gross errors in estimating fuel intensity and other indicators of energy use for personal transport." ],

The latter is mediated by a signal molecule called the\n\"autoinducer\". The mechanistic bases of both luminescence and autoinduction are well\nknown in V. fischeri, but this knowledge is mostly derived from studies of the cloned\nluminescence and autoinduction genes expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study,\nluminescence and autoinduction mutations were systematically generated in V. fischeri to\nexplore aspects of luminescence and autoinduction not addressable in E. coli, such as the\nadaptive significance of luminescence. Most dramatically, the mutants revealed the\npresence of multiple autoinducers and autoinducer synthases in V. fischeri. One of the\nautoinducers (autoinducer-2, or AI-2) was chemically purified and shown to be Noctanoyi-\nL-homoserine lactone. The genetic locus encoding the AI-2 synthase was\ncloned and designated ain (autoinducer). Manipulation of ain and AI-2 in V. jischeri\ndemonstrated that the function of AI-2 appears to be to inhibit rather than to promote\nautoinduction.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution December 1994The\nWHOI Ocean Ventures Fund and the WHOI Molecular Biology Fund" ],

We established alterations in C-fiber bundles of the cornea in patients with CMT1A using non-invasive corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Methods: Twelve patients with CMT1A and 12 healthy control subjects underwent assessment of neuropathic symptoms and deficits, electrophysiology, quantitative sensory testing, corneal sensitivity, and corneal confocal microscopy. Results: Corneal sensitivity, corneal nerve fiber density, corneal nerve branch density, corneal nerve fiber length, and corneal nerve fiber tortuosity were significantly reduced in CMT1A patients compared with controls. There was a significant correlation between corneal sensation and CCM parameters with the severity of painful neuropathic symptoms, cold and warm thresholds, and median nerve CMAP amplitude. Conclusions: CCM demonstrates significant damage to C-fiber bundles, which relates to some measures of neuropathy in CMT1A patients. Muscle Nerve, 2012." ],

To identify proteins that catalyze solute transport across the vacuolar membrane, the membrane proteome of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles was analyzed. Subtractive proteomics was used to distinguish contaminants from true vacuolar proteins by comparing the relative abundances of proteins in pure and crude preparations. A robust statistical analysis combining enrichment ranking with the double boundary iterative group analysis revealed that 148 proteins were significantly enriched in the pure vacuolar preparations. Among these proteins were well characterized vacuolar proteins, such as the subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, but also proteins that had not previously been assigned to a cellular location, many of which are likely novel vacuolar membrane transporters, e.g. for nucleosides and oligopeptides. Although the majority of contaminating proteins from other organelles were depleted from the pure vacuolar membranes, some proteins annotated to reside in other cellular locations were enriched along with the vacuolar proteins. In many cases the enrichment of these proteins is biologically relevant, and we discuss that a large group is involved in membrane fusion and protein trafficking to vacuoles and may have multiple localizations. Other proteins are degraded in vacuoles, and in some cases database annotations are likely to be incomplete or incorrect. Our work provides a wealth of information on vacuolar biology and a solid basis for further characterization of vacuolar functions. ?? 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Firm Entry and Exit with Financial Frictions", "This paper considers a model of firm dynamics to study the quantitative importance of financial frictions for the entry and exit of firms over the business cycle.  Firms face a working capital constraint in that they must pay wages and choose labor in advance.  The firm finances wages with a defaultable one-period non-contingent bond.  Financial frictions then introduce an external finance premium into the firm's cost of borrowing, which constrains the firm's demand for labor and influences the firm's entry and exit decisions through its effect on future profits.  I then measure a financial shock, which contributes to the external finance premium, from corporate bond spreads and feed it back into the model.  Under reasonable parameters, the model predicts that entry and exit rates are almost twice as sensitive to financial shocks than output and employment.  Moreover, historical financial shocks account for a third of cyclical movements in output and hours in the United States between 1953 and 2010.  They are an even stronger explanation for the first year of the Great Recession, accounting for more than half of the initial decline in output and hours, a third of the decline in entry rates and a fifth of the increase in exit rates." ],

While the impressive navigation abilities of ants, bees, wasps, and other insects clearly demonstrate that insects are capable of visual place learning, little is known about the underlying neural circuits that mediate these behaviors. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for dissecting the neural circuitry underlying complex behaviors, from sensory perception to learning and memory. Flies can identify and remember visual features such as size, color, and contour orientation. However, the extent to which they use vision to navigate and recall specific locations remains unclear. In this dissertation, I will : 1) describe the development of a novel place learning assay for investigating spatial memories in Drosophila ; 2) present evidence that fruit flies are capable of forming and recalling spatial memories ; 3) demonstrate that neurons in the central complex are necessary for visual place learning and 4) show that silencing these cells specifically impairs place learning without affecting other sensory or motor systems. Together, these studies reveal distinct neuroanatomical substrates for spatial versus non-spatial learning, and substantiate Drosophila as a powerful model for the study of spatial memories" ],

  "title" : "Valuation of uncertainty in travel time and arrival time - some findings from a choice experiment",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Valuation of uncertainty in travel time and arrival time - some findings from a choice experiment", "We are developing a dynamic modeling framework in which we can evaluate the effects of different road pricing measures on individual choice behavior as well as on a network level. Important parts of this framework are different choice models which forecast the route, departure time and mode choice behavior of travelers under road pricing in the Netherlands. In this paper we discuss the setup of the experiment in detail and present our findings about dealing with uncertainty, travel time and schedule delays in the utility functions. To develop the desired choice models a stated choice experiment was conducted. In this experiment respondents were presented with four alternatives, which can be described as follows: Alternative A: paying for preferred travel conditions. Alternative B: adjust arrival time and pay less. Alternative C: adjust route and pay less. Alternative D: adjust mode to avoid paying charge. The four alternatives differ mainly in price, travel time, time of departure/arrival and mode and are based on the respondents’ current morning commute characteristics. The travel time in the experiment is based on the reported (by the respondent) free-flow travel time for the home-to-work trip, and the reported trip length. We calculate the level of travel time, by setting a certain part of the trip length to be in free-flow conditions and calculate a free-flow and congested part of travel time. Adding the free-flow travel time and the congested travel time makes the total minimum travel time for the trip. Minimum travel time, because to this travel time we add an uncertainty margin, creating the maximum travel time. The level of uncertainty we introduced between minimum and maximum travel time was based on the difference between the reported average and free-flow travel time. In simpler words then explained here, we told respondents that the actual travel time for this trip is unknown, but that between the minimum and maximum each travel time has an equal change of occurring. As a consequence of introducing uncertainty in travel time, the arrival time also receives the same margin. Using the data from the experiment we estimated choice models following the schedule delay framework from Vickrey (1969) and Small (1987), assigning penalties to shifts from the preferred time of departure/arrival to earlier or later times. In the models we used the minimum travel time and the expected travel time (average of minimum and maximum). Using the expected travel time incorporates already some of the uncertainty (half) in the attribute travel time, making the uncertainty attribute in the utility function not significant. The parameters values and values-of-time for using the minimum or expected travel time do not differ. Initially, we looked at schedule delays only from an arrival time perspective. Here we also distinguished between schedule delays based on the minimum arrival time and the expected arrival time (average of minimum and maximum). Again, when using expected schedule delays the uncertainty is included in the schedule delays and a separate uncertainty attribute in the utility function is not significant. There is another issue involved when looking at the preferred arrival time of the respondents; there are three cases to take into account: 1.If the minimum and maximum arrival times are both earlier than the preferred arrival time we are certain about a schedule delay early situation (based on minimum or expected schedule delays). 2.If the minimum and maximum arrival times are both later than the preferred arrival time we are certain about a schedule delay late situation (based on minimum or expected schedule delays). 3.The scheduling situation is undetermined when the preferred arrival time is between the minimum and maximum arrival time. In this case we use an expected schedule delay assuming a uniform distribution of arrival times between the minimum and maximum arrival time. Parameter values for both situations are very different and results from the minimum arrival time approach are more in line with expectations. There is a choice to take into account uncertainty in the utility function in either the expected travel time, expected schedule delays or as a separate attribute. In the paper we discuss the effects of different approaches. We extended our models to also include schedule delays based on preferred departure time. In the departure time scheduling components uncertainty is not included. Results show that the depart schedule delay late is significant and substantial, together with significant arrival schedule early and late. Further extension of the model includes taking into account the amount of flexibility in departure and arrival times for each respondent. The results will be included in this paper." ],

Twenty (20) browse species of semi-arid origin from the Semi-arid zone (Guinea Savannah vegetational zone) of Nigeria were screened for chemical composition and Rumen Degradation Characteristics (RDC) as a means of evaluating the feed values of the plants under study. The study conducted determined the chemical composition and rumen degradation characteristics of some browse plants and crop residues using the Orskov's exponential equation P = a + b (1-e-ct). Three grams (3g) of each sample in triplicate were dispensed into the nylon bags and incubated for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours in the rumen of two cannulated goats of 20kg and 16kg respectively. The mean NDF, lignin and CP content of browse species were 42.95%, 7.96% and 12.90%, while the mean values for DM, Ash, ADF and EE were 87.40%, 8.66%, 26.20%, and 5.72% respectively. The mean of the rumen degradation characteristics were 37.67%, 45.17%, 52.99%, 62.67% and 71.61% at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours respectively. Feed that is degraded within 6, 12 and 24 hours may be considered as substantial feed even though based on this study the optimal potential degradation value of browse species was at 48 hours and maximum at 72 hours. The chemical composition shows browse plants to be rich in protein content. Plant that show exceptional degradation was S.virosa with rumen degradation characteristics of 58% and 94% at 6 and 48hours, 48% and 12% NDF and CP respectively. The plants mentioned above were recommended based on their chemical contents and rumen degradation characteristics which presents them to be unique and are commonly found around the area studied. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: In Sacco, Dry matter degradation, Nigerian Browse plants, Goats, Chemical composition" ],

We present an extremely rare cause of neonatal nasal obstruction, and its management. CASE REPORT: An eight-day-old neonate was referred for upper airway obstruction. Initial investigations had identified no obvious cause. Rigid airway endoscopy revealed a large, cystic lesion appearing to arise from the roof of the posterior nasal space. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a basal cephalocoele projecting inferiorly into the oropharynx, with an intracranial connection to the pituitary fossa. Histology showed fibrovascular tissue lined on one aspect by respiratory type epithelium, with mucous glands present. The tissue contained multiple cystic spaces lined by choroid plexus epithelium, with glial tissue present in the walls of the mass. A transpalatal excision of the nasopharyngeal cephalocoele, with closure of the intracranial connection, palatal repair and lumbar drain placement was undertaken. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, with no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage or palatal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This surgical approach gave excellent access whilst avoiding the obvious morbidity associated with an intracranial approach. Nasal masses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress due to nasal obstruction." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Shopping Trips and Spatial Distribution of Food Stores", "This is an empirical study of food shopping trips in Seattle, Washington. In travel forecasting models, land use activities and transportation systems are assumed to be in static equilibrium. This paper deals with the dynamic nature of urban systems, specifically the interaction between food retail distribution systems and transportation systems. The research questions were: how long does it take these systems to reach an equilibrium and to what extent do transportation systems respond to location choice of food stores? In this paper, we examined changes in travel distances to and from food stores with respect to the location of food stores. In theory, if stores are optimally located with respect to the market area served, then store size and market size should be in equilibrium. To observe the equilibrating character of retail and transportation systems, actual store location patterns were compared with optimal store location patterns at several points in time using travel distance measures. The study showed that transportation systems and food retail distribution systems adjusted to each other and the process of adjustment took several decades to reach an equilibrium. During the past 50 years, store size and travel distance converged at only one point in time, around 1985. The findings of the study suggest that dynamic-equilibrium based models would provide a better predictive capability for long-term projections than static-equilibrium based models." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Insights into mechanism of alcohol mediated modulation of GIRK channels", "Ion channels are proteins that control the flow of ions in and out of the cell. They are important in many aspects of human physiology such as muscle contraction, sensory perception, thought and behavior. Ethanol is the most common drug of abuse worldwide. Ethanol modulates numerous ion channels, but the exact mechanism of modulation has been elusive. My dissertation investigates how ethanol and other alcohols modulate the activity of G-protein gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. GIRK channels are members of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family that regulate the resting membrane potential of excitable cells. They are ubiquitously expressed in the brain and the heart. In the neurons, opening of GIRK channel leads to inhibition of neuronal firing. Ethanol activates GIRK channel in neurons. However, exactly how ethanol activates GIRK channels is not known. In this dissertation, I first used structure-based mutagenesis and electrophysiology to determine that alcohols act on a hydrophobic pocket in the cytoplasmic domain of GIRK channels resulting in channel activation. To strengthen this finding, I used thiol modifying reagents targeted to the hydrophobic pocket to show that this pocket is important for activation of GIRK channels. To determine the mechanism of this alcohol mediated activation of GIRK channels, I studied the requirement of G-proteins and PIP₂ and found that alcohol activates GIRK channels in a G-protein independent, but PIP₂ dependent manner. I then studied single channel properties of alcohol activated GIRK channels. I found that alcohols increase the frequency of channel opening. Combining structural models and functional data, I present a novel model for alcohol mediated activation of GIRK channels. In this model, alcohol facilitates spontaneous opening of GIRK channels by binding to the hydrophobic alcohol pocket and opening its cytoplasmic gate. This work contributes to our fundamental understanding of how ethanol modulates ion channels and how GIRK channels are gated" ],

  "title" : "Some observations about the endogenous money theory",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Some observations about the endogenous money theory", "The endogenous money theory constitutes the core element of the post-keynesian monetary theory. The first formulation of this theory can be found in the works of Kaldor published in the 1970s. Taking these studies as a starting point, the post-keynesians elaborated two versions of the endogenous money theory which differ in their assumptions about the behaviour of the monetary authorities and the banking system, and hence offer different conclusions about the slope of the money supply curve. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the importance of the endogenous money theory using a criterion which can be defined on the basis of Keynes’s distinction between a real exchange economy and a monetary economy. As is well known, Keynes (1933a, 1933b) uses the former term to refer to an economy in which money is merely a tool to reduce the cost of exchange and whose presence does not alter the structure of the economic system, which remains substantially a barter economy. A monetary economy instead refers to an economic system in which the presence of fiat money radically changes the nature of exchange and the characteristics of the production process. Keynes (1933a, p. 410) notes that the classical economists formulated an explanation of how the real-exchange economy works, convinced that this explanation could be easily applied to a monetary economy. He believed that this conviction was unfounded and stressed the need to elaborate a ‘monetary theory of production, to supplement the real–exchange theories which we already possess’ (Keynes, 1933a, p. 411). The specification of the elements determining the non-neutrality of money is thus the key factor differentiating Keynes’s theory from the classical one.1 The criterion used to evaluate the significance of the endogenous money theory is whether it enables us to elaborate on and to broaden the explanation of the justification the nonneutrality of money formulated by Keynes. In The General Theory the reasons for the non-neutrality of money are grounded in the store of wealth function of money; the liquidity preference theory is the element on which the keynesian explanation of income fluctuation is based. The importance of the money endogeneity theory can therefore be assessed in relation to its ability to specify determinant factors for the non-neutrality of money that have not been highlighted by the liquidity preference theory; in other words, the significance of the endogenous money theory depends on its capacity to bring out elements of a monetary economy that have been overlooked in the liquidity preference theory. This paper presents the following results. First of all, it shows that the endogenous money theory makes it possible to extend the analysis of the factors accounting for the non-neutrality of money beyond what Keynes has done in The General Theory; in particular this paper argues that the theory of money endogeneity obtains this result by underlying the means of payment function of money. Second, the work shows that the money endogeneity theory gives credence to certain points developed by Keynes in some works published in 1933 and between 1937 and 1939. Third, the work emphasises that the novel aspects of the money endogeneity theory do not depend on the particular version of this theory, i.e. they do not depend on the slope of the credit supply curve. Finally, in the paper the most significant aspects of the money endogeneity theory are presented by means of a theoretical model that distinguishes clearly between the credit market and the money market. It is shown that an important element of the money endogeneity theory is that it elaborates an alternative credit theory to the neoclassical one. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the most relevant aspects of the money endogeneity theory are presented starting from Kaldor’s work, and we bring out the consistency between that theory and the considerations formulated by Keynes in some writings which preceded and followed the publication of The General Theory. In the second part the two versions of the money endogeneity theory are analysed and it is noted that the debate between the supporters of these two versions risks overshadowing the innovative aspects of the money endogeneity theory that do not depend on the slope of the credit and money supply curves. Then in the third part, the aspects that distinguish a monetary economy from a real-exchange economy and that emerge because of the money endogeneity theory are described." ],

Our main tool is Li's generalization of the Kuznetsov formula on SL(3,R), which has to date been prohibitively difficult to apply. We first obtain analytic expressions for the weight functions on the Kloosterman sum side by converting them to Mellin-Barnes integral form. This allows us to relax the conditions on the test function and to produce a partial inversion formula suitable for studying sums of the long-element SL(3,Z) Kloosterman sums." ],

Here, we have begun efforts to upgrade the prototype polymer production system to a practical stage by using metabolically engineered Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum as an endotoxin-free platform. We designed metabolic pathways in C. glutamicum to generate monomer substrates, lactyl-CoA (LA-CoA), and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HB-CoA), for the copolymerization catalyzed by the LA-polymerizing enzyme (LPE). LA-CoA was synthesized by D-lactate dehydrogenase and propionyl-CoA transferase, while 3HB-CoA was supplied by β-ketothiolase (PhaA) and NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB). The functional expression of these enzymes led to a production of P(LA-co-3HB) with high LA fractions (96.8 mol%). The omission of PhaA and PhaB from this pathway led to a further increase in LA fraction up to 99.3 mol%. The newly engineered C. glutamicum potentially serves as a food-grade and biomedically applicable platform for the production of poly(lactic acid)-like polyester." ],

Motivated by an interest in using new technologies in the context of formal learning (Merchant, 2009), I draw on in-school and out-of-school work in Web 2.0 spaces. This work is inflected by the new literacies approach (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006a), and here I provide an overview of the ways in which learning through participation is characterised by those adopting this and other related perspectives. I include a critical examination of the idea of ‘participatory’ culture as articulated in the field of media studies, focusing particularly on the influential work of Jenkins (2006a; 2006b). In order to draw these threads together around conceptualizations of learning, I summarise ways in which participation is described in the literature on socially-situated cognition. This is used to generate some tentative suggestions about how learning and literacy in Web 2.0 spaces might be envisioned and how ideas about participation might inform curriculum planning and design." ],

  "texts" : [ "Practical experience of ustekinumab in the treatment of psoriasis: experience from a multicentre, retrospective case cohort study across the U.K. and Ireland.", "BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the use of ustekinumab outside of clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with severe psoriasis attending 10 dermatology centres in the U.K. and Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective case-note review of 129 patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab. RESULTS: Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 22·9±10·1 (mean±SD). After 16weeks of treatment with ustekinumab PASI 75 (75% reduction in PASI) was observed in 63·0% (n=80/127) of patients, although four patients required concomitant therapy at the 16-week time point. Previous biologic use did show a small, non-significant trend towards treatment failure. A PASI 75 response was seen in 29·4% (n=5/17) of individuals weighing 90-100kg and treated with the standard 45mg ustekinumab dose compared with PASI 75 of 70·3%, 71·4%, 75·0% and 55·6% for weight groups <80, 80-90, 100-110 and >110kg, respectively (P=0·024). Ustekinumab therapy was well tolerated; serious adverse events were observed in 2·3% (n=3/129) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab is a novel biologic agent for psoriasis. When used in everyday clinical practice it demonstrates high levels of short-term therapeutic efficacy with an acceptable short-term safety profile." ],

Emotion based impulsivity represents one process by which the experience of strong emotions may generally predispose some individuals to engage in rash behavior, including dysfunctional eating and drinking. In two sessions, the present study examined positive and negative urgency in relationship to dysfunctional eating and drinking, cognitive expectations about food and alcohol, affect regulation variables, and as a potential correlate of a behavioral task. 1,060 undergraduate college females were examined on measures of impulsivity, expectations, affect lability, depression, alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and disordered eating; 190 returned for a second session involving a behavioral task following mood manipulation. Among this sample of young adult college females, greater levels of negative urgency were affiliated with alcohol related consequences and disordered eating, above and beyond other sub-facets of impulsivity, depressive symptoms, and volatile affect. Negative urgency was especially heightened among females with co-occurring problem drinking and disordered eating symptoms, versus non-disordered controls and females with either set of symptoms alone. While positive urgency was related to alcohol-related problems above and beyond use rates, it did not add significant predictive power after controlling for other impulsivity sub-facets. Results demonstrate the urgency traits are unique predictors of disordered eating and problematic drinking, independent of depression and affect lability. Females who were elevated on the urgency traits and who held expectations regarding the reinforcing properties of food and alcohol tended to experience the greatest levels of dysfunction. Session two results indicated that while errors of commission on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) were affiliated with increased levels of lack of premeditation when individuals were in neutral mood states, SART responding was unrelated to self reported impulsivity in positive or negative mood states. This study supplements research on the mechanisms and risk factors that underlie these disorders, and has clinical implications for mental health assessment, prevention and treatment" ],

We employ the real per capita growth rate as a depented variable and physical capital and human capital as indepented variables. Growth rate of total fixed capital is used for total physical capital variables. In case of human capital; the share of total education expenditure in GDP, the share of total health expenditure in GDP and rate of school enrollment are used by turns. The main hypothesis is to test whether the primal factor is human capital in Turkish economic development. To test this hypothesis we use Romer’s (1990) Endogenous Technological Change Model (ETCM). The Engle-Granger two step co-integration method is used with time series.The econometric results indicate that physical and human capital accumulation affects positively Turkish economic development. But, when we apply model selection criterion, the main result of this paper show that the Turkish economy has acchieved endogenous growth depending on physical capital rather than human capital" ],

Evidence from Northern California", "The sprawling patterns of land development common to metropolitan areas of the US have been blamed for high levels of automobile travel, and thus for air quality problems. In response, smart growth programs— designed to counter sprawl—have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality—in particular, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of crosssectional data shows that differences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows significant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship." ],

Given this industry is experiencing such widespread growth and becoming increasingly global, questions remain about how best to understand national markets, and how this affects the operation of the industry within them. One area of literature which addresses the concept of different national systems is Varieties of Capitalism which introduces the ideas of ‘institutional complementarities’ to account for co-ordination of actors within an economic system. This Working Brief provides an overview of the varieties of capitalism perspective by outlining some of its key features, the main criticisms, and alternative approaches to considering national systems of economic organisation. Overall, this Working Brief argues that the Varieties of Capitalism approach provides some insight into the ideas surrounding the comparative study of capitalist systems, however, criticisms of being too static, failing to account to regional diversity, overreliance on the firm, a distinct focus on the national, and the absence of labour from its discussions indicate that it is inherently flawed." ],

In macaques infected with SHIV, passive immunization with these CD4-directed neutralizing antibodies fails to control the virus, but prophylactic administration is highly protective.

  "title" : "The role of religious epistemology in inter-religious dialogue",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The role of religious epistemology in inter-religious dialogue", "From the dawn of civilization, a multitude of religious has developed each very complex. These great differences among religions make it difficult to find a least common denominator or to talk at length of religion in general. On the other hand, focusing on just one specific religion often causes us to ignore or underestimate some of the very broad traits that religions seem to share. The fact remains that we will make no headway into the question of what makes a specific religion a religion if we do not seek some characteristics common to all religions.\r\nReligion is usually associated with the supernatural or the divine.505 However, the notion of a supernatural realm does not occur in the non-theistic schools of Buddhism and functions in very different ways, say, in Taoism, Hinduism, and Islam. These shortcomings suggest that religion is notoriously difficult to define. To me, religion is any action taken through every aspect of our being to release us from our weakness or imperfection, and bring us closer to the divine reality. In other words, it is a human inner desire or activity to unite with an absolute being.\r\nThe examination of the intellectual dimension of religion that is, its key beliefs is most beneficial when it is guided and informed. Since epistemology is the theory of knowledge, one would therefore expect epistemological discussions of religion to concentrate on the question whether one could have knowledge of religious beliefs. Religious epistemology is simple to say that it is the epistemology of distinctively religious beliefs, but that will not be helpful in the absence of a definition of religious beliefs.\r\nPhilosophers of religion might consider the epistemology of religious belief, pondering questions about the sources and justifications of religious knowledge. Fundamental questions regarding the nature of knowledge are likely to arise in any culture. After all, everyone has some stake in distinguishing truth from error, wisdom from ignorance, and the path to knowledge from the path to ignorance. Epistemologists have discussed, in addition to the defining conditions and the sources of knowledge, the extent of human knowledge. They have asked how far human knowledge can extend. Many philosophers find it obvious that we know at least some things, if only things about personal experiences or household physical objects. Others have claimed, however, that we really have no knowledge. Such philosophers admit that people typically feel confident that they have some knowledge, but these philosophers insist that our apparent cases of knowledge are mere illusions. Many epistemologists aim not to set knowledge beyond our reach or to escape the quest for knowledge but rather to make many of our ordinary claims to knowledge more secure by explaining knowledge. They seek to explain what knowledge consists in and how we get it.506\r\nTherefore, a good deal of the task of general epistemology is to understand the nature of the various truth-relevant merits which beliefs can possess, the necessary and sufficient conditions for beliefs to possess those merits, and the virtues of mind and practice requisite and apt for their presence merits such as being reliably formed, being warranted, being entitled, being scientific, being rational, being justified and indeed being true.\r\nEpistemology in Western philosophical tradition has until recently offered a prominent definition of knowledge that analyzes knowledge into three essential components: justification, truth, and belief. According to this analysis, propositional knowledge is, by definition, justified true belief. Epistemologists typically focus on propositional knowledge. Knowledge that something is the case, as opposed to knowledge of how to do something. The content of propositional knowledge can be expressed in a proposition, that is, what is meant by a declarative sentence. Knowledge how to do something is by contrast, a skill or competence in performing a certain task. Within the last few decades, philosophers have discovers that these three conditions are not really sufficient for knowledge; something else is required. Genuine knowledge requires not only truth and belief, but also the satisfaction of the belief condition be appropriately related to the satisfaction of the truth condition. That is, on the traditional approach, genuine knowledge requires that a knower have an “adequate indication” that a believed proposition is true. The required “adequate indication”507 of truth, according to Plato, Kant, and many other philosophers, is evidence indicating that a proposition is true. These philosophers thus hold that knowledge must be based on evidence, or justifying reason.\r\nThe kind of justification crucial to knowledge is called epistemic justification. Even if knowledge requires justification, a justified belief can be false. In allowing for justified false beliefs, contemporary epistemologists endorse fallibilism about justification. Reformed epistemologists contend that belief in the existence of God can, in some circumstances, have an epistemic status high enough to render it worthy of acceptance even if it has no support from the arguments of natural theology or from any other beliefs. The views of Alston and Mavrodes are sometimes said to display an affinity with Reformed epistemology, and Nicholas Wolterstorff has made significant contributions to its development. But Plantinga has clearly been the leading contemporary advocate of this school of thought in religious epistemology. During the earlier phase of their development, Plantinga concentrated on defending the view that theistic belief can be in certain conditions, is justified or rationally held even in the absence of any propositional evidence or supporting argument.508\r\nFor the conviction that theistic belief is properly basic, foundationalists carry out a reconstructive project that would put our revised doxastic structures on foundations so firm that they could withstand rather than ignore skeptical challenges. That is, for the classical foundationlist theistic belief requires support from propositional evidence or argument if it is to be rationally or justifiably held. However, it is fairly clear that belief in God’s existence does not satisfy this criterion; it is neither self-evident nor incorrigible nor evident to the sense for humans at any time in this life.\r\nThe question of justification attracts philosophers especially in contemporary epistemology. And controversy of this question focuses on the meaning of ‘justification’ as well as on the substantive conditions of a belief’s being justified in a way appropriate to knowledge. William Alston, for instance, has introduced a non-deontological normative concept of justification that relies mainly on the notion of what is epistemically good from the view-point of maximizing truth and minimizing falsity. Alston link epistemic goodness to a belief’s being based on adequate grounds in the absence of overriding reason to the contrary. But for some epistemologists “Epistemic justification” means simply “evidential support” of certain sort.509 To say that s is epistemically justifiable to some extent for you is, on this view, just to say that s is supportable to some extent by your overall evidential reason. According to epistemologist, knowledge entails beliefs, so that I cannot know that such and such is the case unless I believe that such and such is the case.\r\nRobert Audi mentioned that knowledge arises in experience. It is constituted by conclusively justified true belief, meaning that: the believer may be justified by psychological certain of the true proposition in question and this proposition is so well-grounded as to be itself propositionally certain. And knowledge constitute by such belief may be called epistemic certainty. When we come to religious knowledge, Audi says that religious propositions are simply beyond the scope of human knowledge. But the point is why would it be thought that no religious propositions are known? The most common ground for holding this view is namely, that religious propositions, such as that God exists, cannot be known either a priori or on the basis of experience. The concept of justification or evidence would occur with the concept of belief in a more complex analysis of the concept of knowledge.510\r\nIn recent decades, questions of knowledge seem to have been marginalized by question of justification. As a matter of fact, however, epistemological discussion of religious belief, at least since the Enlightenment has tended to focus, not on the question whether religious belief has warrant, but whether it is justified. More precisely, it has tended to focus on the question whether those properties are enjoyed by theistic belief - the belief that there exists a person like the God of traditional Christianity, Judaism, and Islam: an almighty, all knowing, wholly benevolent and loving spiritual person who has created the world. The main epistemological question about religious belief, therefore, has been the question whether or not religious belief in general and theistic belief in particular is rational or rationally acceptable, or whether it is justified?\r\nIn its primary sense, rationality is a normative concept that philosophers have generally tried to characterize in such a way that, for any action, belief, or desire, if it is rational we ought to choose it. Rationality is the use of reason to reach a certain level of reasonableness or unreasonableness. Many positive characterizations of rational beliefs have been proposed by beliefs that are either self-evident or derived from self-evident beliefs by a reliable procedure and beliefs that are consistent with the overwhelming majority of one’s beliefs.511 Analytic epistemology in the twentieth century was conducted as if there were a part from truth itself - just one truth-relevant merit in beliefs, that one typically called either “justification or rationality;”512 and since there was a great deal of disagreement on the answer to that question, there was a great flowering of theories of justification, or theories of rationality.\r\nAccording to Nicholas Wolterstorff, there are a large number of distinct truth-relevant merits in beliefs, and that neither “Justification” nor “rationality”513 picks out single such merit, both are highly ambiguous terms, each picking out a number of distinct merits. Religious beliefs are formed or evoked by experience of some sort, or by believing what is said in some discourse, or by reflection on the implications of some complex of beliefs that one has previously acquired. Here, we notice that there are no rational activities to understand or justify the experience.\r\nRichard Swinburne considered the nature of actual belief. He saw how in a sense all beliefs given rise to action and must be based on evidence. But he knows that not all beliefs are rational beliefs. For him a beliefs will fail to be rational if it is based on evidence in the wrong way or if it is based on the wrong sort of evidence. According to Swinburne beliefs are rational in so far as they are based on investigation which was, in the believer’s view, adequate, and if the believer believes it to be rational. Swinburne understand by religious beliefs as about transcendent reality, including his belief about whether or not there is a God, and his beliefs about what properties God has (what God is like) and what actions he has performed.514\r\nAccording to John Hick, the issue is not whether it can be established as an item of indubitable public knowledge that God (or the divine or the Transcendent) exists, or most probably exists, but whether it is rational for those who experience some of life’s moments theistically to believe that God exists, and to proceed to conduct their lives on that basis. Hick looks at a rational belief in general way. For him “belief” can mean a proposition believed or it can be defined as an act or state of believing. The idea of evidence normally presupposes a gap between an observed fact, or body of facts, and an inferred conclusion. Therefore, our ordinary moment - to moment perceptual beliefs contradict the principle that all rational believing must be based upon adequate evidence. It is not that they are based upon inadequate evidence, but rather that the model of evidence-inference-belief does not apply here. Ordinary perceptual beliefs arise directly out of our experience, and it is entirely appropriate, proper, and rational to form these beliefs in this way. The relationship between experience and belief has been much debated in recent work in the philosophy of religion. This discussion has focused upon specifically theistic belief and Hick discusses also in these terms and his argument is that it is rational to believe in the reality of God.\r\nAlvin Plantinga argues on these manifestation-experiences that they are properly basic.515 That is to say, it is as rational for religious persons to hold these basic religious beliefs as it is for all of us to hold our basic perceptual beliefs. But, more basically, it is the biblical assumption translated into philosophical terms. According to Plantinga this experience is what justifies me in holding (the belief) that is the ground of my justification, and by extension, the ground of the belief itself. He then applies this principle to religious beliefs.\r\nIn philosophy, experience is generally what we perceive by the senses what we learn from others, or whatever comes from external sources or from inner reflection. In the sense, experience is associated with observation and experiment. Empiricism stresses that our knowledge must be based on experience, but rationalism claims that experience is a potential source of error and prefers rational certainty to mere empirical generalization. In ordinary usage, for every experience there must be something experienced that is independent of the subject of experience. But in philosophy, the relation between experience as a state of consciousness and independent objects of experience becomes a focus of debate. There are many different kinds of experiences, but it is religious experiences that interest me here.\r\nFrom the point of view of epistemology the modifications of consciousness consisting our apparently perceptual experience are of importantly different kinds. In addition to true perceptions there are misperceptions, illusions, and hallucinations. Therefore, if anyone misled by any of these forms of perceptual error, he or she is then deluded. In each case the delusion consists in a mistaken implicit belief about the cause of the experience: Applying this concept of delusion to the realm of religious experience, we have to ask whether those who assume that their experience of living in God’s presence is caused by their being in God’s presence are believing truly or are, on the contrary, under a delusion.\r\nIn modern philosophy of mind a major theme which bears on many theoretical issues, concerns the alleged privacy of an experience as an event knowable only to its possessor and the possibility of public access to that experience. There is much philosophical debate concerning precisely how perception is to be analyzed. In particular, questions are raised concerning the status of the phenomenon. But there is general agreement that in perception, objects present themselves to us in ways that enable us to know them. Similarly, in religious experience God presents himself in ways that enable us to know him and his actions. For Alston there are, it seems, important differences between ordinary perceptual or sense experience and religious experience. Sense perception is a common experience, whereas religious experience is less common, perhaps, even rare, sense perception yields a great deal of information about the world, whereas religious experience yields apparently little information about God, all humans have the capacity for sense perception, but many seem not to have the capacity for religious experience. These differences, however, do not show that religious experience has a structure unlike perception. For one thing, neither the frequency of an experience nor the amount of information it yields tells us anything about its structure.\r\nOn the other hand, the limitation of the rationalist way is that the only truths capable of being strictly proved are analytic and ultimately tautological. But we cannot by logic alone demonstrate any matter of fact and existence; these must be known through experience. For sure if nothing were given through experience in its various modes, we should never have anything to reason about. This is as true in religion as in other fields. If God exists, God is not an idea but a reality outside us, in order to be known to men and women, God must therefore become manifest in some way within their experience. This conclusion is in line with the contemporary revolt against the rationalist assumptions which have dominated much of western philosophy since the time of Descartes.516 Descartes held that we can properly be said to know only truths that are self-evident or that can be reached by logical inferences from self-evident premises.\r\nTherefore, those who stress faith and attack reason often place a great deal of emphasis on religious experience. However, religious experience is by no means a purely emotional “happening”; rather, it involves concepts and beliefs about the being that is experienced. If we tried to separate religious experiences from such concepts and beliefs - from the religious belief-system, as we shall call it - then there would be no way saying who or what is that is experienced, or of explaining what sort of difference the experience ought to make to the person who has it. However, such a religious belief system needs to be understood; at least to some degree - it is hard to see how understanding it is not going to involve the use of reason.\r\nFor Rationalisms, in order for a religious belief-system to be properly and rationally accepted, it must be possible to prove that the belief-system is true. Rationalism in this sense implies a reliance on reason, or intelligence, in deciding our beliefs and actions. The central idea of strong rationalism was stated forcefully by W. K. Clifford. According to his opinion, no religious belief-system is capable of meeting the high standard of proof that should govern all of our believing, and so a reasonable (and moral) person must do without religious beliefs. Among the objections to Christian belief, as well as to Judaic and Muslim, Characteristic of the modern intelligentsia is the objection that it is no longer rational, if ever it was, to believe that God exists. Therefore, the rational person will have to make his way in the world without supposing that there exists any God in whom he could trust.517\r\nHowever, according to Nicholas Wolterstorff, to believe in God is our fundamental human obligation. Central to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam alike is the conviction that we as human beings are called to believe in God to trust in him, to rely on him, to place our confidence in him. Central also is the conviction that only by believing in God can the deepest stirrings of the human heart be satisfied. Duty and fulfillment here coalesce. The rationality of trusting someone presupposes the rationality of believing that person exists.\r\nJohn Locke was among the first to formulate articulately the evidentialist challenge to theistic belief. Reason is reasoning for Locke, and clearly he thinks of it as one among others of our belief-forming processes. Faith is another belief-forming process. It, by contrast, consists in accepting something “as coming from God.”518 However, for Locke it still belongs to reason to judge of the truth of its being a revelation, and of the signification of the words wherein it is delivered.\r\nFor evidentialist, one’s belief that God exists is rational only if it is formed or sustained by good inference by inferring it from others of one’s beliefs, which in fact provide adequate evidence for it. But, Wolterstorff, see no reason what so ever to suppose that by the criterion offered the evidentialist challenge is tenable. He see no reason to suppose that people who hold as one of their immediate beliefs that God exists always have adequate reason to surrender that belief or ought to believe that they do. However, for him those abstract and highly general theses of evidentialism no longer look very interesting, once we regard them in the light of the criterion offered. Therefore, for him the fact that it is not rational for some person to believe that God exists does not follow that he ought to give up that belief.\r\nBut can we accept the Principle of Credulity? One problem is that whereas there is a fundamental uniformity about the way we report both ordinary perceptual experiences and the beliefs about objects of those experiences, there is quite a diversity of reports about religious experiences and the claim based on them. Person give incompatible descriptions of the Reality experienced. Therefore, where perceptions yield conflicting testimony, we must turn to other experiences and rational arguments to determine the truth of the various claims. That is, where there are different accounts, additional considerations must be introduced to help decide which, if any, of the religious experiences are veridical. Although the reports provide a prima facie ground for their acceptance, not all beliefs based on such experiences are true. Just as we at times doubt perceptual claims for good reason, we might do the same for claims based on religious experience.\r\nAccording to Hick, religion constitutes our varied human response to transcendent reality. Religious experience then is structured by religious beliefs which are implicit within religious experience. But the question is if this complex of experience and beliefs that takes place in different shapes within the different traditions, is to be regarded simply as a human creation or as our response to a transcendent reality, even if a response whose particular forms always involve the creative activity of the human imagination. Of course the problem of terminology is obvious as we see in many parts of philosophy, and without explanatory gloss none of the available descriptive labels for these two possibilities is entirely adequate.\r\nMuch of the philosophical discussion of religious diversity continues to centre on the work of John Hick.519 He is not interested in the question of what can justifiably be affirmed in the face of such diversity, rather, he is primarily concerned with the question of which justified response is most reasonable. Moreover, on this question, he leaves no doubt as to his opinion:\r\n519 See John Hick, An Interpretation of Religion: Human response to the Transcendent, (New Haven: Yale University and London: Macmillan press, 1989), 172.\r\n194\r\nreligious pluralism is by far the most plausible explanation for the pervasive religious diversity we encounter.\r\nMany Westerners will best understand the emergence of inclusivism and pluralism in terms of the history of Christianity. For most of its history, Christianity has been resolutely exclusivist. In late antiquity, it was a new religion, struggling to establish itself in the face of criticism and persecution. It is not surprising to find it making exclusive claims on behalf of its charismatic founder, Jesus of Nazareth. Of course, Christianity is not the only religion to have fostered exclusivist attitudes. In their more militant movements, Muslims have done the same. Some Jews cherish an ethnically exclusive identity as God’s chosen people, and some Hindus revere the Vedas as a source of absolute truth, Buddhists often see in the teachings of Gautama the only dharma that can liberate humans from illusion and suffering.\r\nHick has set forth a philosophically sophisticated pluralistic hypothesis that may avoid problems of this sort.520 As he sees it, each of the major religious traditions offers a path to salvation or liberation that involves a transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to reality- centeredness.\r\nReligious plurality is simply a fact. There are religious traditions that differ deeply in terms of their doctrines, practices, institutions, scriptures, experiences, and hope. According to pluralism, a single ultimate religious reality is being differently experienced and understood in all the major religious traditions; they all, as far as the philosophers can tell, offer equally effective paths to salvation or liberation.\r\nAccording to Harold Coward, Judaism is an appropriate tradition in which to begin the stay of religious pluralism and the world religions. The experience of being a minority group in other cultures, which becoming more common place for all the world religions as religious pluralism spreads, has been the norm for Judaism for countless generations. From the biblical period to the present, Judaism has had to formulate its beliefs and practices in the face of challenges from other cultures and religions. The viewpoint of the modern Jew opens the way for relations with Christianity, Islam, and perhaps Hinduism; however, Buddhism - especially Mahayana Buddhism may prove to be in a separate category. The Buddhist consciousness in which no transcendent God is recognized and the Mahayana awareness of the Divine in the\r\n520 Ibid.\r\n195\r\nsecular may be judged by the Jewish philosopher as a modern idolatry. Therefore, perhaps the most serious challenge for Judaism comes in its response to Buddhism. As long as a religion is founded on the experience of a transcendent God, Judaism seems to be able to enter into spiritual partnership with it. But if that experience does not hold true for the Buddhist - if it is not a transcendent God that is being experienced - can the Jew still embrace the Buddhist as a spiritual partner? This question has yet to be faced by Judaism.521\r\nThe relationship between Christianity and the other religions is one of the key issues in Christian self-understanding. Perhaps pluralism is so pressing a challenge because of the exclusivist missionary approaches adopted by Christianity over the past several hundred years.\r\nIn the rapidly expanding body of literature resulting from the encounter with other religions, many Christian theologians are concluding that Christian theology cannot continue to be formulated in isolation from the other religions, and that in fact future developments in Christian theology will be the direct result of serious dialogue with the other religions. Although the Churches are altering their ecclesiology so as to open the way for serious dialogue with other religions, the fundamental Christology that underlies traditional ecclesiology has not yet changed.\r\nThrough out the centuries the basic Islamic approach to other religions was to search for some fundamental structures that were harmonious with Islam but which lay hidden beneath the other religion’s deviations from true Islam: A major obstacle for understanding other religions was the lack of accurate information. However, Islam has essentially reached the truth toward which all other religions are evolving. Christianity, it seems, has also virtually reached this goal. It is possible that various nations or cultures will reach the truth in their own way. The Qur’an itself teaches that every community in every age has had its prophet. However, modern education will offer Muslims an opportunity to understand each religion in terms of its own culture, history, world view, and claims to truth. This will have an effect on Islamic self-perception.\r\nTherefore, the religious pluralism of the modern world will force Islam, finding itself in much the same position as the other traditions, to come to grips with them rather provincial\r\n521 See Harold Coward, Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, Harold Coward, 1-12.\r\n196\r\ncharacter of some of its past views of other religions.\r\nAccording to Hinduism, there is one divine reality that manifests itself in many forms. The various religions are simply different revelations of the one divine reality. Hinduism sees itself as being a very open and tolerant religion. But because it asserts that the Vedas are the most perfect revelation of divine truth, Hinduism also sees itself as providing the criteria against which the revelations of all other religions must be tested. Nevertheless, the Hindu view that there is one Divine, which may be reached by many paths, has proven through out the centuries to be a powerful influence upon Hinduism’s interaction with the other religions.522 Therefore, the Hindu contribution to the modern challenge of religious pluralism is to encourage the inquiring spirit and devotion to truth that is larger than any individual tradition.\r\nThe Buddhist attitude to other religions has been described as “critical tolerance”523 combined with a missionary goal. Buddhism has demonstrated a remarkable degree of tolerance and flexibility throughout the course of its expansion. Unlike some other religious expansions, the spread of Buddhism has been accomplished more through the dissemination of ideas than by migration of peoples.\r\nBuddhism rejects the worship of God or gods and the performance of religious rituals as a means to release. It also rejects speculations about ultimate beginnings, especially about whether the self and the world were eternal, and a number of speculations about the ultimate state of the self in the future. The tolerant but critical attitude of the Buddha toward the plurality of religious views is shaped into a rigorous philosophic approach by the Madhyamika Buddhists. If, as the Buddha discovered, the goal of religion is compassion, then, say the Madhyamika, the biggest obstacle to realizing that goal is attachment to our own religious beliefs in such a way as to make them absolute. Based on this understanding, the Madhyamika Buddhist’s attitude towards other religions is one of openness and indeed a “missionary desire”524 to enter into dialogue.\r\nThe inherent desire to conceptualize and share religious experience is too deeply ingrained in\r\n522 Ibid., 63-80.\r\n523 See K. N. Jayatilleke, The Buddhist Attitude to Other Religions (Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society, 1975). And see also Harold Coward Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, 81.\r\n524 See Harold Coward, Pluralism: Challenge to World Religions, 88.\r\n197\r\nhuman nature to render silence an acceptable answer. In fact the Madhyamika himself has been far from silent. His prescription of silence was only intended to apply to claims of absolute knowledge. As long as the limitation is honored, then discussion, including theological discussion, could take place.\r\nThe dialogical approach opens the way for the meeting of Christians with Jews, Muslims, and Hindus. However, the theocentric premise could become an obstacle to meaningful encounters with Buddhists and Advaita Vedantists. Therefore, an unresolved problem for all of these approaches is the Buddhist and even those with considerable exposure to Buddhism and Hinduism seem almost willfully to turn a blind eye to this problem. One possible exception might be found in Tillich’s formulation of the “god above gods” as the “ground of being.”525\r\nDialogue starts from the assumption that each religion has its absolute claims which cannot be relativized. No amount of reformulation will do away with the difference. But, by letting our theologizing be influenced by others we will be forced to greater honesty and deeper spirituality. The prerequisite for dialogue is not the harmonizing of all beliefs but the recognition that each spiritual person has a committed and absolute conviction, and that these convictions are different.\r\nTherefore, the expected outcome is not the homogenization of particular religions but the mutual deepening of spiritual experience within each particular religion, which may lead to glimpses of a common transcendent reality. This shift in perspective had the effect of drawing attention to the universal nature of religious experience in its many different traditions. In addition to turning attention away from metaphysics, rationalism, or revelation, the focus on the humanity of religion has had the effect of highlighting some of the limitations in human nature that must be taken seriously in all future religion." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "PERIODIC DISTURBANCE REJECTION OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS", "Disturbance rejection is an important topic in control design since disturbances are inevitable in practical systems. To realise this target for nonlinear systems, this thesis brings in an assumption about the existence of a controlled invariant mani- fold and a Desired Feedforward Control (DFC) which is contained in the input to compensate the influence of disturbances. According to the approximation property of Neural Networks (NN) that any periodic signals defined in a compact set can be approximated by NN, the NN-based disturbance approximator is applied to approximate the DFC. Algorithmically, two important types of NN approximators that are Multi-layer Neural Networks (MNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) are presented in detail.In this thesis, a variety of nonlinear systems in standard canonical form are looked into. These forms are the output feedback form, the extended output feedback form, the decentralised output feedback form and the partial state feedback form. For these systems, four types of uncertainties are mainly considered. The first one is the disturbance that can be eliminated by the DFC. Secondly, the parameter uncertainty is taken into account. To get rid of this uncertainty, the adaptive control technique is employed for the estimation of unknown parameters, e.g. the NN gain matrix. The third one is the nonlinear uncertainty. For the case that nonlinear uncertainties are polynomials, it has a bound consisting of an unknown constant and a function of the regulated error such that this uncertainty can be also treated as the parameter uncertainty. Delay is the last type of uncertainty. Particularly, the delay is supposed to appear in output only. This uncertainty can be eliminated together with the nonlinear uncertainty. To establish the closed- loop stability, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is invoked. In addition, due to the requirement of the system structure or the stability analysis, some general control techniques are also involved such like the backstepping control and the high gain control.Throughout the results are illustrated by simulations." ],

In this study it is revealed that Holothuria leucospilota remain very consistent in their modes of evisceration, ejecting the same organs in every evisceration event. The consistency is compounded by the finding that approximately 28% of their body mass is eviscerated regardless of organism size. In terms of organ regeneration, the thickening of the mesentery tissues is apparent at Day 4 and regeneration of the digestive tract at Day 16.

  "texts" : [ "Essays on corporate capital structure and cash holdings", "In this thesis, I examine several important aspects of firms’ financing processes in the G-5 countries consisting of France, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US.First, I investigate the asymmetry in firms’ partial adjustments toward their target leverage, conditional on deviations from target leverage and financing gaps. Using the system Generalized Method of Moments, I show that the asymmetry in firms’ leverage adjustments are driven by differences in these factors. Firms adjust toward their target leverage faster when being over-levered and/or facing a financing deficit, a behavior in strong support of the dynamic trade-off theory of corporate leverage. Second, I examine whether firms’ choices of securities enable them to close out deviations from target leverage through asymmetric, logistic models that take into account both total costs of leverage adjustments (as proposed by the trade-off theory) and costs of adverse selection (as proposed by the pecking-order theory). The results suggest that even when firms’ choices of securities reflect their target adjustments as they allow them to move closer toward their target leverage, costs of adverse selection may still have some influence on these choices.Finally, I develop asymmetric, partial adjustment models to examine firms’ cash holdings adjustments. Consistent with the optimal cash holdings view, I find that firms have optimal levels of cash holdings and attempt to adjust toward these over time. Further, there is asymmetry in both their speeds and mechanisms of adjustments. Firms with above-target cash holdings adjust toward their targets faster than those with below-target cash holdings as their mechanisms of adjustments may involve relatively lower costs. They adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from financing and cash flows from investing while their counterparts adjust mainly via changes in cash flows from operating. I also document some evidence on the asymmetric impact of the magnitude of deviations from target cash holdings and factors which proxy for the levels of financial constraints on firms’ cash holdings adjustments and find that the impact of these proxies tends to be weaker than that of deviations from target cash holdings." ],

Exploration into the process of choosing a holiday showed that the brochure plays an important role for many consumers. However, for the travel agent the brochure is low priority, and even when the brochure is used, the travel agent often has a considerable amount of influence. Whether or not the agency is vertically integrated has considerable influence on the recommendation process. Based on analysis of the interviews and focus groups, a model was developed, and tested using Mystery Shoppers. Results from investigating 156 travel agents across the U.K. indicate that many travel agents owned by large tour operators, will attempt to push the holidays of their parent company rather than give impartial advise to consumers.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Ignorance and Moral Responsibility: A Quality of Will Approach", "My central aim in the dissertation is to defend an account of the epistemic condition of moral responsibility that distinguishes culpable ignorance from non-culpable ignorance.  The view that I defend is that ignorance is culpable just when an agent flouts or ignores moral reasons that underlie her epistemic norms or obligations.  This view is a quality-of-will theory of moral responsibility that emphasizes the agent’s reasons-responsiveness.  It holds that only relevant epistemic obligations are those that require acts of investigation or reflection.  \n\tIn the dissertation, I examine extant theories of culpable ignorance and suggest that they all fall short in some important respect.  Then, I propose and defend an account in which epistemic norms play a leading role.  I analyze the nature of epistemic norms and their normativity, and I argue that agents who ignore or flout actional investigative norms and then act on subsequent false beliefs are connected to the wrongness of their action in a way that establishes their blameworthiness.  I also argue that epistemic norms that require agents to hold certain beliefs or make certain inferences are not relevant to culpable ignorance.  Finally, I explore the implications of my view for certain interesting cases of moral ignorance.  I discuss ignorance that results from an agent’s social or historical circumstances, ignorance that stems from pure moral deference, and ignorance that is explained by epistemic difficulty of getting certain moral facts right.  \n\tThere are two striking outcomes of my research.  The first is that reflection on the epistemic condition shows that one cannot think deeply about moral responsibility without also engaging issues in epistemology relating to the nature and normativity of belief, and issues in normative ethics relating to what our moral obligations actually are.  The second striking outcome is that bringing these rather disparate topics together, as I attempted to do, reveals that much of our ignorance is actually non-culpable, and that many of our beliefs about the blameworthiness of ignorant agents are unwarranted." ],

On the basis of a hypothesized conceptual model, composite indexes were developed for endogenous variable categories (telecommunications and travel demand, supply, cost, land use, and economic activity) by confirmatory factor analysis, with the use of national time series data (1950 - 2000) in the United States. Then, single equation and structural equation models for telecommunications (telephone calls and mobile phone subscribers, separately) and travel were estimated, with the composite indexes and sociodemographic measures used as explanatory variables. Overall, the model results suggest that the aggregate relationship between actual amounts of travel and telecommunications is complementary, not substitution. That is, as telecommunications demand increases, travel demand increases, and vica versa. In addition, it was found that the causal effects of travel demand on telecommunications demand were larger than those in the reverse direction." ],

  "title" : "Structural Equation Modeling of Relative Desired Travel Amounts",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Structural Equation Modeling of Relative Desired Travel Amounts", "The “derived demand” perspective on daily travel, which has become axiomatic in the transportation field, holds that travel is derived from the demand to participate in spatially separated activities. The act of traveling itself is not considered to offer any positive utility, and minimizing travel time is a primary goal of all travelers in all situations. This dissertation continues a recent effort to challenge this paradigm by directly modeling the interrelationships among travel amounts, perceptions, affections (or liking), and desires, and, in doing so, asking: why do some individuals want to travel more, and others less? By modeling quantities such as travel affection and desire, I am, importantly, first acknowledging the existence of these measures and, second, formally quantifying their relative impact on daily travel amounts and each other.\n      Five short-distance (one-way trips less than 100 miles) and five long-distance categories of travel are examined, specifically: short-distance overall, commute, work/school-related, entertainment/ social/recreation, and personal vehicle; long-distance overall, work/school-related, entertainment/social/recreation, personal vehicle, and airplane. The models are estimated using data collected in 1998 from more than 1,300 commuting workers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cross-model analysis reveals three robust relationships, namely: (1) myriad measures of actual travel amounts work together to affect qualitative perceptions of those amounts (e.g. “a little” or “a lot”); (2) those perceptions are consistently important in shaping desires to reduce or increase one’s travel; and (3) affections for travel have a positive influence on those desires. The second finding suggests that two individuals who travel the same objective amount may not have the same desire to reduce their travel: how much each individual perceives his or her travel to be is important. The third point argues that the degree to which travel is enjoyed is a key determinant in shaping desires to reduce travel: the more travel is enjoyed, the less the desire to reduce it. Each of the ten models is estimated with the following four estimation techniques: maximum likelihood, asymptotic distribution free, bootstrapping, and the Mplus approach. A cross-model econometric comparison by estimation technique and sample size is included.\n      The implications of the work are largely theoretical, but the ideas presented can lead to very practical suggestions. For instance, those promoting travel demand management strategies, such as telecommuting, should pay attention to the travel perceptions of their target audience. Even though someone may be objectively traveling a lot, if the individual does not perceive those amounts to be high, he may not embrace a policy aimed at reducing his travel. And the same can be said for those who enjoy travel: those who see value in travel, perhaps because it provides a buffer between the work and home realms of daily life, will logically be less motivated to reduce their travel amounts. The survey respondents exhibit a considerable degree of liking for travel of all kinds studied, and this work unequivocally demonstrates the importance of travel liking to travel behavior." ],

  "texts" : [ "Amateur Anthropologists: DIY Tourism as Learning Culture and Accessing Authenticity", "This literature review explores the ways in which the idea of \"the tourist\" has been theorized by various tourism scholars. First, I will focus on the seminal works and argue that classical tourism literatures have universally approached \"the tourist\" as one who wishes to be identified as a traveler, coded as a learning-oriented explorer rather than a member of tourists, consumerist dupes who fail to truly experience the wonders of the world. I will refer to this particular type of tourist as \"amateur anthropologists,\" adventurous travelers with a strong do-it-yourself attitude, hoping to discover something both extraordinary and authentic from the journey. Such desires to find the authentic led to a fervent yet futile chase between the tourist industry putting on a lavish performance to lure the tourists, versus amateur anthropologists attempting to access the truly unmediated reality. The latter part of this thesis will analyze more recent literatures on tourism and mediation, and argue that these tourism-media scholars also conceptualize the \"tourist\" as truth-seekers orienting their travel towards discovering the truth. Finally, I will further allude to the ways in which the advent of cybermedia may give a new shape to tourism practices." ],

All stakeholders related to tourism and hospitality, therefore, gradually see their role being changed and new opportunities and challenges emerging. The paper demonstrates that future of e-Tourism will be focused on consumer centric technologies to ensure that the new sophisticated and experienced consumers are served. Therefore, agile strategies are required at both strategic and tactical management levels to develop the ‘infostructure’ for tourism organizations to manage their internal functions, their relationships with partners and their interactions with all stakeholders including consumers.

Mencken coined “the Bible Belt” in the 1920s to capture the peculiar alliance of religion and regional life in the American South. But the reality Mencken described was only the closing chapter of a long historical process. Like the label itself, the Bible Belt was something new, and everything new must be made. This dissertation is the history of its making. \n\nOver the course of several decades, and in the face of bitter resistance, a complex but shared commitment to expanding religious authority transformed southern evangelicals’ inward-looking restraints into an aggressive, self-assertive, and unapologetic political activism. Late-nineteenth-century religious leaders overcame crippling spiritual anxieties and tamed a freewheeling religious world by capturing denominations, expanding memberships, constructing hierarchies, and purging rivals. Clerics then confronted a popular anticlericalism through the politics of prohibition. To sustain their public efforts, they cultivated a broad movement organized around the assumption that religion should influence public life. Religious leaders fostered a new religious brand of history, discovered new public dimensions for their faith, and redefined religion’s proper role in the world. Clerics churned notions of history, race, gender, and religion into a popular political movement and, with prohibition as their weapon, defeated a powerful anticlerical tradition and injected themselves into the political life of the early-twentieth-century South.\n\nBy exploring the controversies surrounding religious support for prohibition in Texas, this dissertation recasts the politicization of southern religion, reveals the limits of nineteenth-century southern religious authority, hints at the historical origins of the religious right, and explores a compelling and transformative moment in American history." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The core mysteries : Pierre Bayle's philosophical fideism", "This dissertation develops an original interpretation of the relationship between reason and religious belief in the work of Pierre Bayle, a seventeenth-century skeptic, that I call \"philosophical fideism.\" The underdetermined, and often paradoxical, nature of Bayle's writing makes interpreting him a formidable task; I therefore begin by sketching out the contemporary interpretive landscape of Bayle studies, currently deeply divided over the issue of Bayle's conception of the reason-faith relationship. I subsequently examine other conceptions of the reason-faith relationship among rationalists and skeptics of the seventeenth century, and argue that Bayle's position on this issue is deeply influenced by his Cartesian inheritance. I argue that the central, but neglected, factor in understanding Bayle on the reason-faith question is the influence of seventeenth-century Calvinist rationalism, particularly that of Moïse Amyraut. I show how Amyraut's tripartite distinction of revealed truths provides the framework for a central element of Bayle's philosophical fideism, and argue that a small group of revealed truths that Bayle calls \"the Christian mysteries\" form the core of Bayle's philosophical fideism. I attribute a conception of reason to Bayle that I call \"qualified Academic skepticism,\" in contrast to the \"supersceptical\" interpretation of Richard Popkin on the one hand, and the Stratonian interpretation of Gianluca Mori on the other. Finally, I explain the grounds of Bayle's claims about the erring conscience and the justification for religious toleration. Conscience plays a crucial role in Bayle's philosophical fideism, not only epistemologically, but also morally. The erring conscience supports the interpretation of Christian mysteries as Bayle's own religious first principles, greatly increasing the significance of Bayle's doctrine of the erring conscience. If the conscience is the source of one's core beliefs and of their moral force, then reason, though still able to examine critically the claims of conscience, would be impotent to mitigate the moral force of the duties and rights of conscience. One cannot in good conscience, therefore, be intolerant of those who articulate alternative \"first principles\" since their source is the individual conscience itself. This account thus establishes a ground for religious toleration that is independent of, but compatible with, religious first principles" ],

  "title" : "A Simultaneous Dynamic Travel And Activites Time Allocation Model",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A Simultaneous Dynamic Travel And Activites Time Allocation Model", "In this paper a model is developed and estimated empirically of the allocation of time to out-of-home activities and travel. The model has three important characteristics.\n      First, the allocation of time to out of home activities by individuals is the key concept in the research reported here. Since there exist interdependencies among time usages for different activities, the joint distribution of all relevant out of home activity times has to be taken into account. Consequently the model developed is multivariate.\n      Second, travel is a derived demand. The amount of travel is the result of the spatial activity behaviour of the individual. Of course, the exact relation between activity performance and travel demand is highly complex. The spatial dispersion and quality of activity locations and the scheduling of activities by individuals are both important elements that need to be studied in order to predict total travel demand from a given activity pattern. Here a much simpler approach is taken. It is assumed that total travel time expenditure over a certain time period (i.e. one week) for an activity is proportional to the total amount of time engaged in that activity.\n      The third main feature or the model is its longitudinal character. Longitudinal data have a number of advantages over cross-sectional (see e.g. Hensher, 1985; Davies and Pickles, 1985; van Wissen and Meurs, 1989). From a statistical point of view it allows the estimation of model parameters conditional on non-observed stationary characteristics and individual taste variations. From a theoretical point of view longitudinal data are necessary in order to identify and estimate dynamic processes. In this study only the statistical advantages of longitudinal data will be used.\n      This paper is organized as follows. In section two an overview is given of earlier related work on the allocation of time and travel consequences. In section three the model methodology will be presented. Next, in section four, the data will be described briefly. Section five contains the empirical results of the model estimation. These results are evaluated and some conclusions are drawn in section six." ],

Next, the variances of perception principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement by elementary school teacher based on different personal background and different school environment variables are compared, and further explore the relationship among principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement.Survey research is conducted in this study. Take “A questionnaire of elementary school principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement” as a study tool. Survey subjects are 606 elementary school teachers from Chia-Yi County, sampled according to random sampling and purposive sampling, and there are totally 534 copies of effective samples collected. Make an analysis about the study data in ways of mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, Pearson product-moment correlation, multiple regression analysis and LISREL. After generalizing the outcome of the study analysis, obtain the conclusions as follows:1.Elementary school teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement is above average.2.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers: gender, post, principal’s age.3.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of school culture, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers’ post.4.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers: gender, post, and the school size, location.5.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school students’ score of exam, given the consideration of demographic variations of the school size.6.Significant correlations among are found on every subpart of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement.7.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of school culture, and students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the teachers’ perception of principal’s moral leadership. Teachers with higher principal’s moral leadership would have higher school culture, and students’ learning achievement.8.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement, given the consideration of demographic variations of the type of school culture. Hothouse is the best.9.Significant differences are found on the part of elementary school students’ score of exam, given the consideration of demographic variations of the type of school culture. Welfarist is the worst.10.Having explanatory functions of students’ learning achievement from principal’s moral leadership ,school culture, personal background variables and school environment variables, and the subpart of school culture ”social cohesion” is the most explanatory.11.The subparts of school culture are more explanatory than those of principal’s moral leadership.12.The “structural equation modeling of principal’s moral leadership, school culture and students’ learning achievement” is mediocre fit.13.Principal’s moral leadership influences school culture, school culture influences the teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement. Principal’s moral leadership influences the teachers’ perception of students’ learning achievement thorough school culture.Lastly, depending on the above research conclusions, offer some related suggestions to be the reference for the educational administration authorities concerned, elementary school principals and the future." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Breaking the Letter: Illegibility as Intersign in Cy Twombly, Steve McCaffery, and Susan Howe.", "This dissertation analyzes different forms of illegibility in the works of Cy Twombly, Steve McCaffery, and Susan Howe within the context of postwar experimental art and poetry in North America. From the 1950s onward, interest in intermedium experimentation prompted American artists and poets to explore the visuality of writing, and to pursue strategies for breaking down the letter as the smallest graphemic unit in alphabetic writing systems through occlusion or eradication. How do we interpret marks that are variously effaced, erased, covered, cut, and fragmented to resist notational decipherment? The dissertation considers the suspension between text and image as ???intersign,??? and proposes ???scanning??? as an interpretive mode that mediates between seeing and reading, without assuming the priority of verbal or iconic legibility. Such intersemiotic illegibility seemingly escapes interpretation, yet simultaneously invites more complex interpretive strategies that are demonstrated in each chapter. The Introduction provides a theoretical and historical framework for 20th-century inter-arts experiments, while also touching on earlier European avant-gardes, to frame the artists and poets??? use of illegibility in the postwar North American context. Chapter One focuses on Twombly???s scribblings in paintings, drawings, and prints from 1959 to 1968: by juxtaposing his own name (inscribed in handwriterly marks) with the half-covered inscriptions of names of classical poets like Sappho, Twombly foregrounds the fragmentation of the modern artist???s signature. Chapter Two turns to Carnival, composed by McCaffery from 1967 to 1977, as a hybrid text that challenges reading habits by its ???destructible??? book format and complex typewriter techniques. Chapter Three explores Howe???s typographic experiments from her early to later poetry, culminating in Souls of the Labadie Tract (2007), where the cutting up of letters into ???microfonts??? interrogates the divide between text and image. The conclusion reflects further on the critical and cultural environment where artists and poets looked to each other to explore new possibilities for American poetry. In moving between visual arts and experimental poetics, between art history and literary criticism, and between pictoriality and textuality, the dissertation places the concept of illegibility in a broader interpretive context." ],

In the diarrhoea predominant group balloon volumes required to perceive the sensations of gas, stool, urgency of defecation and discomfort were significantly lower than in controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.001). Diarrhoea predominant patients also had a significantly lower rectal compliance than controls or constipation predominant patients (p less than 0.03) but showed no difference in motor activity induced by distension. When the constipation predominant patients were compared with controls the only significant difference that emerged was in the volume at which discomfort was perceived. No significant differences between constipated subjects and controls were found in the distension induced motor activity. Symptom severity and psychological parameters were also recorded and the diarrhoea predominant patients were found to be more anxious than those with constipation (p = 0.04). It proved possible (by comparison with the control group) to identify three abnormal rectal subtypes in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. These were a sensitive rectum (low sensation thresholds, normal or low rectal pressure), a stiff rectum (normal or low sensation thresholds, high pressure) and an insensitive rectum (high sensation thresholds, normal or high pressure) and their distribution varied considerably depending on bowel habit. Some form of rectal abnormality was identified in 75% of diarrhoea predominant patients compared with 30% of constipation predominant subjects (p = 0.002). A sensitive rectum was a particular feature of diarrhoea predominant patients being observed in 57% of patients compared with only 7% of the constipated group (p less than 0.001)." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A pilot study assessing the prognostic value of CK18 and nDNA biomarkers in severe sepsis patients", "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:\n\nSevere sepsis and septic shock have posed significant treatment challenges for many years. Recently, a number of circulating apoptosis biomarkers have emerged, such as full-length and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and nucleosomal DNA (nDNA), that may be predictive of likely outcome. This non-interventional study aimed to assess the ability of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for these biomarkers to provide clinically useful information to guide the management of sepsis.\nMETHODS:\n\nThis study was conducted in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis at five US centres. Blood samples for assessment of plasma levels of full-length CK18 (measured by the M65® ELISA) and caspase-cleaved CK18 (measured by the M30-Apoptosense® ELISA) and nDNA (measured by ELISA) were collected from patients within 2 hours of consent (baseline) and on days 2, 4 and 8. Blood samples from 17 healthy volunteers acted as controls. Levels of each biomarker were presented descriptively.\nRESULTS:\n\nA total of 22 patients (mean age 60 [range, 24-83] years; 50% male) were included in the study. The mean APACHE II score was 24.4 (range 7-50). One-third of patients had three organ system failures and over one-half had septic shock. Three patients died during the study. Full-length and caspase-cleaved CK18 levels decreased within 48 hours following initiation of treatment of sepsis in patients who survived, whereas increases were observed in the same timeframe in patients who died within 28 days of admission. Baseline nDNA and total soluble CK18 levels (caspase-cleaved and total intact) were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in patients who required renal support than those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nDespite the small numbers of subjects assessed in the current study, these results confirm that measurement of apoptosis biomarkers may help to provide clinically useful information to manage sepsis and expedite development of novel therapeutics. However, further investigations to fully assess their prognostic value are required." ],

The concept of achieving an appropriate balance in the labour market between ensuring the flexibility of employment options and providing sufficient levels of social security has been termed flexicurity (OECD, 2004). Temporary agency work, in turn, is seen as a facilitator of flexibilisation and hence a key component of the drive towards a labour market that operates on this flexicurity principle (ILO, 2009). Restrictive regulation is seen as a prime obstacle to the expansion of the temporary staffing industry and historically there have been many areas of Europe that have been dominated by strict employment protection legislation (EC, 2009). This Working Brief outlines patterns of the regulation of temporary agency work across Europe from 1990 to 2008 using one of the OECD Employment Protection Legislation Index measures." ],

Participants indicated having emotional problems but also having strong commitment to continue their work. Religious leaders are shown to have role conflicts and are not finding it easy to maintain their relationships. And participants used different coping strategies to overcome their emotional problems. This is the first study in psychology to explore in detail how religious leaders perceive their own emotional problems and interpret their own experiences, and as a result, a number of implications of the findings and recommendations for future research are discussed." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Facility-Level and System-Level Stochastic Optimization of Bridge Maintenance Policies for Markovian Management Systems", "This dissertation addresses the determination of optimal decisions for bridge maintenance and repair both for one facility and for a system of heterogeneous facilities. Deterioration models are used to predict the future condition of facilities, which is required in the optimization. More specifically, deterioration models decrease or capture the uncertainty regarding future condition. This dissertation concentrates on the use of deterioration models that take into account aspects of the history of deterioration and maintenance.\n      The first part of the dissertation presents the optimization of bridge inspection, maintenance, and repair decisions for a system of heterogeneous facilities, using a deterioration model from the literature; this model is non-Markovian, and its formulation makes the optimization problem computationally complex. The determination of exact optimal solutions is unlikely to be achieved in polynomial time, and we derive bounds on the optimal cost. We show in a case study that these bounds are close to the optimal cost, which indicates that the corresponding policies are near optimal.\n      The second part of the dissertation presents the optimization of maintenance and repair decision for a system of heterogeneous bridge decks, using a Markovian deterioration model. The dependence of this model on history is achieved by including aspects of the history of deterioration and maintenance as part of the state space of the model. We present an approach to estimate the transition probabilities of the model, using Monte Carlo simulation. This model is then used to formulate the problem of optimizing maintenance and repair decisions for one bridge deck as a finite-state, finite-horizon Markov decision process. Numerical simulations show that the benefits provided by this augmented-state model, compared to a simpler Markovian model, are substantial.\n      Based on the facility-level results, optimal maintenance and repair decisions are determined for a system of heterogeneous facilities. Recommendations are provided for each facility, and we provide formal proofs of optimality in the continuous case. A numerical study shows that the results obtained in the discrete-case implementation seem to be valid approximations of the continuous-case results. The computational efficiency of the system-level solution makes this approach applicable to systems of realistic sizes." ],

We show how individuals engaged in development aspirations strive to achieve futures through the collection, care, and use of money, and how strategies of formalisation, discipline, and framing accord money developmental capacities. The liquidity of money renders it a flexible vehicle for personal and collective aspirations while representing risk of leakage to other persons and ventures.

Association of the Schools of Social Work (IASSW).July 20-24 2008. Durban, South Africa.(Peer Reviewed", "Social models are influential in international social policy, treating social inclusion as a central remedy to health and social care concerns.  This promises great potential for social work to promote its international social justice and individual empowerment value-base, linked to social understandings of service users' concerns (International Association of Schools of Social Work and the International Federation of Social Workers 2001), However, social theory encompasses different perspectives, carrying radically different policy and practice implications. International social inclusion policy assumes social theory that treats social inclusion itself, accessed through individual capacity, participation, and self management of health as the best route to positive outcomes. Significantly, however, these understandings are linked to the historical European Enlightenment concept of the normal human being as completely in control of self and environment, seeing vulnerability to the impact of social and biological forces as marginal in human society. The paper will therefore trace the socio-historical assumptions involved in these policies, together with their implications for the exclusion of service users facing immense damage, suffering and social injustice through inequalities,  those who cannot aspire to self-sufficiency, and individuals, cultures and social groups with different values.  The paper will then explore alternative social theories which both recognise human beings as authors of their lives but also heavily impacted upon by social exclusion and inequalities, and will trace the implications of these perspectives for emancipatory policy and practice, which recognises the universality of vulnerability to suffering and social injustice, and the particularity of human difference, across the globe." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Doing Belonging: a sociological study of belonging in place as the outcome of social practices", "Place is disguised, hidden or simply ignored in much sociological research. Belonging, however, has become a focus of sociological concern. This thesis proposes that one way of belonging is through belonging-in-place leading to a sociological positioning of place as an active participant in social life. In much sociological research places have been seen as fixed and essentialised. To avoid this problem, this study turned to geography and anthropology for suitable frameworks incorporating an open, fluid and relational understanding of place. In particular, Ingold’s (2000) concept of the ‘taskscape’ has been used to understand the connections between place, people, activity and time. The thesis argues that ‘imagined’ and narrativised places create only an ‘outer layer’ of belonging and that it is through embodied connections to other people in the place (what I call a ‘peoplescape’) and through inalienable connections to material places over time that a three dimensional ‘ontological belonging’, as a way of being (and doing) in the world, can develop. Belonging, often spoken of as a sense or feeling, is here shown to be the outcome of social practices, by embodied beings, in a material place.The research took a phenomenological approach in order to see the life-world of the participants from within. A multi-dimensional belonging was uncovered through various user driven qualitative methods: biographical interviews and photo and written diaries with families who have lived in one place, Wigan, for at least three generations. The diaries detailed social encounters which revealed that knowing other people and being known are crucial to an embodied belonging-in-place. Taking photos alongside the diaries enabled specific places of importance to the respondents to be discussed and these revealed that places can be passed on, as inalienable gifts, from one generation, or one life phase, to the next. Inalienable traces of previous generations of Wiganers are present in the material place. The phenomenological methodology and the mix of qualitative methods enabled an inductive analysis which disclosed the everyday life-world of these people in this place. Diaries, both written and photographic, together with other respondent directed methods could be used more widely to explore seemingly mundane aspects of social life from the perspective of the participants. The research found that place is not merely a backdrop to social life but is an integral part of the social practices carried out by embodied and emplaced people. A greater emphasis on both place and materiality as they impact social life could enhance much sociological research." ],

Chapter 1: Introduction The aim of this work is to document and describe characteristics of use, impact and importance of existing school gardens and their relations to other education activities. The research questions are: A) What characterise the school garden as a place? B) What characterise learning in the school garden? C) In what ways can the school garden be interpreted both as a place and learning resource? I discuss and introduce the methods and material that have been used in the research process. The research work is dominated by qualitative methods. The “qualitative research interview” used for collecting empirical data in the field investigation is discussed in chapter 5. Chapter 2: The attributes of outdoor education Part of the research examines school gardening in relation to common outdoor education activities in Sweden and other countries. The study summaries the attributes of outdoor education found in Swedish literature. One general aspect of outdoor learning discussed is how outdoor education can be regarded both as a place for learning, an object of learning and a way of learning. My suggestion is that school gardening can be regarded in the same way. In a short historical retrospective the development from the first school gardens in Sweden, established in the beginning of the 19th century in the old elementary schools of Sweden is described. In spite of many educational arguments, often based on John Dewey and the pragmatism, practically all school gardens in Sweden were removed during the 1960’s. One important reason was the technical development in agriculture, food production and food distribution. It was not necessary for people to grow their own food themselves anymore. But in the 1970’s and 1980’s, with increasing environmental problems, a discussion started surrounding environmental education in schools. The school ground was now regarded as one of the educational opportunities for that purpose. Slowly the interest also increased for the school garden as an educational tool, a tool which could often be described as an ecological laboratory. By 1986 there were about 30 school gardens in Sweden. The same year a research project started at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences with the aim to study and develop methods for educational use of school gardens in Swedish primary schools. The three schools included in that project are a part of my field investigation in chapter 5. The research shows that during the last 200 years, there are two periods when school gardening is most popular; at the turn of the 20th century when peasant society was declining and industrial society was growing very fast, and 90-100 years later, when the industrial society is declining at the same time as the growth of “information society” is advancing. Chapter 3: Perspectives of places and learning This chapter is a discussion about connections and close points of similarities between learning regarded as a constantly on-going process; as a creative urge of the human being; as a human expression at striving for new situations, and places used for these purposes. Learning and creativity are discussed as two aspects of the same phenomenon and as two fundamental motives for the human being to understand and form the world she is a part of. By discussing the situated nature of learning, and learning in socio-cultural and pragmatic contexts, I focus on the need for using physical tools, intellectual/linguistic tools and communication for describing the characteristics of learning in outdoor situations. By discussing places in terms of “sense of place” and “a place is a space claimed by feelings”, I among other things want to focus on a way of looking at physical outdoor environments as relationships between humans and the landscape. With inspiration from Torsten Hägerstrand I discuss the place as a combination of space and time, the landscape as a visual expression of a tight weave of relations that allow or prevent courses of events. I also discuss how places respond to human activities and the use of places as a sort of design process. I also reflect on the interaction between humans, living organisms and the inertia. My conclusion is that there are several connections and similarities in the research of learning respectively research of places, such as: 1) Situation as an engine in learning and for the creative urge. 2) The creating of meaning. 3) The development of identity. 4) The development of thinking and knowledge in a situated and cultural context mediated by tools. 5) Communication between people, but also between people and the physical environments. My assumption is that the school garden can be regarded as a weave of relations between pupils and teachers in co-operation with the cultivated nature that allows or prevents courses of events. Chapter 4: The “where” of learning Based upon my observations in literature, Webb-sites, handbooks, journals and press cuttings from daily p0apers 1992-2002, the “where” of learning in school versus outside school is analysed. As shown in fig. 4 characteristics for four different qualitatively separated themes for place activities in school are clarified. The figure is a model of where such activities take place and shows how they differ from and relate to each other. “Text based practices” are often situated indoors. Pupils use books and Internet for learning about things, and at least in Sweden it is common that they very often just reproduce facts and information from these sources in their school work. The aim on projects in the school ground is often to make the outdoor environment more attractive for play, recreation and learning. The outdoor role of the pupil is to be a constructor or creator, for example in building benches, fences, ponds, planting trees and bushes, painting the asphalt or using the school ground for sculptures and other art work. In these place activities the pupils often participate in decisions, design and construction. School gardening is based on coming back to the same place over the year to maintain different sorts of crops. Teachers and pupil are managers with a responsibility for living plants. They act together with nature, where cultivated nature responds to the activities done in the cultivation areas. Field trips have a long tradition in Sweden, where teachers and pupils visit city environments, parks, cultural landscapes, historical places and nature outside the school. These kinds of visits, as is common for tourists, are mainly based on participation by looking and observing rather than by doing. Chapter 5: School gardening in practice Six schools are included in the field investigation. Each school is, or has been working, in cultivation activities with children that are 5-12 years old. One of the schools is British; Coombes School in Arborfield near Reading. The school is quite well known abroad for their holistic approach to education both outdoor and indoor, for the fascinating school grounds and for their teaching and learning methods (Olsson, et al. 2003). The Swedish schools are spread out all over the whole of country with different opportunities for school gardening. They are all common Swedish compulsory schools. Three of them were included in the project mentioned previously. The fifth school is a Rudolf Steiner school with school gardening stated as a subject in the local curriculum. The sixth school is special as they have extensions of cultivating potatoes and onions enough to feed the schools 60 pupils all the year around. The field investigation is composed of 19 research interviews and 4 other recorded conversations. The results are divided and discussed in two themes; what the interviewees say about the school garden as a place respectively as a learning resource. WHAT IS TOLD ABOUT THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A PLACE? Some of the statements shown in the interviews are characterised by: - School gardening need professional organisation and management. The board of the school should in general be more active, and the school garden should not be placed outside the school grounds. - The school garden is regarded as a classroom, living library, laboratory, scene and virtual room (in computers and pupils minds) with opportunities to make school subjects come alive. - The school garden is a model for the productive culture landscape, and a producing landscape, a base for cooking and handicraft. It is a place where the children participate in building ecological cycles and have opportunities to understand more about sustainable development. - The school garden is a place for health and well-being. It is a place where you must work slowly. The school garden means fresh air, beauty and a place for city kids to be connected with nature. - Identity; practical, creative work in the garden as a way of establishing a relationship to places and to nature. To give identity to the garden at the same time as the garden becomes a part of the child’s identity. WHAT IS TOLD ABOUT THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS LEARNING? Some of the statements shown in the interviews are characterised by: - School gardening as a process and a “trampoline” to knowledge, places and environments outside the school grounds. - Learning in different levels, where the point is to combine practical garden work with more theoretical reflections. School gardening stimulates learning also in the classroom. All sorts of children like gardening. As teacher you can never know from the beginning who will enjoy or benefit from school gardening. - The professional role as teacher is changing after working with school gardening on regards to development of how knowledge, and developing teaching and learning strategies. But there is also need for more teacher training, more time for planning with colleagues and more “green support” from the community outside school. - School gardening means more and new opportunities in education, in thematic work and in teaching school subjects. It is easier to explain and explore in ways that books cannot provide. School gardening is learning by doing. It is easy to work with “sharing and caring” principles for sustainability with the school garden as a starting point. - School gardening results in new social roles. For example it is more obvious in the school garden that teachers learn together with children more than in the classroom. That means that teachers become more like a co-discoverer outdoors than indoors. Chapter 6: The function and importance of school gardens The results from the field investigation are compared to the theoretical reflections in chapter 3. How the interviewees talk about the school as place and learning resources is discussed. The aim is to characterise some opinions among teachers about school gardening as a phenomenon. The discussion focuses on three main perspectives. 1. THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A TOOL FOR NEW TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES Teachers understand the school garden as an opportunity to challenge their teaching methods and at the same time as an instrument for testing new requirements and methods for children’s learning. They also understand school gardening as an opportunity to take care of students’ curiosity and the asking questions. Focus in teaching is changing from a teacher centred detailed planning to more pupil centred work. Teachers also understand the school garden as a place, object and way of learning. They see the child as a part of what’s happening in the garden. The teachers also understand school gardening as interaction and interplay between practical work and theoretical reflection. Success in teaching is understood as being successful when using practical garden work as a source of inspiration in other school activities. But success also is a question about regarding individual experiences in the garden (without teaching) as important as well. 2. THE SCHOOL GARDEN AS A SOCIAL HUB Teachers opinion about school gardening is an opportunity for children to express and present themselves in new ways. School gardening promotes varieties of social situations leading to new social relationships between teachers and pupils, pupils and other pupils and pupils and relatives helping the children in the cultivation activities. Teachers also understand the school garden as a focal point between the school and other parts of the municipality. They also understand the school garden as a reason to establish such contacts. But their opinion is also that some of the actors outside school should take a greater responsibility for administration and organising the garden work, to guarantee that school gardening can continue from one year to another. 3. THE SCHOOL GARDEN BOTH AS ACTOR AND A STORY When a school garden is laid out children and adults begin to take care of their school surroundings in new ways. They who use and own the school garden load it with meaning and importance. Teachers and pupils act in the school garden; they sow and plant in the spring; water and weed in the summer; and pick flowers until that season is over. The garden responds to the work that is done. Plants, animals and the place itself “talk” to the children. The school garden becomes a language, at the very least a kind of communication between the place and the people who belong to the place. Practical garden work increases the beauty of the school ground. The creative work and approach to the school garden is appropriated into the local culture of the school over time. It becomes a local culture with educational and recreational aims in which children and teachers of the school can participate. The impression of the school garden is linked to a specific place where people from one year to another interact in physical and social actions, with regards to the place as an actor. And where there are actors a story can start growing. My conclusion is that there are at least three main aspects of the function and importance of school gardens: 1) People always relate themselves to places. People establish these relationships by personal experiences on site. 2) People always use creative actions as a driving force. The aim is to understand and form the world they live in and are a part of. School gardening is a vehicle for knowledge through interactive learning, as apposed to a passive approach to learning. 3) The situated dialogue between people and places, and the drama developing from maintenance and the influences of the status of the soil, sunshine, wind, rain, animals, pest and diseases, lead to the conclusion that the school garden is both an actor and a story at the same time. Children and adults are all embedded in the same drama communicating with friends, but also with other living organisms and inert objects. From a more pragmatic point of view the garden is a story about cultivation as culture. The school garden provides means to understand ecological systems and cultivation – especially for children living in urban environments." ],

Based on the current, light signals and streamer images, characteristics of both positive and negative streamers on pressboard surface were described, which resemble the features of streamers in open liquid gaps. Introducing pressboard in parallel does not influence the streamer stopping length and thus not weaken the oil gap breakdown voltage, under both positive and negative polarities at gap distances up to 75 mm. However, presence of parallel pressboard significantly reduces the acceleration voltage in mineral oil but seems have no influence on ester liquids under positive polarity, while it tends to accelerate the streamer velocity at larger gap distance and under higher voltage in both ester liquids and mineral oil under negative polarity. Generally, streamer on ester/pressboard interface propagates further than on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the same voltage level; both breakdown voltage and acceleration voltage on ester/pressboard interface are lower than those on mineral oil/pressboard interface at the investigated gap distances up to 75 mm. ?? 2011 IEEE." ],

IBF are fitted to rotorcraft to extract potentially harmful particles from engine-bound air. However, whilst protecting the engine from erosion and other damage, installation of an IBF incurs a loss in static pressure that is of detriment to the engine’s performance. The inherent pressure drop across an IBF can be curtailed somewhat by pleating of the filter surface, but phenomenological effects that arise in the flow at high pleat density limit the extent of this action. The result is an optimum pleat shape for a given filter medium in a given flow. This contribution investigates the optimisation process for IBF with respect to IBF performance, which is assessed through three identified factors: pressure drop, capture efficiency and filter holding capacity; and makes provision for IBF Design in order that the IBF may be of maximum benefit to the engine." ],

Yi Song-mi argues that the style of the paintings correspond to a European sensibility that was not known in Korea in the late eighteenth century, whereas, Oh Ju-seok does not question the attribution to Kim Hongdo or the early dating of the album to ca. 1788. This debate contests Kim's progressive role in the development of the genre of true scenery painting as well as the extent to which Korean artists utilized European techniques and styles at the end of the eighteenth century. \tIn order to understand whether Kim's painting is truly an anomaly, I examine the development of true scenery painting through two other major figures, Ch&#335;ng S&#335;n (1676-1759) and Kang Sehwang (1713-1776), with special attention as to the extent to which they integrate and expand on tradition. I also compare Kim's album with his set of eight hanging scrolls (ca. 1788) that contain similar techniques, styles, and calligraphic elements. My research indicates that both Ch&#335;ng and Kang were keen innovators in the true-scenery genre, experimenting with many of the European techniques and styles that appear in the Four Districts album. In addition, Kim's set of eight hanging scrolls confirm that he used a similarly detailed style of painting for other commissions and that there may be calligraphic evidence to prove that the contested album is by his same hand. Although the true origin of the album may never be proven, my research indicates that it sits comfortably within the development of true-scenery painting in the eighteenth century as well as Kim's oeuvre of landscape works." ],

  "texts" : [ "Travel-associated sexually transmitted infections: an observational cross-sectional study of the GeoSentinel surveillance database", "BACKGROUND: Travel is thought to be a risk factor for the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but no multicentre analyses have been done. We aimed to describe the range of diseases and the demographic and geographical factors associated with the acquisition of travel-related STIs through analysis of the data gathered by GeoSentinel travel medicine clinics worldwide. \r\nMETHODS: We gathered data from ill travellers visiting GeoSentinel clinics worldwide between June 1, 1996, and Nov 30, 2010, and analysed them to identify STIs in three clinical settings: after travel, during travel, or immigration travel. We calculated proportionate morbidity for each of the three traveller groups and did logistic regression to assess the association between STIs and demographic, geographical, and travel variables. \r\nFINDINGS: Our final analysis was of 112 180 ill travellers-64 335 patients seen after travel, 38 287 patients seen during travel, and 9558 immigrant patients. 974 patients (0·9%) had diagnoses of STIs, and 1001 STIs were diagnosed. The proportionate STI morbidities were 6·6, 10·2, and 16·8 per 1000 travellers in the three groups, respectively. STIs varied substantially according to the traveller category. The most common STI diagnoses were non-gonococcal or unspecified urethritis (30·2%) and acute HIV infection (27·6%) in patients seen after travel; non-gonococcal or unspecified urethritis (21·1%), epididymitis (15·2%), and cervicitis (12·3%) in patients seen during travel; and syphilis in immigrant travellers (67·8%). In ill travellers seen after travel, significant associations were noted between diagnosis of STIs and male sex, travelling to visit friends or relatives, travel duration of less than 1 month, and not having pretravel health consultations. \r\nINTERPRETATION: The range of STIs varies substantially according to traveller category. STI preventive strategies should be particularly targeted at men and travellers visiting friends or relatives. Our data suggest target groups for pretravel interventions and should assist in post-travel screening and decision making. \r\nFUNDING: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and International Society of Travel Medicine." ],

New advanced information and communication technology (ICT) influences all aspects of human life. One of the main applications of e-learning which captivates and fascinates so many researchers in the field of education is “Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL)”. According to Stahl (2003), CSCL environments are tools designed to support the building of shared knowledge and knowledge negotiation. In CSCL environments students try to learn collaboratively through the Web and they practice working in distributed teams which seems to be a crucial competency for living in a networked society. Although, theoretically, e-learning and CSCL environments are seen as powerful tools for learning processes, the results of empirical research in the field are contradictory. While some research in the field reported low levels of participation, interaction and depth of learning, many studies described and concluded positive effects of CSCL environments, positive effects of face-to-face teaching supported by CSCL applications, and positive effects of CSCL environments applied in combination with face-to-face learning situations.   This dissertation reports a PhD study which concentrated on performing tasks in asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environments as a blended learning approach for on-campus students. The blended learning approach, which aims at integrating e-learning techniques and traditional teaching methods, is seen as a way to improve the quality of education and reduce the costs of education for all students. The blended learning approach in higher education is a combination of regular, conventional, face-to-face and individual learning activities with web-based learning activities. It aims at integrating different learning approaches and modes of course material delivery into education. The current PhD project was designed to investigate students’ processes of learning (knowledge construction) and learning outcomes (quality of constructed knowledge) while performing different study tasks in university courses in which CSCL has been implemented. More specifically, the main objective of the study was to investigate the implementation of ACSCL environments in conventional face-to-face and on-campus higher education following a blended learning approach. The following research questions were addressed:  <ol type=\"1\"> <li>What is the current use of e-learning environments in general and CSCL environments in particular in higher education?</li> <li>What is the opinion of teachers about e-learning environments in general and CSCL environments in particular in higher education?</li> <li>What is the opinion of students about implementing tasks in ACSCL environments in higher education?</li> <li>How do students participate in learning processes and knowledge construction while performing tasks in ACSCL environments? </li> <li>How can peer group feedback, supported by ACSCL, improve learning quality and facilitate learning processes?</li> </ol> The dissertation is composed of four different studies which address several specific research questions to investigate different aspects of implementing ACSCL in higher education. The first two studies concern two main parties involved in the process of learning: teachers and students. The third study aims at exploring the process of knowledge construction and quality of learning outcomes while performing tasks in ACSCL environments, and finally, the fourth study is designed to investigate the effect of PGF supported by ACSCL on the process of learning. <b> </b>  <b>Study 1: teachers’ use of e-learning environments</b>   The purpose of the first study was to investigate teachers’ use of e-learning environments as teaching and learning tools in higher education and to explore factors which explain teachers’ use of those e-learning environments. In the study the following research questions were formulated:  1.                  Which functions of e-learning environments do teachers most often use? 2.                  What added value do teachers perceive of e-learning environments? 3.                  Which factors influence teachers’ use of different functions and capabilities of e-learning environments? 4.         What are the barriers for implementing e-learning environments in the learning process?   In e-learning environments, general course information functions (like course calendar and schedule and course announcement and news), content management functions (like presenting course material and literature and PowerPoint presentations) and non-interactive communication functions (like mail and mailing lists) are used most frequently. Other communication functions (like video conferencing, chatting, and voice conferencing) and collaboration functions (like online discussion, online collaboration, shared whiteboard, and application sharing) are the least used features of the e-learning environments.  Comparable to the pattern of the actual use of e-learning environments mentioned above, results indicate that teachers believe that presentation of course materials and literature, presentation of information about the courses, PowerPoint presentations, and E-mail have the most added value for teaching and learning processes. Voice conferencing, shared whiteboard, videoconferencing and net-meetings are believed to have the least added value for teaching and learning processes. The assumed added value of online discussion and online collaboration is low as well. In addition, teachers believe they do not face serious technical problems when working with ICT tools and e-learning environments. Finally, teachers are satisfied with the facilities and connectivity but they feel that they do not have access to relevant software, websites and content.  Running exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis we identified  different factors like Knowledge Construction Teaching and Learning Approach (KC), Teachers’ Opinion about Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), Teachers’ Opinion about Web-based Activities (WA), Ease of Use (perceived difficulty), and Time which might contribute to the explanation of teachers’ actual use of e-learning environments (USE). We found that a teacher’s previous experience with e-learning environments, WA, CAL, and ease of use can help us to explain teachers’ perceptions of the added value and usefulness of e-learning environments and their actual use of these environments. At the end, we were able to introduce the Teachers’ Use of E-learning Environments Model (USE Model) which consists of Teachers’ Opinions about Web-based Activities (WA) and Teachers’ Opinions about Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) as predictors, and Teachers’ Perceived Added Value of E-learning Environments (AV) as the mediating variable.    <b>Study 2: Student satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, performing tasks in ACSCL environments</b> The second study was aimed at investigating student satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, performing asynchronous online collaborative learning tasks in courses in higher education. The specific questions addressed in this study were: 1.                  Are on-campus students satisfied with performing learning tasks in this asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)? 2.                  Do on-campus students perceive any added value of performing learning tasks in an asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)? 3.                  What factors influence student satisfaction with, and perceived learning in, this asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (ACSCLE)?   Overall, 61.5% of the students were satisfied with their learning experiences with ACSCLE in their courses and, on average, 43.5% of the students agreed with all the items concerning their satisfaction with different aspects of performing tasks in the ACSCLE; with 45.7% of the students taking a neutral position. From the students’ points of view there were no differences between F2F and asynchronous online collaboration in terms of difficulty of performing tasks and perception of learning. These results led to the conclusion that students evaluate the quality of asynchronous online collaborative learning as equal to the quality of F2F learning. In total, 30.35% of the students positively agreed with all the statements meant to capture their opinions about the learning effects of performing tasks in ACSCLE and 50.35% of them were neutral (Mean=3.12).     <b>Study 3: Students’ learning activities and quality of knowledge construction while performing tasks in ACSCL environments</b> The third study was conducted to explore how on-campus university students in the context of green (food, animal, plant, social and environmental) sciences collaborate and construct knowledge in asynchronous CSCL environments. Therefore, attention was paid to learning activities during the process of knowledge construction. Moreover, we analysed students’ participation and quality of knowledge construction while performing collaborative tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments. The following research questions were addressed with respect to students performing collaborative tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments:  <ol type=\"1\"> <li>To what extent do on-campus students participate in the process of knowledge construction? </li> <li>How can on-campus students’ learning and how can knowledge construction processes be characterised in terms of cognitive, affective, and meta-cognitive learning activities?</li> <li>What is the quality of the constructed knowledge? </li> <li>Are there any changes in on-campus students’ learning activities over time and what are the patterns of those changes?</li> <li>Are there any differences in students’ learning activities in different courses and settings?   </li> </ol>   Considering the fact that, on average, students wrote two notes and read fifty five notes per week, we concluded that students’ active participation in the learning environment was rather/fairly successful and their passive participation was quite successful. We also found that while, on average, each note was read 26.7 times and those contributions written in the first week were read more (Mean =60.4) than notes written in the last weeks (Mean = 5.17). Through content analysis of the students’ written notes and learning activities by means of a coding scheme developed by Veldhuis-Diermanse, 89.2 % of students’ contributions were coded as cognitive learning activities, 8.4 % as meta-cognitive and 2.1 % as affective learning activities. Looking at the subcategories of the coding scheme, we found that ‘debating’ in the cognitive category and ‘keeping clarity’ in the meta-cognitive category appeared more. Another coding scheme was used to assess the quality of students’ contributions. For each of the four quality levels (levels increasing from D to A) corresponding verbs were identified and described. Our findings showed that 75.1 % of students’ contributions were assessed as level B, which is reasonably high, 6.1 % as Level D (lowest quality) and 7.7 % as level A (highest quality) and 11.1 % as level C. Conducting in-depth interviews and focus groups with participants and looking at the open questions of the questionnaire, we concluded that task structure, level of support that students receive, teacher’s role, task complexity, and group composition, which can all be discussed under the term ‘scripting CSCL’, are the main factors that students believed to be important for their learning activities and the quality of their contributions to ACSCL environments.    <b>Study 4: Asynchronous Computer-Supported Peer Group Feedback in Higher Education</b>  In the forth study we concentrated on the application of peer group feedback in face-to-face class meetings and asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning (ACSCL) environments. More specifically, we surveyed student participation in, satisfaction with, and perceived learning effects of, participating in peer group feedback and studied functions and quality of student contributions to the PGF processes in both F2F and ACS conditions. For this purpose the following research questions were formulated: 1. To what extent do students participate in Peer Group Feedback (PGF) in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions? 2. What are students' perceptions of the value of Peer Group Feedback (PGF) in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions? 3. What is the function of the students' feedback in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions during Peer Group feedback (PGF)?  4. What is the quality of the students' feedback in both Asynchronous Computer-Supported (ACS) and Face to Face (F2F) conditions during Peer Group feedback (PGF)? Our findings revealed that students in the ACS-PGF condition participated more in the process of feedback and all students were active (the distribution was better). In F2F conditions some students took over the discussions and teachers contributed more. The minimum amount of contributions under ACS conditions was much higher than under F2F conditions. We also found that students in both conditions were satisfied with participating in group feedback and perceived PGF as effective for learning. Students in ACS groups were positive, to a higher level, about the quality of PGF and its added value. However, there was no significant difference between students’ perceptions of the effect of PGF on motivation, interaction, and satisfaction.  We found that both ACS and F2F conditions differed with respect to students’ contributions. For example, the students’ notes posted in the ACS groups were significantly clearer, more structured, and more to the point than students’ utterances in F2F groups. Students in ACS conditions posted more notes that were encoded as “evaluation/criticism” and as “motivate/praise” than students in F2F conditions.    <b>Concluding remarks</b> From the study the conclusion can be drawn that although well-arranged technical support and reliable infrastructure are important for teachers’ use of e-learning environments, they are not enough. A teachers’ first experience with using e-learning environments and their attitude toward ICT are more important. Moreover, those who use e-learning environments most frequently use non-interactive and superficial features and functions. Interactive features, like CSCL, are rarely used. It seems that, in practice, more attention has been paid to the technological aspects of e-learning than to the pedagogical aspects and, as a result, these advanced learning environments have only been considered as tools to facilitate traditional learning and teaching approaches. Tasks in CSCL environments need more attention than in face to face collaborative learning. In order to integrate CSCL effectively into the learning process characteristics/issues like structure and the level of structuring of the task, complexity of the learning process, task complexity, the formulation of the task, support that learners receive, and the way that they receive that support are very important. Based on our study the conclusion is justified that, as a blended learning approach, integrating asynchronous CSCL environments can effectively engage students in the process of learning. Implementing tasks in CSCL environments increases students’ participation in learning activities and their interaction with each other and with their teachers outside of class time. We also conclude that asynchronous CSCL does not only foster more students’ participation, but more equal participation, in the learning process and might be used successfully to encourage and engage the silent side of the class into the processes of discussion and collaboration. The results of the study lead us to the conclusion that ACSCL environments can foster higher-order learning skills. However, we should remember that the quality of discussion was significantly related to the design and setting of the course. Learning to work in distributed teams is one of the main competencies that should be developed in higher education to prepare students for working in a knowledge and network society. The findings of this study revealed that performing tasks in asynchronous CSCL environments has the potential to increase the level of participation and interaction among students and to foster processes of shared and social knowledge construction. Performing these kinds of tasks has the potential to provide a meaningful supplement to conventional teaching and learning approaches and can help teachers to overcome the limitations of face-to-face collaboration and discussion.  We conclude that following a blended learning approach and taking course objectives into consideration, we can benefit from the added value of e-learning and CSCL environments. For example, our fourth study revealed that ACSCL can enable teachers to successfully embed ‘formative assessment’ and ‘process-oriented feedback’ (which aims at learning rather than assessment) into the learning process. As stated before, the quality of students’ contributions in groups operating under ACS conditions was significantly higher than in F2F groups and they posted more critical comments. This allows us to conclude that asking students to conduct tasks in CSCL environments and combining these activities within the learning process can improve depth of learning and critical thinking.  It is commonly expected that in ACSCL environments students benefit from “asynchronicity” of the environment. By reading background literature in the field and written course material, and thinking deeply about the topic, students can provide in-depth and well-grounded “delayed feedback”. However our study showed that this is not the normal strategy followed by students. In other words, first we need to learn how students work in ACSCL environments, which is not necessarily as we expect, and second to develop an instructional design and script CSCL activities in a way that persuades students to take advantage of the power of ACSCL environments. Without doing so CSCL environments will lose one of their main advantages over conventional F2F conditions.                                                      " ],

  "texts" : [ "Identification of changes needed in supermarket design for", "Supermarkets use 3% of UK energy. To satisfy building regulations supermarket buildings are modeled in considerable detail. Lighting, occupancy, and small electrical energy impacts are included in this modeling. However, refrigeration energy is not, as it is classified as “process energy” rather than “building related”. Refrigeration energy, which can be very significant, is therefore currently “unregulated” and as a result, heat transfers related to refrigeration cabinets are typically not incorporated in modeling of the building at design stage. This paper explores the comparative energy demands of supermarket stores modeled, using a simple first-order dynamic model, executed on Excel, and “optimized” firstly with, and secondly without, the cooling effect of refrigeration cabinets included in the model. A recently built supermarket is modeled. Results suggest that the energy demand of a new store could be reduced by 15-25% by improvement of the building envelope design with process energy included in the modeling." ],

  "texts" : [ "Crossing borders and industry sectors: Behavioral governance in strategic alliances and product innovation for competitive advantage", "This paper investigates governance mechanisms in international technology alliances (ITAs), firm-level innovation capabilities, and performance outcomes in the mobile computing market. This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research." ],

  "title" : "Environmental assessment of imported organic products - focusing on orange juice from Brazil and soybeans from China",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Environmental assessment of imported organic products - focusing on orange juice from Brazil and soybeans from China", "The import of organic products to Denmark has seen a four to five fold increase during the last seven years,\r\ndue to a growing demand for organic products. Globally, the market for organic food and drinks has also\r\nmore than doubled during the same period. The global organic agricultural land has concurrently expanded\r\nfrom 26 to 35 million hectares, mostly due to major conversions in Argentina, China, India, Australia, USA\r\nand Brazil. While Europe and North America still makes up the major markets for organic food and drink,\r\nthe extraordinary growth in the organic markets offers export opportunities for both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries. The production and export of organic products in developing countries might offer\r\nboth economic and environmental benefits, though this has mainly been investigated in Europe and North\r\nAmerica. However, long-distance trade with organic products has also given rise to a debate on the\r\nsustainability of this development especially with regard to global warming. Consumers of organic products\r\nmight ask themselves what are the environmental benefits of buying organic products from e.g. South\r\nAmerica or Asia as compared to conventional production and is this outweighed by the long-distance trade?\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the present PhD study was to assess the environmental impacts of selected imported\r\norganic products from developing countries based on impacts during both production (as compared to\r\nconventional) and during processing and transport to Denmark. Firstly, the global trade, development and\r\noverall environmental impacts of organic agriculture and food systems were investigated to form the\r\nfoundation for the further analysis. Organic soybeans from China and orange juice from Brazil were selected\r\nas relevant case studies. Secondly, environmental life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted for the case\r\nstudies in China and Brazil focusing on comparing organic with conventional cultivation and on identifying\r\nenvironmental hotspots of the imported organic product during production, processing and transport to\r\nDenmark. Thirdly, LCA was evaluated as a tool for evaluating the environmental soundness of organic\r\nagricultural products and a new methodology on including of soil carbon sequestration in LCA was\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nThe PhD study shows that the increasing globalization affects both conventional and organic agriculture and\r\nfood systems. Major environmental problems with regard to agriculture and food systems are identified as\r\nglobal warming, nutrient enrichment and pollution of water resources, reductions in biodiversity and soil\r\ndegradation. The growing global trade and development within organic food and farming systems holds a\r\npotential to offer economic and environmental benefits for developing countries, but at the same time holds a\r\nrisk of increasing the environmental load from long-distance transport and of pushing organic food and\r\nagricultural systems toward the conventional farming model and thereby diminishing the environmental\r\nbenefits of organic farming.\r\n\r\nThe case studies in China and Brazil show that the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with imported\r\norganic soybeans from China is 429 kg CO2 eq. per tonne soybean, whereas imported organic orange juice\r\nfrom small-scale farmers in São Paulo, Brazil is 424 g CO2 eq. per litre orange juice. Transport accounts for\r\n50-60% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the imported organic plant products. As a comparison,\r\ntransport only account for 1-15% for imported meat products, since the greenhouse gas emissions per kg\r\nmeat is a lot higher than for plant products. However, the actual contribution from transport is the same. The\r\nmode of transport is a determining factor in that truck transport has a much higher greenhouse gas emission\r\nper km than sea transport. Thus, sea transport from South America (reloaded to trucks in Rotterdam) is\r\ncomparable to truck transport from Italy and France and lower than truck transport from Spain and sea\r\ntransport from South Africa and China (also reloaded in Rotterdam) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions\r\nper kg imported product. It should be noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural production\r\ncan vary (due to inputs, yields etc.) among countries and in some cases outweigh the emissions from\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nComparing organic and conventional small-scale production until farm gate in the case studies, greenhouse\r\ngas emissions per kg organic product is found to be 60-75% of a comparable conventional production in the\r\ncase study area. The nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) per kg organic product is 38-82% of a comparable\r\nconventional production whereas land use per kg organic product is 10-13% higher. Higher crop diversity is\r\nfound on small organic compared to small conventional orange farms in Brazil, which may have a positive\r\neffect on biodiversity along with the absence of pesticides and the interrow vegetation. No differences are\r\nfound in biodiversity potential in the Chinese case study except the absence of pesticides. Comparing large\r\nand small organic orange farms in Brazil, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential and copper use\r\nper hectare is found to be significantly lower on organic small-scale than on large-scale organic orange\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThe shortcomings of LCA as a tool for evaluating environmental soundness of agricultural products,\r\nespecially with regards to including biodiversity and soil carbon changes, are discussed. The studies in Brazil\r\nand China find that including estimated soil carbon changes widens the difference in greenhouse gas\r\nemissions per kg product between organic and conventional, but there is a need for methodological\r\ndevelopment on how to estimate and include this.

  "texts" : [ "Effect of temperature and iron-oxide nano-particle inclusions on the ultrasound vaporization pressure of perfluorocarbon droplets for disease detection and therapy", "Introduction: The longer circulating time and larger particle count of perfluorocarbon (PFC) droplets make them more effective as targeted contrast agents compared to microbubbles. It has also been shown that conversion of PFC droplets to microbubbles improves ultrasound (US) sensitivity to emulsions by 10 orders of magnitude. PFC droplets, with their higher boiling point and smaller particle size are more desirable to prevent spontaneous aporization and maximum accumulation of emulsions. However, the high US energy required to induce phase conversion in these emulsions is not clinically feasible. We hypothesized that by increasing the temperature and using Iron-oxide nanoparticles(IONP) as nucleation sites within the more stable and submicron droplets, the US energy required to vaporize them may be lowered. Material and method: A sample of 60%w/v iron-oxide loaded PFC droplets with mean diameter of 200nm was manufactured and characterized. A phantom was designed to allow for the interaction between the US energy and droplets. A high intensity focused ultrasound system (HIFU) was used to generate US pressures and a heat exchanger pump was used to control the temperature while emulsions of PFHB and PFP with or without IONP were circulated through the chamber. A harmonic imaging system was also used to detect the generated microbubbles. Discussion and result: The effect of temperature and IONP on the vaporization rate and threshold of PFC emulsions were determined. It was shown that presence of IONP and higher temperature increase the rate and decreases the vaporization threshold of PFC emulsions" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Social Death: A Grounded Theory Study of the Emotional and Social Effects of Honour Killing on Victims’ Family Members- A Palestinian Family Perspective", "The University of ManchesterAbstract of thesis submitted by Salam Alkhatib on 4 September 2012for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, entitled:A Grounded Theory Study of the emotional and social effects of honour killing on Victims’ family members- A Palestinian family perspectiveAbstract The murder of women in order to uphold ‘honour’ has occurred throughout history and in many contexts. Despite high rates of domestic violence and increased rates of honour killing over the last decade in Palestine, there is a paucity of empirical data about the phenomenon, the social and cultural forces underlying it and how it affects family members emotionally and socially. The standpoint of this thesis is that Palestinian society today has no solution to honour killing (HK). This study addresses two questions: the factors that contribute to HK, as reported by the participants; and the emotional and social effects and consequences of it. The study adopted a Grounded Theory method. Data were collected using individual and group interviews with family members, professionals and neighbours associated with victims of HK. The total numbers of the participants were 43 (23 family members, 15 professionals and 5 neighbours). A feminist paradigm guided the data collection and analysis. The findings of this study have revealed that the HK phenomenon is multifaceted, grounded in the interplay of several complex factors, including institutionalized patriarchy within society, families and Palestinian culture; honour and shame values in the traditional society and other societal influences (cultural norms and values, legislative and institutional systems). This study therefore concluded that HKs were patriarchal and traditional methods of disempowering and subjugating women, enabled (directly or indirectly) by families, communities, political parties, religious leaders, professionals and the state, rendering society at large as unlikely to condemn honour killing. The main result was that although family members killed their female relatives primarily in an attempt to re-establish their honour, the murder failed in this purpose and in fact made their situation worse. Understanding this significant finding gives a clear message to family members and to the public that honour killing harms perpetrators emotionally and further damages family honour, where enter into a long process which ultimately leads to social death. Thus, multiple efforts are needed to combat HK, but this is extremely difficult. Altering the attitudes and behaviour of those who believe in HK is not an easy task but one of the first and crucial steps in combating this issue is state action. This study shows that most participants, especially family members, were concerned about family reputation and endeavoured to resolve problems within the family. This makes solving the problems inside families more difficult for any external party. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to work with families. Further research has the potential to increase our understanding of other social factors and processes involved in honour killing, which would enable concerned parties to better craft effective intervention strategies." ],

  "texts" : [ "Time trends in coroners' use of different verdicts for possible suicides and their impact on officially reported incidence of suicide in England: 1990-2005.", "BACKGROUND: Official suicide statistics for England are based on deaths given suicide verdicts and most cases given an open verdict following a coroner's inquest. Previous research indicates that some deaths given accidental verdicts are considered to be suicides by clinicians. Changes in coroners' use of different verdicts may bias suicide trend estimates. We investigated whether suicide trends may be over- or underestimated when they are based on deaths given suicide and open verdicts. Method Possible suicides assessed by 12 English coroners in 1990/91, 1998 and 2005 and assigned open, accident/misadventure or narrative verdicts were rated by three experienced suicide researchers according to the likelihood that they were suicides. Details of all suicide verdicts given by these coroners were also recorded. RESULTS: In 1990/91, 72.0% of researcher-defined suicides received a suicide verdict from the coroner, this decreased to 65.4% in 2005 (p trend < 0.01); equivalent figures for combined suicide and open verdicts were 95.4% (1990/91) and 86.7% (2005). Researcher-defined suicides with a verdict of accident/misadventure doubled over that period, from 4.6% to 9.1% (p < 0.01). Narrative verdict cases rose from zero in 1990/91 to 25 in 2005 (4.2% of researcher-defined suicides that year). In 1998 and 2005, 50.0% of the medicine poisoning deaths given accidental/misadventure verdicts were rated as suicide by the researchers. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1990/91 and 2005, the proportion of researcher-defined suicides given a suicide verdict by coroners decreased, largely due to an increased use of accident/misadventure verdicts, particularly for deaths involving poisoning. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of 'accidental' deaths by poisoning with medicines in the statistics available for monitoring suicides rates." ],

  "texts" : [ "Clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs: FIRE spectroscopy of Ross 458C", "Condensate clouds are a salient feature of L dwarf atmospheres, but have been assumed to play little role in shaping the spectra of the coldest T-type brown dwarfs. Here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infrared spectrum of the brown dwarf candidate Ross 458C, obtained with the Folded-Port Infrared Echellette (FIRE) spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes. These data verify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a T8 spectral classification, log[subscript 10] L bol/L[subscript ☉] = –5.62 ± 0.03, T [subscript eff] = 650 ± 25 K, and a mass at or below the deuterium burning limit. The data also reveal enhanced emission at the K band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity, reflecting the properties of the Ross 458 system (age = 150-800 Myr, [Fe/H] = +0.2 to +0.3). We present fits of FIRE data for Ross 458C, the T9 dwarf ULAS J133553.45+113005.2, and the blue T7.5 dwarf SDSS J141624.08+134826.7B, to cloudless and cloudy spectral models from Saumon & Marley. For Ross 458C, we confirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperature differs depending on the presence (635[superscript +25] [subscript –35] K) or absence (760[superscript +70] [subscript –45] K) of cloud extinction. ULAS J1335+1130 and SDSS J1416+1348B have similar temperatures (595[superscript +25] [subscript –45] K), but distinct surface gravities (log g = 4.0-4.5 cgs versus 5.0-5.5 cgs) and metallicities ([M/H] ≈ +0.2 versus –0.2). In all three cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data, significantly so for Ross 458C. These results indicate that clouds are an important opacity source in the spectra of young cold T dwarfs and should be considered when characterizing planetary-mass objects in young clusters and directly imaged exoplanets. The characteristics of Ross 458C suggest that it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogony does not conform with current planet formation theories." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Spirits in a material world : representations of gentrification in U.S. urban centers", "This dissertation proposes that literary texts can capture and reflect how representational spaces are conjured up by authors to inscribe a hidden past. This hidden past is often subsumed from the official narratives approved by redevelopment agencies and the state. This dissertation also argues that it is imperative to see these inscriptions of the past as haunting reminders demanding that we remember the people and spaces removed from gentrified neighborhoods. These specters of history leave us ill at ease, wondering what can and should be done in the future to address the inequities of dislocation and relocation that result from gentrification. These specters permit a recuperation of \"subjugated knowledge\" where the violence of the past permits itself to be seen through the inscription of a historical past to neighborhoods facing gentrification. They inscribe a past so as to develop an oppositional narrative that defers resistance into the future so as to change the desire of residents. That is, the texts examined here ask longtime residents to challenge future encroachments of gentrification while asking newer residents to understand the subjugated histories of the neighborhood and to understand that their existence within a neighborhood carries real, and sometimes, unintended consequences into a neighborhood. For these reasons, this dissertation examines texts from New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles in order to excavate these histories. The dissertation thus offers examples of how to face and challenge gentrification in the United States" ],

An example of such relationship is that of the interaction between area deprivation and individual ethnicity on reports of self-rated health, which we explored using cross-sectional data from the 2007 Citizenship Survey linked to the 2001 UK census. We aimed to examine whether the association between area deprivation and poor self-rated health differs for ethnic minority groups, as compared to white British people. Following from this, we also examined whether possible differential associations were mediated by ethnic density effects and perceptions of and satisfaction with neighbourhood characteristics. Results of random effects multilevel logistic regression models showed the detrimental association between area deprivation and self-rated health to be of greater magnitude and stronger for white British people than for ethnic minority people. This differential association was not mediated by ethnic density effects or perceptions of and satisfaction with neighbourhood characteristics." ],

  "texts" : [ "Design and analysis of non-pharmacological treatment trials with multiple therapists per patient", "In trials of physical and talking therapies, nesting of patients within therapists has statistical implications analogous to those of cluster randomised trials. Nevertheless, the clustering effect may be more complex, as it interacts with treatment. For some therapies, individual patients may receive care from multiple therapists of the same type, so that patients are no longer strictly nested within therapists, creating a ‘multiple-membership’ relationship between patients and therapists.This paper considers methods of analysis and sample size estimation for trials with multiple-membership clustering effects. It is motivated by a trial of a psychotherapy for the treatment of adolescent depression with cognitive behavioural therapy. We tested methods and issues in a Monte Carlo simulation study, simulating trials with multiple membership. Results demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of convergence and give estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient and empirical test size similar to a simple hierarchical design.We derive formulae for sample size and power for multiple-membership trial designs. We then compare estimates of power from this formula with empirical power derived from the simulation study. Finally, we show that we can easily extend formulae for sample size and power to allow consideration of power and sample size for certain types of more complex interventions. These include situations where therapists of different types deliver separate components of the intervention, creating a cross-classified relationship, or where several therapists deliver a group-administered treatment, creating further levels.

  "texts" : [ "Central Nervous System Injury, Neurocognitive and Quality of Life Outcomes in Children with Brain Tumors Treated with Chemotherapy", "Two-thirds of children diagnosed with brain tumors achieve long-term survival, and increasingly, children younger than 5-6 years at diagnosis are treated with high-dose chemotherapy protocols, delaying or foregoing cranial radiation. Intrathecal chemotherapy is associated with white matter loss, with systemic administration of certain agents also damaging healthy brain tissue. However, effects of systemic chemotherapy on the brain in children with tumors are unclear. Our first objective was to compare structural neural integrity with magnetic resonance imaging procedures in children with brain tumors (n = 7, mean age 8.3 years), treated with chemotherapy a mean of 5.4 years earlier, to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9, mean age 9.3 years). We also sought to explore the relationship between tissue loss, memory and executive functioning and quality of life (QOL) effects. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected using a diffusion tensor imaging protocol to evaluate tissue integrity throughout the brain, and in specific regions of interest. Voxel-based morphometry was used to determine differences between groups. In addition, we used neurocognitive, behavioral and QOL assessments. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps were obtained from normalized, smoothed images, and the two groups were compared using analysis of covariance, with age and gender as covariates. Higher mean diffusivity values emerged in patients over controls (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), and were especially apparent in the central thalamus, internal and external capsules, putamen, globus pallidus and pons. No significant differences emerged in fractional anisotropy values between groups. The patient group had lower brain-to-CSF ratio (p = .03), assessed with volumetric analyses. Overall QOL, school functioning, and psychosocial functioning were significantly lower in patients. The majority of patients scored within the average range on memory and executive functioning tests, and behavior assessment did not differ from controls. Significantly higher mean diffusivity, indicating long-term damage, appeared in multiple areas in patients 5 years after treatment with chemotherapy. Early intervention may provide neuroprotection or repair to alleviate the long-term consequences of the original trauma and chemotherapy-related damage." ],

Lipoatrophy in sub-Saharan African children can be stigmatizing and have far-reaching consequences. The severity and extent of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal children living in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMethods\n\t\t\t\tIn this cross-sectional study, children who were 3-12 years old, on antiretroviral therapy and pre-pubertal were recruited from a Family HIV Clinic in South Africa. Lipoatrophy was identified and graded by consensus between two HIV pediatricians using a standardized grading scale. A professional dietician performed formal dietary assessment and anthropometric measurements of trunk and limb fat. Previous antiretroviral exposures were recorded. In a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbtiometry (DXA) substudy body composition was determined in 42 participants.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\tAmong 100 recruits, the prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy was 36% (95% CI: 27%&#8211;45%). Anthropometry and DXA measurements corroborated the clinical diagnosis of lipoatrophy: Both confirmed significant, substantial extremity fat loss in children with visually obvious lipoatrophy, when adjusted for age and sex. Adjusted odds ratio for developing lipoatrophy was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3 - 2.9) for each additional year of accumulated exposure to standard dose stavudine. Cumulative time on standard dose stavudine was significantly associated with reductions in biceps and triceps skin-fold thickness (p=0.008).\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\tThe prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy is high. The amount of stavudine that children are exposed to needs review. Resources are needed to enable low-and-middle-income countries to provide suitable pediatric-formulated alternatives to stavudine-based pediatric regimens. The standard stavudine dose for children may need to be reduced. Diagnosis of lipoatrophy at an early stage is important to allow timeous antiretroviral switching to arrest progression and avoid stigmatization. Diagnosis using visual grading requires training and experience, and DXA and comprehensive anthropometry are not commonly available. A simple objective screening tool is needed to identify early lipoatrophy in resource-limited settings where specialized skills and equipment are not available." ],

Currently, the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgical resection is not feasible. Screening for lung cancer has been a major focus of research for the last 40 years. Despite this, there is still a lack of evidence to promote its use outside clinical trials. More recently, interest has focused on promoting earlier recognition of symptomatic disease among both the general public and primary care physicians in order to encourage more timely investigation and referral to secondary care. The hope is that this approach may increase the proportion of disease identified in the early tages, allowing more surgical resections and improved five-year survival rates.

  "texts" : [ "Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) using [¹⁸F]-IL1RA and PET imaging in rats.", "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) has the potential to improve our understanding of the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of therapeutic agents, and is easily translated to clinical studies in humans. However, studies involving proteins radiolabelled with clinically relevant PET isotopes are currently limited. Here we illustrate the potential of PET imaging in a preclinical study of the biodistribution and metabolism of ¹⁸F-labelled IL-1 receptor antagonist ([¹⁸F]IL-1RA) using a novel [¹⁸F]-radiolabelling technique. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: IL-1RA was radiolabelled by reductive amination on lysine moieties with [¹⁸F]fluoroacetaldehyde. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with [¹⁸F]IL-1RA and imaged with a PET camera for 2 h. For the study of IL-1RA metabolites by ex vivoγ-counting of samples, rats were killed 20 min, 1 h or 2 h after injection of [¹⁸F]IL-1RA. KEY RESULTS: [¹⁸F]IL-1RA distribution into the major organs of interest was as follows: kidneys > liver > lungs > brain. In lungs and liver, [¹⁸F]IL-1RA uptake peaked within 1 min post-injection then decreased rapidly to reach a plateau from 10 min post-injection. In the brain, the uptake exhibited slower pharmacokinetics with a smaller post-injection peak and a plateau from 6 min onward. IL-1RA was rapidly metabolized and these metabolites represented ∼40% of total activity in plasma and ∼80% in urine, 20 min after injection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Preclinical PET imaging is a feasible method of assessing the biodistribution of new biological compounds of therapeutic interest rapidly. The biodistribution of [¹⁸F]IL-1RA reported here is in agreement with an earlier study suggesting low uptake in the normal brain, with rapid metabolism and excretion via the kidneys." ],

  "texts" : [ "From Orientalism to Japonisme: Hugo, Baudelaire and Mallarme", "In nineteenth-century France, both Orientalism and Japonisme were heralded as ways to rejuvenate art and literature. Did these movements actually \"modernize\" the arts? This thesis visualizes the esthetics of the Orientalist poetry of Hugo, Baudelaire and Mallarme through a parallel study of nineteenth-century Orientalist painting. The results of these Orientalist analyses are compared to the esthetic effects of the movement of Japonisme found in painting and in Mallarme's poetry.Hugo, in Les Orientales, communicates in a linear, rational and metonymic style of representation which merely perpetuates Western literary convention. This resembles the painting of the French neo-classicists and academic realists such as Gerome. These artists, like Hugo, paint a \"realistic\" portrait of \"Oriental\" reality which blatantly coincides with the poet's desire to demonstrate his artistic virility.Baudelaire's poetry moves towards the Impressionistic ideal while still remaining (like Delacroix) in the French Romantic tradition. His images transcend the delineated linear rational reality. His personal use and distortion of metaphor disrupts the rational interpretative process of the reader which anticipates twentieth century Western art and literature.Mallarme, like many of his contemporaries, realized the relativity of Western ideals of beauty. An analysis of certain poems reveal his use of Orientalism and Japonisme which demonstrates the nineteenth century search for fresh inspiration. However, unlike earlier poets and painters, Mallarme succeeds in breaking out of tradition--much like those artists incorporating Japanese artistic techniques into their art.Mallarme relies on the universal essence of language that strips all referential connotations in order to leave the reader with nothing but its enigmatic essence. An analysis of Mallarme' s later poetry reveals a resemblance to the esthetics of Zen art wherein lies Mallarme's literary japonsime, and wherein perhaps lies another way to interpret the change in consciousness in many artists, readers, spectators and/or scientists of the time whose perception of the world was changing and whose poetic and artistic representations help us to visualize the transformation of their inner reality and its relationship to the outer world" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Thermal Characterization of Nanostructures and Advanced Engineered Materials", "Continuous downscaling of Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and progress in high-power electronics demand more efficient heat removal techniques to handle the increasing power density and rising temperature of hot spots. For this reason, it is important to investigate thermal properties of materials at nanometer scale and identify materials with the extremely large or extremely low thermal conductivity for applications as heat spreaders or heat insulators in the next generation of integrated circuits. The thin films used in microelectronic and photonic devices need to have high thermal conductivity in order to transfer the dissipated power to heat sinks more effectively. On the other hand, thermoelectric devices call for materials or structures with low thermal conductivity because the performance of thermoelectric devices is determined by the figure of merit Z=S^2e/K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, K and e are the thermal and electrical conductivity, respectively. Nanostructured superlattices can have drastically reduced thermal conductivity as compared to their bulk counterparts making them promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Other applications calling for thin films with low thermal conductivity value are high-temperature coatings for engines. Thus, materials with both high thermal conductivity and low thermal conductivity are technologically important. The increasing temperature of the hot spots in state-of-the-art chips stimulates the search for innovative methods for heat removal. One promising approach is to incorporate materials, which have high thermal conductivity into the chip design. Two suitable candidates for such applications are diamond and graphene. Another approach is to integrate the high-efficiency thermoelectric elements for on-spot cooling. In addition, there is strong motivation for improved thermal interface materials (TIMs) for heat transfer from the heat-generating chip to heat-sinking units. This dissertation presents results of the experimental investigation and theoretical interpretation of thermal transport in the advanced engineered materials, which include thin films for thermal management of nanoscale devices, nanostructured superlattices as promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials, and improved TIMs with graphene and metal particles as fillers providing enhanced thermal conductivity. The advanced engineered materials studied include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and microcrystalline diamond (MCD) films on Si substrates, directly integrated nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films on GaN, free-standing polycrystalline graphene (PCG) films, graphene oxide (GOx) films, and \"pseudo-superlattices\" of the mechanically exfoliated Bi2Te3 topological insulator films, and thermal interface materials (TIMs) with graphene fillers." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Solving PDEs with random data by stochastic collocation", "In many science and engineering problems there is uncertainty in the input data. The ability to suitably model and handle this uncertainty is crucial for obtaining meaningful information about solutions. In this thesis, we consider the numerical approximation of statistics of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain inputs. We focus on PDEs with random coefficients and random domains.We consider a general set of numerical methods known collectively as stochastic finite element methods. We can distinguish stochastic Galerkin methods and stochastic sampling methods. For the latter, samples of the random inputs are generated and the deterministic PDE is solved for each one. Averages of the quantities of interest are calculated using solutions obtained from the samples. We focus in particular on a specific type of sampling method, the stochastic collocation method.The main computational cost associated with solving PDEs with random data using stochastic finite element methods is the solution of the resulting linear system(s) obtained from the fully discrete problem. The main aim in this thesis is to identify efficient and robust techniques for solving the sequence of linear systems obtained from stochastic collocation methods and to reduce the computational costs by recycling as much information as possible. New iterative solution strategies are presented for stochastic collocation discretisations of PDEs with random coefficients and for stochastic collocation discretisations of PDEs on random domains. Substantial savings on computing costs have been demonstrated." ],

  "texts" : [ "THE CRYSTAL GROWTH OF SODALITE ZINCOPHOSPHATE OBSERVED USING IN SITU ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY", "Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used in order to investigate the crystal growth of sodalite zincophosphate (SOD-ZnPO). For the first time, in situ growth experiments studying an inorganic zeotype were performed.On the {100} face of SOD-ZnPO, an interlaced spiral growth mechanism was observed that was a consequence of a difference in condensation rates between the phosphorus and zinc species adding at the crystal edge. It was found that zinc condensation was slower, and therefore rate limiting. Growth rates on this face were found to be directly influenced by solution stoichiometry, and the importance of solution ageing was also determined. On the {111} face, the importance of extra-framework cations in the growth process was investigated. Monolayer terraces that were propagated by through-extra-framework species bonding were observed as well as bilayers that grew by through-framework bonding. That the cation assisted mechanism was observed suggested the importance of extra-framework species in the growth of nanoporous materials. Lateral Force Microscopy (LFM) was used to investigate the friction of growing terraces and step edges on the {100} face of SOD-ZnPO. On terraces, anisotopic friction was observed that was related to the anisotropic growth. It was found that scanning across rows of zinc atoms on a crystal surface caused an enhanced friction compared to scanning along rows of phosphorus, due to the different friction experienced scanning the different T units. At step edges, enhanced energy was imparted to the tip as a direct result of an increase in growth rate. This was attributed to an increase in shear strength due to increased kink density at higher growth rates." ],

  "texts" : [ "Apolonia Dangzalan: Filipina Businesswoman, Watsonville, California", "Apolonia Dangzalan, a Filipino resident of Watsonville, California, was interviewed on April 27, 1977 by Meri Knaster, an editor at the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history. Dangzalan was born in February 1896 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Sur, northwest of Manila, on the largest of the Philippine islands. Her family owned some land on which rice and corn was cultivated by sharecroppers. Her uncle was the president of San Nicholas. Dangzalan attended school for five years but was unable to continue due to illness. Her father died when she was five years old and her mother died when she was seventeen. In 1923, at age 27, she married. A year later she and her husband immigrated to Oahu, Hawaii. Her husband worked in the sugar cane fields and Dangzalan began a small business in her house sewing clothes for the Filipino community. This was the first of many small businesses she would run throughout her long life. In 1925 she and her husband moved to San Francisco, and then to Stockton, California, where her husband worked as a laborer in the asparagus fields.\n      Dissatisfied with her marriage, in 1926 Dangzalan divorced her husband and moved to Marysville, California, where she bought and managed a pool hall and restaurant frequented by Filipinos, Mexicans and Anglo Americans. Although she enjoyed this work, business was not too good. She heard that Watsonville and Salinas were much better places to be in business because they attracted a large Filipino community that came to work in the fruit orchards. So after five months in Marysville, Dangzalan joined her nephew, Frank Barba, in Watsonville, California. (Frank Barba is also the subject of an oral history published by the Regional History Project.) Dangzalan opened a boarding house for Filipino agricultural workers on Bridge Street in Watsonville, California, where she became known as \"Mama\" Dangzalan. After a few years, her nephew, Frank Barba, took over the Watsonville boarding house and Dangzalan opened another boarding house on Salinas Road in 1930. Most of the workers she housed were working for the Gary Company, and Dangzalan also served as a labor contractor, hiring men to work in the company's fields. Dangzalan was one of very few women engaged in labor contracting.\n      Dangzalan engaged in diverse business activities besides labor contracting. She also opened a liquor store, dancing club, and pool hall on Main Street in Watsonville in 1936. During World War II she owned a house of prostitution on Union Street in Watsonville. She hired an American woman to manage it for her.\n      In 1950 Dangzalan stopped working as a labor contractor and went into business for herself as a farmer, primarily growing strawberries. After four years of this she was tired. In 1952 Dangzalan was operated on for kidney cancer. She withdrew from all of her businesses except for the International Groceries and Liquors store on lower Main Street, which she was still running at the time of this oral history interview in 1977. At age 81 Dangzalan was still working in the liquor store until 2:30 in the morning. In her field notes, interviewer Meri Knaster described Dangzalan as \"a very spry and active eighty-one year old\". Dangzalan continued to operate the liquor store until 1982. She died in 1992, at the age of 96." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Evaluating the Benefits of Integrated Child Development Program in Rural India", "India suffers from widespread child malnutrition, childcare constraints on maternal employment, and gender education gap. In my  dissertation I examine the impact of India's biggest child development program - Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) - on each of these aspects. The program provides various services to children below six years, including supplementary nutrition, preschooling, immunization and health check-ups. In the first paper I look at the ``direct'' program impact on nutritional status of young children, and in the second and third, I analyze the ``indirect'' program impact on maternal employment and education of older siblings respectively. For all three papers I use data from recent demographic health survey 2005-6 for India, and for two I also substantiate my results with time use information of mothers and older siblings from another dataset.In my first paper, using matching and difference-in-difference estimators, I find that girls 0-2 years old receiving supplementary feeding intensely are at least 1cm (0.4 z-score) taller than those not receiving it in rural India. The estimates are similar for boys 0-2 but less robust. Although the program's focus is on children ages 3-5, I find no positive effect on their growth. In the second paper, using probit, covariate matching and conditional logit (village fixed-effects), I find that the mother, whose child is receiving highly correlated services of regular preschooling or daily supplementary feeding, is 12\\% more likely to work in rural India. Using similar estimation strategy (including mother fixed-effects), in my third paper I find that the girl 6-14 years, having a younger sibling below 5 years receiving any of the ICDS services intensely, is at least 9\\% more likely to be in school in rural India. The effect on boys 6-14 years is positive, but not robust. Because of various program services, the ``indirect'' benefits can accrue through several pathways: time saving because of release from child supervision, improvement in health of young children and implicit income subsidy. For maternal employment it seems that the effect seems to be driven mainly by the daycare implicit in preschooling, and for the girl's education by health benefits of vaccinations of younger children." ],

  "texts" : [ "Product innovation and knowledge protection in the relationshipbetween automotive first-tier suppliers and OEMs in China: an empiricalinvestigation", "The entry of China into the globalized world and onto the stage of the global automarket has presented auto manufacturers with the largest ever market opportunity.While global competitive forces drive firms to develop product innovation throughtheir global supply chains, the approach of global auto manufacturers and their firsttiersuppliers has been to bring existing technology into China. Only recently has thesupply chain in China become integrated into the global product innovation cycle.While innovations generated by supply channel relationships, as opposed to individualpartners, are playing an increasingly important role in the success of all supply chainpartners, there has been limited research in the literature on how supply chainrelationships cultivate the process of such innovation generation, particularly inChina.Correspondingly, this study explores how multinational suppliers can developadaptive product innovation in order to create a sustainable competitive advantage inChina and how the protection of their knowledge helps them sustain it. Drawing onthe knowledge-based view and transaction cost economics, and integrating those withbehavioural governance and the institution-based view this study identifies drivers ofproduct innovation for MNC suppliers in their relationships with Chinese OEMs,investigates the influence of supplier involvement and knowledge protection onsupplier product innovation and examines the outcomes in the specific context of theChinese automotive industry from the first-tier supplier perspective. Survey results of170 multinational automobile suppliers in China indicate support for most of thehypotheses.Specifically, knowledge protection is found to have an impact on product innovationin the context of the auto industry in China. Supplier involvement in co-design andco-development with an automotive OEM customer has an inverted U-shapedrelationship with product innovation. Furthermore, trust and technological uncertaintyare found to drive greater product innovation. In addition, the institutionalenvironment moderates the effect of product innovation on performance.Overall, this study enhances the understanding of how MNC suppliers can acquirelocal knowledge, develop products adapted to the local market requirements andfoster product innovation while retaining their knowledge and know-how andminimizing negative effects of spill-overs to the local competition in the automotiveindustry in China." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Impacts of Heather and Grassland Burning in the Uplands: Creating Sustainable Strategies", "Both nationally and globally, UK upland peat is an important store of carbonas well as a source of other important ecosystem services. However,concerns have been raised regarding the stability of these stores.Significant increases in water colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)from catchments draining upland peat have been observed across the UK.Unlike many boreal peats, the peat soils of UK uplands are heavily managedfor sheep grazing and recreational shooting. Productivity of theselandscapes has been increased through managed burning of the vegetation.Burning has been linked with increases in water colour and inappropriateburning can lead to ‘unfavourable’ conditions in these landscapes.This thesis presents the results from a monitoring programme at MoorHouse National Nature Reserve. Results show that burning does not lead todramatic increases in DOC and that longer rotations may have benefits forcarbon by reducing water colour. Increases in the occurrence and changesin the quality of runoff water following burning could help explain changes inwater quality parameters such as DOC.Experimental studies into biomass loss during burning, combined with asurvey of a wildfire, have shown that the production of char is an importantcarbon store that should be accounted for in fire prone upland settings.Modelling studies suggest that rotation lengths of 15 years are suitable forchar production and that on these longer rotations char becomes a moreimportant carbon store than any remaining unburnt biomass or litter.Therefore this work would suggest that longer rotations may have benefitsfor carbon storage and water quality. Longer rotations may be sustainable insome areas but that this is unlikely to be appropriate across the entire of theUK. The caveats to this work should always be presented and localknowledge be consulted when drawing up management plans." ],

A MANCOVA was performed to predict distress and cancer-specific quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation based on control variables (patient age, education, residence, tumor size (breast sample), gleason score (prostate sample), and receipt of an initial treatment consultation recording), predictor variables (treatment type--chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy; decisional role--active, collaborative, passive), and interactions between these predictors.RESULTS: Women who received chemotherapy and reported having played a more passive role in treatment decision making had significantly greater distress and lower cancer-specific quality of life at 12-week post-consultation. There were no statistically significant predictors of these outcomes identified for men with prostate cancer.CONCLUSION: Receipt of chemotherapy places women with breast cancer at risk for distress and reduced quality of life, but only for the subset of women who report playing a passive role in treatment decision making. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to explicate the antecedents, composition, and consequences of the 'passive' decisional role during the treatment phase of the cancer trajectory." ],

Tenure and Neighborhood Stability in Chelsea, Massachusetts", "In this article, we examine the role of investors and occupant-owners in an urban context during the recent housing crisis. We focus on Chelsea, Massachusetts, because it is a dense city, dominated by multifamily housing structures with high rates of foreclosure for which we have particularly good data. We distinguish between occupant-owners and investors using local data, and we find that many investors are misclassified as occupant-owners in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. Then, employing a competing risks framework to study ownerships during the period 1998 through mid-2010, we find that local investors, who tend to invest more in relation to purchase prices and sell more quickly, experienced approximately 1.8 times the mortgage foreclosure risk of occupant-owners, conditional on financing. Nonlocal investors have no statistically significant difference in foreclosure risk from occupant-owners. Nonetheless, those owners with subprime purchase mortgages (most of whom are occupant-owners) faced the highest foreclosure risk when house prices fell." ],

Significant morbidity is caused by an overexuberant mixed lung cell infiltrate, which is thought to be driven by chemokines. One of the main chemotactic mediators responsible for the movement of eosinophils is CCL11 (eotaxin). Using a mouse model of eosinophilic bronchiolitis induced by RSV, we show here that treatment in vivo with a blocking antibody to CCL11 greatly reduces lung eosinophilia and disease severity. In addition, anti-CCL11 caused a striking inhibition of CD4-T-cell influx and shifted cytokine production away from interleukin-5 without reducing the resistance to viral replication. These results suggest that in addition to influencing eosinophil diapedesis and survival, anti-CCL11 has an action on T cells. These studies strengthen the case for anti-CCL11 treatment of Th2-driven diseases." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Education On Prehospital Pain Management: A Follow-Up Study", "Introduction: The most common reason patients seek medical attention is pain. However, there may be significant delays in initiating prehospital pain therapy. In a 2001 quality improvement (QI) study, we demonstrated improvement in paramedic knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain. This follow-up study examines the impact of this QI program, repeated educational intervention (EI), and effectiveness of a new pain management standard operating procedure.\n      Methods: 176 paramedics from 10 urban and suburban fire departments and two private ambulance services participated in a 3-hour EI. A survey was performed prior to the EI and repeated one month after the EI. We reviewed emergency medical services (EMS) runs with pain complaints prior to the EI and one month after the EI. Follow-up results were compared to our prior study. We performed data analysis using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests.\n      Results: The authors reviewed 352 surveys and 438 EMS runs with pain complaints. Using the same survey questions, even before the EI, 2007 paramedics demonstrated significant improvement in the knowledge (18.2%; 95% CI 8.9%, 27.9%), perceptions (9.2%; 95% CI 6.5%, 11.9%), and management of pain (13.8%; 95% CI 11.3%, 16.2%) compared to 2001. Following EI in 2007, there were no significant improvements in the baseline knowledge (0%; 95% CI 5.3%, 5.3%) but significant improvements in the perceptions of pain principles (6.4%; 95% CI 3.9%, 9.0%) and the management of pain (14.7%; 95% CI 11.4%, 18.0%).\n      Conclusion: In this follow up study, paramedics’ baseline knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain have all improved from 6 years ago. Following a repeat educational intervention, paramedics further improved their field management of pain suggesting paramedics will still benefit from both initial and also ongoing continuing education on the topic of pain management.

  "texts" : [ "Privatization's Progeny", "Privatization’s proponents are branching out.  They’ve traditionally relied on government contracting to boost regulatory efficiency, maximize budgetary savings, enhance unitary control over the administrative state, and reap political dividends.  Now, however, these proponents are also blazing newer, bolder paths.  They’re experimenting with more powerful instruments that offer surer, quicker routes to promote privatization’s aims. \n      One such instrument is marketized bureaucracy.  For decades, the government offered its employees generous base compensation and considerable job security.  During that time, privatization’s proponents found these public-sector arrangements anathema.  Rather than tear down the then-prized civil-service framework, they simply circumvented it — replacing what they viewed as overpaid and insufficiently motivated government workers with contractors.  Of late, however, the tide has turned against the civil service.  Across the country, elected officials are reducing government workers’ wages and benefits, curtailing collective-bargaining rights, reclassifying tenured civil servants as at-will employees, and introducing performance-based bonuses.  These efforts have made government bureaucracy far more like the private sector, thus reducing the need to contract out. \n      Another such instrument is government by bounty.  Exemplified by regulatory vouchers, prediction markets, R&D prizes, and social-impact bonds, government-by-bounty initiatives shed the conventional contractual form.  In its stead are high-risk, high-reward bets that shift financial and programmatic responsibility onto bounty seekers.  Unlike traditional contractors, bounty seekers invest their own money and get paid only if they win the \"bet\" — that is, only if they successfully carry out their given tasks.  As a result, the bounty seekers are, in theory, better-motivated and less susceptible to slack, abuse, and fraud.\n      This Article explores how these instruments uniquely challenge the administrative state, reorienting public programs, reversing longstanding practices, and forcing courts to recalibrate core administrative law doctrines in ways traditional contracting never did.  Specifically, these new instruments enable school districts to “teach to the test,” states to barter away sovereign authority, and presidents to politicize the bureaucracy.  They also test the robustness of foundational legal precepts undergirding hard-look review, Chevron and Skidmore deference, and constitutional due process.  Ultimately, the emergence of these instruments reflects the extent to which government today is commingling political and business-like agendas in ways both liberating and threatening." ],

  "texts" : [ "Reading Images and Texts: English Broadside Ballads and Visual Culture, 1600-1800", "This dissertation provides an interdisciplinary study of broadside ballads - an inexpensive form of early modern print sold to entertain and inform. It argues that illustrations were not simply included to entertain the less-literate, but were a central part of ballad composition for over 200 years. Working with a multi-archive sample set of over 3,000 ballads, it documents previously unrecognized patterns in text-image relationships. More importantly, it demonstrates that ballads were a multi-layered form of print that integrated text, tune, image, and performance to appeal to consumers with varying levels of textual literacy. This project complicates our understanding of early modern print and literacy in several ways. Most scholars of early modern England argue that the printing press and the Protestant Reformation transformed early modern England into a literate, text-based society to the exclusion and detriment of visual cultures. Instead, this dissertation suggests that the persistent presence of ballad illustrations and other printed images show that post-Reformation English visual culture was not as impoverished as has been assumed. Further, the textual and visual content of ballads provide crucial information on the transformation of literacy in early modern England. This analysis demonstrates that people relied on verbal and visual signs to interpret printed texts well into the eighteenth century. Ballads are not just remnants of early modern England's vibrant popular culture, but demonstrate strategies that printers employed to make new print culture appealing and accessible to a mixed-literate market." ],

It is very important to understand its meaning and importance in all human reactions in order to be able to understand the world and deal with the difficulties of life. The purpose of this study is to distinguish and to make apparent the terms of religiosity and spirituality in a general population in Thessaly.Design/participants: In order to have a reliable tool of measurement of spirituality and religiosity in Greece it was used “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” questionnaire. In the study, 393 Greek citizens, living in Thessaly, completed the questionnaire, generally. The choice of the sample was at random, via place of work, homes and hospitals in the area of Thessaly.Measurements/ results: The average age of participants was 36,39 years, 149 (37,9%) were men and 244 were women in a percentage of 62,1%. Moreover, 95, 9% of the sample stated that they were Christians Orthodox. It was found that in a percentage of 57,7%, the participants have as much of spiritual and religious understanding of their lives in a relevance of a 11,7 of those people who have only spiritual understanding.Ιt was  also, found that, people who have a high understanding of spirituality and religiosity had higher scores in the practice of faith in contrast to those who had only a spiritual understanding. It was also interesting that those who demonstrated both religious and spiritual understanding declared that they believe there is a spiritual power or force above them influencing the international facts. This was not the case with the participants who declared only religious beliefs. 85% stated that praying plays an important role in their lives. Sixteen people stated that they have experienced a situation related to death while 165 were certain that we exist in some kind of form after death.Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that religion and spirituality are significant and fulfilling in the lives of the participants. The process to explain the importance of spirituality is difficult and painful" ],

They were originally designed for gene expression profiling in relatively simple biological systems, such as cell lines and model systems under constant laboratory conditions. This poses a challenge to ecologists who increasingly want to use microarrays to unravel the genetic mechanisms underlying complex interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment. Here, we discuss typical experimental and statistical problems that arise when analyzing genome-wide expression profiles in an ecological context. We show that experimental design and environmental confounders greatly influence the identification of candidate genes in ecological microarray studies, and that following several simple recommendations could facilitate the analysis of microarray data in ecological settings. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Chemical dynamics and bonding at gas/semiconductor and oxide/semiconductor interfaces", "Gas and oxide adsorption and their impact on the properties of semiconductor interfaces were investigated at the atomic level with both experimental and theoretical techniques. Two types of semiconductors were studied, an organic semiconductor, employed in chemical field effect transistors (chemFETs) and alternative channel materials for metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs). Adsorption of nitric oxide (NO) on iron phthalocyanine (FePc), an organic semiconductor, was explored to determine the adsorption mechanism of NO. King and Wells sticking measurements were performed on ordered monolayer, multilayer FePc and quasi-amorphous tetra-t-butyl FePc multilayer thin films to determine the impact of surface order and thickness on adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) results show there is a deep chemisorption well at the metal center. The metal centers are a small fraction of the surface (3%), but the initial sticking probability was 40% at low surface temperature and low incident beam energy. Both the experimental and theoretical data supports molecular NO sticking onto FePc via physisorption to the aromatic periphery followed by diffusion to the Fe metal center, a multiple pathway precursor-mediated chemisorption. To understand the chemical dynamics of bonding at the oxide/semiconductor interface, the adsorption of oxygen, nitrogen, and high- [kappa] dielectrics onto alternative high mobility channel materials, Ge and InAs, was investigated to identify passive oxide/semiconductor interfaces via DFT. DFT modeling of experimental results found oxygen exposure on Ge(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) pins the Fermi level near the valence band due to generation of Ge ad-atoms and formation of a suboxide. Similarly, DFT modeling demonstrated that the nitrided Ge(001) surface was pinned due to generation of Ge ad-atoms and formation of a subnitride. For III-V materials, a comparison was made of the geometric and electronic structures of ordered HfO₂ and ZrO₂ monolayers on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2). DFT calculations showed that both high-k oxides were able to electronically passivate the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface, decreasing density of states at the Fermi level by removal of dangling bonds and strained bonds on the semiconductor substrate. With a greater atomic understanding of the oxide-semiconductor interfaces, the presented results can help guide future device engineering efforts" ],

  "texts" : [ "Antimony and acetaldehyde migration from Nigerian and British PET bottles into water and soft drinks under typical use conditions. Concentration of migrants and some trace elements in polyethylene terephthalate and in bottled contents.", "Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an excellent material for bottling water, beverages, edible oils and other liquids because it is light, tough and transparent. PET bottles are also extensively reused for storage of drinking water, beverages and other liquids and for solar disinfection of microbiologically unsafe drinking water in the tropics. In spite of the usefulness of PET bottles earlier works have reported leaching of antimony and acetaldehyde from the bottle matrix into the liquid contents. Both antimony trioxide and acetaldehyde belongs to Group 2B (possible carcinogens) in the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) carcinogen classification. Additionally acetaldehyde associated with alcoholic beverages (derived from alcoholic beverage and formed endogenously) has recently been upgraded to IARC Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans).\nThe research aims to assess the pattern and extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from British and Nigerian polyethylene terephthalate bottles into bottle contents under typical use and reuse conditions. The research compares the assessed extents of migration with the current regulations to determine whether the maximum acceptable levels of antimony and acetaldehyde are being exceeded and whether current regulations might need to be reassessed. \nTo achieve these goals the pattern and extent of PET bottle use and reuse in Britain and Nigeria were appraised through survey. The survey revealed that new bottles with contents are typically stored prior to use for periods ranging between one and 7 days, with Nigerians storing for longer periods than British respondents. However storage of up to one year was reported. The extent of bottle reuse was high and similar for the two countries.  Nevertheless Nigerian respondents reuse bottles for longer periods than British respondents. The survey findings together with relevant literature were used to design laboratory experiments that assessed the extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from PET bottles into water/beverages. \nA total of 82 brands of bottled water and soft drinks in plastic and glass bottles and in cartons were collected. A few samples from Nigeria in plastic pouches were collected. Materials used in bottling including glass and plastic bottle materials, metal and plastic bottle cap materials and plastic cap lining materials were collected. All samples were collected in supermarkets and shops in Britain and Nigeria except drinking water from taps which was collected in Britain only. Some bottles were aged for the purpose of studying the impact of bottle aging on chemical migration. Other bottles were stored with their contents to study the impact of long term storage of bottle contents on chemical migration.\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise PET bottle material and other materials associated with water and soft drink bottling. Antimony and other trace metals in water and soft drinks were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Antimony content of PET and other plastics was determined by microwave digestion and ICP-MS. Acetaldehyde content of water and soft drinks and PET were determined using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID). Accuracy and precision for determination of antimony and other trace elements in bottle materials and bottle contents were good as recoveries were around 100% and coefficients of variation were less than 15% for all analysis types. Accuracy and precision for determination of acetaldehyde in bottle materials and bottle contents were also good as recoveries were around 100% and coefficients of variation were less than 15% for all analysis types. Impact of long term storage, elevated temperatures, bottle thickness, carbonation, bottle aging and bottle size on migration of antimony and acetaldehyde were also assessed. \nAll plastic bottle materials analysed were found to be PET. Bottle cap materials were either polyethylene or polypropylene. All plastic cap lining materials from Britain and some from Nigeria were found to be ethylene vinyl acetate/polypropylene copolymer. Plastic cap lining materials from some Nigerian soft drinks were identified as polyvinyl chloride. Glass bottle materials analysed were found to be soda-lime glass. Metal bottle caps were identified as tinplate, tin-free-steel coated with chromium or aluminium coated with chromium.\nThe antimony concentration in 32 PET bottle materials from Britain and Nigeria were similar and ranged between 177 and 310 mg/kg with an average of 250±30 mg/kg. The concentration agrees well with the industry reported concentration of between 150 and 350 mg/kg. The concentration of residual acetaldehyde in 25 fresh PET bottle materials from Britain and Nigeria ranged between 0.95 and 12.52 µg/g. The average concentration in British and Nigerian soft drinks PET materials are 4.76 and 2.17µg/g respectively. Concentration of residual acetaldehyde was higher in soft drinks and still water PET materials than in sparkling water materials. The concentration of residual acetaldehyde decreases as the bottle wall material becomes older. Also the thinner the bottle walls the lower the concentration of residual acetaldehyde. \nAntimony concentration in 47 freshly purchased British bottled water and soft drinks ranged between 0.03 and 6.61µg/L with only one sample going above the EU acceptable limit. Concentrations of other trace elements measured were low except titanium which was detected at part per million levels in soft drinks. Lead content of a Nigerian soft drink in glass bottle stored for 2 months was above the EU acceptable limit for lead. At realistic temperatures of 40 and 60°C antimony concentration in the water remained below the EU acceptable limit even after 48 hours of exposure but the concentration exceeded the limit for most exposures at 80°C. Concentration of antimony in some Nigerian bottled water and soft drinks was above the EU limit after 11 months of storage at room temperature. Aged bottles leach lower amount of antimony than new bottles. Similarly larger bottles leach lower amount of antimony than smaller bottles. \nThe average acetaldehyde concentrations found in British fruit juices, carbonated soft drinks, sparkling water and still water were 5113, 1458, 22 and 8 µg/L respectively. Acetaldehyde was not detected in water bottled in glass. The concentration of acetaldehyde in five fruit juice samples in PET bottles and carton was beyond the EU specific migration limit (SML) of 6mg/kg. Also the tolerable daily intake of acetaldehyde could be exceeded as a result of intake of some soft drinks and fruit juices. Acetaldehyde content in soft drinks increase with storage but the increase cannot be accounted for by the residual acetaldehyde in PET. Acetaldehyde was found to be outgassing from some bottles. It was also found to be capable of migrating from soft drinks into bottle wall. Without replenishment the concentration of acetaldehyde in solution decreases with time.\nThe use of PVC cap lining in Nigeria as found in this study is a cause for concern as PVC is associated with health risk issues. The study recommends actions to ensure that antimony in fruit juices and other bottled products remain within the regulatory standard from bottling to consumption for the purpose of safeguarding the health of consumers. Glass used in bottling should be well scrutinized to ensure that it does not contain high levels of lead or other chemical substances that can cause harm to consumers through migration into contents. PET bottles can safely be used for solar water disinfection without the risk of antimony intake at concentrations above safe limits as water temperature achievable as the result of the technique doesn¿t go beyond 60°C. Also aged bottles are safer to use than new bottles because their chemical leaching was found to be lower than that of new bottles. This study recommends the reassessment of the absence of international guidelines for acetaldehyde in water and foods. The study also recommends that the amount of acetaldehyde that can be added to soft drinks as flavouring agent should be below the specific migration limit (SML) for migration of acetaldehyde from PET bottle into bottle contents. This is essential since the SML was designed to ensure that exposure to acetaldehyde, as a result of intake of bottled water and soft drinks in PET bottles, is below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for acetaldehyde. As antimony was reported to go beyond the safe limits in some Nigerian bottled water and soft drinks after 11 months of storage this study discourages the use of bottle contents stored for a very long time.Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the United Kingdo" ],

  "title" : "Religious and political leadership in Persian Baluchistan: a study in the confusion of temporal and spiritual authority",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Religious and political leadership in Persian Baluchistan: a study in the confusion of temporal and spiritual authority", "<p>1. The aim of the thesis is threefold:<ul><li>i) to present a fully dynamic analysis of leadership among the Baluch in the Persian Province of Baluchistan,</li><li>ii) to illustrate the sociological distinction (or lack of it) between sacré and profane on different planes in the society,</li><li>iii) to make some advance in the theoretical treatment of personality as a sociological factor in leadership.</li></ul></p><p>2. The Baluch in general form a linguistic and sub-cultural unit within the broader cultural context of Eastern or Iranian Islam. The Persian Province of Baluchistan, which is roughly coterminous with the area of Persia where the Baluch form the majority of the population, is an isolated area which presents great extremes of altitude, climate and fertility. Natural conditions break the society down into small communities (whether settled or nomadic), and force it into dependence on a combination of agriculture and pastoralism in varying proportions. In almost every aspect of the material culture utter simplicity and dependence on the environment is evident. However, complex patterns of movement and other sociological factors keep all communities and classes constantly in touch with each other, and counteract the fragmenting effect of the the environment.</p><p>Baluch society within the Province consists of:<ul><li>i) Balush - who are predominantly nomadic,</li><li>ii) shahri - who are generally peasants,</li><li>iii) ghulāms - who until recently were slaves, and</li><li>iv) a superstructure of dynastic families, for which however there is no native term.</li></ul></p><p>From the point of view of leadership, there are also four role-statuses:<ul><li>i) kamāsh - who may be secular or religious,</li><li>ii) maulawi - who is religious,</li><li>iii) darwish - who is also religious, and</li><li>iv) \"chief\" - who is secular, and for which there is no really equivalent native term.</li></ul></p><p>Political aspirations invariably function through one or other of these role-statuses, which however cannot be said to form a structure. A chief must be a member of a dynastic family, and is a leader by definition. Holders of the other three role-statuses are only potentially leaders: they may or may not lead in fact. The chief is generally but not necessarily more powerful than holders of the other role-statuses.</p><p>Every man inherits a tribal name agnatically, and the word for tribe (zāt) is best translated as \"birth status\". However, the zāt of a man's mother is also an important factor in determining his status. He may only improve his status within limits by his own achievements. There are also institutionalised forms of behaviour for particular occasions and situations, and there is a \"formal\" religion - Islam.</p><p>Beyond these factors there is no institutionalisation in the society, and so there is practically no specifically political institutionalisation at all. Furthermore, the terms for the three role-statuses which are named in the society are all of alien origin.</p><p>3. This situation makes it impossible to understand and analyse realistically the present framework of political conceptions in the society without taking cognisance both of the history of these conceptions and of comparative material from neighbouring societies, for all of these conceptions have at least archaistic aspects, and in some respects contact with the semantic origin of the term still conditions its use within the society.</p><p>In general, a zāt represents a group of immigrants to the Province. The people who brought the name \"Baluch\" and the Baluchi language into the Province appear to have arrived there in the 11th century. There is evidence that agriculture flourished in the Province before the Baluch came, but we know nothing of any pastoral life there before them. The names of the main agricultural settlements were the same before the Baluch came as they are now. There are no other pre-Baluch names in the Province.</p><p>On the basis of the historical and comparative data available a theoretical model is constructed to demonstrate the synchronic and diachronic contexts of the present situation. This model is particularly relevant to the study of:<ul><li>i) relationships between settled and nomadic and the mixture of various ethnic, cultural, and linguistic groups</li><li>ii) the ways in which social stratification may result from such mixtures</li><li>iii) how certain political relationships - particularly the feudal relationship - may develop in these circumstances, and</li><li>iv) how the constellation and importance of kin and affinal relationships may be affected.</li></ul></p><p>4. The kinship terminology is simple and cognatic. There are strong ties between brother and sister, and between cousins. Brothers and sisters generally inherit equal shares of land, except that the eldest son may be given an extra share. Livestock is gnerally inherited by sons only. Landownership is only of secondary importance to leadership. Marriage preference (for first or only wives) is for \"cousins\", and the bride-price is high and not affected by the choice of a father's brother's daughter. Some communities and classes are generally monogamous, others generally polygymous, and it is possible to discern a difference in the function and conception of marriage in the two cases. Matri- and patri-locality is better interpreted in terms of the fact that solidary political groupings (formed by marriage or allegiance) are generally more important sociologically than geographical and seological groupings. Among the nomadic Baluch a corollary of the orientation towards kinship, tribal affiliation, etc., is the instability of the individual camp. Marriage and inheritance practices reinforce \"class\" identity - particularly in the dynastic families where this identity is most important. Similarly, because of these practices, members of dynastic families acquire ownership interests in widely scattered pieces of land, and are therefore encouraged to move about continually.</p><p>5. The dynastic families form a superstructure. The chief is generally the paramount leader in a certain area, and has a certain vaguely defined \"people\". There are communities and areas without chiefs. Holders of the other role-statuses may also function as paramount leaders. Any leader automatically qualifies for one or other of the traditional role-statuses. This essay is concerned primarily with the chief who is seen (by the Baluch) as the most typical form of paramount leader but for whom nevertheless there is no native term. The main functions of the leader are to provide social control and initiative, but he also personifies the prestige of the community.</p><p>A chief (or other leader) rules generally through kenash, who form the basic political denominators of the society. Neither is directly chosen or elected by the other. The extent of a leader's power depends basically on two factors:<ul><li>i) his \"ecological\" situation, i.e. parentage, alliance, etc.</li><li>ii) his \"personality\",</li></ul></p><p>of which the first is little use without the latter, but the latter is to a large extent confirmed by the former. A certain quality attaches to this personality of the leader - particularly in the case of the chief - who has affinities with Weber's \"charisma\".</p><p>In the Baluch Period (before 1928), where possible a chief operated from a fort in an agricultural centre, and generally either owed (informal) allegiances to a senior chief, or was owed allegiances by another chief or chiefs. He was traditionally entitled to a tithe on the produce of the land he controlled (apart from his major share of the produce from the land he owned), and service from the pastoralists. In addition to this in many cases he also collected a tax (in origin nourped from the Persian Government) from all sections of the population. Despite definite class distinctions, n some cases linked with differnces in occupation and conventional behaviour, there is little real differentiation in standard of living between the leader and the led, and no privacy for the chief.</p><p>6. The overwhelming majority of all Baluch are Sunni muslims of the Hanafi rite, and the words Islam and religion are synonyms in Baluchi. Although the chief provides the major force for social control in the society, Islamic law (interpreted by the maulawi) provides an alien standard and constitutes a court of appeal. In present circumstances, now that the chiefs in general no longer have physical force at their disposal, the religious role-statuses play a greater part in social control and leadership. The basis of the legitimacy of this \"formal religion\" is alien, inasmuch as its representatives have to study outside the Province. Given \"personality\" this legitimacy may be sufficient to allow the maulawi to rival a chief as a leader. But even so, and despite the charisma of Islam, without physical force he would not be able to impose settlements any more than a chief. The personal element is as much a part of religious as of secular leadership.</p><p>Not all the religious concepts and practices in the Provinces are accepted by the formal religions. We therefore use the term \"informal religion\" to cover unrationalised religious attitudes and practices which though they may not be denied by the formal religion do not form a conscious part of it, and we treat the role-status of darwish as the personification of the informal religion in the society. The position of the darwish may or may not be tribal, that of the maulawi is never tribal. The chief is often called on to fulfil many of the functions of the darwish.</p><p>7. In practice therefore in Baluch society now a leader may be either secular, formal religious, or informal religious, while the authority of his leadership is based on qualities of personality plus either birth, foreign religious learning, or esoteric religious knowledge respectively. Their power depends on these bases plus a combination of sociological factors such as kin, affinal and allegiance ties. Whatever the basis of the leader's legitimacy, or the scope of his power, the authority which he wields includes both temporal and spiritual aspects and these two aspects are not consciously differentiated. We can go no further in the analysis of leadership without analysing the \"personality\" of the leader.</p><p>8. In the context of this argument there is much similarity between the Persian Baluch and (among published ethnography) the southern Iraqi Kurds, the Swat Pathans, the Basseri in south Persia, the Marri Baluch in West Pakistan, the Somali, the Arab Bedouin, the Asande, and the feudal society of Medieval Europe, and comparative material from each of these societies is chosen to illustrate further various aspects of this type of leadership's situation, and show the general relevance and importance of the Baluch material.</p><p>9. A third party judges a chief by the quality and quantity of kamash who own allegiance to him. In Baluch thinking men do not create a chief by selecting him as their leader. This is not surprising, for they do not have a word for chief. The chiefs come from certain families (referred to by the family or tribal name in lieu of a general term) which enjoy a higher status than any of the rest of the community. However, none of the role-statuses are in Baluch thinking elective. Four major criteria may be distinguished on which the Baluch choose a particular chief as their leader. These are on two planes:</p><p><ul><li>a) <ul><li>i. ecological situation - in fact, his power,</li><li>ii. personality - the sum of his personal qualities,</li></ul></li><li>b)<ul><li>i. present - what the above factors amount to now, and</li><li>ii. past - what they amounted to in the past, e.g. in the case of his father, etc.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p>It is doubtful whether any one of these factors may be said to be generally more important than the others.</p><p>In general, individual social relationships are amazingly stable, - until they become political relationships, when they tend to be unstable. The Baluch have a certain degree of social, but no specifically political, institutionalisation. This situation leaves a wide field for values of personality, and personality may be regarded as the main factor in political \"legitimacy\", - though the Baluch themselves do not think in terms of political legitimacy or even of \"political stability\". Ideological divisions militate against large scale landownership as a stable basis for legitimacy, and together with the traditional isolation of the Province these divisions have meant that it has never been in the interests of the Baluch to have one paramount high-status leader for the purposes of treating with the Persian Administration or other foreign powers. However, the marriage and inheritance practices tend to define and preserve dynasties, even though genealogy as such is never a factor in establishing their legitimacy for the majority of their followers. Nevertheless, the chief always co-ordinates a number of sociological divisions among his followers - only he can have sufficient status and mobility to overcome all the sociological and ecological barriers to political unity.</p><p>10. Social differentiation between religious and secular in the society is forced by the acceptance of an alien formal religion. Decrease in the temporal power of the secular role-status of chief has been compensated by an increase in demand for the spiritual functions he can fulfil. Paramount temporal power generally has its spiritual associations at least, if only because it symbolises the unity of the society. In the Baluch case, lack of institutionalization and formality in the choice of leaders, together with the lack of conscious differentiation between spiritua and temporal, is linked with the political importance of values of personality in the society. Charisma is the \"spiritual\" aspect of these values.</p><p>The mode of choice defines the society's own conception of its leader, and therefore in this case it is the primary clue to an understanding of what we have felt constrained to call \"charisma\". \"Personality\" may be divided into:</p><ul><li>i) objective factors - which may be determined by analysing the total objective ecological relationship between the leader and his followers, and</li><li>ii) subjective factors - which are the values accorded by the followers to certain of the objective factors in the leader's personality.</li></ul></p><p>Charisma is the combination of the subjective factors. It is the \"otherness\" which the followers accord the leader subjectively.</p><p>Therefore, there is an inverse ratio between the degree of political institutionalisation and the importance of personality in leadership. And the need to lend a personality political legitimacy causes the follower to accord it a charismatic otherness subjectively, and this takes the leader's authority beyond the purely-temporal sphere.</p>" ],

  "title" : "The regulation of global deSUMOylation by human SUMO- specific proteases",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The regulation of global deSUMOylation by human SUMO- specific proteases", "SUMOylation - the covalent tagging of a target protein with a SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) molecule - has recently emerged as an important post-translational modification in regulating a wide array of biological events. SUMOylation is a dynamics process, where SUMO- specific proteases (SENPs) process proSUMO molecules and also deconjugate them from substrates. My dissertation focuses on the deconjugating activity of SENPs and addresses the role they play in regulating the global SUMOylation \"status quo\" of eukaryotic cells. SENPs are among the most specific proteases and only cleave SUMO molecules, yet they exhibit substantial substrate specificity among SUMO paralogs. To address the deconjugating specificities of human SENPs, I developed two different proteomics strategies to profile these proteases. One method has the potential to identify lysines of SUMOylation, besides the SUMOylation substrate itself, while the other can differentiate SUMOylated substrates from SUMO-interactors. To this end, I demonstrated the proof-of-principle of both methods and have identified polySUMOylated substrates. Such polySUMOylation (ie: modification of proteins by SUMO chains) has been an elusive phenomenon to study. In fact, so far, mainly mass spectrometry has shed light on the nature of SUMO chains through identifying SUMO-SUMO isopeptides. Thus, in the bulk of my dissertation, using a conjugatable, but not deconjugatable SUMO, I demonstrate the abundance of SUMO chains in vivo, make them visually appreciable and uncover the rapid dynamics of SUMOylation through their deconjugation. I propose that the balance of the dynamics is largely due to the action of SENPs in constantly cleaving SUMO from its targets, whether from a target protein or from another SUMO. This way, SENPs guard the SUMOylation status of the proteome, which by definition includes keeping in check modification of substrates by SUMO chains. I also establish the mechanism of SUMO chain deconjugation, which I show to be stochastic. Lastly, I reiterate the importance of deSUMOylation in vivo, by showing that the lack of deSUMOylation is adversary for the growth of Schizosaccharomyces pombe under replicative stress and for human cells" ],

These programs target the walk to school as an essential point of intervention to improve pedestrian safety and increase physical activity among children. In this article, we evaluate California’s pioneering SR2S construction program, which was designed to improve safety for children’s walking and bicycling to school, and to increase the number of children who do so, by funding traffic engineering improvements around schools. Through a systematic evaluation of 10 California SR2S traffic improvement projects near elementary schools, we examined the impacts of this influential state policy on children’s travel behavior in these neighborhoods. We investigated changes in the perceived safety of children’s trips to school, in safety-related behaviors tied to the trip to school, and in the number of children walking and bicycling to school following these improvements. The findings have implications for California’s SR2S program and for similar initiatives throughout the country." ],

In this paper, we study the effects of retroactivity at the interconnection between two transcriptional modules, focusing on stochastic behavior. In particular, we describe the system through the Master equation and develop a singular perturbation theory to obtain a reduced Master equation. We prove that the solution of the original Master equation converges fast to an e neighbor of the solution of the reduced Master equation, in which e is the singular perturbation parameter. Our analysis shows that the upstream system and the downstream one are statistically independent at the steady state. However, the interconnection slows down the dynamics of both the expectation and the variance of the output of the upstream transcriptional module." ],

It posits that Brontë’s social critique of gender convention in nineteenth-century England is related to her novelistic critique of narrator-reader tradition in first-person novels. In the same way that gender convention dictates the context in which social sympathy should be felt thereby perpetuating gendered power relationships, novelistic tradition also dictates the context in which readerly sympathy should be felt and also endorses a power relationship between narrator and reader. However, this thesis concludes that Brontë’s creation of a contentious and oppositional narrator in Villette ultimately reverses this latter power relationship between narrator and reader." ],

However, reproducing all the components of such complex systems precisely would require unreasonable amounts of computing power. Hence, a trade off between accuracy and compute time is needed. For this reason most state-of-the-art tools do not have accurate models for the networks-on-chip, and rely on timing models that permit fast-simulation. Generally, these models are very simplistic and disregard contention for the use of network resources. As the number of nodes in the network-on-chip grows, fluctuations with contention and other parameters can considerably affect the accuracy of such models. In this paper we present and evaluate a collection of timing models based on a reservation scheme which consider the contention for the use of network resources. These models provide results quickly while being more accurate than simple no-contention approaches." ],

We examine themes from our interviews such as ‘dignity’, ‘normality’, ‘happiness’ and the ‘affordability’ and ‘ease’ of life in the UK (compared to Poland). We focus on the autobiographical or intra-personal discursive practices that define what Habib calls migrants' continuing relationship with their ‘homeland’. We draw on Emirbayer and Mische's analysis of the relationship between ‘agency’ and what they call ‘embedded temporalities’ to examine the interaction between our participants' recollections of life in Poland and their evaluation of their present lives in the UK in order to examine the impact of these on their future plans (to stay in the UK or return to Poland). We locate this analysis in what we call a transnational autobiographical field which is a modification of what Levitt and Glick Schiller call a transnational social field. Rather than examine, for example, how decisions to migrate, settle and re-migrate are embedded in inter or trans-personal social relations and networks, in this article we examine the self-dynamics associated with our participants' articulation of their intra-personal and autobiographical embedded temporalities. Our argument is that articulations of individuals' pasts, presents and anticipated futures are also significant factors shaping their migration, settlement, and re-migration decisions." ],

From its size alone, we should expect this group to hold some of the clues, not only to how religious change takes place in Europe, but also why. Using the Religious and Moral Pluralism (RAMP) survey from 10 European countries, four subtypes of “fuzzy fidelity” were identified through cluster analysis. These included both “believing without belonging” and “belonging without believing.” Detailed analysis of each type show great national differences in the ways that religion is practiced and understood. A sizable minority of the Dutch population can be classified as “Believing without belonging,” whereas Scandinavians are much more likely to belong without believing. The diversity of the religious landscape within fuzzy fidelity highlights the methodological issues involved in using single-scale measures for multidimensional phenomena." ],

Little is yet known regarding the co-stimulatory environment that favours the development of Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses during helminth infections. As recent evidence implicates the co-stimulatory receptor ICOS in defining Foxp3(+) Treg-cell functions, we investigated the role of ICOS in helminth-induced Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses. Infection of ICOS(-/-) mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Schistosoma mansoni led to a reduced expansion and maintenance of Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Moreover, during H. polygyrus infection, ICOS deficiency resulted in increased Foxp3(+) Treg-cell apoptosis, a Foxp3(+) Treg-cell specific impairment in IL-10 production, and a failure to mount putatively adaptive Helios(-) Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses within the intestinal lamina propria. Impaired lamina propria Foxp3(+) Treg-cell responses were associated with increased production of IL-4 and IL-13 by CD4(+) T cells, demonstrating that ICOS dominantly downregulates Type 2 responses at the infection site, sharply contrasting with its Type 2-promoting effects within lymphoid tissue. Thus, ICOS regulates Type 2 immunity in a tissue-specific manner, and plays a key role in driving Foxp3(+) Treg-cell expansion and function during helminth infections." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Cars and Drivers in the New Suburbs: Linking Access to Travel in Neotraditional Planning", "Various 'new suburb' land use designs have recently been proposed to address a number of social and environmental problems, including the dominance of automobile travel. Transportation benefits are to be accomplished by reducing the surface street distance between locations, mixing land uses, and promoting walking, bicycling and transit via redesigned streets and street-scapes. That auto travel will fall is a largely unchallenged premise of these designs, though what little evidence exists is either weak or contrary. This paper presents a simple behavioral model to explain why. Generally speaking, driving is both discouraged and facilitated in the new suburbs, with the net effect being an empirical matter. In particular, both the number of automobile trips and vehicle-miles traveled can actually increase with an increase in access, such as a move to a more grid-like land use pattern. Whatever the merits of neotraditional and transit-oriented designs, and there are many, their transportation benefits have thus been oversold. Each development must be evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether its net impact on auto use is positive or negative. An analytical framework for doing so is suggested." ],

Multi-hop wireless networks are rapidlydeployable to extend the coverage of the Internet, which can be aneconomical alternative to building new base stations. Multi-hopwireless networks are particularly useful for first responders fordisaster relief, and military operations in battlefields. In thisthesis, we study power scheduling issues for multi-hop wirelessnetworks. Power scheduling, also known as medium access controlconsisting of link scheduling, power control and source beamforming,fundamentally governs the capacity of multi-hop wireless networks.In the first part of this thesis, the achievable network throughputof large-scale multi-hop wireless networks is evaluated under apower scheduling scheme called opportunistic synchronous arraymethod (O-SAM). Under O-SAM, a large network is partitioned intomany small subnets, and within each subnet, the link with bestchannel gain is scheduled for transmission. We examine the impact oftraffic load, network topology and multiple antennas on theachievable network throughput. Compared with slotted ALOHA, thethroughput of O-SAM is significantly higher. In addition to O-SAM, adistributed synchronous array method (D-SAM) is proposed, and itsperformance is also evaluated.In the second part of this thesis, we focus on the power schedulingproblem for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) relay networks. Ageneralized water filling (GWF) theorem is established for link ratemaximization with multiple power constraints. The corresponding GWFalgorithm is a fast solution to an important class of convexoptimization problems.  The GWF algorithm is a useful building blockfor joint source and relay optimization for a multiuser MIMO relaynetwork. We study the power scheduling problems for both uplink anddown- link cases of the multiuser MIMO relay network. A number ofcomputational strategies are proposed to maximize the sum ratesubject to power constraints or to minimize the sum power subject torate constraints." ],

A number of centers are reporting the continuing increasing frequency and evolution of resistance mechanisms in A. fumigatus, in both azole-naïve and patients treated with azoles. The increasing rate of resistance is of concern. A number of resistance mechanisms have been found. The biofilm modality of Aspergillus growth may have a number of therapeutic implications for aspergillosis, including antifungal resistance. Microbiological diagnosis of aspergillosis is limited by poor culture yield, leading to uncertainty about the frequency of triazole resistance.

  "texts" : [ "Explaining Financial Scandals: Corporate Governance, Structured Finance and the Enlightened Sovereign Control Paradigm", "Submitted by Vincenzo Bavoso for the degree of PhD entitled “Explaining financial scandals: corporate governance, structured finance and the enlightened sovereign control paradigm”, School of Law, Faculty of Humanities, The University of Manchester, 30/06/2012.The explosion of the global financial crisis in 2007-08 reignited the urgency to reflect on the origins and causes of financial collapses. As the above events kick-started an economic meltdown that is still ongoing, comparisons with the Great Crash of 1929 started to abound. In particular, the externalities that a broad spectrum of societal groups had to bear as a consequence of various banking failures highlighted the necessity of a more inclusive and balanced regulation of firms whose activities impact on a wide range of stakeholders.The thesis is centred on the proposal of a paradigm, the “enlightened sovereign control”, that provides a theoretical, institutional and substantive framework as a response to the legal issues analysed in the thesis. These stem primarily from the analysis of two sequences of events (the 2001-03 wave of “accounting frauds” and the 2007-08 global crisis) which represent the background upon which modern financial scandals are explained. This is done by highlighting a number of common denominators emerging from the case studies (Enron and Parmalat, Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers) which caused financial instability and scandals. The research is grounded on the initial recognition of theoretical themes in the field of corporate and financial law, which eventually link with the more practical events examined. This parallel enquiry leads to the investigation of two heavily interrelated spheres of law and finally highlights more practical legal issues that emerge from the analysis.Through this multifaceted approach, the thesis contends that the occurrence of financial crises during the last decade is essentially rooted in two main problems: a corporate governance one, represented by the lack of effective control systems within large public firms; and a corporate finance one identified with the excesses of financial innovation and related abuses of capital market finance. Research conducted in this thesis ultimately seeks to contribute to current debates in the areas of corporate and financial law, through the proposals of the “enlightened sovereign control” paradigm." ],

Specifically, each user sends one independent message to its corresponding receiver through its own antenna and via the help of the cognitive helper. For this network, we show that the sum DoF value is outer bounded by(K + 1)/2whenKis odd andK2/(2(K + 1))whenKis even, respectively. The new DoF outer bounds are derived based on the fact that collaboration among users does not decrease the capacity region and increasing the number of users does not increase the capacity per user. In addition, we provide a new achievable scheme to achieve a total of(K + 1)/2DoF for anyK≥3. Thus, the exact DoF value of the network is characterized with the total DoF given as(K + 1)/2, wheneverKis odd. The new achievable scheme is based on interference neutralization and asymptotic interference alignment." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Travel and Emissions Impacts of Telecommuting for the State of California Telecommuting Pilot Project", "The impacts of home-based telecommuting on travel behavior and personal vehicle emissions for participants in the State of California Telecommuting Pilot Project are analyzed using the most advanced emissions modeling tools currently available. A comparison of participants' telecommuting day travel behavior with their before-telecommuting behavior shows a 27% reduction in the number of personal vehicle trips, a 77% decrease in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), and 39% (and 4%) decreases in the number of cold (and hot) engine starts. These decreases in travel translate into emissions reductions of 48% for total organic gases (TOG), 64% for carbon monoxide (CO), 69% for nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 78% for particulate matter (PM). Although the authors developed the methodology to investigate the emissions impact of telecommuting, the analysis technique can be applied to any demand management or other transportation strategy where all of the necessary model inputs are available. An analysis of the number of personal vehicle trips and VMT partitioned into commute-related and non-commute-related purposes revealed that non-commute personal vehicle trips increase by 0.5 trips per person-day on average, whereas the non-commute VMT decreased by 5.3 miles. This important finding supports (for one indicator, the number of trips) the hypothesis that non-commute travel generation is a potential negative impact of telecommuting. This finding demonstrates the need to monitor these changes as telecommuting moves into the mainstream. In this study, however, the small increase in non-commute trips has a negligible impact compared to the overall travel and emissions savings." ],

  "texts" : [ "Quantitative risk assessment for skin sensitisation: consideration of a simplified approach for hair dye ingredients.", "With the availability of the local lymph node assay, and the ability to evaluate effectively the relative skin sensitizing potency of contact allergens, a model for Quantitative-Risk-Assessment (QRA) has been developed. This QRA process comprises: (a) determination of a No-Expected-Sensitisation-Induction-Level (NESIL), (b) incorporation of Sensitization-Assessment-Factors (SAFs) reflecting variations between subjects, product use patterns and matrices, and (c) estimation of Consumer-Exposure-Level (CEL). Based on these elements an Acceptable-Exposure-Level (AEL) can be calculated by dividing the NESIL of the product by individual SAFs. Finally, the AEL is compared with the CEL to judge about risks to human health. We propose a simplified approach to risk assessment of hair dye ingredients by making use of precise experimental product exposure data. This data set provides firmly established dose/unit area concentrations under relevant consumer use conditions referred to as the Measured-Exposure-Level (MEL). For that reason a direct comparison is possible between the NESIL with the MEL as a proof-of-concept quantification of the risk of skin sensitization. This is illustrated here by reference to two specific hair dye ingredients p-phenylenediamine and resorcinol. Comparison of these robust and toxicologically relevant values is therefore considered an improvement versus a hazard-based classification of hair dye ingredients." ],

University cultural centers promote retention and sense of belonging for underserved students (June, 1996; Patton, 2006; Welch, 2008).This study included Schlossberg's (1989) theory of mattering to investigate underserved student retention. Using constructivist grounded theory data analysis methods, this study examined the influences of sense of belonging and mattering on underserved student retention in a university cultural center (Charmaz, 2006). Qualitative data collection methods were implemented to analyze cultural center and cultural center staff influence on sense of belonging and mattering of underserved students. Seven undergraduate students and one full-time staff member in the Cross-Cultural Center at California State University, San Marcos, participated in focus groups and an interview. Document analysis contributed to the trustworthiness of the data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). A theory grounded in the experiences of the students, student staff, and staff of the Cross-Cultural Center emerged from the data. The emerging theory was called \"Cultural Center Staff : A Grounded Theory of Distributed Relational Leadership and Retention.\" Distributed relational leadership was the core or central phenomenon of the grounded theory. As a rich emergent finding, identity development was added to this study's conceptual framework of sense of belonging, mattering, and retention. Distributed relational leadership, sense of community, the physical space of the Center, and programs influenced the sense of belonging, mattering, identity development, and retention of underserved students. This study's grounded theory guides ongoing retention theory research and university cultural center practice" ],

This study combined 1) quantitative comparisons of biology persisters and switchers via a questionnaire developed for the study and survival analysis of a larger population of biology freshmen with 2) qualitative comparison of biology switchers and persisters via semi-structured life story interviews and homogenous focus groups.  319 students (207 persisters and 112 switchers) participated in the questionnaire and 36 students (20 persisters and 16 switchers) participated in life story and focus group interviews.  All participants were undergraduates who entered The University of Texas at Austin as biology freshmen in the fall semesters of 2000 through 2004.  Findings of this study suggest:  1) Regardless of eventual major, biology students enter college with generally the same suite of experiences, sources of personal encouragement, and reasons for choosing the biology major; 2) Despite the fact that they have also had poor experiences in the major, biology persisters do not actively decide to stay in the biology major; they simply do not leave; 3) Based upon survival analysis, biology students  are most at-risk of leaving the biology major during the first two years of college and if they are African-American or Latino, women, or seeking a Bachelor  of Arts degree (rather than a Bachelor of Science); 4) Biology switchers do not leave biology due to preference for other disciplines; they leave due to difficulties or dissatisfaction with aspects of the biology major, including their courses, faculty, and peers; 5) Biology performance has a differential effect on persistence in the biology major, depending on how well students perform in comparison to other courses or other students." ],

Historically, in the UK this was the pattern for the traditional professions of law, accountancy, medicine and architecture. More recently in the UK, sandwich courses, predominantly a 'new' university contribution to higher education, have been developed to give students a balance between academic theory and practical professional experience.

  "texts" : [ "Detection and quantification of bacterial spoilage in milk and pork meat using MALDI-TOF-MS and multivariate analysis.", "Microbiological safety is one of the cornerstones of quality control in the food industry. Identification and quantification of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk and meat in the food industry currently relies on accurate and sensitive yet time-consuming techniques which give retrospective values for microbial contamination. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), a proven technique in the field of protein and peptide identification and quantification, may be a valuable alternative approach for the rapid assessment of microbial spoilage. In this work we therefore developed MALDI-TOF-MS as a novel analytical approach for the assessment of food that when combined with chemometrics allows for the detection and quantification of milk and pork meat spoilage bacteria. To develop this approach, natural spoilage of pasteurized milk and raw pork meat samples incubated at 15 °C and at room temperature, respectively, was conducted. Samples were collected for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis (which took 4 min per sample) at regular time intervals throughout the spoilage process, with concurrent calculation and documentation of reference total viable counts using traditional microbiological methods (these took 2 days). Multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component discriminant function analysis, canonical correlation analysis, partial least-squares (PLS) regression, and kernel PLS (KPLS) were used to analyze the data. The results from MALDI-TOF-MS combined with PLS or KPLS gave excellent bacterial quantification results for both milk and meat spoilage, and typical root mean squared errors for prediction in test spectra were between 0.53 and 0.79 log unit. Overall these novel findings strongly indicate that MALDI-TOF-MS when combined with chemometric approaches would be a useful adjunct for routine use in the milk and meat industry as a fast and accurate viable bacterial detection and quantification method." ],

The current study explored the relationship between depression and anxiety in Parkinson’s disease and frontal lobe cognitive impairment. Twenty community-based participants with PD were compared with 20 participants, over the age of 60 years, without a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, matched for age, sex, educational level, and pre-morbid intelligence. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure mood, and the FAS Verbal Fluency test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and a Stroop test were employed to measure frontal lobe cognitive functioning.  The group with Parkinson’s disease was characterised by greater anxiety and depression, in addition to impaired Verbal Fluency performance, compared with the group without the disorder. Participants with PD and major depression as defined by the HADS exhibited greater general cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Younger participants and those in whom the disease had been diagnosed at a younger age were more likely to suffer from anxiety. A number of participants with Parkinson’s disease exhibited co-morbid anxiety and depression. In addition, four of the research sample with Parkinson’s disease scored below the cut-off point on the MMSE indicative of cognitive impairment sufficient to suggest dementia. Implications for those living with Parkinson’s disease plus recommendations for future research are discussed." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Distributed Load Balancing in Many-To-One Wireless Sensor Networks", "A typical sensor network is conceived as being a very large collection of low-powered, homogeneous nodes that remain static post-deployment and forward sensed data to a single sink via multi-hop communication. For these types of networks there is an inherent funnelling effect whereby the nodes that can communicate directly with the sink must collectively forward the traffic of the entire network and therefore these nodes use more energy than the other nodes. This is known as the energy hole problem because after some time, these nodes deplete their batteries and leave an energy hole cutting the sink off from the network.In this thesis two new routing protocols are proposed that aim to maximise load balancing among these most critical nodes in order to maximise lifetime. They are the first fully distributed routing protocols that are designed to generate a load balanced routing tree to mitigate the energy hole problem. The results show that the better performing of the two is capable of creating a highly balanced tree at the cost of a small increase in latency.Although there have been other fully distributed protocols that aim at a similar form of load balancing, it is proven that the approach they take cannot guarantee perfect balance among the most critical nodes even in unrealistically generous scenarios. This suggests that they are not well suited to that task and the simulation results show that the novel protocols proposed in this thesis outperform the best of the alternatives.Before these protocols are proposed, the absolute reception-based blacklisting routing strategy is shown to be more energy efficient than previously thought and indeed more efficient than the strategy that has previously been considered optimal. This result is used to strongly justify the use of the unit disk graph model in simulations of sensor networks. Additionally, the relay hole problem in sensor networks is analysed for the first time." ],

A separation between parametric and unstructured uncertainty is achieved by first estimating low order linear parameter models via frequency domain curve fitting followed by a linear Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to bound the parametric variations on the estimated parameters. Remaining differences between the low order parametric models and the measured frequency responses are captured by a bounded unstructured uncertainty on a frequency dependent dual- Youla parameter that uses prior information on a stabilizing feedback controller. The resulting perturbation model is written in a standard Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) form and the procedure is applied to experimental data obtained from several mechanically equivalent servo actuators in a Linear Tape- Open (LTO) drive" ],

Shifting sands and teacher education: preparing future lifelong learning teachers for their first years in professional teaching practice, or preparing them to keep their heads above water?", "This collaborative study explores the transitions of three former further education teachers, at different points in their academic careers, into Higher Education teaching.   We suggest that this transition inevitably brings a number of personal and professional challenges. With an increasing move towards performativity via target setting, results and accountability, a great deal of academics’ time and energy is governed by a managerial-driven system based on close scrutiny of paperwork, and increasing emotional labour (e.g. Bathmaker and Avis, 2006) in work environments where job security is unstable due to redundancies and restructuring. This often leaves academics fearful of their job security, exhausted and reluctant to challenge the hegemony based on quantifiable outcomes whereby notions of critical autonomy are side-lined for compliance. The data draws on life history methodology and narrative enquiry.   It explores our stories and the process of what Clough and Nutbrown (2002, p.81) describe as ‘focused conversations’. It moves from viewing society as a disembodied structure, and instead sets our narratives against the backdrop of cultural, historical and political landscape, providing a life history methodology that allows us to make sense of our transitions through our connections.  The intertwining of our narratives provides an insight into how university lecturers engage in shaping a professional identity, and leads us to suggest that communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991, Wenger, 1998, Wenger et al., 2002) can support teachers’ critical autonomy in their early career." ],

Then, building on the ideas from \\cite{ACV11,ACV12} and \\cite{OS11}, we introduce a framework for the design of duality-based marker makers that enjoy liquidity adaptation as well as other desired properties. We will show that in return for liquidity adaptation, we must trade off information accuracy. A detailed discussion about this trade-off then follows.

Although opportunities exist to shop from home today, most consumers initiate travel trips to stores or markets. Widespread use of automobiles has facilitated the retailing configurations we know today but the development of new electronic networks could changes this. This study establishes a baseline to explore shopping activities using two-day travel activity data from a large U.S. metropolitan area. It is found that people who telework from home today spend more time engaged in shopping activities than other workers. Potentially, their saved work travel is converted into new trips. IN the future, saved shopping travel might be converted into other types of travel, and modeling results show that for busy working women there is a latent demand for maintenance-related activities. The study results suggest that electronic home shopping will bring into play complex interactions between communications and transportation." ],

As a complement to approaches to mathematically model capacity fade that require detailed understanding of each mechanism, capacity fade was accurately and efficiently predicted for future cycles using a discrete approach by extrapolating the change in effective transport and kinetic parameters with cycle number (N) for a battery tested under controlled experimental conditions. The effective parameters and their uncertainties are estimated using a mathematical reformulation of a porous electrode model, whose computational efficiency enables the integration of the proposed approach into an inexpensive microprocessor for estimating the remaining lifetime of a battery based on past charge-discharge curves. The approach may also provide some guidance for designers as to which battery components to focus on for redesign to reduce capacity fade." ],

On average, individuals in the experiments reduced their electricity consumption by 7.4%.Our results also show that strategies providing individualized audits and consulting are comparatively more effective for conservation behavior than strategies that provide historical, peer comparison energy feedback. Interestingly, we find that pecuniary feedback and incentives lead to a relative increase in energy usage rather than induce conservation.We also find that the effect varies with the rigor of the study, indicating potential methodological issues in the current literature." ],

As users demand more functionality and convenient access, there is often a point at which a systems designer has no choice but to ask clients to place some level of trust in one participant in the system, be it a key management server or even just the integrity of some external hardware. This is in contrast to many cryptographic functionalities that will either perform as expected, or at least remain secure, without a client having to trust anything but their own integrity. The main focus of this thesis is to conduct a thorough analysis of two settings in which trust is essential and find new dimensions in which to reduce the amount of trust the participants are asked to put in the system for it to function as expected. First, we analyze remote storage where a third party is trusted to store and do access control on a client's data. Second, we study what additional assumptions are necessary in order to circumvent impossibility of fully secure MPC without an honest majority." ],

Traditional simulations can help carry out virtual experiments but they are often not very interactive, and are frequently complex and slow. 3D VWs provide a natural interactive exploration environment, where individuals and groups can interact and learn. The prototype Wireless Ray-Tracing Educational Land (WRTEL) was built using the OpenSimulator VWs technology, to improve the learning experience for electrical engineering and physics students studying electromagnetic wireless systems. Instead of using textbooks, pictures, equations and paper examples to understand how wireless signals propagate, signals are visualized in an interactive 3D virtual environment. This paper presents the prototype WRTEL, where invisible wireless signal propagation is made visible using the VW technology. Students are able to visualize signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) in either two dimensions (2D) or three dimensions (3D), and information about each interaction between signals and the surrounding environment can be displayed. The WRTEL consists of three main regions. In the first region, three educational tools have been implemented to explore the relationship between wavelength and frequency, the electromagnetic spectrum and antennas. In the second region, a free space laboratory had been designed in simulated outer space to allow students to visualize line of sight signal propagation between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. In the third region, students are provided with a selectable two or three dimensional ray-tracing laboratory, to create environments using obstacles made from different materials. Students will be able to visualize how signal behaviour (reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering) is affected by the surrounding environment. Path loss calculations, received power, angle of incidence and many other values will be provided at any point in space until the signal is received by the receiver antenna. The transmitted wireless signals will be visualized by mapping them into the visual spectrum for display; this makes the invisible rays visible. A brief technical and educational evaluation indicated that the prototype educational land was both usable and would support student learning activities in laboratories." ],

  "texts" : [ "A Coherence Perspective of Bilateral Investment Treaties", "Foreign investment is mainly protected through national laws. However the wide-spreading network of bilateral investment treaties aims to ensure a certain standard of protection. These treaties demonstrate far-reaching implications at both treaty level and international level. The implications raise an important question as to whether bilateral investment treaties are coherent or not. Coherence can be viewed as an attempt to prettify the law and minimise the effect of politics which may leave the law incoherent. It is obvious that bilateral investment treaties need to be coherent for a number of reasons. Firstly, incoherent treaties may create problems in relation to the development policy of member countries. Secondly, coherence reassures that negotiators of such treaties would not encounter possible contradictions and inconsistencies amongst the countries’ agreement network as well as between the treaties and domestic laws. Thirdly, coherence is critical to treaty interpretation as it is necessary to avoid further complications which may arise from contradictory awards. The aim of this thesis is mainly to elucidate the meaning of coherence and use it to provide an understanding as to how coherent these treaties are. The coherence of bilateral investment treaties will be evaluated in  a number of aspects: coherence between bilateral investment treaties and the fundamental principles of international investment law; coherence between bilateral investment treaties and their objectives of investment promotion and investment liberalisation; coherence within the bilateral investment treaties network; coherence between bilateral investment treaties and customary international law on foreign investment; coherence between bilateral investment treaties and free trade agreements; coherence between bilateral investment treaties’ obligations and non-investment obligations of states." ],

In Arabidopsis thaliana, shortage of potassium (K) induces a number of genes related to the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA). Using comparative microarray analysis of wild-type and coi1-16 mutant plants, we classified transcriptional responses to K with respect to their dependence on COI1, a central component of oxylipin signaling. Expression profiles obtained in a short-term experiment clearly distinguished between COI1-dependent and COI1-independent K-responsive genes, and identified both known and novel targets of JA-COI1-signaling. During long-term K-deficiency, coi-16 mutants displayed de novo responses covering similar functions as COI1-targets except for defense. A putative role of JA for enhancing the defense potential of K-deficient plants was further supported by the observation that plants grown on low K were less damaged by thrips than plants grown with sufficient K." ],

Identical experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis, consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes that have been previously associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf, Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1 mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and metastasis." ],

Commensurate to the size of the industry is a growth in the number of students pursuing degree courses in tourism around the world. Despite an increasingly sophisticated literature, the relative recency of the industry and its study has meant little attention has been paid in the ethics literature to the dilemmas facing tourism managers and its students. Based on interviews with senior members of the tourism industry six scenarios are developed with pertinence to the challenges faced by industry practitioners today. This paper then applies the Multidimensional Ethics Scale (Reidenbach and Robin, 1990) to tourism students at three prominent universities in the UK, Canada and Australia. In total, 438 responses are achieved.

It is organized as follows.The system architecture is explained in section 2. Section 3 deals with the kinematics model of the AGV path,prediction and control. Section 4 describes the experiments. The conclusion and recommendation are given insection 5.Design/methodology/approach: It is a three wheels vehicle. The front wheel is used for driving and steering theAGV and the two rear wheels are free. The steering and driving are DC motor. Two encoders are individuallyattached on the two rear wheels in order to measure the vehicle displacement and then calculate its real timeposition and orientation. The choice of positioning the encoders on the free wheels provides to the vehicle anaccurate measurement of its progression. A programmable logic control (PLC) is used for motion control.Findings: In this paper, An Automate Guided Vehicle (AGV) is presented. The developed algorithm is basedon memorised path and kinematics determination of the movement. The vehicle position and deviation arecalculated from rear wheels rotation measurement. The steering and driving command are determined fromthis deviation. Localization of AGV by Kaman filtering algorithm is presented. Control of AGV motion isimplemented by using PID control scheme. Displacement axis and steering axis are separated to implementthe motion control. We proposed the localization system for estimation of AGV. Position and orientation areestimated by Kalman filtering in state-space model. Position and orientation of AGV are measured and used forsimulation for localization system. We conclude that the vehicle can reach from the initial position moved alongwith generated path with accurate location. A Schneider PLC is used to implement this control. The tests reveala smooth movement and convenient deviation.Practical implications: The first prototype working, the next research steps will be development of a correctionsystem to correct none detected errors. It will also be necessary to develop the fleet management strategy andsoftware.Originality/value: Future work is planed to increase the accuracy of the system by equip more sensors forobservation technique. Treatment of dynamic model and machine vision application of automated vehicle arealso planed to the next step" ],

In the Boston NECTA during the 2000-2002 period, 70% of home-purchase lending was done by out-of-state banks or by mortgage companies not affiliated with Massachusetts banks. These lenders, not covered by CRA, perform significantly worse than covered lenders in lending to borrowers and neighborhoods of color. Pending Massachusetts legislation would bring the state’s CRA into line with the transformed nature of the mortgage lending industry by imposing CRA-type obligations and evaluations on all types of mortgage lenders.

  "texts" : [ "Open implementation approach to Internet-scale context awareness", "Proliferation of hardware and software sensors and our desire to determine relationships between the near-real- time data from multiple publishers motivates our introduction of Internet-scale context-awareness (ISCA). Content-based publish/subscribe (CBPS) seems the most natural substrate for ISCA because it provides the right separation of concerns, efficient event distribution, extensibility, and scalability. However, our evolving information environment is different from that for which CBPS was designed. Attempting to use the black-box style transparency afforded by CBPS precludes efficiently detecting data relationships for publication as context- aware events and leads to information glut and device saturation. We overcome these problems by recognizing that any component-based system is an ecology for which we can achieve global efficiencies by providing top-down and bottom-up context and collaboration. We extend CBPS with an open implementation approach to enable subscribers to inject domain-specific knowledge into the network in the form of first-class publish/subscribe agents. Agents are distributed algorithms that observe and transform data, dynamically manage bounding region filters, and exchange data only on an as-needed basis to eliminate useless event traffic at the sensor-edges of the network. Filtering at the network edge reduces bottlenecks in the network core to increase the scalability of the system. Content-based routing mechanisms are leveraged to allow the user to control where code is deployed, to develop complex relationship hierarchies, and to construct one-to-one conversations by leveraging existing network knowledge without flooding the network with either advertisements or subscriptions. We are programming the network. We add dynamic contextual message filtering and distributed memoization to minimize re-computation at downstream nodes. Combining open implementation, distributed processing, content-addressability, and distributed memoization satisfies the required increases in expressiveness, efficiency, and scalability necessary to achieve our Internet-scale context-awareness vision. Our algorithm detecting the proximity of mobile buddies reduced event traffic from O (events) to an expectation of about ln (movement) event-hops. Complex traffic-route monitoring used eight times fewer events than basic CBPS and reduced aggregation enhanced CBPS load imbalances by distributing relationship computations over the event- entry edge-brokers. Our algorithms are scalable with increased reporting rates because they measure data movement" ],

We show that when nutrition affects only utility then under rather general conditions it will be optimal for all members of the household to consume food bundles of identical quality. This is true even when household members have private information about their actions—in this case thequantityof food given may provide incentives, but quality remains common within the household. When nutrition affects household resources our finding that quality is constant is overturned—in this case when the household invests more in the nutrition of one member it will simultaneouslyreducethe quality of her food bundle.\n      Using data on individual-level food consumption from a sample of farm households in the Philippines, we estimate and test a dynamic model of intra-household food allocation. We find that individual consumption shares respond to individual earnings shocks. At least part of this response is due to nutritional investments, but it appears that the allocation of food also plays a role in providing incentives within the household." ],

It also enables the case to be made, and the content outlined, for a tourism higher education which educates philosophic practitioners. These would be graduates who deliver efficient and effective tourism services whilst at the same discharging the role of stewardship for the development of the wider tourism world in which these services are delivered.</p>" ],

  "texts" : [ "Free transit for low-income youth: Experience in the San Francisco Bay Area", "In August 2002, AC Transit – the principal bus operator serving the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay – began distributing free bus passes to low-income middle school and high school students in the transit service district. The program developed in response to grassroots community activism and growing political pressure to remove the burden of school transportation costs from low-income households. Advocates argued that school transportation costs were a barrier that prevented poor children from participating in after-school activities and, in severe cases, led to missed days of school. Funding for a pilot bus pass program was provided by the transit agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, local agencies, and several nonprofit organizations. The University of California, Berkeley, was funded to carry out an evaluation of the program during the first year of the program. Before-and-after travel and activity surveys, interviews, focus group meetings, and analysis of attendance data were used in the evaluation. Findings after 1 year of implementation indicate that the free bus pass program increased student bus ridership and after-school participation but did not increase overall school attendance. Increases in bus use were greater among pass holders, in areas with high levels of bus service, and among high school students." ],

  "texts" : [ "Mechanistic reappraisal of early stage photochemistry in the light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase.", "The light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide (Chlide). This reaction is a key step in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll. Ultrafast photochemical processes within the Pchlide molecule are required for catalysis and previous studies have suggested that a short-lived excited-state species, known as I675*, is the first catalytic intermediate in the reaction and is essential for capturing excitation energy to drive subsequent hydride and proton transfers. The chemical nature of the I675* excited state species and its role in catalysis are not known. Here, we report time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements to study the involvement of the I675* intermediate in POR photochemistry. We show that I675* is not unique to the POR-catalyzed photoreduction of Pchlide as it is also formed in the absence of the POR enzyme. The I675* species is only produced in samples that contain both Pchlide substrate and Chlide product and its formation is dependent on the pump excitation wavelength. The rate of formation and the quantum yield is maximized in 50∶50 mixtures of the two pigments (Pchlide and Chlide) and is caused by direct energy transfer between Pchlide and neighboring Chlide molecules, which is inhibited in the polar solvent methanol. Consequently, we have re-evaluated the mechanism for early stage photochemistry in the light-driven reduction of Pchlide and propose that I675* represents an excited state species formed in Pchlide-Chlide dimers, possibly an excimer. Contrary to previous reports, we conclude that this excited state species has no direct mechanistic relevance to the POR-catalyzed reduction of Pchlide." ],

  "texts" : [ "Spin injection and transport in semiconductor and metal nanostructures", "In this thesis we investigate spin injection and transport in semiconductor and metal nanostructures. To overcome the limitation imposed by the low efficiency of spin injection and extraction and strict requirements for retention of spin polarization within the semiconductor, novel device structures with additional logic functionality and optimized device performance have been developed. Weak localization/antilocalization measurements and analysis are used to assess the influence of surface treatments on elastic, inelastic and spin-orbit scatterings during the electron transport within the two-dimensional electron layer at the InAs surface. Furthermore, we have used spin- valve and scanned probe microscopy measurements to investigate the influence of sulfur-based surface treatments and electrically insulating barrier layers on spin injection into, and spin transport within, the two- dimensional electron layer at the surface of p-type InAs. We also demonstrate and analyze a three-terminal, all- electrical spintronic switching device, combining charge current cancellation by appropriate device biasing and ballistic electron transport. The device yields a robust, electrically amplified spin-dependent current signal despite modest efficiency in electrical injection of spin- polarized electrons. Detailed analyses provide insight into the advantages of ballistic, as opposed to diffusive, transport in device operation, as well as scalability to smaller dimensions, and allow us to eliminate the possibility of phenomena unrelated to spin transport contributing to the observed device functionality. The influence of the device geometry on magnetoresistance of nanoscale spin-valve structures is also demonstrated and discussed. Shortcomings of the simplified one-dimensional spin diffusion model for spin valve are elucidated, with comparison of the thickness and the spin diffusion length in the nonmagnetic channel as the criterion for validity of the 1D model. Our work contributes directly to the realization of spin valve and spin transistor devices based on III-V semiconductors, and offers new opportunities to engineer the behavior of spintronic devices at the nanoscale" ],

These normal intracellular and abnormal extracellular roles can be attributed to the multidomain structure of AGR2. The NMR structure shows that AGR2 consists of an unstructured N-terminal region followed by a thioredoxin fold. The protein exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium with a K(d) of 8.83μM, and intermolecular salt bridges involving E60 and K64 within the folded domain serve to stabilize the dimer. The unstructured region is primarily responsible for the ability of AGR2 to promote cell adhesion, while dimerization is less important for this activity.

The tradeoffs among the constraints on clock jitter, skew, slew rate, and power are discussed. For strict timing constraints, severe power overhead (≥110%) has to be added to obtain a low improvement in the worst case skitter and slew rate (≤13%).

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Government-led Vocational Training System and its Lessons: In case of South Korea before the IMF Economic Crisis", "Vocational training system for skilled workforce has been highlighted as one ofthe key driving forces of South Korea's economic development. South Korea is well known for adopting a government-led vocational training strategy to make sure the supply of a skilled workforce according to the 1st--7th five-year economic developmentplans. This paper examines the main features and developmental changes of this strategy from the 1960s to the 1990s and suggests a set of important lessons for the design and implementation of vocational training policies. Vocational training policy also was led by the government and complemented by private sector. By providing training program through the establishment of public training institutes, the government managed the supply of skills. While the government has consistently expanded and controlled the vocational training system for meeting the needs of industry, the principle system was the compulsory in-plant training system, in which itwas obligatory for large companies to provide training program for their workforce or alternatively contribute the training promotion fund. The initial stages of this system in the 1970s were considered as successful in terms of raising numbers of trainees withinindustry. However the numbers later fell dramatically in the 1980s after the government reformed its policy. Many employers resisted against the burden of training obligation and levy. Although there were still unsolved limitations of the government-led vocational training system, South Korean vocational training system before the 1997 IMF economic crisis has contributed systematically to the transformation of industry and to economic development." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays on Efficiency Measurement with Environmental Applications", "This study contributes to three branches of literature:  index number theory, the modeling of environmental production technologies, and index decomposition analysis.  The first part of the study begins by analyzing a previous adjustment made to a popular graph space index, which is used to compute input-output efficiency scores, and shows that this adjustment fails to correct two serious flaws it was intended to rectify - satisfaction of an indication and weak monotonicity condition.  The failure arises at the boundary of output space when zeros arise frequently in the data.  We propose an alternative formulation to correct for these deficiencies and implement the proposed modification in two different empirical applications.Next, we identify a conceptual flaw regarding tradeoffs between inputs, outputs, and pollutants when one production relation is used to model the joint production of pollution-generating technologies.  We propose a superior modeling tactic to correct for the tradeoff implications when using only one implicit production relation.  Using multiple production relations to capture intended and unintended production, and defining the reduced form technology as the intersection between these two production sets, we introduce the \"by-production\" technology.  This novel formulation has direct implications on DEA estimation, which we derive and utilize in an application of efficiency measurement. Moreover, we show that constructing efficiency scores for \"by-production\" technologies isn't straight forward.  We distinguish between efficiency in intended and unintended production, show that some traditional indexes are not appropriate for applications involving \"by-production\" technologies, and propose a modification of a previous index that has superior properties and decomposes into productive and environmental efficiency.Lastly, this study applies the by-production modeling tactic developed earlier to reconsider index decomposition results previously derived under different assumptions regarding the nature of pollution-generating technologies.  The application examines factors related to variations in electric power plant emissions through an index decomposition analysis and shows, in general, that previous results derived using the more primitive technological assumption of weak disposability and null-jointness are incongruent with the results derived under by-production.  We conclude the final portion of the study by analyzing energy firm responses to the 1990 Amendment to the Clean Air Act Amendment." ],

They have been used for countless reasons throughout history, including nonessential purposes such as dyes for textiles and paints. Less trivial uses, such as those related to health better demonstrate the importance of natural products. Toxic natural products had been used to bolster hunting efficiency and insect pheromones. Therapeutic natural products have long been used as dietary supplements and medicines. The ubiquitous nature of natural products and their derivatives in current medicinal validates continued investigations in all areas of natural product research. Our laboratory has a longstanding tradition in the synthesis and evaluation of biologically interesting natural products. We have viewed natural product synthesis as a tool to expand our understanding of organic chemistry. Of particular are natural products with novel architectures. The synthetic study of these natural products often inspires creativity to solve complicated synthetic challenges, and leads to the development of new methodologies. Novel structural characteristics and attractive bioactivities of two natural product families, zoanthamine alkaloids and Illicium sesquiterpenes, caught our interest for the stated reasons. Research herein describes work directed towards synthesis of the ABC ring system of norzoanthamine, total syntheses of Illicium sesquiterpenes jiadifenolide and jiadifenin. Chapters 1 and 2 narrate the background and research related to the norzoanthamine ABC ring motif. Chapters 3 and 4 report the total syntheses of jiadifenolide and jiadifenin, and their biological studies related to their neurotrophic activity" ],

  "texts" : [ "Successes and challenges of instructional strategies in two-way bilingual immersion", "Growing numbers of English Learners (ELs) in public education are placed in a variety of second language programs across the nation. Policymakers, educators, and parents are indecisive on which programs are most beneficial for the linguistic and cultural needs of ELs. Empirical studies on two-way bilingual immersion (TWBI) programs seem to provide promising data for ELs receiving content instruction in their primary language while acquiring second language acquisition skills in classrooms where students are integrated with native English speakers. The goals of TWBI programs are for all students to become bilingual, biliterate, and bicultural. This study examined the instructional strategies teachers used to develop biliteracy and cross-cultural competence in TWBI. A single case study approach allowed the researcher to gain insights about the implementation of strategies in two TWBI programs in Southern California. The methods included multiple measures to collect and analyze the data through photo-elicitation journals, appreciative inquiry interviews, lesson observations, teacher reflections, and questionnaires. The sample population for this case study included nine bilingual teachers in TWBI programs with 90/ 10 model designs in grades first through sixth. First, the research synthesized how the teachers gained their knowledge-base and professional support to implement their strategies. Second, the findings discussed how the framework for the Guiding Principles for Dual Language Education assisted teachers in the implementation of their instructional strategies. Third, the data analysis described the successes and challenges in the teachers' instructional strategies to develop biliteracy and cross- cultural competence with ELs and English Proficient students in their classrooms. Lastly, the study discussed how the teachers gained new insights about their practices based on their successes and challenges in their strategies. Results of the study demonstrated that teachers were very experienced and knowledgeable in TWBI practices and supported each other through planning and lesson development. Teachers implemented strategies aligned to the four main guiding principles of instruction : research-based practices, instructional strategies, student-centered instruction, and multicultural/ multilingual learning environments. Convergence of multiple measures indicated that teachers experienced successes and challenges in their instructional strategies for biliteracy and cross-cultural competence, but established new perspectives and innovations to advance their practice" ],

However, studies assessing pre-travel health-seeking practices from a variety of medical and non-medical sources and vaccine uptake prior to travel to both developing and developed countries within the Asia-Pacific region are scarce.</p> <p><b>Methods</b></p> <p>Cross-sectional surveys were conducted between July and December 2007 to assess pre-travel health seeking practices, including advice from health professionals, health information from other sources and vaccine uptake, in a sample of travelers departing Sydney and Bangkok airports. A two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to ensure representativeness of travelers and travel destinations. Pre-travel health seeking practices were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire distributed at the check-in queues of departing flights. Logistic regression models were used to identify significant factors associated with seeking pre-travel health advice from a health professional, reported separately for Australian residents, residents of other Western countries and residents of countries in Asia.</p> <p><b>Results</b></p> <p>A total of 843 surveys were included in the final sample (Sydney 729, response rate 56%; Bangkok 114, response rate 60%). Overall, pre-travel health information from any source was sought by 415 (49%) respondents with 298 (35%) seeking pre-travel advice from a health professional, the majority through general practice. Receipt of a pre-travel vaccine was reported by 100 (12%) respondents. Significant factors associated with seeking pre-travel health advice from a health professional differed by region of residence. Asian travelers were less likely to report seeking pre-travel health advice and uptake of pre-travel vaccines than Australian or other Western travelers. Migrant Australians were less likely to report seeking pre-travel health advice than Australian-born travelers.</p> <p><b>Conclusions</b></p> <p>This study highlights differences in health-seeking practices including the uptake of pre-travel health advice by region of residence and country of birth. There is a public health need to identify strategies targeting these travel groups. This includes the promotion of affordable and accessible travel clinics in low resource countries as traveler numbers increase and travel health promotion targeting migrant groups in high resource countries. General practitioners should play a central role. Determining the most appropriate strategies for increasing pre-travel health preparation, particularly for vaccine preventable diseases in travelers is the next stage in advancing travel medicine research.</p" ],

  "texts" : [ "Analysis of microelectronic power distribution networks and exploration of 3D ICs", "As the semiconductor process nodes advance to 28nm and below and three-dimensional (3D) silicon integration technology is emerging, power delivery is becoming an ever -greater challenge in VLSI design. Detailed analyses of power distribution networks (PDN) must be performed in order to ensure robust power delivery. Different aspects of analysis problems with current and future VLSI designs and 3D ICs are addressed in this dissertation. We review the traditional frequency-domain PDN analysis methodology and investigate the relationship between the frequency- domain PDN impedance and time-domain PDN noise. We demonstrate that the traditional frequency-domain analysis methodology has limitations. Due to the limitation of frequency-domain analysis methodology, we point out the importance of time-domain analysis which lead to our research work worst-case PDN noise prediction. We also propose a simulation flow for large-scale PDN using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). This flow utilizes the characterizations of PDNs and adaptively choose the simulation points based on different frequency ranges of PDNs. With such an adaptive sampling technique, we are able to simulate large-scale PDN models and achieve fairly results in a reasonable simulation time. Our simulation flow also naturally fits into parallel computation techniques, which further enhances the simulation efficiency. Finally, with our analysis and simulation tools, we explore the PDN characteristics of 3D ICs. We propose lumped and distributed models for 3D PDNs, and analyze 3D PDNs systematically in both frequency domain and time domain. Unique noise behaviors of 3D PDNs are discovered with our modeling analysis flow. Different design space of 3D PDNs are also studied and design guidelines based on the studies are provided" ],

The head was rotatable such that data longitudinal and transverse to the major muscle fiber direction could be obtained. EIM measurements were made with this device on 16 healthy mice and 14 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) animals. Repeatability was assessed in both groups.\nResults:\nThe technique was easy to perform and provided good repeatability in both healthy and ALS animals, with intra-session repeatability (mean ± SEM) of 5% ±1% and 12% ±2%, respectively. Significant differences between healthy and ALS animals were also identified (e.g., longitudinal mean 50 kHz phase was 18±0.6° for the healthy animals and 14±1.0° for the ALS animals, p = 0.0025).\nConclusions:\nWith this simple device, the EIM data obtained is highly repeatable and can differentiate healthy from ALS animals.\nSignificance:\nEIM can now be applied to mouse models of neuromuscular disease to assess disease status and the effects of therapy." ],

P53-dependent apoptosis of hair-matrix keratinocytes and chemotherapy-induced hair-cycle abnormalities, driven by the dystrophic anagen or dystrophic catagen pathway, play important parts in the degree of hair-follicle damage, alopecia phenotype, and hair-regrowth pattern. Additionally, the degree of hair-follicle stem-cell damage determines whether chemotherapy-induced alopecia is reversible. We highlight the need for carefully designed preclinical research models to generate novel, clinically relevant pointers to how this condition may be overcome." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Understanding the Demand for Travel: It's Not Purely 'Derived'", "We contest the derived demand paradigm for travel as a behavioral absolute. To the contrary, we suggest that travel has an intrinsic positive utility and is valued for its own sake, not just as a means of reaching a destination. We argue that the same positive characteristics that lead people to engage in travel as a recreational activity in itself are likely to motivate them to engage in apparently excess travel in the context of their mandatory and maintenance activities as well. This paper explores the conceptual basis of a positive utility for travel, and presents some results from an ongoing empirical study of attitudes toward travel. In modelling distance traveled (in each of 11 categories), we found that subjective variables such as Travel Liking, the adventure-seeker Personality trait, the travel stress Attitudinal factor, and the Excess Travel indicator added considerable explanatory power to the Demographic variables traditionally used in such models. It appears that, far from being completely determined by demographically based needs, the amount of travel demanded is heavily influenced by one's attitudes toward travel. This is not only true for discretionary (entertainment) purposes, as would be expected, but for more \"mandatory\" purposes such as work/school-related activities as well. We are convinced that the demand for travel arises from a fundamental human need for mobility and other subjective characteristics, as well as from the external causes typically measured. To more accurately forecast travel demand and policy response, the role of those subjective characteristics needs to be understood much better than it is at present." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "School staff perceptions of well-being and experience of an intervention to promote mental well-being", "AbstractEducational Psychologists (EPs) spend much of their time working with school staff to solve problems. Staff often report perceptions of high levels of stress, overwork and lack of time to plan and implement changes indicating frequent experience of poor mental well-being. There has been a recent increase in awareness of promoting the well-being of children and young people, however, little attention appears to have been focused as yet upon the school staff who will promote and support this agenda.Research in schools has tended to focus on teachers rather than including all staff. There is a preponderance of research clarifying contributors to teachers’ stress and, to a lesser extent describing interventions in schools. However, little research has focused on school staff understanding and value of well-being and about perceptions of interventions carried out in schools. This study aimed to obtain a greater understanding of the perceptions of school staff about well-being, the value they placed upon it and the experience and perceived impact of taking part in a study aiming to promote staff well-being. An 8 week intervention was carried out in a primary school with weekly sessions of a project which was known as ‘Chill and Chat’. Data was gathered via questionnaires completed before and after the project and 3 focus groups held before, during and after the project. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.It was found that well-being was seen as important, however, colleagues with poor mental well-being were ‘pathologised’. ‘Learning’ to cope and maintain positive well-being was perceived as a responsibility of the staff member. Staff perceived the informality of provision to support their well-being as important and valued the time to develop better relationships with colleagues rather than ‘working relationships’ and also feeling valued and cared for. Staff reported perceptions of greater efficacy in the classroom, increased job satisfaction and feeling calmer in the classroom. The most significant limitation of the study was the continuation of provision to support staff mental well-being which requires commitment and understanding from school senior management teams and local authority members regarding the impact that increased well being can have on teaching and learning and a shift of thought towards focusing on positive well-being promotion rather than managing poor well-being.There are implications for EP practice and research in helping school staff reflect on their well-being and actions that they can take as a team to promote well-being in school. EPs can also be instrumental in disseminating research findings highlighting the impact of staff mental well being on teaching and learning." ],

  "texts" : [ "The Multi-dimensional Nature of Religiosity/Spirituality and its Association with Psychological Adjustment", "The present study examined the dimensional structure of religiosity/spirituality (R/S) and its relationship with positive psychological adjustment (defined here as a latent variable indicated by lower levels of depression and perceived stress and higher levels of positive affect) within a Christian context.  Two separate samples (total N = 806) were recruited online via Amazon MechTurk and consisted of Christian American adults (age > 18).  R/S was measured using the MCRSI, a 29-item inventory designed to measure multiple conceptual dimensions of R/S (e.g., intrinsic religiosity, forgiveness, health related beliefs, etc.) in a Christian population.  An exploratory factor analysis revealed that Christian R/S, as measured using the MCRSI, is a construct with 2 empirically distinct, yet correlated, dimensions which were conceptually defined as spiritual attitudes/beliefs and religious behaviors.  SEM analyses revealed that Christian R/S was significantly associated with positive psychological adjustment after controlling for age and SES, explaining 7% of the variance in psychological adjustment.  This relationship was fully mediated by positive relationships with others and purpose in life.  Religious social support and religious coping did not significantly mediate the relationship.  The relationship was not moderated by gender, ethnicity (Caucasian vs. African-American), peer group salience of Christian R/S, or chronic stress.  The entire model (including proposed mediators) explained 59% of the variance in psychological adjustment.  Of the two dimensions of R/S, spiritual attitudes/beliefs emerged as a stronger predictor of psychological adjustment than religious behaviors, but religious behaviors had a modest positive association with psychological adjustment through religious social support and a modest association with positive affect through religious coping, even after controlling for spiritual attitudes/beliefs.  Implications of these results are discussed." ],

We argue that this relationship is unsuitable as a supply curve for equilibrium analysis because hypercongestion occurs as a response to transient demand fluctuations.  We then present tractable models for handling such fluctuations, both for a uniform expressway and for a dense street network such as in a central business district (CBD).  For the CBD model, we consider both exogenous and endogenous time patterns for demand, and we make use of an empirical speed-density relationship for Dallas, Texas to characterize both congested and hypercongested conditions." ],

  "texts" : [ "Time Courses of Desensitization and Recovery From Adaptation in Mouse Rod Photoreceptors", "Sensitivity and dynamic range are two important characteristics of sensory receptors in the nervous system that define the physiological role of these cells. Rod cells in the retina of a mouse have the ability to detect very dim lights by closing cyclic-gated nucleotide channels. This extreme sensitivity would be impractical if the dynamic range on these cells was limited. Adaptation is a process by which the sensitivity of the transduction cascade is adjusted so cells can function within broader ranges of stimuli. Electrical recordings of circulating currents have been used to show that in the presence of steady background light, rods are desensitized so that saturation doesn't occur, and they remain responsive to increments and decrements of illumination. Furthermore, changes in calcium concentration have been proposed to mediate modulations of various molecules within the transduction pathways. In this project, we investigated the time course of desensitization and recovery in adaptation using suction electrode recording. We were able to show, desensitization at various ranges of adapting light, as manifested by the fact that reduction in sensitivity acceleration of recovery is already present at 500 ms. We also demonstrated that in recovery from adaptation, sensitivity of the rod returns back to its dark-adapted levels within 2 seconds. The persistence of adaptation in the form of acceleration of recovery was present with extremely dim lights and the time constant of its recovery to dark-adapted levels was dependent on the intensity of the background light." ],

The paper finds that small businesses, which comprise the majority of the businesses in the United States, and are among the heaviest users of foreign labor, consider the 2006 H-2C program to be unaffordable. Policy makers must redesign H- 2C to be affordable for small businesses while still offering an effective system for protecting domestic worker interests. The paper concludes that the best means to achieve both program affordability for small businesses and effectual domestic worker protections is likely a user -friendly, electronic program process" ],

An empirical study was carried out using a sample drawn from the automotive industry in Thailand and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the theoretical model. The findings indicated that a lean supply chain strategy has a positive relationship with supplier integration and that supplier integration can improve the firm’s competitive capabilities. In particular, supplier integration was observed to have the most impact on the competitive capability of process flexibility and, overall, the improvement of competitive capabilities appeared to vary according to the degree of supplier integration present in the relationship." ],

  "texts" : [ "Persistence of Latino students in community colleges : an empowerment model addressing acculturative stress", "College student persistence has been a concern of researchers and practitioners since the early 1960s. Traditional models have addressed the need for students to be integrated into the academic and social domains of the college campus. Recently, critical theorists and researchers have been questioning the relevance of the traditional models for students of color. The development of student empowerment through the establishment of student-initiated retention projects and the support of institutional agents has been proposed as a more meaningful goal to increase the persistence of students of color. Ethnic student organizations have also been shown to be important in giving students of color a sense of belonging. While acculturative stress has been shown to be a factor in the well-being of Latino students, it has not been considered as a contributor to persistence decisions. This study used mixed methods to collect data from surveys and interviews of Latino community college students. Analysis of this data showed that persistence is negatively correlated to acculturative stress. Additionally, certain acculturation strategies play a role in the persistence decisions of students. Both traditional and emerging models of persistence are compared in order to propose a new model which includes consideration of acculturative stress and student empowerment" ],

  "title" : "Columnar Liquid Crystalline Semiconductors",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Columnar Liquid Crystalline Semiconductors", "This is an exciting stage in the development of organic electronics. No longer is it an area of purely ‘academic interest’ but increasingly real applications are being developed and some of these are beginning to come on-stream. There have been several drivers for the surge of interest shown by the electronics industry. Perhaps the greatest is the promise afforded by organic systems for low-cost processing, e.g., methods of fabrication such as roll-to-roll contact printing or ink-jet printing in which the components are ‘assembled’ on low-cost substrates at room temperature. The long-term vision is for the creation of integrated devices in which, for example, a photovoltaic cell, a sensor and a display, all made of organic materials, is printed onto a plastic film in a single operation. Another factor in the recent development of organic electronics is the huge advances made in organic synthesis over the last half century, which make it easy to fine-tune the properties of organics at a molecular level in a way that is simply not possible for their metallic and semi-metallic counterparts. Finally, organics are much easier to interface with biomaterials, which is perhaps the key problem in the development of new generation biosensors. Another consideration in the development of organic electronics has been ‘Green Issues’: not only the need to develop energy-efficient methods of manufacture but also the need to develop methods based on renewable (organic) rather than finite (inorganic and metallic) components.Although it seems improbable that organics will ever compete with silicon-based devices in terms of high-end computing applications, where device speed is of the essence, there are many low-end areas of application, where we can look to see traditional inorganic components increasingly replaced by organics. Areas that have already been commercially developed or which are under intensive development include organic light emitting diodes (for flat panel displays and solid state lighting), organic photovoltaic cells, organic thin film transistors (for smart tags and flat panel displays) and sensors. Potentially this is a field that will affect every aspect of our lives and have an impact in every home and in every business.Within the family of organic electronic materials, liquid crystals are relative newcomers. The first electronically conducting liquid crystals were only reported in 1988, but already a substantial literature has developed. The potential advantage of liquid crystalline semiconductors is that they have the easy processabilty of amorphous and polymeric semiconductors, but they usually have higher charge carrier mobilities. Their mobilities do not reach the levels seen in crystalline organics, but they circumvent all of the difficult issues of controlling crystal growth and morphology. Liquid crystals self-organise, they can be aligned by fields and surface forces and, because of their fluid nature, defects in liquid crystal structures readily self-heal.Because this is a relatively young field, there are still issues which need to be understood. In particular, the theory of electronic conduction in liquid crystals is much less well developed than that of electronic conduction in other organic mate- rials and, although the relationship between molecular structure and conductivity is mostly understood, some issues still remain to be resolved and understood.With these matters in mind, this is an opportune moment to bring together a monograph on the subject of ‘Liquid Crystalline Semiconductors’. The field is already too large to cover in a comprehensive manner, so our aim has been to bring together contributions from leading workers, which cover the main areas of the chemistry (synthesis and structure/function relationships), physics and potential applications. A general introduction to liquid crystals and the nature and kinds of their mesomorphic behaviour and structure (mesophases) is given in Chap. 1. A description of the nature and mechanisms of different kinds of charge transport in calamitic (nematic and smectic) liquid crystalline semiconductors is given in Chap. 2 followed by a similar treatment of columnar (discotic) liquid crystalline semiconductors in Chap. 3. The different approaches and methods of determining charge transport in liquid crystals are also described in detail. Chap. 4 provides a comprehensive description of the synthesis of a wide range of columnar liquid crystalline semiconductors. A series of reaction schemes are used to illustrate different synthetic strategies and approaches to the synthesis of this special type of liquid crystal. Chapter 5 gives an extensive discussion of the nature and magnitude of charge transport in reactive mesogens (monomers) and how they are determined. A similar treatment of the corresponding liquid crystal polymer networks is also given in this chapter. An insight into the nature and complexity of the optical properties of liquid crystals is provided in Chap. 6. Chapters 7, 8 and 9 describe the modes of operation, configuration and performance of a range of electrooptic devices, i.e., organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), especially with polarised emission, organic photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors, incorporating the types of liquid crystalline semiconductors described in the preceding chapters. Our hope is that this book will provide a useful introduction to the field both for those in industry and for those in academia and that it will help to stimulate future developments." ],

  "texts" : [ "A GPS-based Analysis of Household Travel Behavior", "While characteristics of daily travel behavior have been determined from analyses of the reconstructed household travel behavior recorded in travel diaries, such reconstructions are subject to criticisms that people lie or falsely recall information about destinations, times of travel, trip purposes, trip destination, and other critical characteristics, such as under-reporting of short trips and the number of stops in a trip chain. In 1997 the Department of Transportation carried out a one week study in Lexington, Kentucky in which the cars of 100 households were equipped with GPS and in-car computers. Every stop was logged by the GPS receiver and the purpose of the trip was recorded at that time on an in-car computer. The final report of the study gave descriptions of travel behavior but performed little analysis on the data so collected. Using a CD-ROM data record of all transactions provided by DOT, we propose to examine questions such as: To what extent were the travel behaviors recorded on each day highly correlated? Are there recurring cyclic patterns that show similar patterns of repetitive behavior on different days of the week? How well can a model calibrated for activity behavior on one day predict behavior on other dates? How well does this data support panel and/or diary studies? To what extent to discrete choice models of travel behavior fit the data for different days with approximately the same parameters? To what extent did travelers use optimal travel routes (e.g. shortest path?)? What proportion of different trip purposes were undertaken entirely on suburban streets and what proportion relied on different quantities of freeway travel?\n      Knowing the answers to these questions provides the final pieces to the puzzle of repetitiveness in household travel behavior. It is of considerable importance to the calibration of predictive models of behavior and to successfully implementing Advanced Transportation Management and Information Systems (ATMIS)." ],

  "texts" : [ "Reconstructed grounded theory: beyond comparison?", "This paper examines the modifications made to constructed grounded theory for application within an ethnographic study of group work processes in a virtual learning environment. The paper details how the complex professional relationship of educational practitioner research, and the associated ethical issues, together with the variety of data analysed influenced the approach taken. The paper explores how the adaptations to constructed grounded theory process were applied and how this approach can be construed as grounded in grounded theory. <p></p> \r\n\r\nThe paper is explicit about the application and adaptation of grounded theory to meet the needs of the research and the epistemology of the researcher.  Many studies purporting to use grounded theory are less explicit, this paper is intended to contribute to the discussion and development of a flexible approach to grounded theory, fit for purpose within the restraints of a practitioner based virtual educational ethnographic study.<p></p>  \r\n\r\nThe relationship of the practitioner researcher (an Associate Lecturer) and the participants (the students) created a dichotomy between the neutrality and social distance of the researcher and the ethical implications for the Associate Lecturer.  Whilst the participants were not vulnerable adults, many of the participants were novice learners returning to study and therefore a duty of care was required. The paper explains how the adaptation of constructed grounded theory enhanced the analysis and provided richer data than ethnographic observation alone.<p></p>\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from constructed grounded theory methods, rigor was achieved through the comparison of the coding produced throughout the analysis of the data.  This level of rigor led to the emergence of unanticipated themes which influenced the group work processes.  It is my belief that these would not have appeared through generic inductive approaches as they would have been overlooked and ignored without the line by line analysis.  The modification of the grounded theory process retained the influence of constructed grounded theory rather than claiming to be rooted in constructed grounded theory. But the techniques applied are not beyond comparison with grounded theory.  The research into virtual group work is timely in light of recent UK Government reports and relevant as interest in network delivered learning continues to grow." ],

  "texts" : [ "Understanding the Warburg effect and the prognostic value of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of a lethal tumor microenvironment.", "Cancer cells show a broad spectrum of bioenergetic states, with some cells using aerobic glycolysis while others rely on oxidative phosphorylation as their main source of energy. In addition, there is mounting evidence that metabolic coupling occurs in aggressive tumors, between epithelial cancer cells and the stromal compartment, and between well-oxygenated and hypoxic compartments. We recently showed that oxidative stress in the tumor stroma, due to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, is important for cancer cell mutagenesis and tumor progression. More specifically , increased autophagy/mitophagy in the tumor stroma drives a form of parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling. These findings explain why it is effective to treat tumors with either inducers or inhibitors of autophagy, as both would disrupt this energetic coupling. We also discuss evidence that glutamine addiction in cancer cells produces ammonia via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Ammonia production in cancer cells, in turn, could then help maintain autophagy in the tumor stromal compartment. In this vicious cycle, the initial glutamine provided to cancer cells would be produced by autophagy in the tumor stroma. Thus, we believe that parasitic epithelial-stromal metabolic coupling has important implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy, for example, in designing novel metabolic imaging techniques and establishing new targeted therapies. In direct support of this notion, we identified a loss of stromal caveolin-1 as a marker of oxidative stress, hypoxia, and autophagy in the tumor microenvironment, explaining its powerful predictive value. Loss of stromal caveolin-1 in breast cancers is associated with early tumor recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, leading to poor clinical outcome." ],

Here, we present computational classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the behavior of U(VI) in contact with different calcite surfaces. The calcium-uranyl-carbonate [Ca2UO2(CO3)(3)] species is shown to display both inner and outer-sphere adsorption to the flat {10 (1) over bar4} and the stepped {31 (4) over bar8} and {3 (12) over bar 16} planes of calcite. Free energy calculations, using the umbrella sampling method, are employed to simulate adsorption paths of the same uranyl species on the different calcite surfaces under aqueous condition. Outer-sphere adsorption is found to dominate over inner-sphere adsorption because of the high free energy barrier of removing a uranyl-carbonate interaction and replacing it with a new uranyl-surface interaction. An important bin monolayer between the surface and the sorbed complex. From the free complex was also found to adsorb preferentially on the acute-stepped ding mode is proposed involving a single vicinal water energy profiles of the different Calcite surfaces, the uranyl {31 (4) over bar8} face of calcite, in agreement with experiment." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Road Less Traveled: Land Use and Non-Work Travel Relationships in Portland, Oregon", "New Urbanism seeks to exploit a relationship between urban form and travel behavior in order to develop communities which are simultaneously more egalitarian, more pleasant, and less costly to society as a whole. The focus of New Urbanist design practices is to create environments (both urban and suburban) which promote walking and transit over private automobile use as a mode of travel. Specifically, New Urbanists contend higher residential density, closer residential proximity to employment and shopping, grid street patterns and greater access to transit will lead to reductions in automobile travel. This dissertation tests those assertions and discusses the resulting policy implications. The work presented here concentrates on transportation mode choice for non-work travel, defined here as all travel not related to employment or employment related activities. Non-work travel is of particular interest because it comprises a majority of activities involving travel, yet modeling strategies for various policy goals (e.g., clean air, traffic congestion, transit development) ignore non-work travel, in favor of analyzing employment related commute behavior.\n      The working hypothesis is that land use patterns consistent with New Urbanist principles can alter a person’s willingness to substitute other travel modes (i.e., walking and/or transit) for automobile use by way of changing the amount of time needed to complete trips by these other modes. This willingness to substitute then impacts the number of trips by each mode of travel observed for individuals. The results described here suggest New Urbanist land use practices can work as their proponents suggest, even when one accounts for the interference of people self-selecting into residential environments which promote one form of travel over others. These findings are tempered by further analysis suggesting New Urbanist designs must have their various elements properly balanced, or none of the proposed benefits will come to pass. Also, it appears that in the context of analyzing distances traveled and number of trips made, New Urbanist practices simply provide a premium on travel that can be completed close to the home. The impact of these findings on theories and policies tied to travel behavior are discussed in the concluding section." ],

  "title" : "The Causal Relationship between the Built Environment and Personal Travel Choice: Evidence from Northern California",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Causal Relationship between the Built Environment and Personal Travel Choice: Evidence from Northern California", "Suburban sprawl has been widely criticized for its contribution to auto dependence. Numerous studies have found that suburban residents drive more and walk less than residents in traditional neighborhoods. Accordingly, smart growth programs have been advocated as a means to reduce auto travel. However, most studies have established only an association between the built environment and travel behavior, but not a causal relationship. Their connection may be more a matter of residential choice than of travel choice. For example, residents preferring walking may selectively live in walkable neighborhoods and thus walk more. If so, the effects of land use policies may be overstated. Using data collected from 1682 respondents living in four traditional and four suburban neighborhoods in Northern California in 2003, this dissertation explored this causal link by employing a quasi-longitudinal research design and controlling for residential self-selection (namely, residential preferences and travel attitudes). Specifically, we investigated the influence of the built environment on various measurements of personal travel choices including uses of different modes (driving, transit, walking, and biking), trip frequencies for different purposes (overall travel, nonwork travel, shopping travel, and strolling), auto ownership, and vehicle type choice. The results showed that residential preferences and travel attitudes have pervasive influences on all measurements of travel choices. The results also provide some encouragement that land-use policies designed to put residents closer to destinations and provide them with alternative transportation options will actually lead to less driving and more walking. Taking the evidence from all our analyses together, however, neighborhood design appears to have a stronger influence on walking than on driving. In other words, the residential environment promoted by smart growth programs may be an effective strategy to encourage walking but have less effect on driving, especially after attitudinal predispositions are accounted for. Given that walking is an inadequate substitute for driving, the smart growth movement seems to be more of a solution to public health problems than to transportation problems. Even so, it will give residents a choice to drive less and walk more and this choice is highly valued by a large proportion of respondents in our data as well as in other studies." ],

  "title" : "Multinationals and Institutions: An Agency-oriented, Integrated Perspective",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Multinationals and Institutions: An Agency-oriented, Integrated Perspective", "Recent years have seen several major contributions that apply insights from institutional theory to the study of multinational corporations (MNCs), in particular through the distinction between home- and host-country effects. However,  MNCs continue to pose a challenge to institutional analysis. This paper aims to confront these challenges by developing an alternative perspective that acknowledges institutional agency. It poses a duality between structure and agency in accordance with Gidden's structuration theory and argues that institutional contradictions within and between organizational fields, together with the interpretative ambiguity of institutions, allow for institutional 'play'. What results is a double fragmentation, both among and within organizational fields and between agents, which makes that institutions do not only constrain but also enable. Existing institutions often provide the necessary building blocks for institutional innovation as agents have the creative freedom to recombine existing practices through bricolage. Institutions are therefore both 'medium' and 'outcome'. For such a perspective, the MNC, with is multiple and fragmented environment, does no longer pose a fundamental challenge but is within the reach of institutional analysis. To theorize the implications for MNCs we can draw on alternative perspectives that stress strategic and political behaviour. They discuss how subsidiaries are relatively autonomous and highlight the importance of power relations within MNCs. It can therefore be no surprise that the integration of these alternative approaches with the institutional perspective answers to a widely expressed ambition within the MNC literature. Moreover, it does not merely bring theoretical overview but can contribute to our understanding. It can be argued that both 'institutional' and 'political' approaches would benefit. Most obvious is how political awareness adds to the agency understanding of institutional theory. But institutional awareness can also provide an important input to political approaches. First of all, it illustrates how agency is constrained. Moreover, institutions can be a resource that specific parties within the MNC can draw upon. This holds in particular for subsidiary managers that may strengthen their organizational influence by stressing the need to align with host environments. To argue the possible contribution of this integrated framework, the paper presents several concepts from the literature that illustrate the character of institutional processes presented here, such as 'Anglo-Saxonization', 'transactional social space' and the 'liability of foreignness'.  The paper concludes by raising two important questions for future research about the relevance of institutional arguments in the analysis of MNCs and the challenges of empirical research." ],

Relationships between obesity and pain were examined by calculating odds ratios stratified by gender and adjusted for socioeconomic status as reflected by level of maternal education.

Obesity was associated with increased odds of any pain (odds ratio [OR] 1.33, P=.04), CRP (OR 2.04, P=.005), and knee pain (OR 1.87, P=.001), but not CWP (OR 1.10, P=.5). Compared with non obese participants, those with any pain, knee pain, and CRP reported more severe average pain (P<.01).

Combining erlotinib and pertuzumab may enhance antitumor activity. This study aimed to establish the recommended dosing of the erlotinib and pertuzumab combination; assess safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics; and analyze biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer who failed chemotherapy were recruited. The patients received erlotinib (days -8 to -1), then combination therapy (21-day cycles for 6 cycles). Pertuzumab was given intravenous at 840 mg, then 420 mg once every three weeks, with erlotinib given daily (100 or 150 mg). RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Adverse events were generally grade 1/2 and manageable. The objective response rate was 20% (3/15 patients; 2 responders had mutant HER1, 1 responder had wild-type HER1), median overall progression-free survival was 9.3 weeks. High HER1, HER2, and HER3 messenger RNA expression correlated with increased progression-free survival. Combination therapy did not affect erlotinib's pharmacokinetics; however, pertuzumab mean exposures (maximum concentration, 231 mg/L; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 21 days, 1780 mg*d/L) were slightly higher than in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy was well tolerated in patients with good performance status, with encouraging efficacy. A loading dose of pertuzumab 840 mg followed by 420 mg once every three weeks plus daily erlotinib 150 mg appears to be the most appropriate regimen for this combination." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Religion and Health: An Examination of the Effect of Religiosity on Health", "IntroductionOne of the issues in the field of sociology that has attracted the attention of many social scientists is the important role of social determinants in human health. In spite of the significant progress of medical sciences in identification of pathogeneses and treatment methods, sociologists are interested in the study of health and illness and identification of the effective factors. The results of sociological studies indicate that health is multi-faceted, and may be affected by cultural, economic and social factors in addition to biological factors. Most of medical sociologists believe that social factors play an important role in human health; biological and medical explanations, which ignore the significant role of social and cultural factors on health and illness patterns, are insufficient. This has led sociologists to study the social and cultural determinants of health. This research aims to investigate the effect of some social and cultural determinants such as religiosity, healthy lifestyle and level of social support on health among university students. The present study examines the direct and indirect effect of religiosity on health. As a variable, health has been investigated in three physical, mental and social dimensions. The indirect effect of religiosity on health has been studied through social support and healthy lifestyle. In order to study the relationship between religiosity and health, theories of Emile Durkheim, Kingsley Davis, Milton Yinger, Thomas O'Dea’s functionalism theory, and Max Weber and Peter Berger’s meaning theories have been utilized. Each of these approaches has implications for the relationship between religiosity and health. According to the functionalists, religion unifies society and preserves social integration. Also, religion provides a background for integration and categorizes people according to special ideology in peer social groups. This categorization could be a factor for promotion of intergroup integration against outer groups that follow different opinions and ideas. On the other hand, in relation to the research question, Berger and Weber's approach also seems important. According to these theorists religion, in addition to other functions, provides a meaningful and purposeful life in a world that is constantly meaningless. According to Weber, regardless of level of rationality in the society, individuals have a psychological need to find the world meaningful and purposeful. As a result of his view, religion is not functionless in the modern era. So from Weber’s point of view, it can be inferred that even in new forms of society religiosity can have a positive effect on health. Therefore, religious people that are more likely to control their carnal desires show less risky behavior and as a result, they may have a healthier life. In general, implication of functionalists and meaning theorists can be shown in a causal model as a theoretical model of this study as follow: Figure 1- Conceptual Model of the Study Based on the proposed model and the review of literature, the following hypotheses can be reasonably inferred from:1. Religiosity has a positive effect on healthy lifestyle.2. Religiosity has a positive effect on social support.3. Social support has a positive effect on healthy lifestyle.4. Healthy lifestyle has a positive effect on health.5. Social support has a positive effect on health.6. Religiosity has a positive effect on health.Materials and MethodsIn this research, a survey method was used to investigate the relationship between variables. It was performed based on a sample of 350 students of the University of Tabriz. Participants filled out a questionnaire containing mental, physical and social health measures (i.e., HS-36). Also, it contained measures for healthy lifestyles and social support as intervening variables and for religiosity as an independent variable. The measures enjoyed a high level of reliability and validity.FindingsFindings reveal that religiosity, healthy lifestyle, and social support have significant positive correlations with physical, mental, and social health and consequently with the general measure of health. In addition, the results of multivariate regression analysis reveal that these independent variables explain 36.8% of variance of general measure of health. However, the explained variance of mental health and social health (respectively, 31.2% and 32.6%) are almost twice as that of the physical health. Furthermore, the results of path analysis indicate that religiosity significantly and positively has both direct and indirect effects on general and mental health. Religiosity has also a significant indirect effect through social support and healthy lifestyle on physical and social health but it has no direct effect on these two dimensions of health. In general, the findings support the implications of functionalist theories on the positive effect of religion on healthy lifestyle and health, particularly mental and social health.     Discussion of Results and ConclusionIn summary it can be said that the results of different statistical tests to examine the relationship between religiosity and health indicate that religiosity has a significant impact on promotion of health and its dimensions. According to the mentioned theoretical discussions concerning the relationship between religiosity and health, these results were expected. Indeed, the findings confirm these theories. According to these theories, the positive effect of religiosity on health and its dimensions can be explained through integration, ascetic and meaning functions of religion. A) Integration Function of ReligionAccording to the functionalists, religion unifies society, preserves social integration and motivates social unity. According to this approach, religious thoughts based on communicating and interacting with others extensively, make religious people incline to develop social relationships and social support. As a result, this leads to receiving lots of support from relatives and friends. On the other hand the extension of religion in society has caused religious people to join religious networks in addition to family, relatives, friends and occupational networks and hence have larger social networks than less religious people. Therefore, the expansion of social communications and joining diverse social networks provides a background for receiving social support for religious people. Accordingly, religion plays a positive role in promotion of social health by expanding religious people’s supportive networks.B) Meaning Function of ReligionAlthough Weber and Berger, like functionalists, emphasize on social functions of religion but they consider meaning function of religion. Based on this approach, by offering spiritual responses to human ultimate questions, making life purposeful, and coping with problems, religion acts as an obstacle to human meaningless crisis. As a result, the religious people that are less suffering from meaninglessness and aimlessness can better cope with difficulties and have mental peace and comfort. Therefore, the findings of the present study confirms the mentioned theories concerning to the positive effect of religiosity on mental health.C) Ascetic Function of ReligionAnother implication of Weber and Berger’s theory regarding the relationship between religion and health is the positive effect of religiosity on physical health. These theorists’ approaches imply that religion is an important factor to control the instinctive desires. Participating in religious ceremonies causes religious people to control their carnal desires.So the findings of the present study based on a positive and significant relationship between religion and health confirm that ascetic content of religion about controlling carnal desires and avoiding illegal affairs causes religious people to control their instinctive desires and prevents them from high-risk behaviors and consequently is more physically health" ],

While most surveys on travel health knowledge, attitudes, and practices focus on malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases, noninfectious travel risks were included in this study.\r\nMETHODS: Pre- and post-travel perception of nine travel-associated health risks was recorded among 314 travelers to tropical and subtropical destinations. All travelers sought pre-travel health advice at the Travel Clinic of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in 2008 and 2009. In addition, 18 Swiss travel health experts provided an assessment of the respective risks. A validated visual psychometric measuring instrument was used [pictorial representation of illness and self measure (PRISM)].\r\nRESULTS: Travelers and experts rated most risks similarly, except for accidents and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which experts rated higher. Compared to other risks, accidents ranked highly in both groups and were the only risk perceived higher after travel. Pre- and post-travel perceptions of all other risks were similar with a tendency to be lower after travel. Travelers perceived mosquitoes to be the highest risk before travel and accidents after travel.\r\nCONCLUSION: Travelers' risk perception appears to be accurate for most risks stated in this study. However, travel health professionals should be aware that some perception patterns among travelers regarding travel-related health risks may be different from professional risk assessment. Important but insufficiently perceived health risks, such as sexual behavior/STIs and accidents, should be considered to be part of any pre-travel health advice package." ],

The family typically provides an initial religious identity and introduces children to religious beliefs, practices and a network of adherents. For both scholars and practitioners, the question of how religion does or does not come to be passed on in families is of crucial importance. In this study we use data from the 2001 International Congregational Life Survey to examine church attendance across three generations in England and Australia. In both England and Australia there is a strong tendency for couples to attend church together; they are making joint decisions and, when churchgoing is favored, encouraging each other in religious practice. The impact of two churchgoing parents on their children is considerably stronger than that of one alone. Our analysis shows that not only parental but also grandparental religious activity has a significant effect. While much of their influence simply results from the upbringing they gave their own children, a substantial proportion of it seems likely to be a direct, unmediated effect on grandchildren." ],

Using the\r\ngovernment’s own figures, it is possible to identify the scale of the austerity cuts, as\r\nfollows, but they should be compared to the overall reduction in government current\r\nspending of -4.3% over 2008-2013, the baseline.\r\nProgrammes for Travellers\r\nInteragency activities -100%\r\nTraveller education -86.6%\r\nTraveller accommodation -85%\r\nEquality -76.3%\r\nNational Traveller organisations -63.6%\r\nFAS Special Initiative for Travellers -50%\r\nNational Traveller Partnership -32.1%\r\nTraveller SPY youth projects -29.8%\r\nHealth1 -5.4%\r\nProgrammes and funding lines of importance to Travellers\r\nEquality and rights agencies -69%\r\nLocal & Community Development Programme -42.3%\r\nInitiatives against drugs -32.5%\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of these cuts was that statutory agencies did not even\r\nspend all their allocations, so the picture is even more difficult. This is a table of the\r\nproportions actually spent (and, conversely, the underspend):\r\nSpend Underspend\r\nHealth 82% 18%\r\nEquality 72% 28%\r\nAccommodation 64% 36%\r\nFAS Special Initiative for Travellers 60% 40%\r\nThe only exceptions to the pattern of cuts were the Traveller social economy\r\nprogramme and the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service,\r\nwhich show that it is possible to protect or even increase specific budget lines.These figures tell an egregious story of an extraordinary level of disinvestment by the\r\nIrish state in the Traveller community. One can think of no other section of the\r\ncommunity which has suffered such a high level of withdrawal of funding and human\r\nresources, compounded by the failure of the state to spend even the limited resources\r\nthat it has made available.\r\nThe reductions in accommodation and education are especially impactful, granted the\r\ncontinued hardship faced by many Travellers on sites and in poor quality private rented accommodation, and granted the still-wide gap in educational opportunities\r\nbetween the Traveller and the settled community. Worrying reports are already\r\ncoming through on the negative consequences for Travellers at school.\r\nIn looking to the future, the report lays out the challenges for community development\r\nfor the next years with Travellers.\r\nThese are:\r\nThe need to protect, preserve and extend the gains made by community\r\ndevelopment over the past thirty years, principally its model of development, the\r\ninfrastructure of Traveller organisations that has built up and the leadership that\r\nhas developed, training a new, younger generation that will enable the community\r\nto cope with the hardships inflicted by austerity, respond to them and emerge from\r\nthem;\r\nThe need to challenge and reverse the effects of the decisions taken, which have\r\ndisproportionately affected the Traveller community, challenging those areas from\r\nwhere the state has retreated, such as anti – racism and inter - culturalism and the\r\nprevention of discrimination. The state continues to take decisions without\r\nconsulting Travelling people, with Travellers unrepresented on high-level groups\r\nat national level and local level, contrary to European principles.\r\nThe importance of making the strategies and the structures developed over the past\r\ndecades work effectively, especially in such areas as health, accommodation,\r\neducation, the labour market and enterprise;\r\nThe need to address key political issues, notably recognition of the Traveller\r\ncommunity as a minority ethnic group; amendment of the equal status legislation\r\nso as to make it a truly effective instrument against discrimination;\r\ninterculturalism, especially in schools which are slow to address issues of culture\r\nand discrimination despite examples of some good initiatives; and the alignment\r\nprocess, which must preserve the independence of community development\r\nprojects working with Travellers." ],

  "title" : "Holistic Spirituality in the Thinking of Ellen White",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Holistic Spirituality in the Thinking of Ellen White", "Spirituality refers to a profound human dimension and quality which it is challenging to exactly define, if not impossible. It is represented on the one hand by a spirituality realised through means of religion, focused on seeking the purpose and ultimate being of life, but also by all other culture of the spirit in quest of a meaningful existence. According to John Swinton, the realm of the spirit is that characteristically human, dynamic life-force which vitalises and invigorates a person and motivates him/her to seek God, values, meaning, purpose and hope. \n\nThis dissertation makes holistic spirituality the object of its study, drawing attention to the connections by which the realm of the spirit is joined to other fundamental activities and dimensions of human life. These include 1) thinking 2) deeds and practical action 3) relationships and interactive networks 4) feelings and attitudes influencing behaviour 5) the dimensions of existence and being. It is in the realm of the spirit, in other words inwardly, as spiritual issues, that the meaning, value and significance of experiences are perceived. \n\nThe primary sources of this study comprise six books from 1892   1905, products of the later years of Ellen White, an American who lived 1827   1915, and systematic analysis is employed as the method of study. A practical, down-to-earth touch is essential to White s way of discussing religious praxis. This study shows that the views of Martin Luther have had a significant influence on White s thinking. The sources reveal a similarity between her views and the lines of thought in his literary production highlighted by some of the most recent Finnish studies of Luther. Although White and Luther represent different levels of theological learning, both have a similar view of the essence of the relation between God and humankind: God s love and activity flowing from his grace lie at its basis. Secondly, the existential connection,  union  between a person and Christ is the foundation for God s acceptance of and care for him/her now and forever. Thirdly, this alliance and joining of Christ and the person is manifested as cooperation and companionship aimed at realising common goals in the world. White emphasises the interactive and active nature of the spiritual relationship between the person and Christ, which is expressed in unselfishness, consideration for other people and their needs, and in compassion and an ability to place oneself in the position of another. \n\nWhite connects her thoughts on a healthful lifestyle and education to a broad understanding of spirituality which aims for the person s holistic welfare. She does not see spirituality as insular, cut off from the day-to-day business of life, but rather as the primary dimension which energises, gives purpose and guides a person in all aspects of life. \n\nDuring the course of the study the concepts  surrender to God  and  character , frequently used by White, became a focus of attention. According to White, a person cannot reach God alone, by an effort of the will; instead, when faced with God s loving invitation, one must cease to will for oneself and agree to unite with God s will and purpose. This is connected to the internal change which White describes by the concept of character. The new orientation of the will, accomplished by God s grace, changes the person s being, values, attitudes and ability for sympathetic interaction to such an extent that the person is no longer quite the same as before. There is, on the one hand, a sudden and total change of being, but at the same time a quiet, life-long growth and development are intended. It is through the concept of character that White describes spirituality and the inner journey it entails. \n\nThis study approaches spirituality as a universal human characteristic and quality, which means that the primary focus is not on individual doctrinal views or forms of religious practice. The purpose here is to outline a unifying structure within which holistic spirituality can be more clearly perceived and be understood in more detail." ],

  "texts" : [ "Close relation of fasting insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) with glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk in two populations.", "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes but its role and causal pathways are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that the insulin-like growth factor system is independently associated with cardiovascular risk within susceptible populations based on previous reports of the links between low circulating insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentrations and increased macrovascular disease in Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: In a population-based study 272 subjects (142 subjects of European and 130 Pakistani of origin) underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and standardised anthropometry. Fasting concentrations of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), intact insulin and lipids were measured and were related to 2-h glucose tolerance test status. Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). RESULTS: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was significantly lower in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance when compared with normal glucose tolerance in both ethnic groups (Europeans F = 6.7, p = 0.002 and Pakistanis F = 4.4, p = 0.01). Multiple linear regression modelling showed that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was independently associated with 2-h glucose (beta = 0.16, p = 0.009) and logistic regression indicated a 40% reduction in risk of impaired glucose tolerance for every 2.7 ng/ml increase in the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 concentration [odds ratio 0.6 (CI = 0.49-0.71), p = 0.001)]. In addition, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 was significantly correlated negatively with several established cardiovascular factors, and positively with insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 is closely related to risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people of European and Pakistani origin. It has potential use as a marker of (hepatic) insulin resistance in clinical intervention studies and further implicates the insulin-like growth factor system in the development of macrovascular disease." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The roles of microstructure and mechanics in intergranular stress corrosion cracking", "Previous work on the prediction of intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistance in grain boundary engineered microstructures has used two dimensional percolation models, in which the grain boundaries are assumed to be either resistant or susceptible to cracking, depending on the grain boundary character. One limitation of such models is that they do not necessarily account for the mechanical crack driving force. Further, they cannot capture experimentally observed phenomena such as the formation of isolated ductile bridging ligaments by resistant boundaries. These arise due to the three-dimensional character of crack propagation. A new mechanical crack propagation model is presented which, via finite element solutions, addresses these limitations. The model is based on a regular discrete representation of the material's microstructure and is applicable to both 2D and 3D behaviour. Results are reported for 2D-hexagonal microstructures, and are compared with percolation models. The results demonstrate the influence of stress on the crack path, as well as the influence of the rupture strain of susceptible boundaries on the crack behaviour. Further, the effect of crack bridging, which arises from ductile resistant boundaries is studied." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The UK Bank Corporate Governance Framework: A Holistic and Critical Analysis with a Focus upon Bank Risk and Executive Remuneration Governance", "This thesis is the first piece of legal academic research that takes a holistic approach to the bank corporate governance framework in the UK, with a critical analysis of each key component of the governance framework. Its research questions are twofold: what are the key problems of the UK bank governance framework and how to improve it? Although “black letter” law analysis is at the core of the methodological approach of this thesis, the analysis draws extensively upon the bank-governance-related findings of the literature of economics, finance, management, accounting and psychology. Moreover, modest use of historical and empirical analytical tools is attempted. This thesis comprises five chapters. Chapter One (the adapted principal-agent theory and bank governance, a historical account of UK bank corporate governance, and the FSA’s regulatory system in respect of bank corporate governance) and Chapter Two (an experimental empirical study on enforcement mechanisms in UK bank corporate governance) set the general backdrop, against which the UK framework for bank executive remuneration governance (Chapter Three) and the UK framework for bank risk governance (Chapter Four) are holistically discussed and critically analysed. Chapter Five makes the following conclusions: (1) This thesis, based on Professor Heremans’ work, redefines agency problems in banks with dispersed shareholders to comprise two-tier agency problems and the agency problems between the regulator and the regulated. This theoretical framework has been extensively used in the analysis of this thesis.(2) None of the distinct but interlinked governance mechanisms of the UK bank governance framework are a panacea and risk-free. Each governance mechanism is beset by its own obstacles and limits, hence no single governance mechanism can function effectively alone. The UK bank governance framework should fully recognise the limitations of each governance mechanism and eradicate any false sense of confidence. It would be inaccurate to describe them as substitutes for each other. (3) Agency problems affect the effectiveness of and the interaction between governance mechanisms. Equity governance mechanisms in the form of self-regulation cannot address debt governance problems and financial stability concerns alone without regulatory intervention. Further, some of the equity governance mechanisms may have a negative impact upon debt governance. The thesis thus concludes that various governance mechanisms must all work together efficiently and consistently if a UK bank’s governance matrix is to be robust and the objectives of a proper UK bank governance framework are to be met.(4) The effectiveness of the framework, in particular from the perspective of risk governance and executive remuneration governance, calls for a number of factors to be observed.(5) An inherent limitation of the UK bank governance framework is that it is not, and cannot be, designed to address possible black swan phenomena. The framework should be, and is, to a large extent, designed to effectively discourage and prevent bank boards and senior management from building exposures to or, continuing with, known ill-considered or inadequately controlled risk and to effectively encourage them to incorporate foreseeable systemic risk into their bank’s risk appetite/risk tolerance." ],

Average level of FDI inflows is associated with a 23 percenthigher takeoff probability relative to a zero FDI inflow benchmark, and this effect is highest for the LatinAmerica subsample, with a 65 rise in takeoff probability. Higher stock of short term external debt hasbeen associated with a substantial negative effect on the probability of a takeoff, and the effect of theshort terms debt overhang is largest for Latin American countries. Yet, virtually all the takeoffs wereassociated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. At the sample mean, inflow of portfolio debt is associatedwith approximately 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff. In contrast, a one standard deviationincrease in equity outflows (inflows) is associated with a 47 percent (17 percent) decline in the probabilityof a takeoff.

Quantitative analysis and simulation of a computational model of the intrinsic BG demonstrated that its output was consistent with this proposition. Here we build on that model by embedding it into a wider circuit containing the motor thalamocortical loop and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Simulation of this extended model showed that the additions gave five main results which are desirable in a selection/switching mechanism. First, low salience actions (i.e. those with low urgency) could be selected. Second, the range of salience values over which actions could be switched between was increased. Third, the contrast between the selected and non-selected actions was enhanced via improved differentiation of outputs from the BG. Fourth, transient increases in the salience of a non-selected action were prevented from interrupting the ongoing action, unless the transient was of sufficient magnitude. Finally, the selection of the ongoing action persisted when a new closely matched salience action became active. The first result was facilitated by the thalamocortical loop; the rest were dependent on the presence of the TRN. Thus, we conclude that the results are consistent with these structures having clearly defined functions in action selection." ],

During this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 276 elderly people consumed daily 50 g of either probiotic (n = 136) or control cheese (n = 140). The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of a high salivary yeast count (>or= 10(4) cfu/mL) analyzed by the Dentocult method. The prevalence decreased in the probiotic group from 30% to 21% (32% reduction), and increased in the control group from 28% to 34%. Probiotic intervention reduced the risk of high yeast counts by 75% (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.10-0.65, p = 0.004), and the risk of hyposalivation by 56% (OR = 0.44, 95%CI 0.19-1.01, p = 0.05).

  "texts" : [ "The anthropology of Islam by way of a transnational piety movement", "This study explores the anthropological study of Islam through an ethnographic analysis of the Tablighi Jama'at - a transnational piety movement. Recent anthropological writings on Islam have approached Islam as a discursive tradition and, drawing heavily on the work of Michel Foucault, have detailed the ethical formation of the subject. Embedded within these formulations are important notions of power, knowledge, truth, and authority, which are fundamental features of Islamic beliefs and practices. In the ethnographic sections of the study, I will apply this framework in the analysis of the Tablighi Jama'at. Although the movement is very much the product of a particular moment, which I will demonstrate in my historical overview, the Tablighi Jama'at has been able to expand on a global level. These two aspects will be clarified by demonstrating how the Tablighi Jama'at's formal methodology and creed are put into practice at a mosque in San Diego. In order to do so, I will rely heavily on semiotics, or the process of signification, and I will demonstrate how semiotics forms are vital elements to the success of these types of piety movements. Thus, in the final section of this study, I will revisit the debates about signification surrounding the nature of authorizing discourses, and will aim to show how semiotics allows us to connect the discursive traditions of Islam, with its authorizing and authoritative discourses, with immanent utterances and practices in the world" ],

  "texts" : [ "An Analysis of the Role of Civil Society in Building Peace in Ethno-religious Conflict: A Case Study of the Three Southernmost Provinces of Thailand", "The ‘Southern Fire’ is an ethno-religious conflict in the southernmost region of Thailand that has claimed thousands of innocent lives since an upsurge in violence in 2004. Although it does not catch the world’s attention as much as other conflict cases in the same region, daily violent incidents are ongoing for more than a decade. The violence in the south has multiple causes including historical concerns, economic marginalisation, political and social issues, religious and cultural differences, educational opportunity inequities, and judicial discrimination. \r\nAccording to a framework for conflict resolution, for Thailand’s case, the state’s policy alone could not resolve the conflict as it focused mainly on implementing a ‘peacekeeping’ strategy by increasing the number of security forces and pursuing a ‘peacemaking’ strategy via peace talks. However, to create lasting peace in this region, civil society actors need to be involved in a ‘peacebuilding’ strategy in order to keep the balance of socio-economic structures and prevent violence from happening again. More than a hundred civil society groups are involved in attempting to build peace in the southernmost provinces. Since the resurgence of violence, some civil society groups have accumulated their experiences and played significant roles in the area. These groups have become a strong network which could reduce the tensions in this region. \r\nThe research aims to promote the civil society sector as a tool of a non-violent approach; to study the role of the civil society sector in building peace in the southernmost provinces; and to strengthen civil society groups attempting to find a solution to the insurgent problem. This research used the qualitative method employing in-depth interviews and documentary research. The data was collected through person-to-person interviews with representatives of twenty-nine civil society groups. This research examines the role of the civil society sector in building peace in southern region; the efficacy of civil society groups; the problems of civil society groups active in the south; and puts forward recommendations on how to improve the work of the civil society groups.\r\nOne of the main findings was that bridge-builder, academic and relief worker are the most significant roles civil society groups play. The efficacy of the civil society sector in peacebuilding in the deep south shows that it has the potential to grow. It has a number of strong internal factors and many external opportunities that can increase capabilities and help the groups to perform better. There are, however, four important problems including human resources, time management, influence from funding sources, and political and safety issues, which can have a serious impact on the civil society sector. The three key recommendations that can help to enhance the performance of civil society groups are building trust in the communities, understanding the needs of the locals, and working with a clear strategy.\r\nThis research concludes that the civil society sector plays various roles in attempting to create peace in this region. Together with other actors, the civil society sector can be an important part of the effort to reduce the violence and can play a major role in building sustainable peace in southern Thailand when the violence eventually stops" ],

DESIGN AND METHOD: The WHOQOL-SRPB assesses QoL relating to SRPB where 33 QoL facets are scored in 6 domains, of which SRPB is one. The measure was completed by a heterogeneous sample of 285 sick and well people representing a cross-section of religious, agnostic, and atheist beliefs in UK, and structured for gender (52% female) and age (mean 47 years). RESULTS: No evidence was found to support the model of spiritual QoL as a concept that overarches every other QoL domain. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that SRPB is an integral concept to overall QoL, with a very good fit (comparative fit index=.99). Spiritual QoL made a significant, relatively independent contribution, similar to the other five domains (β=0.68). Spiritual QoL is most closely associated with the psychological domain, particularly hope and optimism and inner peace; two of the nine SRPB facets. Spiritual QoL, but not most other aspects of QoL, is higher for religious people. CONCLUSION: The results explain theoretical confusion arising from previous research. Spiritual QoL makes a significant and distinctive contribution to QoL assessment in health and should be assessed routinely in health care populations." ],

  "texts" : [ "The politics of representing the past in Bolivia", "This dissertation focuses on the role of representations of the past in social differentiation in Bolivia. I examine how connotations of specific representations of the past form important catalysts for organization and mobilization by political parties and social movements throughout the country. Assertions of a direct lineage to various precolonial, colonial, and post-independent peoples have played a vital role in contemporary ideas of difference between the highlands and lowlands of the country. These conceptions of ancestry are used both by political parties and social movements to construct oppositional lines of descent, and perceived differences inherited from ancestors legitimize contemporary ideas about regional variation in Bolivia. This research outlines how these divides are the discursive means through which material claims are debated. Felt historical differences are directly connected to debates over revenue from oil and gas reserves, agrarian reform, and the influence of locally and regionally elected officials in national decisions. As a result, at stake is the distribution of wealth as well as the systems of land ownership and political representation in the country. This research contributes to the anthropology of memory in three ways. First, by framing memory as a representation of the past, I demonstrate how these representations connect individuals temporally to a common ancestral heritage as well as spatially to a place. In this capacity, I argue that memory is a bridge connecting people to each other and to particular shared spaces. Second, in exploring the current role of descent in social distinctions, I show how an individual's perceived ancestry associates ancestral identification with a shared lineage, outlining a key overlap between autobiographical and collective memory. Finally, I demonstrate how power is exercised in the ability to control the connotation of important representations of the past through investigating how these representations are catalysts for organization and mobilization by political parties and social movements. In this capacity, I show that representations of the past reflect, but are also used to construct, meaningful social distinctions and differentiation in the present" ],

The purpose of this study was to derive constructs to describe neighborhoods using both primary (neighborhood audit) and secondary (geographic information systems) data.\n            \n            \n               \n                  Methods\n               \n               We collected detailed information on 10,770 road segments using an audit and secondary data. The road segment sample was randomly split into an exploratory (60%) and validation sample (40%) for cross-validation. Using the exploratory sample (n = 6,388), seven a priori constructs were assessed separately (functionality, safety, aesthetics, destinations, incivilities, territorality, social spaces) by urbanicity using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, new a posteriori constructs were derived using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). For cross-validation (n = 4,382), we tested factor loadings, thresholds, correlated errors, and correlations among a posteriori constructs between the two subsamples. Two-week test-retest reliability of the final constructs using a subsample of road segments (n = 464) was examined using Spearman correlation coefficients.\n            \n            \n               \n                  Results\n               \n               CFA indicated the a priori constructs did not hold in this geographic area, with the exception of physical incivilities. Therefore, we used EFA to derive a four-factor solution on the exploratory sample: arterial or thoroughfare, walkable neighborhood, physical incivilities, and decoration. Using CFA on the validation sample, the internal validity for these a posteriori constructs was high (range 0.43 to 0.73) and the fit was acceptable. Spearman correlations indicated the arterial or thoroughfare factor displayed near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.96). Both the physical incivilities factor and the walkable neighborhood factor had substantial to near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.77 to 0.78 and r = 0.79 to 0.82, respectively). The decoration factor displayed moderate reliability in urban segments (r = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38&#8211;0.60) and lower reliability in rural segments (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25&#8211;0.52).\n            \n            \n               \n                  Conclusion\n               \n               The results of our analyses yielded four reliably and objectively measured constructs that will be used to explore associations with physical activity in urban and rural North Carolina. These constructs should be explored in other geographic areas to confirm their usefulness elsewhere." ],

The complete sequence of the rice genome has provided an extremely useful parallel road map for genetic and genomics studies in wheat. The recent construction of a defense response interactome in rice has the potential to further enhance the translation of advances in rice to wheat and other grasses. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of conservation in the protein-protein interactions in the rice and wheat defense response interactomes. As entry points we selected proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response: the RAR1/SGT1/HSP90 protein complex, NPR1, XA21, and XB12 (XA21 interacting protein 12).\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\t\tUsing available wheat sequence databases and phylogenetic analyses we identified and cloned the wheat orthologs of these four rice proteins, including recently duplicated paralogs, and their known direct interactors and tested 86 binary protein interactions using yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. All interactions between wheat proteins were further tested using in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Eighty three percent of the known rice interactions were confirmed when wheat proteins were tested with rice interactors and 76% were confirmed using wheat protein pairs. All interactions in the RAR1/SGT1/ HSP90, NPR1 and XB12 nodes were confirmed for the identified orthologous wheat proteins, whereas only forty four percent of the interactions were confirmed in the interactome node centered on XA21. We hypothesize that this reduction may be associated with a different sub-functionalization history of the multiple duplications that occurred in this gene family after the divergence of the wheat and rice lineages.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\t\tThe observed high conservation of interactions between proteins that serve as key regulators of the rice defense response suggests that the existing rice interactome can be used to predict interactions in wheat. Such predictions are less reliable for nodes that have undergone a different history of duplications and sub-functionalization in the two lineages." ],

METHODS: This Phase I study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of vandetanib when administered with either gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or vinorelbine plus cisplatin (VC) in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. RESULTS: Seventeen patients received vandetanib 100 mg/d plus VC (n = 9) or GC (n = 8). Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported in each treatment group: vandetanib + VC (pulmonary artery thrombosis and asymptomatic QTc prolongation [n = 2]); vandetanib + GC (peripheral ischemia [due to arterial occlusion], pulmonary embolism, and limb venous thrombosis). The protocol definition of a tolerable dose was not met, and no patients were recruited to receive vandetanib 300 mg plus VC or GC. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between vandetanib and vinorelbine or gemcitabine, but there was an approximate 30% increase in the exposure to cisplatin, which may be due to accumulation of total platinum and/or an interaction with vandetanib. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer, vandetanib 100 mg/d in combination with either VC or GC was not tolerated." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Researching schools: being simultaneously and insider and an outsider", "Educational research concerns ways in which researcher identity can influence findings and practice. Very often writings which instruct Doctoral students on the positioning and reflexivity of the researcher, tend to present identity as singular and static. In this paper I discuss my experience as a Doctoral researcher whose identity is represented using the notion of inside/outside researcher, but in reality is far more complex. My Doctoral Project centres on a student-led action research project at an independent secondary school in the south-east of England. Twenty-five students aged between 14 and 19 collaborate with a consortium of teachers and administrators to develop policy statements on teaching and learning with ICT, which they recommend to the school’s senior management team. I study this group over 33 months and collect data through participant interviews, analysis of school documents and unstructured observations. In my research I am simultaneously an insider—by virtue of being an employee at the school—and an outsider because I was acting as a researcher within the school. The former role was necessary in organizing and facilitating the student-led project. I show how I had to take on multiple identities, and how these multiplied and shifted throughout the project in ways that have become more visible in hindsight. I mobilize Zygmunt Bauman’s notion of ‘fluid identities’ and use the work of Thomson and Gunter (2011) to argue that the inside-outside binary, although helpful as political categories in which researchers may be classified, actually limit understandings of the ‘messy research practice’ within schools." ],

The winter northeast monsoon has\nmoderate wind forcing and a strongly destabilizing surface buoyancy flux, driven by large\nradiative and latent heat losses at the sea surface. Convective entrainment is the primary\nlocal mechanism driving the observed mixed layer cooling and deepening, although horizontal\nadvection of thermocline depth variations affect the depth which the mixed layer\nattains. Modifications of a one-dimensional mixed layer model and heat balance show that\nthe primary nonlocal forcing of the upper ocean is the horizontal advection of temperature\ngradients below the mixed layer base. The summer southwest monsoon has strong wind\nstresses and a neutral to stabilizing surface buoyancy flux, limited by the extreme humidity\nof the atmosphere, which suppresses both the radiative and latent heat losses at the surface.\nWind-driven shear instabilities at the base of the mixed layer, which entrain cooler\nand fresher water primarily produces the observed mixed layer cooling and deepening.\nHorizontal advection of cooler water within the mixed layer influences the local heat balance\nat the mooring site. Ekman pumping velocities play only a small role in the upper\nocean evolution during both monsoon seasons.Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution September 1997This research was funded by ONR grant N00014-94- 1-0161, and I was supported during\nthis time by a generous NDSEG fellowship" ],

  "texts" : [ "Sustainable global wheat supply scenarios under future climate change impacts", "Climate change is predicted to have impacts on agricultural productivity which, coupled with growth in population, will make sustainably feeding the world extremely challenging. While some parts of the world are expected to benefit from moderate climate-change related temperature increases and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, others are likely to face worsening agricultural production conditions. Even those regions benefiting from changing average conditions are likely to face more frequent extreme weather events which make agricultural production and food supply more volatile than it already is.This paper uses the example of wheat, as one of the most important staple crops worldwide to explore climate change issues relevant to supply and demand. Published data on current and projected wheat yields under different adaptation strategies are used to analyse the extent to which global production can be increased to match projected demands. A set of wheat supply scenarios was developed which shows that the increasing demand can only be provided by northern hemisphere producers narrowing their yield gaps, utilising climate change benefits and increasing production levels to supply southern hemisphere consumers. Even then there are significant risks associated with food security and resilience which could jeopardise the ability to service the future global wheat demand." ],

Tojeiro generalized this result given the existence of a certain type of function of the eigenvalues of the Codazzi tensor, of which the trace is one example. We will show the equivalence of Tojeiro's condition to three other conditions. Furthermore, we construct examples of Codazzi tensorshaving two eigenvalue functions, one of which has eigenspace dimension n-1  where the metric is not a warped product with interval base, refuting a remark in Besse that the warped product conclusion holds without any restriction on the trace." ],

  "title" : "Three Essays in Chinese Accounting",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three Essays in Chinese Accounting", "In this thesis, I examine financial reporting issues in the Chinese context, with a particular focus on the effect of political forces. The thesis consists of three essays.In the first essay, I examine whether the earnings properties and share price anticipation of earnings of Chinese firms changed following the mandatory adoption of Chinese IFRS in 2007. Using a set of IFRS “early adopters” as a control group, I find that the earnings persistence and other measures of earnings properties, among the treatment group of firms adopting Chinese IFRS in 2007, do not change significantly. However, I do find that share price anticipation of earnings improves for the treatment group relative to the control group, consistent with the improved transparency associated with Chinese IFRS adoption making it easier for investors to forecast future earnings. Particularly, I find that the improvement in the share price anticipation of earnings is confined to firms that are not state controlled or subsidized, and so largely rely on capital markets to supply most of their financial needs.In the second essay, I examine the value relevance of government subsidies for Chinese listed companies. My exploration of the valuation consequences of state support is structured around three questions. First, are the government subsidies received by Chinese listed companies value relevant? Second, does the value relevance of government subsidies depend on the purpose for which the subsidies are used? Third, does the value relevance of government subsidies depend on the channel through which the subsidies are granted? I motivate these research questions through interviews of accountants, managers, academics and government officials. Through large sample analyses, I confirm that subsidies are positively related to firm value, but less so for distressed firms and subsidies granted through non-tax channels. My study contributes to the understanding of a Chinese-style capitalism that is driving China towards becoming the largest economy in the World.In the third and final essay, I examine whether state subsidies influence the voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures of Chinese listed firms. Focusing on Chinese manufacturing industries for the period 2006-2009, I find that a well established model of CSR disclosures that was designed for Western companies produces similar results in China. I then go on to exploit the additional unique institutional features of China that have material implications for disclosure choice over and above the variables that commonly figure in Western models. In particular, I focus on the influence of state subsidies on the CSR disclosure choices of Chinese firms, taking care to distinguish between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state owned enterprises (NSOEs). I find that state subsidies do (do not) significantly affect the CSR disclosure choices of NSOEs (SOEs). I also find a significant difference between the influence of tax-based subsidies and non-tax based subsidies on NSOEs. My findings are consistent with the political cost hypothesis that firms receiving state subsidies, especially those not under state control, are pressured to disclose CSR activities due to political cost concerns associated with public demand as well as government scrutiny." ],

A multicentre, randomized, controlled trial: 3-year follow-up.", "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of early class III protraction facemask treatment in children under 10 years of age at 3-year follow-up. Design: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients were randomly allocated, stratified for gender, into early class III protraction facemask group (PFG) (n = 35) and a control/no treatment group (CG) (n = 38). OUTCOMES: Dentofacial changes were assessed from lateral cephalograms and occlusal changes using the peer assessment rating (PAR). Self-esteem was assessed using the Piers-Harris children's self-concept scale, and the psychosocial impact of malocclusion with oral aesthetic subjective impact score (OASIS) questionnaire. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) signs and symptoms were also recorded. The time points for data collection were at registration (DC1), 15 months later (DC2) and 3 years post-registration (DC3). RESULTS: The following mean skeletal and occlusal changes occurred from the class III starting point to DC3 (3-year follow-up): SNA, PFG moved forwards +2·3° (CG forward +1·6°; P = 0·14); SNB, PFG moved forwards +0·8° (CG forward +1·5°, P = 0·26); ANB, PFG class III base improved +1·5° (CG stayed about the same at +0·1°; P = 0·001). This contributed to an overall difference in ANB between PFG and CG of +1·4° in favour of early protraction facemask treatment. The overjet was still improved by +3·6 mm in the PFG and changed a small amount +1·1 mm in the CG (P = 0·001). A 21% improvement in PAR was shown in the PFG and the CG worsened by 8·4% (P = 0·02). There was no increase in self-esteem (Piers-Harris score) for PFG compared with the CG (P = 0·56) and no statistically significant difference in the impact of malocclusion (OASIS) between groups in terms of the changes from DC1 to DC3 (P = 0·18). TMJ signs and symptoms were very low at DC1 and DC3. CONCLUSIONS: The favourable effect of early class III protraction facemask treatment undertaken in patients under 10 years of age, is maintained at 3-year follow-up in terms of ANB, overjet and % PAR improvement. The direct protraction treatment effect at SNA is still favourable although not statistically significantly better than the CG. Seventy per cent of patients in PFG had maintained a positive overjet which we have defined as ongoing treatment success. Early protraction facemask treatment does not seem to influence self-esteem or reduce the patient's personal impact of their malocclusion at 3-year follow-up." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Dynamic link-based ranking over large-scale graph- structured data", "Information Retrieval techniques have been the primary means of keyword search in document collections. However, as the amount and the diversity of available semantic connections between objects increase, link-based ranking methods including ObjectRank have been proposed to provide high-recall semantic keyword search over graph-structured data. Since a wide variety of data sources can be modeled as data graphs, supporting keyword search over graph- structured data greatly improves the usability of such data sources. However, it is challenging in both online performance and result quality. We first address the performance issue of dynamic authority-based ranking methods such as personalized PageRank and ObjectRank. Since they dynamically rank nodes in a data graph using an expensive matrix-multiplication method, the online execution time rapidly increases as the size of data graph grows. Over the English Wikipedia dataset of 2007, ObjectRank spends 20-40 seconds to compute query-specific relevance scores, which is unacceptable. We introduce a novel approach, BinRank, that approximates dynamic link- based ranking scores efficiently. BinRank partitions a dictionary into bins of relevant keywords and then constructs materialized subgraphs(MSGs) per bin in preprocessing stage. In query time, to produce highly accurate top-K results efficiently, BinRank uses the MSG corresponding to the given keyword, instead of the original data graph. PageRank and ObjectRank calculate the global importance score and the query-specific authority score of each node respectively by exploiting the link structure of a given data graph. However, both measures favor nodes with high in-degree that may contain popular yet generic content, and thus those nodes are frequently included in top-K lists, regardless of given query. We propose a novel ranking measure, Inverse ObjectRank, which measures the content-specificity of each node by traversing the semantic links in the data graph in the reverse direction. Then, we allow users to adjust the importance of the three ranking measures (global importance, query-relevance, and content-specificity) to improve the quality of search results" ],

Using student focus group interviews, teacher and staff interviews, and document analysis, this study seeks to understand the nature of after-school athletics and exercise programs in these schools, how they meet the needs of these students, and the role of administrators and teachers in leading these programs and tracking how these programs may benefit students academically as well as physically. Key findings include a relationship between funding and increased teacher investment of providing after-school activities, as well as a positive relationship between adults who are on campus all day and the social-emotional investment and connection of the students to the school and their own learning. Key data sources are generally not systemically used to measure growth in behavior, investment, or academic growth, despite myriad sources of data for analysis. Students report feeling more invested in school when it seems adults through the day are caring about them by checking on their progress, even if useful data is not systematically used. Implications of this study span across leadership, practitioner, and policy considerations; research constructs; and theoretical concepts. Key factors to consider when implementing an effective program include financial support, facility considerations, preexisting physical resources, staff knowledge and interest, and an understanding of the importance of the program. Recommendations include conducting pre- and post- engagement surveys, tracking changes in grades, credit acquisition, and behavior, maintaining funding for after-school physical education programs for typically low-socioeconomic status students, recruiting facilitators who are also teachers on continuation school campuses during the regular school hours, using existing data sources to guide decisions, and reconsidering theoretical frameworks to better understand the student-in-context as an individual with agency to pursue healthy relationships with adults via mentoring frameworks for interactions which will facilitate resiliency and positive health habits" ],

  "texts" : [ "“Real” Native Speakers: Visible ethnic minority, native English speaking teachers", "In the professional world of TESOL, the native English speaker (NES) / non-native English speaker (NNES) dichotomy is a firmly entrenched hierarchy that affects how teachers are perceived and valued. Within the international English language education business, the NES status is often associated with a particular racial profile.  The view that NES are preferred English language teachers remains the dominant storyline, which is made available to those that fit the racial and linguistic criteria. As a NES of Filipino ethnic origins, I am visibly not part of this profile and, as I have experienced, visible ethnic minorities can find that their NES identity is not acknowledged by students, school managers and even NNESTs. In this multi-stage, narrative based study I further problematize the NES preference by examining the experiences of visible ethnic minorities who are native English speaking teachers (VEM-NESTs). Moreover I am both the researcher and a participant and I have deliberately incorporated my story as part of the methodological design.  The stories generated in response to my narrative have been influenced by my identity as a VEM-NEST in addition to the content of my story.  This paper presents how VEM-NESTs have subverted the dominant NES storyline and through this subversive stance, reconstructs their racial and linguistic identity in response to the resistance they encountered when striving to be recognized as a ‘legitimate’ English language professional. The findings have implications on the criteria currently used for evaluating the worth of English language teachers, NES and NNES." ],

The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of a 5-HT3 antagonist in irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Fifty patients with irritable bowel syndrome were treated with ondansetron, a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. In addition to assessing its effect on the classical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (abdominal pain, distension and disordered bowel habit) its effect on symptoms often seen in irritable bowel syndrome, but more commonly associated with functional dyspepsia, was also examined. RESULTS: Ondansetron reduced bowel frequency (P = 0.035) and improved stool consistency (P = 0.002) in diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome and did not cause a deterioration of bowel habit in constipation predominant subjects. No statistically significant improvement was seen for abdominal pain or distension, although those patients who did respond were approximately twice as likely to be taking ondansetron than placebo. It was also found that ondansetron significantly improved the upper gastrointestinal symptoms of post-prandial epigastric discomfort (P = 0.008), flatulence (P = 0.022) and heartburn (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The results of this study justify evaluation of the therapeutic potential of selective 5-HT antagonists in both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome." ],

  "texts" : [ "A prospective trial of the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life and depressive symptoms.", "BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin is an efficacious treatment for acne, but has been controversially linked with depression. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the effects of isotretinoin on quality of life(QoL) and depression using a prospective design. METHODS: The WHOQOL-BREF QoL measure and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale were administered to consecutive outpatients with acne who were prescribed either isotretinoin (n = 65) or antibiotic treatment (n = 31).Patients and physicians rated acne severity independently. Groups were compared at baseline with a matched community sample (n = 94) and measurements repeated at 3 months for treatment groups. RESULTS: There were no differences between the three groups at baseline in terms of age, gender, depression or overall QoL. Acne was more severe in the treatment groups (P < 0·001). Depression was negatively correlated with QoL (P < 0·001)and hence was included as a covariate in repeated-measures analyses of QoL.Acne improved over time in both treatment groups (F = 48·2, P < 0·001). There was no detectable deterioration in depression score in either group (F = 1·1, not significant). QoL in the physical and social domains improved (P < 0·001) while psychological and environmental QoL was unchanged over time. The improvement in social QoL was greater in the isotretinoin group (P < 0·05). Those patients with higher baseline depression scores showed greater improvements in physical, psychological and social QoL (P < 0·001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of acne improves QoL, particularly in those with more depressive symptoms at the outset. Mood deterioration was not detected, but the possibility of subtle or rare mood effects of isotretinoin cannot be ruled out." ],

In this work these biomarkers were analysed in surface sediments along a well characterised sub-Arctic transect in the northernmost Baltic Sea from the Kalix River to the central Bothnian Bay to assess their environmental behaviour and potential for tracing the contribution of soil in this type of system. There was a high BHP diversity and enhanced total BHP concentration in the estuarine sediments, whereas a much less diverse pattern could be observed in the open bay with lower total BHP concentration. In addition, both soil marker BHPs (adenosylhopanes) and branched GDGTs were substantially more abundant in the estuarine than the open bay sediments. The R soil ′ index, based on the Rsoil index minus the contribution from the methylated soil marker BHPs, is suggested as a new approach for tracing soil derived organic matter (OM) in the (sub)-Arctic region. The index decreased along the transect in an off-river direction, correlating strongly with both the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index and the stable carbon isotopic composition of the sedimentary organic carbon. These field results indicate that both the R soil ′ and the BIT indices have potential for tracing soil derived OM in sub-Arctic to Arctic waters." ],

I: The process of care.", "OBJECTIVE: To compare the process of out of hours care provided by general practitioners from patients' own practices and by commercial deputising services. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four urban areas in Manchester, Salford, Stockport, and Leicester. SUBJECTS: 2152 patients who requested out of hours care, and 49 practice doctors and 183 deputising doctors (61% local principals) who responded to those requests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response to call, time to visit, prescribing, and hospital admissions. RESULTS: 1046 calls were dealt with by practice doctors and 1106 by deputising doctors. Practice doctors were more likely to give telephone advice (20.2% v 0.72% of calls) and to visit more quickly than deputising doctors (median delay 35 minutes v 52 minutes). Practice doctors were less likely than deputising doctors to issue a prescription (56.1% v 63.2% of patients) or to prescribe an antibiotic (43.7% v 61.3% of prescriptions issued) and more likely to prescribe genetic drugs (58.4% v 32.1% of drugs prescribed), cheaper drugs (mean cost per prescription pounds 3.28 v pounds 5.04), and drugs in a predefined out of hours formulary (49.8% v 41.1% of drugs prescribed). There was no significant difference in the number of hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast with practice doctors, deputising doctors providing out of hours care less readily give telephone advice, take longer to visit at home, and have patterns of prescribing that may be less discriminating." ],

However, many today lack familiarity with the narratives of traditional religions. In other words, they suffer from ‘religious illiteracy’. This article considers the problem of how religion can become meaningful to such people. The view that religion can be divested of its outdated cultural accoutrements and presented in a form that resonates with postmodern secular culture is considered and found to be problematic. If acquiring a religion is like acquiring a culture, or a language, it seems unlikely that a deeper appreciation of a religious tradition will be facilitated by divesting it of its traditional cultural expressions. Moreover, the view that religious lifestyles should be emphasised rather than religious belief seems to be more a symptom of the problem of ‘religious  illiteracy’ than a solution to it. The article concludes that both of these responses fail to provide a solution to the problem and that an alternative strategy  is urgently required." ],

While the focus is on non-affective psychosis and the schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the mechanisms underlying suicide behaviour in this group may well underlie or at least influence suicide behaviour in other disorders. The authors describe methods of assessment through individual formulation, and a cognitive behavioural intervention through case studies, to reduce the risk of suicide.This book argues that:· Suicide behaviour lies on a cognitive-behavioural continuum from ideation, through intention to action. · Mechanisms based on biased information processing systems, the development of suicide schema, and appraisal styles are likely to be fruitful in explaining suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· A psychological theory of suicide behaviour is needed in order to develop a mechanism of suicide and to understand the components of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.· Suicide risk can be reduced through the use of the intervention methods described within the text Cognitive Behavioural Prevention of Suicide in Psychosis evaluates practical applications of contemporary research on this topic, and will therefore be of interest to practitioners, post-graduates in training, and researchers studying suicide and/or psychosis." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Regulation of fibrillin-1 processing and microfibril assembly by pro-protein convertases", "The University of ManchesterAbstract of thesis submitted by Alan Robert Francis Godwin for the degree of Master of Philosophy entitled ‘Regulation of fibrillin-1 processing and microfibril assembly by pro-protein convertases’. September 2012.Fibrillin-1 is the major component of a class of microfibrils which form the scaffold for the deposition of elastin in elastic tissues such as the aorta, elastic arteries, skin, lung and auricular cartilage. Mutations in fibrillin-1 lead to a number of inheritable connective tissue disorders collectively termed fibrillinopathies, which include diseases such as Marfan syndrome and Weill Marchesani syndrome.Fibrillin-1 contains recognition sequences for the pro-protein convertase family of serine proteases in its N- and C-terminal regions. Cleavage at the C-terminus has been shown to be a critical step in the assembly of fibrillin-1. Mutations have been identified which prevent C-terminal processing of fibrillin-1, which in turn cause Marfan syndrome. N-terminal processing is also likely to be an important step in microfibril deposition.For the first time, N-terminal processing of fibrillin-1 has been monitored using a cell culture model expressing full-length N-terminally V5-tagged recombinant fibrillin-1. N-terminal processing was shown to be sensitive to the addition of exogenous heparin. Addition of the pro-protein convertase inhibitor hexa-D-arginine suggests that N-terminal processing may not be essential for the “head-to-tail” assembly of fibrillin-1 into microfibrils.Using RNA interference to target enzymes of the pro-protein convertase family, it was determined that furin was the major enzyme involved in the C-terminal processing of fibrillin-1. This processing of the C-terminus, however, was not sensitive to the addition of exogenous heparin, or to the depletion of heparan sulphate using RNA interference of exostosin-1 (an early heparan sulphate polymerase).These results give new insights into the role and regulation of fibrillin-1 processing in the formation of fibrillin-1 microfibrils, and highlight the importance of heparan sulphate interactions in N-terminal cleavage by the pro-protein convertases" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Using multivariate calibration to evaluate hominin brain/body size relationships", "Modern humans are highly encephalized, having relatively large brains despite our already large bodies. The current assumption is that brains and bodies have both increased in size during the course of human evolution but the rate, timing, and evolutionary relationship of the two are still unclear. This study uses methods that increase the sample size of fossil hominins, provide more confidence in body mass estimates, and allow a comparison of the rate and timing of changes in each trait over the past 4+ million years (mya). \r\n\r\nBrains and bodies show different evolutionary patterns over time. Body size actually shows a decrease in the Pliocene while brains are essentially static. This would have resulted in more encephalized hominins. At the beginning of the Pleistocene (ca. 2.6 mya) body size began to increase and brains began a modest but discernible increase. Body size became static about 1.0 mya and brain size increased sharply around 0.4 mya (close to the appearance of the first Homo sapiens). These patterns indicate that both traits were subject to differing selection (directional or stabilizing) or genetic drift at different times. Their genetic covariation is low; this trait is also subject to selection so the amount of covariation can change throughout time. \r\n\r\n\r\nTaken together, these results suggest a complicated relationship between brain size and body size. Both traits were probably experiencing some direct selection, while also susceptible to indirect selection from the other based on their covariation. The dissimilarities in the change of body size and brain size indicate that their covariation was actively changing during the course of human evolution. Other research indicates that humans have less phenotypic integration than great apes. For example, the transition to bipedalism may have been eased by lowering covariation within the hip, thus reducing evolutionary constraint. This pattern of ``evolvability\" could extend to more general modules or groups of traits, like the skull and brain size, or skeletal and body size. \r\n\r\nChanges in selection on brain size and body size would have been rooted in environmental and life history changes; many life history changes accompany brain size and body size changes. If we examine the analyses of the entire sample, Australopithecines were experiencing decreasing body size and relative stasis in brain size, producing an overall result of encephalization. As brains got relatively larger compared to bodies it was inevitable that at some point either brains would have to get smaller along with bodies or bodies would have to start getting larger to birth large-brained offspring. After 2.6 mya the selection for bigger brains could be responsible for driving larger bodies, but brains show positive allometry relative to bodies. These changing phenotypic relationships suggest changing genetic relationships, indicating a different pattern in integration that began to emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still much to learn and understand about the evolution of human brains and bodies. These analyses lend some clarity to the rate and timing of evolution of both brain size and body size over time, but the trends are not directly comparable because body size changes linearly over time while brain size shows an exponential increase. Results support previous findings in many ways, including probable changes in energy allocation to support a large brain, an increased rate of evolution in more recent hominins, and changing phenotypic integration. New results include body size decreasing and brain size stasis in the Pliocene, as well as static body size and increasing brains in the Pleistocene" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A study of the professional identities of senior school leaders in areas of economic hardship", "This study makes a contribution to the body of work on the impact of education policy aimed at improving schools on the identities of school leaders. It uses the National Challenge as an example of how New Labour attempted to solve the perceived problem of school failure particularly in areas of economic hardship. The aim of the study is to investigate the identities of senior school leaders as they position themselves in relation to the discourses that arise from the neoliberal ideology that has dominated education policy making since the 1980s. These schools are often officially measured and labelled as failing.A literature review locates the research in the political context of education reform over the last thirty years. A review of literature relating to the work of senior leaders in areas of economic hardship traces how knowledge claims and leadership development have shaped their roles throughout this period of post-welfarist reform. It is argued that the policies that have been enacted give rise to discourses which construct some schools as being successful and others as being failures and that the notion of failure is particularly prevalent in area of economic hardship. It is within this environment that senior leaders construct their professional identities meaning that they are required to balance their beliefs and values about the nature and purpose of education with those inherent in the dominant discourses. How these school leaders both shape and are shaped by the policies that they are required to implement is central to the effectiveness of attempts to improve their schools. The work has been structured around three research questions. What are the dominant discourses and models of change in education and how do these both impact on and define schools serving areas of economic hardship? How are senior leaders constructing their professional identity in relation to these discourses and models of change? What are the implications of senior leader identity for development and change in those schools serving areas of economic hardship?The work is a policy scholarship which aims to place the research within its wider historical and sociological context. A discourse analysis of key documents which relate to the National Challenge was carried out and then interviews were conducted with twenty senior leaders. The analysis of the findings include a largely descriptive account of the main themes that emerged and then a more detailed analysis that describes identity in terms of dialogic interactions and conceptualises them using the thinking tools of Bourdieu. Findings from the study make a contribution to the body of knowledge relating to the interaction between education policy influencing school improvement and the identity of those who implement it particularly in areas of economic hardship. The research problematises and challenges some of the assumptions and some of the value inherent in the policies and provides a body of work that will inform future improvement strategies particularly if these are to fully engage and value those who lead these schools. The long term aim would be to ensure that improvement strategies are effective in specific contexts and that there is a shared understanding of both what effective means and what are the desired outcomes of education in these areas. The study reveals how school failure is a construct arising from neoliberal education policy strategy and describes the position of the school leaders using Bourdieu’s concept of hysteresis." ],

  "texts" : [ "How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand the engagement of educational workers in higher Education?", "In ‘Making a European area of lifelong learning a reality’, the EU stressed the role of universities in relation to lifelong learning, a role that entails a need for widening access to universities, particularly for those not coming through the traditional direct route of upper secondary education. As teachers play a significant role in the quality of the lifelong learning as well as in motivating future generations to take part in lifelong learning, education and training for teachers becomes important; not only in relation to initial teacher education, but also in relation to a continuous development of knowledge and skills. \r\nThis paper represents the first stage of a larger comparative project intended to examine and compare educational workers’ (i.e. professionals involved in teaching in the class room) participation in higher education in England and Denmark, their access and interest. In particular, the paper relates participation and engagement to national and international educational policies and frames this work within an examination of the social background of the professional groups. The key research questions at this stage of the work are methodological and can be summed up by the overarching question, “How can the concepts of habitus and field help us to understand levels of engagement of educational workers in Higher Education”?\r\nThe paper reports the results of our review of current policies and our efforts to identify the structural relations within the educational professional fields in each country. To do so we are developing a theoretical model using the relational analytical approach advocated by Bourdieu. As such, our work is an early stage attempt at operationalising Bourdieu’s observations regarding the dynamics of field. This seems to us to provide an important conceptual approach to understanding the habitus of educational workers in the context of the dynamics of a fast changing policy arena and the complexities of the backgrounds of individuals working in the educational field. The model attempts to build in the reflexivity that Bourdieu demands for a ‘science’ that is not weakened by over-emphasis on either the objective structural relations or the subjective phenomenology of experience. \r\nThus, the paper presents a preliminary contextual analysis of the factors that enable an understanding of engagement or lack of engagement in higher level learning among school-based education workers in the two EU countries and is related to a larger research project that explores habitus (both individual and collective) among these groups of education workers." ],

  "texts" : [ "Page Smith: Founding Cowell College and UCSC, 1964-1973", "This oral history chronicles the late Page Smith's experiences as founding provost of the campus's first college and his major contributions in shaping the college system here. His narration includes chapters on student culture in the 1960s and 1970s, the pass/fail grading system, his educational philosophy, town/gown relations, campus architecture, the History of Consciousness Program, his relationship with founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry, arts on the campus and the role of his wife, Eloise Pickard Smith, in the founding of the art gallery at Cowell College which now bears her name. The volume is a candid narration which conveys Smith's contrarian perspective on higher education and the flavor of the campus in its early pioneering years.\n      Smith joined the faculty in 1964 and embarked on the adventure of creating a new UC campus. The formative concepts shaping UCSC were an emphasis on undergraduate teaching and the creation of small human-scale colleges around which campus intellectual and cultural life would be organized. Smith became deeply involved in creating a close-knit community at Cowell College, and in promoting a number of innovations during the campus's first decade, perhaps the most significant of which was the narrative evaluation or pass/fail system, an abandonment of the old letter grade system.\n      Smith's interviews are organized into three sections. The first includes Smith's commentary on his controversial appointment as the campus's first provost, early faculty appointments, his efforts to recruit women and minority faculty, and college life. In the second section he discusses issues he confronted as provost, administering Cowell College, establishing the pass/fail grading system, his teaching and curriculum philosophy, the conflict between boards of studies (now designated as departments), and how he defined the provost's role. In the final section, \"UCSC's Development\", Smith discusses campus-wide topics, including his relationship with founding Chancellor Dean E. McHenry, his opinion of campus architecture, the origins of the History of Consciousness program, and town-gown relations. He also discusses the role of his wife, the late artist, Eloise Pickard Smith, in the founding of the art gallery at Cowell College that now bears her name.\n      In the final chapters of the volume, Smith candidly discusses his resignation from the University in 1973 after his colleague and friend, Paul Lee, a professor of religious studies, was not given tenure. Smith used this occasion as a symbolic protest against what he considered the rigidity of the \"publish or perish\" system governing University faculty promotion and tenure. This issue was a major and paradoxical bete noire in Smith's attitude towards academic life since he himself was uncommonly prolific and published over two dozen books. His Killing the Spirit: Higher Education in America (1990) provided an elaborate critique of contemporary academic life.\n      Smith's legacy lives on in his scholarly work, which he continued after his retirement from the University, with numerous publications, including the 8-volume People's History of the United States, in his many contributions to UCSC and Cowell College, and in his untiring work as a community activist on behalf of the homeless. He was a co-founder (with his friend Paul Lee) of the William James Association in Santa Cruz, the Homeless Garden Project, the Penny University and the Prison Arts Project." ],

  "texts" : [ "Financialization and consumption: an alternative account of rising consumer debt levels in Anglo-America", "A diversity of opinions exists on the cause and consequences of rising debt levels in the United States and United Kingdom. Economists and government policy makers see rising debt levels as a natural outcome of lower inflation and nominal interest rates. In fact, growing debt levels are seen as contributing to a wealth effect in these economies, as borrowing more as induced asset price appreciation contributing to new avenues of wealth creation. Conversely, some see rising debt levels as a symptom of eroding of self-control and evidence of the intensification of consumerism in Anglo-American society, as people are now considered to consume without consideration for the limits of income. Increasing indebtedness has also been associated with the deepening disciplinary power of global financein everyday life. This article addresses previous unexplored socio-cultural variables alongside significant market transformations that, together, contributed to escalating levels of consumer debt levels in Anglo-America. In doing so, it asks: what factors contributed to rising consumer debt levels in Anglo-America since the mid-1990s? Rather than putting forward a single causal relationship, rising debt levels are analyzed as a product of the cumulativeeffects of economic changes and socio-cultural factors. In particular, how widespread use of asset-backed securitization (ABS) in consumer credit industry created an increase supply of credit available for lending and a dependence on a growing pool of revolving debtors.Moreover, how stagnant incomes for wage-earners created a new form demand for consumer credit. Finally, how the centrality of consumerism in Anglo-American society provided sufficient cultural justification for consumption despite lower incomes for most wage-earners." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "PONTANVS FECIT: Inscriptions and Artistic Authorship in the Pontano Chapel", "Built between 1490 and 1492, the chapel of the humanist Giovanni Pontano is one of the most interesting and controversial cases of fifteenth-century Neapolitan architecture. The chapel has been attributed to different architects including Fra Giocondo, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Baccio Pontelli; however, none of these attributions can be considered conclusive. Pontano himself discourages us from trying to propose a new name in addition to those which have already been suggested, by repeatedly signing the pavement of the chapel with an unequivocal Pontanus fecit. This feature has never been remarked upon by historians, yet Pontano’s inscription should be seen as a true signature of the work and represents a central element for our understanding of the building and above all of Pontano’s relationship with the artistic culture of his time. Wishing to inform posterity about who was responsible for the chapel, he proposes himself as its only true auctor. This matches perfectly what the humanist would shortly afterwards express in his treatise De magnificentia, in which he describes the patron as the auctor of the work of art who through his knowledge of architecture and sculpture is thereby able to show the architect and sculptor the means how they might achieve magnificence in the artistic work which they are going to carry out on his behalf. Pontano’s use of such signatures reflects a precise humanistic interest in artists’ signatures which emerged at the end of the fifteenth century and which led to the resumption of this practice in antiquarian terms. While the graphic form of the inscription in capital letters and its arrangement within a scroll show a careful observation of ancient monuments, the wording of the sentence with the name in the nominative and the verb facere, employed in the perfect tense (fecit), reveals a precise ancient literary source. Pontano’s signature is an accurate quotation from Pliny’s preface to the first book of the Naturalis Historia. With his choice of the inscription Pontanus fecit, Pontano is consciously making a precise statement: he not only communicates his role as the author of the chapel, as well as its patron, but also expresses his conviction that he has perfected the work of art to his full satisfaction and does not have to fear the judgment of posterity." ],

Based on interviews with gay men living in Manchester and observation sessions in its ‘gay village,’ I examine what midlife gay men’s body management practices say about the construction of ageing and the discourse of ageism in local gay culture. I focus mainly on moral claims to bodily authenticity, which differentiate midlife gay men from younger or older gay men and indicate the multidirectional operation of gay ageism. Claims to authentic midlife self-presentation and sexual citizenship work in three ways: first, through reproducing ageism, especially a reverse ageism; second by introducing ambivalences that indicate negotiation with gay ageing and ageism; and third, using resources of ageing like ‘ageing capital’ and at times age-related ‘technologies of the self,’ ageism is subverted by critiquing it and re-claiming the value of age." ],

This paper addresses this question by examining the degree to which job accessibility is associated with reduced work travel and how closely retail-service accessibility is correlated with miles and hours logged getting to shopping destinations. Based on data from the San Francisco Bay Area, we find that jobs-housing balance offers the greatest travel reduction benefits, by a substantial margin. Retail accessibility does significantly increase non-motorized travel, which is important given America’s mounting obesity problem. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy measures introduced in California to bring housing, workplaces, and retail centers closer together." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Spiritual but not religious: a phenomenological study of spirituality in the everyday lives of younger women in contemporary Australia", "In current discussions about contemporary forms of spirituality, consideration is given to the question, what is spirituality and to exploring the range of associated beliefs and practices. Common to most discussions is the acknowledgement that the term spirituality is ambiguous and does not represent any one finite quality or thing, but rather, is a wide and somewhat identifiable set of characteristics. Some commentators suggest that contemporary spirituality, characterised by its separation from institutional forms of religion, and represented by the hallmark expression I am spiritual, but not religious, is an increasing phenomenon in Australian society. In view of this, there are several debates about the merits of a spirituality without explicit links to religion (in particular Christian traditions) and whether a personal spirituality can hold any real depth or purpose, or whether it just perpetuates a superficial, narcissistic focus of the self. This kind of critique pays little attention as to how spirituality, and the associated beliefs and practices, are developed and applied in an everyday sense, and how this impacts on the lives of those who subscribe to their own sense of spirituality. \r\n\r\nIn this thesis, I shift the focus from analysing the merits of a personalised spirituality to exploring in depth some of the lay understandings and purposes underlying contemporary forms of spiritual practice. The primary concern of my thesis is to describe this phenomena of spiritual life as experienced by eleven younger Australian women aged 18-38 years inclusive, who considered themselves 'spiritual' women, yet do not necessarily identify with a particular religious denomination. At its core, and as a phenomenological study, the thesis undertakes a theoretical exploration of consciousness and the apprehension and formation of belief, meaning, and identity. Held central, and alongside the phenomenological methodology, is the feminist notion that every woman is the centre of her own experience, that any interpretations and understandings of women's spirituality, must start with the personal. The empirical stages of research therefore focus on an exploration of the women's personal understandings, experiences, interpretations and translations of spirituality to uncover the location and application of spirituality in everyday life. \r\n\r\nA primary factor explored throughout the thesis is the intersection between emotional experiences, meaning and purpose, and notions of spirituality. It is my assertion that grief, crisis and trauma, and the more general emotional experiences arising from everyday life, can be a driving force to embark on an exploration of the spiritual; inform personal constructions of spirituality; and provide a basis for the articulation of that spirituality, with a central purpose of alleviating emotional pain. Thus, my main thesis contention is this 'new' form of spirituality, as experienced and practiced outside of religious institutions, was expressed by the women in this research as a conscious and pragmatic resource applied, and developed in relation to, the various events and experiences of everyday life, and in relation to the ongoing process of developing and locating a sense of self and identity." ],

After a short description of the event of the 1st March 2010 in Italy, the paper focuses on the migrants’ political and discursive opportunity structure. The analysis indicates that the 1st March event and more recent migrants’ strikes have several elements of similarity with other contemporary political movements.

This high-tech market is characterized by numerous cross-border strategic technology collaborations between software and hardware firms. Anchoring our work in interfirm governance theories and the resource-based view, we develop a model and empirically test relationships related to behavioral governance mechanisms, innovation capabilities, and business performance. In the cross-industry and cross-border context, the empirical model explains to what extent complementary strategic resources, through a relational governance mechanism, contribute to the innovation capabilities of high-tech firms, providing competitive advantage. The data, analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling, indicates that technological commitment is a factor in expediting technology resource exchange in ITAs between heterogeneous firms. Technological commitment is captured by the extent to which a focal firm commits to investing its technology resources in an ITA to maintain the relationship. The results also show that firm-level performance is only influenced by market development capability, and not new product development capability, in product innovation. However, we did not find any significant moderating effects of firm size and industry type on the model. This paper offers insights into how high-tech firms benefit from interfirm governance in international technology resource exchange arrangements. Furthermore, it provides evidence of the methodological usefulness of PLS path modeling in strategic alliance, capability and performance research." ],

  "texts" : [ "Simulating Attachment to Pure-Play Fashion Retailers", "The purpose of this thesis is to empirically identify how pure-play fashion retailers can simulate attachment to their websites (through trust, loyalty and purchase intentions) by using different marketing communications media (static product presentation, moving product presentation, guidance and community) to overcome the intangible nature of the online sales environment.The word “simulating” in the title has been chosen due to the nature of the relationship which can exist between a consumer and a pure-play retailer. The word “simulate” means ‘imitate the appearance or character of’ and ‘pretend to have or feel (an emotion)’ (Google a, 2012). A computer facilitates the relationship between a consumer and the pure-play retailer and cannot feel; therefore the relationship cannot exist in a real way and only exists in the eyes of the consumer. Just as a simulator is used for pleasure rides, such as flights or rocket ships, the flight does not exist, but is simulated by a computer and a director who ensures the film starts simultaneously with motion. The same is true for the relationship between a pure-play retailer and a consumer, it is not real, and therefore it is appropriately “simulated”. Descriptive statistics set the scene for a following body of multivariate statistical analysis (EFA, CFA and SEM) using AMOS 16.0. 15 hypothesized relationships are tested after being generated from an extensive literature review. A sample of 688 female young fashion consumers from The University of Manchester participated in this study. There is clear variability in the build up of attachment when a consumer shops for products communicated via different marketing media. Different facets of attachment can be simulated by using static product presentation, moving product presentation and guidance. Community tools can be used to fuel product viewing in rich media and moving formats whilst acting as a discursive platform. Static product presentation has direct relationships with trust and purchase intention, whereas moving product presentations are related to building loyalty. Generalisation of results is limited due to the use of an exclusively female, student sample and the centrality on the UK fashion industry. Further development of the constructs used in this study is needed to further test the conceptual model. This study is one of the first to empirically study pure-play fashion retailing, providing insightful and pragmatic advice by identifying which communication mediums foster enduring relationships with young fashion consumers." ],

While innovations generated by supply channel members, as opposed to individual partners, are playing an increasingly important role in the success of all supply chain partners, there has been limited research on how supply chain relationships cultivate the process of such innovation generation, particularly in emerging markets. Correspondingly, this study explores how multinational suppliers can develop adaptive product innovation to create competitive advantage in emerging markets. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and transaction cost economics, this study investigates the influence of supplier involvement and other factors on supplier innovation and performance. The results of a survey of 170 multinational automobile suppliers in China provide support for most of the hypotheses. Specifically, supplier involvement in co-design has an inverted U-shaped relationship with product innovation. Furthermore, knowledge protection, trust and technological uncertainty are all found to drive greater product innovation. In addition, the institutional environment moderates the effect of product innovation on performance. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how MNEs can acquire local knowledge and develop adaptive products in emerging markets." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Innovations in Transportation: The Case of Telecommuting", "Effective management of travel demand is a growing concern among transportation planners, engineers, local governments and business establishments. Most of the industrialized countries have realized that increasing transport capacity to satisfy travel demand is not a viable option for meeting future needs [AASHTO, 1988]. This realization was the result of growing energy, environmental, and air quality considerations which discouraged the expansion of existing transport systems supply. Transportation consumes 63% of all petroleum used in the United States [EIA, 1988a] and over 70% in California [CEC, 1987]. United States oil imports are forecast to increase from 5.8 million barrels per day in 1987 to between 7.6 and 11.6 million barrels per day by the year 2000 [EIA, 1988b] and the single greatest opportunity for reducing petroleum consumption lies in the transportation sector. On the environmental front, continued reliance on the private automobile continues to raise serious questions about our air quality. In 1987 the Environmental Protection Agency reported that 107 metropolitan areas in the US violated the primary health standard for ozone, carbon monoxide or both [Sperling and Deluchi, 1989]-- 12 of these regions were in California. On-road mobile sources are forecast to to emit 61% of total CO and 47% of NOx (an ozone precursor) in California [CARB, 1988]. Thus, the focus of transportation planning has shifted from the construction of new facilities to the application of efficient travel demand management techniques." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Understanding and managing corporate agency problems", "This dissertation examines the relationships between agency problems and mechanisms that mitigate those problems. The first chapter examines both theoretically and empirically how the quality of firm information disclosure affects shareholders' use of dividend policies to mitigate agency problems. As a first step to induce the manager to behave in the interests of shareholders, managerial compensation is linked to the value of the firm. However, the manager and shareholders are asymmetrically informed. As a result, the manager can manipulate the firm's accounting information through earnings management to increase perceived firm value. This chapter shows how dividends can limit earnings management practices, by adding to the cost faced by a manager who inflates earnings. Dividend payers show less evidence of earnings management and show less evidence of a change in behavior after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), a law that increased financial disclosures. This suggests that dividends had indeed been useful in limiting earnings management. The second chapter analyzes how firms switch between monitoring tools. SOX and contemporaneous changes by NYSE and NASDAQ created minimum requirements on board composition. This chapter analyzes how treated and untreated firms changed other monitoring tools such as CEO ownership, CEO compensation, firm leverage, and dividend policy. The results suggest that independent board members are substitutes for monitoring that comes from CEO ownership and debt. Some evidence is also found that firms forced to create an independent audit committee increased leverage and decreased dividends. The third chapter examines bank dividend policy responses to SOX and the passage of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003 (Tax Reform). Agency models predict that the monitoring from SOX induces firms to lower dividends and that a dividend tax rate decrease induces firms to adopt or increase dividends. I find no evidence of a change in dividend behavior in the banking sector after SOX or after the Tax Reform" ],

OBJECTIVE: To study the longer term outcome for patients referred to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic and then given a non-cardiac diagnosis. METHODS: The study collected retrospective data from a cohort of all patients attending the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic based in the cardiorespiratory Department at the York District Hospital, England. Questionnaires were sent to all patients who attended the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic during the previous 14 months and were diagnosed with non-cardiac chest pain. Participants reported on their chest pain, subsequent episodes of primary and secondary care and their beliefs about causation of pain. RESULTS: Of the patients referred to the Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic, 235 (52%) did not have cardiac chest pain. Of these patients, 161 (69%) returned the questionnaire, nearly half of whom reported ongoing chest pain. The mean time since Clinic attendance was approximately 8 months and the median duration of ongoing chest pain was 5.4 months. Women were twice as likely as men to continue to be experiencing pain but did not report more frequent or severe pain on average. More than 50% of the non-cardiac group were not convinced by their negative cardiac diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There is an ongoing challenge to support patients with non-cardiac chest pain, including the provision of reassurance that their pain is very unlikely to be caused by their heart." ],

As a colony in a world which has already gotten over colonialism, a place such as Guam is a sad exception to the existing multicultural family of nations. In this sense, Guam and places like it are insignificant, and say or mean very little in terms of describing or defining the global order today. They exist to simply be attached to other larger nations, and are defined primarily through powerlessness and dependency. In this dissertation, these relationships and the way they are dominantly articulated today will be challenged and denaturalized. The notions that Guam is an irrelevant effect of the United States, merely a mistake on sovereignty's journey, or a powerless American territory, will be interrogated to reveal their structure. The core of accomplishing this challenge, which amounts to a process of theoretical decolonization, is to re-imagine and re-articulate the meaning of Guam's ambiguous, exceptional status, from one of irrelevance or powerlessness, and reveal the way in which Guam or other sites like it, actually play constitutive roles in producing the powers that claim them. Therefore this dissertation will seek to decolonization the space between Guam and the United States, and Guam and the concept of sovereignty by showing the structure by which Guam potentially sits at the center of American power, and that there are a litany of ways in which its banality, its geography, its coloniality all intersect to constitute the United States, its power, its authority, its might, its sovereignty. Each chapter will represent a different attempt to re-signify that discursive space between Guam and the United States and sovereignty, and to reverse the conventional way in which the space is assumed meaning, and what the tendencies for power and dependency are, or who constitutes who and who is powerful or powerless?" ],

DESIGN: An experimental design with a single between participants factor (actor versus abstainer prototype) was employed. METHOD: Participants in this study were 247 school pupils who completed measures of TPB variables, PWM variables and past behaviour in relation to three health-protective and three health-risk behaviours. RESULTS: Findings indicated that PWM variables accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in behavioural intentions after TPB variables and past behaviour had been taken into account (Mean deltaR2=.05). Perceived similarity to prototypes was the most consistent additional predictor of intention. Actor and abstainer prototypes exhibited equivalent predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The present research suggests that variables from the PWM, especially prototype similarity, enhance the predictive validity of the TPB. The findings also provide new evidence that acquiring the characteristics of both health and risk images may be goals among adolescents and suggest that both healthy and risky prototypes constitute useful cognitive targets for interventions." ],

We show that constitutive and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced generation of soluble Axl (sAxl) involves the activity of disintegrin-like metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Spontaneous and inducible Axl cleavage was inhibited by the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and by hydroxamate GW280264X, which is capable of blocking ADAM10 and ADAM17. Furthermore, murine fibroblasts deficient in ADAM10 expression exhibited a significant reduction in constitutive and inducible Axl shedding, whereas reconstitution of ADAM10 restored sAxl production, suggesting that ADAM10-mediated proteolysis constitutes a major mechanism for sAxl generation in mice. Partially overlapping 14-amino-acid stretch deletions in the membrane-proximal region of Axl dramatically affected sAxl generation, indicating that these regions are involved in regulating the access of the protease to the cleavage site. Importantly, relatively high circulating levels of sAxl are present in mouse sera in a heterocomplex with Axl ligand Gas6. Conversely, two other family members, Tyro3 and Mer, were not detected in mouse sera and conditioned medium. sAxl is constitutively released by murine primary cells such as dendritic and transformed cell lines. Upon immobilization, sAxl promoted cell migration and induced the phosphorylation of Axl and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Thus, ADAM10-mediated generation of sAxl might play an important role in diverse biological processes." ],

  "texts" : [ "Increased dietary cholesterol does not increase plasma low density lipoprotein when accompanied by an energy-restricted diet and weight loss.", "BACKGROUND: Diets enriched with dietary cholesterol, frequently from eggs, have been shown to produce a small but variable increase in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. There is evidence to suggest that energy-restricted diets, that may contain a relatively high proportion of fat and cholesterol, can attenuate the cholesterol-raising effect of dietary cholesterol on plasma LDL. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the combined effects of increased dietary cholesterol and weight loss produced by energy restriction on plasma LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, parallel study was performed in two groups of free-living volunteers on an energy-restricted diet for 12 weeks, one group was instructed to consume two eggs a day (n = 24), the other, to exclude eggs (n = 21). Dietary advice on energy restriction was based on the British Heart Foundation guidelines on how to lose weight for men and women. RESULTS: Energy intake fell by 25 and 29% in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed groups, resulting in a moderate weight loss of 3.4 kg (P < 0.05) and 4.4 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. The daily intake of dietary cholesterol increased significantly in the egg-fed group from 278 to 582 mg after 6 weeks. The concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol decreased in the non-egg-fed groups after 6 weeks (P < 0.01) and in the egg-fed and non-egg-fed at 12 weeks relative to baseline. There were no other significant changes in plasma lipoproteins or LDL particle size. CONCLUSIONS: An increased intake of dietary cholesterol from two eggs a day, does not increase total plasma or LDL cholesterol when accompanied by moderate weight loss. These findings suggest that cholesterol-rich foods should not be excluded from dietary advice to lose weight on account of an unfavorable influence on plasma LDL cholesterol." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A Post Construction Evaluation To Study The Impact of Contractors' Attributes On Construction Project Success", "The success of construction projects is a fundamental issue for most governments, users and communities. In the literature that deals with construction project success and causes of time and cost overruns in the construction industry, there is some literature that highlights the role of contractors in project success. While most studies rank contractors’ success attributes from tendering, prequalification, and a long term historical perception perspective, this research aims to study the impact of contractors’ attributes on project success from a post construction evaluation perspective to identify what went right and what went wrong. In an attempt to understand and investigate this impact, a questionnaire survey is used to establish construction professionals’ perception of critical success factors (CSFs) of contractors that greatly impact on the success of construction projects. Factor analysis reveals nine underlying clusters namely- (i) safety and quality; (ii) past performance; (iii) environment; (iv) management and technical aspects; (v) resources; (vi) presence; (vii) experience; (viii) past projects; and (ix) finance. Logistic regression techniques were used to develop models that predict the probability of project success. Factors such as turnover history, quality policy, adequacy of labour resources, adequacy of plant resources, waste disposal, size of past projects completed, and company image are the most significant factors affecting projects success. Assuming that project success is repeatable; these findings provide a clear understanding of contractors’ performance and could potentially enhance existing knowledge of construction project success." ],

  "title" : "Thread Scheduling Mechanisms for Multiple-Context Parallel Processors",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Thread Scheduling Mechanisms for Multiple-Context Parallel Processors", "Scheduling tasks to efficiently use the  available processor resources is crucial to  minimizing the runtime of applications on  shared-memory parallel processors. One  factor that contributes to poor processor  utilization is the idle time caused by long  latency operations, such as remote memory  references or processor synchronization  operations. One way of tolerating this latency  is to use a processor with multiple hardware  contexts that can rapidly switch to executing  another thread of computation whenever a  long latency operation occurs, thus increasing  processor utilization by overlapping  computation with communication. Although  multiple contexts are effective for tolerating  latency, this effectiveness can be limited by  memory and network bandwidth, by cache  interference effects among the multiple  contexts, and by critical tasks sharing  processor resources with less critical tasks.  This thesis presents techniques that increase  the effectiveness of multiple contexts by  intelligently scheduling threads to make more  efficient use of processor pipeline, bandwidth,  and cache resources. This thesis proposes  thread prioritization as a fundamental  mechanism for directing the thread schedule  on a multiple-context processor. A priority is  assigned to each thread either statically or  dynamically and is used by the thread  scheduler to decide which threads to load in  the contexts, and to decide which context to  switch to on a context switch. We develop a  multiple-context model that integrates both  cache and network effects, and shows how  thread prioritization can both maintain high  processor utilization, and limit increases in  critical path runtime caused by multithreading.  The model also shows that in order to be  effective in bandwidth limited applications,  thread prioritization must be extended to  prioritize memory requests. We show how  simple hardware can prioritize the running of  threads in the multiple contexts, and the  issuing of requests to both the local memory  and the network. Simulation experiments  show how thread prioritization is used in a  variety of applications. Thread prioritization  can improve the performance of  synchronization primitives by minimizing the  number of processor cycles wasted in  spinning and devoting more cycles to critical  threads. Thread prioritization can be used in  combination with other techniques to improve  cache performance and minimize cache  interference between different working sets in  the cache. For applications that are critical  path limited, thread prioritization can improve  performance by allowing processor resources  to be devoted preferentially to critical threads.  These experimental results show that thread  prioritization is a mechanism that can be used  to implement a wide range of scheduling  policies." ],

The speed and power consumption of 3D NoC are compared to that of 2D NoC. Physical constraints, such as the maximum number of planes that can be vertically stacked and the asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical communication channels of the network, are included in speed and power consumption models of these novel 3D structures. An analytic model for the zero-load latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network. A performance improvement of 40% and 36% and a decrease of 62% and 58% in power consumption is demonstrated for 3D NoC as compared to a traditional 2D NoC topology for a network size of N = 128 and N = 256 nodes, respectively." ],

Many Candida species representing oral microbiota have been shown to be capable of marked acetaldehyde production. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of various sugar alcohols and sugars on microbial acetaldehyde production. The study hypothesis was that xylitol could reduce the amount of acetaldehyde produced by Candida. Laboratory and clinical isolates of seven Candida species were selected for the study. The isolates were incubated in 12 mM ethanol and 110 mM glucose, fructose or xylitol at 37°C for 30 min and the formed acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. Xylitol significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced the amount of acetaldehyde produced from ethanol by 84%. In the absence of xylitol, the mean acetaldehyde production in ethanol incubation was 220.5 μM and in ethanol-xylitol incubation 32.8 μM. This was found to be mediated by inhibition of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Coincubation with glucose reduced the amount of produced acetaldehyde by 23% and coincubation with fructose by 29%. At concentrations that are representative of those found in the oral cavity during the intake of proprietary xylitol products, xylitol was found to reduce the production of carcinogenic acetaldehyde from ethanol by Candida below the mutagenic level of 40-100 μM." ],

Besides all the good memories associated with these posters, they indeed involve the history of Turkish cinema, graphic design as well as Turkish society. The great deal of labour involved, resulting from the poor resources of the period; design elements, typography, composition, the mistakes; all reflect the characteristics of then-Yeşilçam. Going over an archive of posters and with the help of interviews with designers, cinema historians and labourers, the article focuses on the relationship of design with the industry, technology and society.</p>\n<p>\nThe Yeşilçam movie posters are analyzed through the methods of iconography as well as reception theory. And therefore as well as exploring their graphic and visual characteristics they would be placed in the context of the social life, the conditions of the movie industry in Turkey, the character of Yeşilçam Melodrama and evolution of Turkish movie poster. </p>\n<p>\nAfter a detailed research and observation, four categories are revealed as the most frequently seen types among the Turkish melodrama posters, according to the kind of images in relation to specific themes and concepts and the design schemas they use. These are “star posters”, “beefcake posters”, “phallic woman posters”, and “posters of movement”.

The research material consists of outdoor advertisements photographed in their actual exhibition places in a city environment. Outdoor advertising media, which are used to communicate visual messages from a sender to several addressees, participate in building the visual city culture and open manifold solutions in design. The visual language used in the research material is analyzed in order to find out how advertising messages, their denotations and connotations, are constructed and how arguments used for persuasion are visualized. </p>\n<p>\nThe first analysis is based on the knowledge and methods used in graphic design practice, which has been defined to be the process of making, choosing and arranging marks in order to convey a message. The analysis shows that different modes, techniques and visual elements are applied to attract the attention of spectators and arouse interest towards the message of an artefact. The second analysis is based on communication studies and semiotics, especially on Roman Jakobson’s theory about the functions of communication. The method of combining two analyses reveals different ways of using visual language and syntaxes to announce the excellence of an advertised product, service or subject. It also shows various types of visual arguments used in advertisements. Three types of visual rhetoric emerge from the research material. They are called brand rhetoric, personalized rhetoric and poetic rhetoric. </p>\n<p>\nThe taxonomy of visual rhetoric exemplifies how visual language can be constructed and used for persuasion. It shows that the decisions in design influence the messages and meanings created. The research calls for further studies as regards the reception of visual rhetoric and suggests that the taxonomy of visual rhetoric could be applied in visual communication design and in the analysis of advertising messages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nOutdoor Advertisement/Advertising; Visual Rhetoric; Visual Language; Graphic Design; Visual Communication Design; Advertising Message</p>" ],

That is, the class of market makers that could adjust their liquidity levels according to market activities. Towards this goal, we first give a formal definition of <italic>liquidityadaptation,</italic>. that captures this intuition. Then, building on the ideas from \\cite{ACV11,ACV12} and \\cite{OS11}, we introduce a framework for the design of duality-based marker makers that enjoy liquidity adaptation as well as other desired properties. We will show that in return for liquidity adaptation, we must trade off information accuracy. A detailed discussion about this trade-off then follows. We will also define <italic>asymptotic profit rate</italic> that represent the ability of the market to make a profit in a long run. Finally we discuss the design of \\emph{optimal market} that maximize worst case liquidity level given information accuracy and profit rate requirements." ],

Regional differencties, in a public healthcare system.", "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate regional differences in and risk factors for admission, length of stay, mortality, and readmission for community-acquired pneumonia in elderly Danish patients. METHODS: National registry study on elderly Danish citizens with an acute admission in 2009 owing to community-acquired pneumonia. We studied differences among hospitals in length of stay, in-hospital mortality, mortality within 30 days of discharge, and readmission within 30 days after discharge using Cox regression models with adjustments for age, sex, ventilatory support, and co-morbidity by Charlson's index score. RESULTS: A total of 11,332 elderly citizens were admitted with community-acquired pneumonia. Mortality during admission and 30-days from discharge were 11.6% and 16.2%, respectively. Readmission rates within 30 days of discharge were 12.3%. There were significantly differences between hospitals in length of stay. A high Charlson index score and advanced age were significantly risk factors for death during admission and within 30 days of discharge. Male sex and high Charlson index score were significant risk factors for readmission. Admission to large bed capacity hospital was a significant risk factor for death and readmission within 30 days of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Length of stay, rate of admission, mortality and readmission in elderly Danish patients with community-acquired pneumonia follows international findings. There are regional differences between hospitals. In depth investigation in regional differences could reveal potential feasible clinical interventions with an improvement of readmission-, mortality rates and cost." ],

Health Information Technology (HIT) may serve this purpose; however, the effectiveness of such tools is not known. We conducted a small-scale randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an adapted web-based alcohol assessment and intervention tool among low-income, non-pregnant women of reproductive age who were receiving WIC services in San Diego County and who reported currently drinking in a binge pattern. A total of 150 binge-drinking participants completed a web-based assessment and were randomly assigned to either receive a personalized feedback intervention or general health information about alcohol consumption and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Follow-Up assessments on reported alcohol consumption were conducted via telephone at 1- and 2-months post baseline. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 44 and were predominately Hispanic/Latina (44%). At baseline, all respondents reported consuming >̲ 3 standard drinks on >̲ 1 occasion in the previous month. Outcome was available for 131 participants. The main outcome measure was reduction in number of risky drinking occasions, and did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, (OR 1.200, 95% CI 0.567-2.539, p = 0.634). However, over 70% of the participants reported a reduction in risky drinking occasions regardless of treatment condition (Control 43/63, 68%; Experimental 49/68, 72%). Furthermore, after controlling for confounding in a multivariate hierarchical logistic regression model, the estimate of treatment effect reached borderline significance (OR 2.922, 95% CI 0.991-8.613, p = 0.052). The results of the present study demonstrate that web-based assessment of alcohol consumption among low-income women of reproductive age, as represented by WIC clients, is feasible and acceptable. The findings also suggest that detailed and interactive assessments of alcohol consumption may be sufficient for the reduction of risky drinking within this population and personalized feedback may provide additional benefits for some individuals" ],

  "title" : "Three Empirical Essays on Bank Accounting",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three Empirical Essays on Bank Accounting", "This thesis presents new empirical evidence on three important aspects of financial reporting by banks. The thesis consists of an introductory chapter that explains how the three issues are related to each other, three empirical chapters and a final summary chapter. The first empirical chapter studies the effects of accounting conservatism on the pricing of syndicated bank loans. I provide evidence that banks more timely in loss recognition charge higher spreads for the same loan provision. I go on to consider what happens to this relationship during the financial crisis. During the crisis, banks more timely in loss recognition increase their spreads to a lesser extent than banks less timely in loss recognition. The policy implication is that banks more timely in loss recognition exhibit more prudent and less pro-cyclical debt pricing behaviour. The second empirical chapter examines the relationship between the value relevance of fair value gains and losses and bank risk in an international bank sample. One possibility is that, as risk increases, the scope for subjectivity in fair value estimates increases thereby potentially rendering the numbers less useful. However another possibility is that the relevance of faithfully reported fair value gains and losses increases as risk increases. The study provides evidence that the value relevance of fair value gains and losses is positively associated with bank risk prior to the crisis. During the crisis there is also evidence of a similar positive relationship, but it is not possible to draw firm conclusions for reasons discussed in the chapter. My research also shows that the fair value gains and losses of banks that elect to use the fair value option for assets that could have been accounted for using amortized costs are more value relevant and persistent. This study provides information to policy makers on the situations when fair values are most useful to investors. The third empirical chapter examines if the market rationally prices the loan loss provisions, and the reported fair value gains and losses of US banks. The chapter models the discretionary components of loan loss provisions and fair value gains and losses, and tests if the discretionary components are priced differently from their non-discretionary counterparts. The results provide little evidence that the market misprices operating cash flows, non-discretionary loan loss provisions, or fair value gains and losses (discretionary or otherwise). However there is evidence of significant mispricing of discretionary loan loss provisions. The lack of evidence on the mispricing of fair value gains and losses is consistent with the finding on the value relevance of fair value gains and losses in the second empirical chapter." ],

We decompose total accruals into working capital accruals, long-term investment and non-transaction accruals to test whether the investment can explain the accruals anomalies and behavior in operating and investment cycle. We use the financial information of 135 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2005 to 2011 through OLS approach and find that long-term investment and non-transaction accruals are able to predict subsequent net income and free cash flow. Whereas, working capital accruals do not have this ability. To predict subsequent ROA, the persistence of total accruals, Long-term investment and external financing decrease in longer operating cycle. Total accruals are more persistent and non-transaction accruals and external financing are less persistent in the longer investment cycle. Total accruals and external financing are inversely related to subsequent returns, implying that accruals anomalies as well as external financing anomalies exist in our sample. To predict future returns, the persistence of total accruals and working capital accruals decrease, however, the persistence of external financing and non-transaction accruals and long-term investment increase in longer operating cycle. Total accruals and non-transaction accruals are more persistent and working capital accruals and long-term investment are less persistent in longer investment cycle, but the persistence of external financing is not related to investment cycle.</p" ],

International airport hubs are comprised of a network of interlinked corridors where large transient populations are received, held and then dispersed again. The medical tourist is a product of the rapidly increasing cost and specialization associated with medical treatment procedures. Recognizing that the density of airport hubs now rivals that of contemporary city centers, this project expands the capacity of the international airport hub, thus enabling the airport to compete for citizens in a manner similar to cities. \n\nAs one iteration of a potential airport expansion system that could serve multiple mobile citizen types, this project exploits the security requirements of an existing airport and an innovative program to hypothesize a new type of airport terminal." ],

The integral elastic cross section exhibits three sharp peaks that are nominally shape resonances associated with trapping in the vacant pi* molecular orbitals. Although the two lowest-energy resonances do in fact prove to be nearly pure single-channel shape resonances, the third contains a considerable admixture of core-excited character, and accounting for this channel coupling effect is essential to obtaining an accurate resonance energy. Such resonant channel coupling has implications for electron interactions with the DNA bases, especially the pyrimidine bases for which pyrazine is a close analog. In the absence of data on pyrazine itself, we compare our elastic differential cross section to measurements on benzene and find close agreement." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Apoptosis, intrinsic radiosensitivity and prediction of radiotherapy response in cervical carcinoma", "Apoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in tumours and it is seen both prior to and following radiotherapy. In this study patients with proven carcinoma of the cervix had measurement made of the percentage of apoptotic cells (apoptotic index or AI) in pre-therapy biopsies. Measurements of intrinsic radiosensitivity (SF2), already shown to be a predictor of outcome, had previously been made on the same pre-therapy biopsies. Mitotic index (MI) and Ki-67 antigen staining were also recorded as markers for proliferation. Patients were divided into those with an AI above or below the median and in general increasing apoptosis was associated with poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for tumours with an AI below the median was 79% and was significantly greater than the rate of 47% for those with an AI above the median (p = 0.003). There was also a significantly increased 5-year local recurrence-free rate for patients with an AI below the median compared with those with an AI above the median (79 versus 61%, p = 0.012). In addition, AI and SF2 acted as independent prognostic indicators. Patients with both an SF2 and AI value above the median did badly (25% 5-year survival, 46% local control) compared with those with an SF2 and AI below the median (80% 5-year survival, 100% local control). Apoptosis showed correlation with MI (n = 66, r = 0.34, p = 0.002) and cell staining for the Ki-67 antigen (n = 57, r = 0.25, p = 0.03), but neither MI nor Ki-67 were related to patient outcome. This suggests that while apoptosis may be a reflection of tumour proliferation this cannot in itself explain the ability of apoptosis to predict clinical outcome for this series of patients. The study raises the possibility of AI and SF2 being used together as predictors of tumour response to radiotherapy." ],

This checklist was used in the analysis of\r\nprinciples appearing in 1346 biology and biology-related articles from\r\n671 issues of 15 publications for the year 1967. The publications were\r\nselected to represent all segments of society.\r\nData concerning articles, principles, biology-related social\r\nproblems, and biology topics were analyzed by means of frequencies\r\nand descriptive percentages and are summarized as follows:\r\n1. All the publications surveyed were found to contain biology or\r\nbiology-related articles.\r\n2. One hundred ninety-one of the 195 biological principles in the\r\nchecklist appeared in the articles surveyed. Twenty-two appeared\r\n100 times or more, fifteen appeared 70-99 times, and\r\nfifteen 50-69 times.\r\n3. The greatest frequency of 435 was noted for the principle,\r\n\"Plant and animal diseases are caused by numerous physical\r\nand chemical factors and by various parasitic organisms.\"\r\n4. Of the six areas of biology represented in the checklist, the\r\n46 principles of ecology received the greatest emphasis in the\r\nnews with 45.9 percent and morphology the least with 2.5 percent. 5. Eleven biology-related social problems were identified in 460\r\nof the news articles. Ecology principles received 66.6 percent\r\nof the emphasis and physiology 22.7 percent.\r\n6. News articles other than those concerning biology-related social\r\nproblems were grouped under nine biology topics or classifications.\r\nThose receiving greatest emphasis were applied\r\nbiology (predominantly health and disease) with 331 or 30.9\r\npercent of the articles and animal life (predominantly mammals\r\nand birds) with 217 or 20.3 percent.\r\n7. The BSCS texts were analyzed for the presence, location, and\r\nemphasis of the biological principles appearing most frequently\r\nin the public press. None of the principles were omitted in the\r\nthree texts. The Yellow and Green versions gave the 100 most\r\nfrequent principles in the news the most emphasis.\r\nThe following conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) The\r\npublic press does include many biology and biology-related articles\r\nwhich contain many of the basic principles of biology; and (2) There\r\nis a close relationship between biological principles found in articles\r\nof the public press and those stressed in the modern type introductory\r\nbiology texts surveyed in this study." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "(Neo-) Polanyian perspectives on Technology-Economy relations", "This article explores some enduring themes in Karl Polany’s work with particular attention to his life-long concern with the subject Freedom. In contrast to the dominant focus on Economy-Society relations, which perhaps results from disproportionate attention contemporary Polanyi scholars pay to his seminal work The Great Transformation (TGT); this paper calls for a broader thematic analysis of Polany’s life-work spanning concerns of Freedom-Society-Technology-Economy, and their inter-relations. These themes are visible in his writing from the 1920s to the early 1960s but were explicitly brought together in a normative critique that Polanyi and Rotstein began but never finished, in a book they had entitled Freedom and Technology. Polanyi expressed the concern that modern technologies have the capacity to ‘numb’ society because of their ubiquitous nature – the combination of omnipresence and invisibility. Technological Civilisation is the outcome of a set of conditions whereupon humanity is so submerged within the affective powers of mass technology, that there is a corresponding mass-desensitisation to its powers. But he was not anti-technology. Technology brings benefits as well as threats to society. What concerns Polanyi from a normative standpoint, is that technologies enable human relationships (in particular relations of economic organisation) to be conducted  beyond the ‘human’ scale. At the same time actors immersed in these relationships are dehumanised. The mode of organising and facilitating the relationship overtakes the original purpose, meaning, and understanding of it. The consequence of dual expansion, namely technological expansion and expansion of economic organisation - indeed as a result of each providing the means for the expansion of the other – is that original logics of human wellbeing are lost. A particular expression of Technology-Economy relations takes over, mediated by the rationales of Technical Agencies. We add that a series of dialectical double movements are evident, beyond the market-society double movement that Polanyi puts forward in TGT. The paper illustrates these ideas in the contemporary case of designing a system of exchanges in order to trade in permits and credits of greenhouse gas emissions known collectively as ‘carbon markets’. The paper finishes by offering some preliminary (Polanyi-inspired) theoretical reflections on the notion of technologising processes." ],

  "texts" : [ "Romancing race and gender : intermarriage and the making of a 'modern subjectivity' in colonial Korea, 1910-1945", "This dissertation investigates the discourse and representation of interracial marriage and transnational romance through an examination of popular texts and colonial policies during the Japanese colonial era in Korea (1910-1945). For the colonial ruler, the unusual promotion of interracial marriages between the colonizer and colonized (Japanese and Koreans), which was a part of an assimilation policy, could act as a means to demonstrate the benevolence of the Japanese Empire and encourage Koreans to advance into full imperial citizens. For the colonized people, it might have started as a subjugating colonial project, but then it presented the possibility of becoming much-desired modern subjects, thus it changed construction of \"modern subjectivity\" and further complicating understandings of race, gender, and sexuality in everyday life. This dissertation traces how an assimilative colonial state program - the promotion of intermarriage between Koreans and Japanese - turned into diverse discourses that impacted public discourses and literary representations of racial and gender norms. The dissertation is organized into four chapters. The first sketches the historical context of interracial marriage between Koreans and Japanese. The remaining chapters focus on analyzing popular texts and contextualizing them within particular issues surrounding intermarriage and romance, such as the construction of domesticity in intermarriage texts (Chapter Two), the representation of international marriage and modern home in popular print culture (Chapter Three), and race and gender in encountering others at the end of the colonial era (Chapter Four). In conclusion, this dissertation aims to unveil the influence of colonial intimacy and articulations of race and gender discourses in the making of a \"modern subjectivity\" in Korea in the time of Japanese empire-building. It contributes to the growing discussion of modern colonialism and imperialism by examining the everyday life of colonized territories and how colonized people understood, articulated, and manipulated colonial discourse" ],

The literature review systematically explores research that has examined changes in attachment representations during psychological therapy. The purpose of the review is to enhance understanding of change processes in adult attachment and to provide empirical support to the premises of attachment theory. In spite of inconsistencies with regards to measurement and conceptualisation of attachment, the evidence suggests that attachment security increases during therapy, whereas insecurity decreases.The aim of the empirical paper was to examine the association between global adult attachment representations, specific attachment to the therapist, working alliance and response to individual Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT). The study also investigated changes in global attachment representations and their relationship with outcome. The results indicated that clients with greater secure attachment to the therapist showed greater improvements in symptoms, whereas clients with higher avoidant-fearful attachment to the therapist demonstrated less improvement. Significant improvements in attachment avoidance and anxiety were also associated with improvements in psychological symptoms, as was working alliance. No associations between adult global attachment and outcome were found. In paper 3, the approaches used within the current thesis are evaluated in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed and ideas for future research are outlined." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The determinants of FDI distribution across manufacturing activities in an Asian industrialising country: a case of Japanese FDI in Thailand", "This research identifies and investigates the 'industry-level determinants' of FDI in the context of Asian industrialising countries by using the data on Japanese foreign direct investment in Thailand. It differs from previous empirical studies for non-industrialised countries in three important aspects. Firstly, the previous studies (e. g. Lall and Mohammad, 1983) focus on the determinants of FDI in terms of monopolistic characteristics of industries in which foreign firms operate (e.g. technological intensities and scale economies). The present study, on the other hand, examines the influences of locational-specific characteristics of host industries such as factor endowments, trade costs, and policy factors. More distinctively, it examines the effects of vertical (input-output) linkages among Japanese firms. These effects have rarely been investigated in the context of Asian industrialising countries. Thirdly, it constructs the highly disaggregated data on FDI (4-digit ISIC level), using a broad range of information gathered from various published sources. Such data allow the present analysis to examine in detail the 'pattern' and 'determinants' of FDI distribution across segmented stages of manufacturing production rather than broadly defined industrial sectors.\r\n\r\nOn analysing descriptively the manufacturing distribution of FDI, it was found that Japanese FDI in Thailand was not evenly distributed across manufacturing activities. Some capital- / technology-intensive industries like rail equipment (ISIC 3842) and aircraft (ISIC 3845) did not receive (or host) any FDI during a specified period (1954-1995). On the other hand, other relatively labour-intensive industries like TV, radio, and communication equipment industry (ISIC 3832) and motor vehicle industry (ISIC 3843) received disproportionately large values of FDI. Based on the locational approach to the determinants of FDI in non-industrialised countries, several hypotheses were formulated and quantitatively tested by using cross-sectional data (1985,1990, and 1995). The empirical findings lend strong and consistent support to the postulated hypotheses. It is to be hoped that these empirical findings will not only enhance our understanding of the industry-level determinants of FDI in the context of Asian industrialising countries but also stimulate further work on this line of research." ],

  "texts" : [ "Essays on Foreign Direct Investment, Growth and the Environment", "This dissertation is composed of three essays on the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on productivity growth, convergence, and the environment. Chapter 2 decomposes labor productivitygrowth into components attributable to technological change, technological catch-up, foreign capital deepening, domestic capital deepening, and human capital accumulation, thus separating the effects of foreign and domestic capital deepening on productivity growth and convergence. We apply nonparametric production-frontier methods to a worldwide 1980--2005 panel and find that (1) foreign capital accumulation, together with human capital accumulation, is the driving force for productivity growth and increasing international dispersion of productivity, (2) technological change is decidedly non-neutral, with most technologicaladvancement taking place in foreign-capital-intensive countries, and (3) international polarization is brought about primarily by efficiency changes.Chapter 3 develops a statistical procedure to select the appropriatenonparametric efficiency model in terms of its dimensionality. The change of dimensionality is categorized into three cases: nested variable changes (expansion or contraction of a variable set), additive variable changes (aggregation or disaggregation of a variable set) and other non-nested model changes. A bootstrapping method is proposed to measure the size of the dimensionalityeffect. Potential bias in raw efficiency scores owing to the dimensionality effect is corrected to reflect true efficient levels. An empirical illustration is presented with the Hughes and Yaisawarng (2004) (hereafter HY) data set.Using U.S. state-level panel data from 1980--1994, chapter 4 estimates the impact of environmental stringency on the inflows of FDI in the U.S. The stringency of environmental policy is an uncontrollable variable in the operating environment. A  three-stage model is proposed to evaluate state performance with environmental variables and reassess the pollution haven hypothesis. The three-stage model combines both data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), and can isolate the impact of luck (statistical noise) from those of managerial efficiency and environmental effect. This paper improves the second stageSFA evaluation by using the Local Linear Least Squares (LLLS) estimator. The empirical result suggests a negative relationship between state-level environment standards and the distribution of foreign capital in the U.S." ],

This approach assumes that individuals, if offered an opportunity, are likely to reduce their travel. It also assumes that accessibility-enhancing land-use changes will increase transit and non-motorized trips in lieu of automobile usage. However, there are numerous indications that people engage in excess travel and are not necessarily inclined to reduce it. This paper presents a number of hypotheses on the reasons for excess travel and the relationships among attitudes toward travel and responses to accessibility-enhancing strategies. It suggests that different market segments are likely to respond to policy measures in different ways. In particular, if a large segment of the population prefers mobility over the reduced travel offered by accessibility improvements, then such policies will be less effective than anticipated." ],

It helps to minimize the project- and product-related risks such as project budget and schedule overrun, or missing product cost and quality targets. Risk management is especially important for complex, international product design projects that involve a high degree of novel technology. This paper reviews the literature on risk management in product design. It examines the newly released international standard ISO 31000 “Risk management — Principles and guidelines” and explores its applicability to product design. The new standard consists of the seven process steps communication and consultation; establishing the context; risk identification; risk analysis; risk evaluation; risk treatment; and monitoring and review. A literature review reveals, among other findings, that the general ISO 31000 process model seems applicable to risk management in product design; the literature addresses different process elements to varying degrees, but none fully according to ISO recommendations; and that the integration of product design risk management with risk management of other disciplines, or between project and portfolio level in product design, is not well developed." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Synthetic studies toward the pladienolide and spirohexenolide natural products", "Actinomycetes are microbes found in terrestrial soil and marine sediment that produce a rich variety of secondary metabolites. These natural products have diverse biological activity including antifungal, insecticidal, antibacterial, and antitumor activities. Although in most cases we can only speculate why the producer microbes make these natural products, they have been in use throughout human history. Some of these secondary metabolites and their semi-synthetic derivatives have proven to be indispensible to modern medicine, and others are highly desirable for non-essential uses such as food additives, fragrances and dyes. Our laboratory became interested in the actinomycetes produced pladienolide natural products when they were originally reported due to their potent antitumor activity and unique cell-cycle arrest profile. The novel assay used in their discovery, and the reported biological data indicated that these natural products probably had a unique mechanism of action against tumor cells. Herein is described research toward the synthesis and structural elucidation of the pladienolides and their close structural relative FD-895. This research was accompanied by efforts to isolate authentic samples of the pladienolides from their producer organism, Streptomyces platensis MER 11107. These efforts led to the isolation and structural elucidation of novel spirotetronate polyketides from this organism, the spirohexenolides. Chapter 1 describes attempts toward the synthesis of the core macrolactone ring of the pladienolides and FD-895, the synthesis of the sidechain of FD-895, and the synthesis of two models of FD-895 which demonstrate the feasibility of our end-game strategy toward this family of natural products. Chapter 2 describes the isolation efforts directed toward the pladienolides, and the isolation and structural elucidation of the spirohexenolides. An intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) approach to (±) - spirohexenolide A, and a Lewis-acid catalyzed Diels-Alder approach to (±) - spirohexenolide B are described" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Effects of financing on the investment of Dutch SMEs during the financial crisis", "This study investigates the effect of the recent financial crisis on the investment of Dutch SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). Precisely, the focus is on the availability of internal finance and external finance of Dutch SMEs and their effect on the investments during the recent financial crisis. It is hypothesized that, investments of SMEs declined significantly during the financial crisis due to the supply shock of external finance (bank credit) and less cash flows generated by SMEs because of sluggish economic condition. It is also hypothesized that, during the financial crisis internal finance (cash flows) would determine more investment than the external finance (bank credit). Because cash flows become a distinct source of investment than the external finance due to market imperfections. As Dutch SMEs are more dependent on banks for the external sources of finance, financial crisis would affect their business activity negatively. To investigate the effect of financial crisis, finance and investment related data of Dutch SMEs are collected over the period of 2004-2012. SMEs are classified by the European commission definition. Firms are included which are active during the sample period. Financial institutions, nonprofit and government firms are excluded due to the nature of the study. The final sample consists of 2,890 investment observations. In this study unbalanced panel data have been used. OLS regression model has been implied to investigate the effect of financing (i.e. cash flows and bank credit) on the investment during the financial crisis. In all of the regressions, industry dummy has been used to control the individual industry effects. Besides, size, age, growth opportunity are used as control variables. \r\n\r\nThe results suggest that the financial crisis has induced a negative credit supply shock which adversely affected the investment of private SMEs in the Netherlands. The results further highlight that, the financial crisis has weakened the supply of short term bank finance and long term bank finance to Dutch SMEs. Overall, the results suggest that investment of private Dutch SMEs are vulnerable to variations in the supply of bank credit which may have long-term implications for the survival and growth of these firms, which in turn might have a negative effect in the economy. The findings show that, bank credit determined more investment during the financial crisis than any other financing source. The results signify that a financial crisis may restrict the SMEs ability to finance investment, which would in turn affect the growth while this may not be a matter of concern in normal state of the economy" ],

The research is undertaken in the context of a large, rural Local Authority and is related to the broad theme of cognition and learning in children and young people.   The researcher adopts a Q-methodology to consider the subjective and collective viewpoints of educational psychologists in the Local Authority with regard to dyslexia and using factor analysis to process the data, three distinct viewpoints emerged.  The literature review included in the thesis seeks to provide an overview of the research base which underpins formative assessment practices in educational settings in the UK.  The importance of the role of teacher feedback in classroom learning is illustrated through meta-analyses research and studies.  Formative assessment is considered in the review within the conceptual framework of constructivist learning theory.  The role of pupil feedback in a junior classroom is then explored in a qualitative research study using a collaborative action research methodology.  Thematic analysis is used to analyse the textual data from interviews with the participant teacher.  The action research methodology was an effective model to enable the teacher to effect change in her practice.  The three papers are set within an organisational context in the thesis, current challenges for the profession are summarised and many examples are given of the role and importance of research in the work of an educational psychologist.    Implications for further research within the profession of educational psychology are suggested." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Meaning making in a college mathematics lecture format : the intersection of mathematics, language, and cultural meaning systems", "Students and teachers use language to communicate mathematical knowledge and understanding. This communication is compounded by the underlying requirement for students to acquire language with specialized meaning and to have facility with this meaning as a member of a mathematics discourse community. The lecture format is a long-standing means of communicating knowledge in the university mathematics classroom. Instructors and students approach the mathematics classroom with cultural meaning systems that contain diverse and divergent assumptions, histories, personalities, and social and cultural norms. The instructor assembles a lecture from a perspective that includes a deep understanding of mathematics that may not match the perspective and mathematical knowledge of the student audience. Given the multiple and complex concepts in mathematics, assigning a precise meaning can be difficult for students, producing a high likelihood that connotation, implication, and relevance can be confused. Even with precise mathematical definitions, students' interpretation of the meaning of a definition being taught is very much dependent on the precision with which the student assigns connotation, implication, and relevance to each symbol, picture, metaphor and word within the framework of the definition. This study examines the question of how students assign meaning to terms in the mathematics register and how these assigned meanings determine the ways in which students understand mathematical concepts. The students in this study are drawn from a college-level remedial mathematics course. The depth of students' pre-existing knowledge of mathematics determined the complexity and breadth of their current meaning-making. The students' use of language and meaning in an \"everyday\" context influenced the ways meaning was assigned to terms in the mathematics register and the lack of precision in understanding and assigning mathematical meanings. The subtle variations in meanings and the seemingly reasonable connections students made to arrive at these meanings suggests instructors need to take cultural meanings that students bring to the classroom into account when teaching the mathematics course. Instructional planning should include ways for instructors to decipher previous student meaning-making about and understanding of mathematical concepts in order to correct students' misunderstandings and to help students develop more precise meanings assigned to terminology and concepts." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Rethinking the objectivity of ethics", "Commonsense says that morality is objective. But skeptics deny that the normativity and fallibility that characterize this objectivity really exist. I disagree. I develop an account of moral facts that vindicates the objectivity of ethics. Moreover, I do this without relying on either the strong foundational claims of realism and constructivism, or the revisionary logic of expressivism. Instead, I build from a moral psychology that is modest and familiar--one that focuses on the distinctive, but well-known, anxiety that is provoked when we make a moral judgment. Drawing on empirical work, I argue that this anxiety is a universal feature of our social-psychological lives, one we've developed to promote social cohesion. Moral anxiety does this by altering our orientation to others: we become more sensitive to the consequences that our actions can have, and so tend to avoid them if we find that they are not justified. I argue further that this picture of the role that moral anxiety serves points to a broadly teleological account of moral facts: moral facts are the upshot of a validation procedure that alleviates moral anxiety in a manner consistent with the function that it serves. I then develop an account of the form of validity that is constitutive of moral facts. I argue that because moral anxiety is provoked by unease about the legitimacy of one's moral judgment, it will be properly alleviated only if that judgment (i) is not based on false non-moral beliefs, and (ii) uses principles that correctly assess the situations of those affected by the conflict in question. I argue that what counts as p̀roperly assessing the situation of the affected parties' is subjectively fixed in the sense that it is the upshot of what one would defend, on reflection and when pressed, given a motivation to resolve moral conflict in a manner that preserves social cohesion. Despite its subjective nature, my proposal captures the objectivity of ethics: fallibility is possible since the judgments we actually make can come apart from those that we would defend; normativity is explained by the sensitizing effects of moral anxiety" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Transmission and Performance:  Memory, Heritage, and Authenticity in Korean Mask Dance Dramas", "In this dissertation I explore the effects of the Republic of Korea's Cultural Property Protection Law (1962). Faced with decreased interest in traditional arts, many governments have instituted well-intentioned but unavoidably bureaucratic protection efforts; these policies can potentially turn once-vibrant and ever-evolving art forms into stale, taxidermized re-enactments. Although the Cultural Property Protection Law has been widely praised and even imitated, ethnographic research into arts transmission reveals complications. I conducted the research that informs this eleven-chapter dissertation between 2004 and 2011 including over three years of intense participant-observation. Methods included learning and performing half a dozen Korean arts, structured and open interviews and an examination of relevant documents. The dissertation utilizes the lenses of heritage, authenticity and memory to examine transmission of the Korean performing arts. In the dissertation I develop an understanding of transmission in the pedagogical and performance context for three Korean mask dance dramas: Songpa Sandae Noli, Bongsan Talchum and Goseong Ogwangdae. This understanding builds a comprehensive portrait of how heritage legislation impacts the transmission of performing arts knowledge. Through this dissertation I contribute to discussions of intangible heritage on three fronts: first, the impact of global and transnational cultural flows in Korea and on traditional culture; second, the ossification of traditional arts after preservation programs are established; and third, the way memory, heritage and authenticity are constructed, maintained and negotiated through the arts." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Mass fractionation of noble gases in synthetic methane hydrate : implications for naturally occurring gas hydrate dissociation", "As a consequence of contemporary or longer term (since 15 ka) climate warming, gas hydrates in some settings may presently be dissociating and releasing methane and other gases to the ocean–atmosphere system. A key challenge in assessing the impact of dissociating gas hydrates on global atmospheric methane is the lack of a technique able to distinguish between methane recently released from gas hydrates and methane emitted from leaky thermogenic reservoirs, shallow sediments (some newly thawed), coal beds, and other sources. Carbon and deuterium stable isotopic fractionation during methane formation provides a first-order constraint on the processes (microbial or thermogenic) of methane generation. However, because gas hydrate formation and dissociation do not cause significant isotopic fractionation, a stable isotope-based hydrate-source determination is not possible. Here, we investigate patterns of mass-dependent noble gas fractionation within the gas hydrate lattice to fingerprint methane released from gas hydrates. Starting with synthetic gas hydrate formed under laboratory conditions, we document complex noble gas fractionation patterns in the gases liberated during dissociation and explore the effects of aging and storage (e.g., in liquid nitrogen), as well as sampling and preservation procedures. The laboratory results confirm a unique noble gas fractionation pattern for gas hydrates, one that shows promise in evaluating modern natural gas seeps for a signature associated with gas hydrate dissociation.This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

However, access to this information by visually impaired people is limited due to the Web's visual complexity that implicitly helps sighted users understand and interact with the page content. A variety of usability and accessibility studies show that complicated Web page structure depends on the page composition and layout. During our research we will identify how Web page structural elements, including links, text, and images, interact with each other to produce a visually complex page. In addition we will determine whether pages that sighted users identify as visually complex are complex for visually impaired users as well. ViCRAM is a project that will contribute to the Web Accessibility area by facilitating visually impaired users. We will study sighted users's behaviour and eye movement while interacting with a Web page to elicit their implicit knowledge of visual perception. A relationship will then be distinguished between sighted users' visual cognition and visually impaired users' coping strategies employed when interacting with Web pages. The project's objective is to create a framework that will be used to identify visually complex areas on Web pages for two purposes: to give feedback to visually impaired users regarding the presentation and visual layout of the page; and to help reduce the visual clutter of the page by using the framework as a guide for a Web page transcoding process." ],

  "title" : "Essays on Multivariate Modeling in Financial Econometrics",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays on Multivariate Modeling in Financial Econometrics", "The main theme of this dissertation is multivariate modeling in financial econometrics. The first chapter uses the fundamental properties of the multivariate distributions of independent random variables to develop a new specification testing methodology for dynamic models. The second chapter generalizes this methodology to tests of distributional assumptions and dynamic specification in multivariate models. In the third chapter we focus on testing and modeling asymmetries in the second moments of multiple equity returns.The methodological advances in nonlinear time series models with non-normal density functions and in density forecasting have emphasized the need for developing dynamic specification tests for the joint hypothesis of i.i.d.-ness and density functional form. In Chapter I, we propose a new battery of tests that rely on the fundamental properties of independent random variables with identical distributions and we introduce a graphical device -the autocontour-that helps to visualize the modeling problems. Based on the theoretical probability coverage of the autocontours, we construct a battery of asymptotic t-tests and chi-squared tests, which have standard convergence rates. The tests are very powerful against violations of both hypotheses. They do not require either a transformation of the original data or an assessment of goodness-of-fit à-la Kolmogorov and explicitly account for parameter uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations show that their finite sample performance is very good even in relatively small samples. We illustrate the usefulness of this methodology within the context of GARCH and ACD models using returns and duration data from the US equity markets.In Chapter II, we generalize the testing methodology developed in Chapter I to time series models with multivariate GARCH disturbances. The tests are applied to the vector of generalized errors that must be i.i.d. with a certain parametric multivariate probability density function under the null hypothesis of correct specification. We develop t-tests based on a single autocontour and also more powerful chi-squared tests based on multiple autocontours. In the spirit of goodness-of-fit tests, we also propose an additional test that focuses on the multivariate density functional form of the vector of innovations. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the size and power properties of the test statistics in finite samples. We apply our tests to multivariate GARCH models fitted to excess returns on portfolios sorted according to market capitalization.In Chapter III we test and model asymmetries in time-varying means, volatilities, correlations, and betas of equity returns in a multivariate threshold framework. We consider alternative specifications in which the threshold variable is based on market excess return, the Fama-French size and value factors, realized volatility of the market portfolio, and variables reflecting economic fundamentals. We find strong threshold effects with respect to market excess return, value premium, and term spread. Our results indicate that the threshold model based on market excess return provides a flexible and computationally inexpensive specification for modeling asymmetries, especially when dimensionality is high. We find that small caps, value stocks, and the Durables industry exhibit the strongest expected return asymmetries. Correlations of small caps, value firms, and defensive industries with the market tend to be significantly larger during market downturns. Correlation asymmetry usually translates into asymmetry in beta. Regime dependent volatility is a common characteristic of all portfolio groups. We evaluate performance of the proposed threshold models in an out-of-sample setup and find that there can be substantial economic gains in incorporating asymmetries in portfolio decisions." ],

The original contribution of knowledge of this thesis is to explain how imperfect market pricing undermines the utility of stock-based compensation awards, especially in light of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-11 (‘GFC’).The existing position with regard to Anglo-American corporate governance emphasises the role of the market in determining optimal governance solutions. However, the market cannot regulate all conflicts. For example, the separation of ownership and control in modern corporations creates an agency problem whereby managerial and shareholder interests may diverge. Public companies therefore use performance-related pay to align the interests of management with those of firm owners. This performance-related pay often includes an element with a specific link to the price of company stock. A by-product of these arrangements is that incentives are created for executives to inflate the value of their companies in order to benefit from short-run price appreciation. This reduces the utility of stock-based pay and encourages market short-termism. There is however, a further fundamental flaw in the use of stock-based pay; it places complete faith in modern finance theory; a theory which asserts that market pricing is flawless (the so-called Efficient Capital Markets Hypothesis). However, financial and asset markets are susceptible to forces which drive prices away from intrinsic value for protracted periods and contribute to serious price distortion. Behavioural finance explains how these distortions occur and provides a more appropriate paradigm for securities market operation. The Financial Instability Hypothesis (‘FIH’) also explains how endogenous instability, emanating from the banking sector, arises as an inevitable consequence of the functioning of the capitalist economy. It further demonstrates how markets may be driven away from fundamental value, how asset bubbles occur, and how the market pricing mechanism is seriously distorted. The most serious recent crisis, the GFC, exhibited the FIH taxonomy. It exposed serious flaws in modern finance theory and revealed the dangers of flawed incentive systems in generating asset bubbles. Executives at financial institutions stand accused of short-termism, over-leveraging and poor risk management. Monitoring of management was impossible to perform effectively due to various behavioural and structural obstacles arising from the size and complexity of the institutions concerned. Moreover, a system of perverse incentives led to the failure of effective regulation of executive compensation.Reform is therefore required. The thesis will conclude with a critical analysis of recent amendments to the regulation of compensation systems at financial institutions. Based on this examination, the thesis will make some proposals for future remuneration packages in the wider economy. These proposals are designed to reduce the potential for financial instability through removing incentives for firm executives to concentrate on short-term results, and emphasize the role of qualitative indices of performance." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Art of the Modernist Body", "The Art of the Modernist Body explores the fraught relationship between corporeality and the genesis of new language in modernist literature.  The dissertation argues that the history of disability in the early twentieth century facilitates a revised account of Anglo-American modernism; specifically, the modernists' formal preoccupation with loss, deficiency, and absence, long regarded as a vital aspect of the movement, can be re-imagined productively through the heuristic of disability theory.  The project likewise reveals that many of modernism's signature novelties, including free verse, Imagism, and the embrace of ordinary speech, are influenced by artists' attempts to represent physical deviance.  Each text in question is generated out of repeated encounters with extraordinary figures or forms, and the artists openly challenge the conceptual, social, and political parameters that delimit the ideal human body.  Their literature also reminds us that the modernist period is a remarkably inchoate time in terms of how the body is imagined.  Two World Wars, the rise of the machine age, and advances in prosthetic and rehabilitative medicine are just a few of the phenomena that brought the human form to the forefront of British and American culture, with politicians, cultural critics, industrial scions, workers, artists, and soldiers all tussling over the social and economic value of imperfect bodies.  Accordingly, many accounts from the period resist any entrenched, discrete notions of normality and abnormality, and acts of corporeal discipline, normalization, and rehabilitation are neither roundly condemned nor applauded.  The confluence of multiple visions of corporeality not only alters the cultural landscape, but it also affects the very language through which the experience of physical difference is articulated.  The novelists and poets herein record both processes, namely by producing what might be called a \"contingency of corporeality:\" they define the superlative modernist body as a hybrid entity, a form that registers the dueling forces of normalization and destabilization." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Investigation of the reaction of OH and CO to form H and CO₂ by photoelectron-photofragment coincidence spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion beam trap", "The HOCO radical plays a crucial role in a wide variety of chemical processes, including atmospheric CO₂ regulation and combustion chemistry, as an intermediate in the elementary reaction OH + CO [right arrow] H + CO₂. However , scant information exists on this species due to the difficulties in studying it. Previous photoelectron- photofragment coincidence (PPC) studies performed in this laboratory have identified key processes occurring on the HOCO potential energy surface, but are complicated by the presence of internal excitation in the precursor anions, leading to uncertainties in product energies and dynamics. To address this, a new instrument has been constructed which incorporates a cryogenically cooled linear electrostatic storage device, providing a cold source of anions for dissociative photodetachment studies by PPC spectroscopy. The enhanced resolution and well- characterized energetics provided by this instrument have allowed the fundamental energetics and processes occurring on the HOCO potential energy surface to be studied in unprecedented detail. New data shows unambiguous confirmation of the presence of tunneling in the reaction HOCO [right arrow] H + CO₂. Careful study of this product channel has led to the generation a model one-dimensional potential barrier describing this process directly from experimental tunneling data, and tunneling lifetimes over a range of relevant internal energies to be predicted. High resolution photodetachment experiments provide a reassignment of the electron affinities of both cis- and trans-HOCO and the determination of several normal mode frequencies not previously measured in the gas phase, each with the support of high-level ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Further details on the previously-unknown isomer well depths and the process of isomerization have been extracted using this information. Finally, nonresonant two-photon photodetachment studies of NO₂⁻, a species with striking electronic structure similarities to HOCO⁻, reveal a highly asymmetric angular distribution of photoelectrons. A model for reconstructing these photoelectron angular distributions is proposed, showing that interference between atomic emissions in the linear combination of atomic orbitals - molecular orbital picture is sufficient to explain the asymmetry" ],

While most surveys on travel health knowledge, attitudes, and practices focus on malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases, noninfectious travel risks were included in this study.METHODS: Pre- and post-travel perception of nine travel-associated health risks was recorded among 314 travelers to tropical and subtropical destinations. All travelers sought pre-travel health advice at the Travel Clinic of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in 2008 and 2009. In addition, 18 Swiss travel health experts provided an assessment of the respective risks. A validated visual psychometric measuring instrument was used [pictorial representation of illness and self measure (PRISM)]. RESULTS: Travelers and experts rated most risks similarly, except for accidents and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which experts rated higher. Compared to other risks, accidents ranked highly in both groups and were the only risk perceived higher after travel. Pre- and post-travel perceptions of all other risks were similar with a tendency to be lower after travel. Travelers perceived mosquitoes to be the highest risk before travel and accidents after travel.CONCLUSION: Travelers' risk perception appears to be accurate for most risks stated in this study. However, travel health professionals should be aware that some perception patterns among travelers regarding travel-related health risks may be different from professional risk assessment. Important but insufficiently perceived health risks, such as sexual behavior/STIs and accidents, should be considered to be part of any pre-travel health advice package." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Financial Markets and Real Ecinomy: Four Essays in International Trade", "Financial markets play an important role in an economy performing various functions like mobilizing and pooling savings, producing information about investment opportunities, screening and monitoring investments, implementation of corporate governance, diversification and management of risk. These functions influence saving rates, investment decisions, technological innovation and, therefore, have important implications for welfare. In my PhD dissertation I examine the interplay of financial and product markets by looking at different channels through which financial markets may influence an economy.My dissertation consists of four chapters. The first chapter is a co-authored work with Martin Strieborny, a PhD student from the University of Lausanne. The second chapter is a co-authored work with Melise Jaud, a PhD student from the Paris School of Economics. The third chapter is co-authored with both Melise Jaud and Martin Strieborny. The last chapter of my PhD dissertation is a single author paper.Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis analyzes the effect of financial development on growth of contract intensive industries. These industries intensively use intermediate inputs that neither can be sold on organized exchange, nor are reference-priced (Levchenko, 2007; Nunn, 2007). A typical example of a contract intensive industry would be an industry where an upstream supplier has to make investments in order to customize a product for needs of a downstream buyer. After the investment is made and the product is adjusted, the buyer may refuse to meet a commitment and trigger ex post renegotiation. Since the product is customized to the buyer's needs, the supplier cannot sell the product to a different buyer at the original price. This is referred in the literature as the holdup problem. As a consequence, the individually rational suppliers will underinvest into relationship-specific assets, hurting the downstream firms with negative consequences for aggregate growth. The standard way to mitigate the hold up problem is to write a binding contract and to rely on the legal enforcement by the state. However, even the most effective contract enforcement might fail to protect the supplier in tough times when the buyer lacks a reliable source of external financing. This suggests the potential role of financial intermediaries, banks in particular, in mitigating the incomplete contract problem. First, financial products like letters of credit and letters of guarantee can substantially decrease a risk and transaction costs of parties. Second, a bank loan can serve as a signal about a buyer's true financial situation, an upstream firm will be more willing undertake relationship-specific investment knowing that the business partner is creditworthy and will abstain from myopic behavior (Fama, 1985; von Thadden, 1995). Therefore, a well-developed financial (especially banking) system should disproportionately benefit contract intensive industries.The empirical test confirms this hypothesis. Indeed, contract intensive industries seem to grow faster in countries with a well developed financial system. Furthermore, this effect comes from a more developed banking sector rather than from a deeper stock market. These results are reaffirmed examining the effect of US bank deregulation on the growth of contract intensive industries in different states. Beyond an overall pro-growth effect, the bank deregulation seems to disproportionately benefit the industries requiring relationship-specific investments from their suppliers.Chapter 2 of my PhD focuses on the role of the financial sector in promoting exports of developing countries. In particular, it investigates how credit constraints affect the ability of firms operating in agri-food sectors of developing countries to keep exporting to foreign markets.Trade in high-value agri-food products from developing countries has expanded enormously over the last two decades offering opportunities for development. However, trade in agri-food is governed by a growing array of standards. Sanitary and Phytosanitary standards (SPS) and technical regulations impose additional sunk, fixed and operating costs along the firms' export life. Such costs may be detrimental to firms' survival, \"pricing out\" producers that cannot comply. The existence of these costs suggests a potential role of credit constraints in shaping the duration of trade relationships on foreign markets. A well-developed financial system provides the funds to exporters necessary to adjust production processes in order to meet quality and quantity requirements in foreign markets and to maintain long-standing trade relationships. The products with higher needs for financing should benefit the most from a well functioning financial system. This differential effect calls for a difference-in-difference approach initially proposed by Rajan and Zingales (1998). As a proxy for demand for financing of agri-food products, the sanitary risk index developed by Jaud et al. (2009) is used. The empirical literature on standards and norms show high costs of compliance, both variable and fixed, for high-value food products (Garcia-Martinez and Poole, 2004; Maskus et al., 2005). The sanitary risk index reflects the propensity of products to fail health and safety controls on the European Union (EU) market. Given the high costs of compliance, the sanitary risk index captures the demand for external financing to comply with such regulations.The prediction is empirically tested examining the export survival of different agri-food products from firms operating in Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania. The results suggest that agri-food products that require more financing to keep up with food safety regulation of the destination market, indeed sustain longer in foreign market, when they are exported from countries with better developed financial markets.Chapter 3 analyzes the link between financial markets and efficiency of resource allocation in an economy. Producing and exporting products inconsistent with a country's factor endowments constitutes a serious misallocation of funds, which undermines competitiveness of the economy and inhibits its long term growth. In this chapter, inefficient exporting patterns are analyzed through the lens of the agency theories from the corporate finance literature. Managers may pursue projects with negative net present values because their perquisites or even their job might depend on them. Exporting activities are particularly prone to this problem. Business related to foreign markets involves both high levels of additional spending and strong incentives for managers to overinvest. Rational managers might have incentives to push for exports that use country's scarce factors which is suboptimal from a social point of view. Export subsidies might further skew the incentives towards inefficient exporting. Management can divert the export subsidies into investments promoting inefficient exporting.Corporate finance literature stresses the disciplining role of outside debt in counteracting the internal pressures to divert such \"free cash flow\" into unprofitable investments. Managers can lose both their reputation and the control of \"their\" firm if the unpaid external debt triggers a bankruptcy procedure. The threat of possible failure to satisfy debt service payments pushes the managers toward an efficient use of available resources (Jensen, 1986; Stulz, 1990; Hart and Moore, 1995). The main sources of debt financing in the most countries are banks. The disciplining role of banks might be especially important in the countries suffering from insufficient judicial quality. Banks, in pursuing their rights, rely on comparatively simple legal interventions that can be implemented even by mediocre courts. In addition to their disciplining role, banks can promote efficient exporting patterns in a more direct way by relaxing credit constraints of producers, through screening, identifying and investing in the most profitable investment projects. Therefore, a well-developed domestic financial system, and particular banking system, would help to push a country's exports towards products congruent with its comparative advantage.This prediction is tested looking at the survival of different product categories exported to US market. Products are identified according to the Euclidian distance between their revealed factor intensity and the country's factor endowments. The results suggest that products suffering from a comparative disadvantage (labour-intensive products from capital-abundant countries) survive less on the competitive US market. This pattern is stronger if the exporting country has a well-developed banking system. Thus, a strong banking sector promotes exports consistent with a country comparative advantage.Chapter 4 of my PhD thesis further examines the role of financial markets in fostering efficient resource allocation in an economy. In particular, the allocative efficiency hypothesis is investigated in the context of equity market liberalization.Many empirical studies document a positive and significant effect of financial liberalization on growth (Levchenko et al. 2009; Quinn and Toyoda 2009; Bekaert et al., 2005). However, the decrease in the cost of capital and the associated growth in investment appears rather modest in comparison to the large GDP growth effect (Bekaert and Harvey, 2005; Henry, 2000, 2003). Therefore, financial liberalization may have a positive impact on growth through its effect on the allocation of funds across firms and sectors.Free access to international capital markets allows the largest and most profitable domestic firms to borrow funds in foreign markets (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). As domestic banks loose some of their best clients, they reoptimize their lending practices seeking new clients among small and younger industrial firms. These firms are likely to be more risky than large and established companies. Screening of customers becomes prevalent as the return to screening rises. Banks, ceteris paribus, tend to focus on firms operating in comparative-advantage sectors because they are better risks. Firms in comparative-disadvantage sectors finding it harder to finance their entry into or survival in export markets either exit or refrain from entering export markets. On aggregate, one should therefore expect to see less entry, more exit, and shorter survival on export markets in those sectors after financial liberalization.The paper investigates the effect of financial liberalization on a country's export pattern by comparing the dynamics of entry and exit of different products in a country export portfolio before and after financial liberalization.The results suggest that products that lie far from the country's comparative advantage set tend to disappear relatively faster from the country's export portfolio following the liberalization of financial markets. In other words, financial liberalization tends to rebalance the composition of a country's export portfolio towards the products that intensively use the economy's abundant factors." ],

  "texts" : [ "Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs.", "BACKGROUND: Second-generation antipsychotics have been thought to cause fewer extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) than first-generation antipsychotics, but recent pragmatic trials have indicated equivalence. AIMS: To determine whether second-generation antipsychotics had better outcomes in terms of EPS than first-generation drugs. METHOD: We conducted an intention-to-treat, secondary analysis of data from an earlier randomised controlled trial (n = 227). A clinically significant difference was defined as double or half the symptoms in groups prescribed first- v. second-generation antipsychotics, represented by odds ratios greater than 2.0 (indicating advantage for first-generation drugs) or less than 0.5 (indicating advantage for the newer drugs). We also examined EPS in terms of symptoms emergent at 12 weeks and 52 weeks, and symptoms that had resolved at these time points. RESULTS: At baseline those randomised to the first-generation antipsychotic group (n = 118) had similar EPS to the second-generation group (n = 109). Indications of resolved Parkinsonism (OR = 0.5) and akathisia (OR = 0.4) and increased tardive dyskinesia (OR = 2.2) in the second-generation drug group at 12 weeks were not statistically significant and the effects were not present by 52 weeks. Patients in the second-generation group were dramatically (30-fold) less likely to be prescribed adjunctive anticholinergic medication, despite equivalence in terms of EPS. CONCLUSIONS: The expected improvement in EPS profiles for participants randomised to second-generation drugs was not found; the prognosis over 1 year of those in the first-generation arm was no worse in these terms. The place of careful prescription of first-generation drugs in contemporary practice remains to be defined, potentially improving clinical effectiveness and avoiding life-shortening metabolic disturbances in some patients currently treated with the narrow range of second-generation antipsychotics used in routine practice. This has educational implications because a generation of psychiatrists now has little or no experience with first-generation antipsychotic prescription." ],

We apply these advances to study commuters' preferences for speedy and reliable highway travel with the objective of exploring efficiency and distributional effects of road pricing that accounts for users' heterogeneity. Our analysis combines revealed and stated commuter choices of whether to pay a toll for congestion-free express travel or to travel free on regular congested roads. We find that highway users exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their values of travel time and reliability. Moreover, we show that road pricing policies that cater to varying preferences can substantially increase efficiency while maintaining the political feasibility exhibited by current experiments.

  "texts" : [ "Food benefit and climate warming potential of nitrogen fertilizer uses in China", "Chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer has long been used to help meet the increasing food demands in China, the top N fertilizer consumer in the world. Growing concerns have been raised on the impacts of N fertilizer uses on food security and climate change, which is lack of quantification. Here we use a carbon–nitrogen (C–N) coupled ecosystem model, to quantify the food benefit and climate consequence of agronomic N addition in China over the six decades from 1949 to 2008. Results show that N fertilizer-induced crop yield and soil C sequestration had reached their peaks, while nitrous oxide (N2O) emission continued rising as N was added. Since the early 2000s, stimulation of excessive N fertilizer uses to global climate warming through N2O emission was estimated to outweigh their climate benefit in increasing CO2 uptake. The net warming effect of N fertilizer uses, mainly centered in the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Basin, with N2O emission completely counteracting or even exceeding, by more than a factor of 2, the CO2 sink. If we reduced the current N fertilizer level by 60% in 'over-fertilized' areas, N2O emission would substantially decrease without significantly influencing crop yield and soil C sequestration.© IOP Publishing,  2012.

The article first outlines the theoretical framework of the concept of BA. On that basis it looks in detail at the way BA is currently operationalized in evaluation practice and how the concept is applied in the interaction between policy makers and evaluators. The article utilizes a statistical analysis of 171 innovation policy evaluations, a text analysis of selected BA evaluation reports, and finally a number of in-depth case studies of evaluations. Based on the conceptualization and the empirical findings, the article identifies three different uses of BA in innovation policy evaluations. The article further concludes that despite the widespread use of the concept of BA, an improved theoretical basis and serious methodological improvements are needed to realize the full potential of the concept for evaluation and policy practice." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "'Beer used to belong to older men' : drink and authority among the Nyakyusa of Tanzania.", "In her last major work on social change among the Nyakyusa of southwestern Tanzania, Monica Wilson returned to an argument about the changing role of beer drinking which had featured in her earlier writings (1963: 176, 1977: 92-3, 131). She suggested that the selling of locally made grain beer for cash, and its consumption in commercial clubs, had played a major role in altering relationships between young and old, and men and women. Generational separation had broken down: young men had lost respect for elder men and women had acquired a new economic autonomy founded on the cash income they earned from selling beer. Beer thus lay at the heart of a pattern of social change (1977: 186). \r\nThis article examines changes in authority and the drinking of beer in Nyakyusa society from the 1890s-when written records become available-to the end of the twentieth century. It argues that patterns of deference and authority have suffered less dislocation than Wilson suggested and that-while locally made grain beer has been physically transformed, has disappeared from certain public rituals of well-being and has come increasingly into the cash market-its commoditisation has not necessarily empowered women, nor has it eliminated the role of beer in patterns of behaviour and discourse which sustain elder men's claims to authority." ],

  "texts" : [ "High tryptophan diet reduces CA1 intraneuronal β-amyloid in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs mnesic functions. The histopathology of the disease is manifested by the accumulation of intracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and subsequent formation of neuritic plaques as well as the presence neurofibrillary tangles in specific brain regions associated with learning and memory including the hippocampus. Here, we analysed the effect of chronic (1 month) food diets containing low (LTrP), normal (NTrP) and high tryptophan (HTrP), 0.04, 0.20 and 0.40 g/100 g, respectively, on CA1 serotonin transporter (SERT) fibre density, intraneuronal Aβ deposition and total number of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in an AD triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model. Nontransgenic (non-Tg) animals fed with HTrP displayed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 (35%) and in stratum lacunosum moleculare (S.Mol) (48%) compared to LTrP diet. Transgenic animals showed increased SERT fibre density in CA1 S.Mol compared to diet-matched non-Tg irrespective of dietary tryptophan content (104% for LTrP, 74% for NTrP and 35% for HTrP); no differences were observed in the total number of 5-HT neurons neither in the dorsal nor in the median raphe nuclei. However, and more relevant to AD, HTrP diet reduced intraneuronal Aβ density (by a 17%) in transgenic animals compared to transgenic animals fed with NTrP diet. Our results show that increased dietary TrP intake reduces intraneuronal Aβ load in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD, suggesting that enhanced TrP intake and in consequence a potential increase in 5-HT neurotransmission may be effective in reducing plaque pathology in AD." ],

An intent-to-treat analysis, including those patients (n = 28) who discontinued clozapine during the study period, showed a significant reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital in the 2 years following clozapine initiation compared to the previous 2 years and to the follow-up period in the control group. This translated into a reduction of £7300 in hospitalization costs per patient started on clozapine, over the 2-year period. In those patients whocontinued clozapine treatment for the whole of the 2-year period, there was a two-thirds reduction in number of admissions and total time spent in hospital compared to no change in the clozapine discontinuers. These findings suggest that clozapine is a clinically and cost-effective intervention for severe schizophrenia in routine clinical settings." ],

  "title" : "Three Essays on Analyst Target Prices",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Three Essays on Analyst Target Prices", "This thesis presents three essays on analyst target prices. The essays contribute to the major debate on the value of analyst target prices in the capital market by addressing the following three questions: Does a bull-bear valuation analysis increase the accuracy of analysts’ target prices? Does analyst ranking affect how informative target prices are to institutional investors? And, do analysts use their cash flow forecasts when setting target prices?In the first essay, I explore whether conducting a bull–bear analysis (BBA) increases target price accuracy. A bull–bear analysis is a risk assessment tool that analysts use to enhance the credibility of their valuations and limit target price uncertainty. Using propensity score matching to control for selection bias, combined with a difference-in-differences estimation to allow for company- and analyst-specific effects, I estimate the effect of supplementing target prices with a BBA on the target price accuracy of US stocks during 2008–2009. The results suggest that target prices are more accurate when analysts supplement them with a BBA. The findings contribute to the literature exploring the determinants of analyst ability to produce accurate target prices. The second essay examines whether analyst ranking status affects institutional investors’ decisions to incorporate target price information into their investment strategies. Evidence shows that market participants value analyst target prices. There is limited evidence, however, on how target price revisions influence the decisions of sophisticated investors. The examination of this study is relevant for the economic question: Does analyst reputation mitigate or exacerbate the conflicts of interest that analysts face? Consistent with institutional investor trades being based on superior information, I observe differences in the information content of target price revisions by star and non-star analysts. Additionally, a duration analysis shows that the quality of analyst target price revisions significantly increases the hazard of analysts losing their star ranking.In the final essay, I examine whether analysts’ decisions to issue cash flow forecasts depend endogenously on their decision to use these forecasts to set target prices. Using an endogenous switching regression model, with analyst report regimes of disclosure and non-disclosure of cash flow forecasts, I find that cash flow revisions are more important than earnings revisions in explaining the magnitude of target price revisions in the cash flow disclosure regime. Cash flow forecasts influence and are influenced by analyst valuation choices. Additional analysis shows that cash flow-based pseudo-target prices play a greater role in explaining target price implied returns than do earnings-based pseudo-target prices. These findings provide insights into analysts’ valuation decision processes and their sophisticated valuation input choices." ],

A model of productive public capital shows that, when input factors are mobile, public infrastructure investments in one location can draw production away from other locations. In a linear production function framework, this effect would be manifested as a negative output spillover from public capital. Using data for California counties from 1969 through 1988, such negative spillover effects are shown to exist in the case of highway and street capital. The data show that changes in county output are positively associated with changes in highway and street capital within the same county, but output changes are negatively associated with changes in highway and street capital in other counties." ],

  "title" : "Essays on Closed-end Funds",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays on Closed-end Funds", "This thesis is comprised of three separate empirical chapters on the closed-end fund industry. The first chapter examines the performance and trading volume of UK Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) focusing on the expiry of the minimum holding period required for investors to gain income tax relief on VCT shares bought at flotation. The second explores the effect of repurchase transactions on the stock liquidity of UK closed-end funds. The third chapter investigates the relationship between pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) and fund risk of US closed-end funds. The first empirical chapter finds negative abnormal returns and permanent increases in trading volumes at and around the expiry of the required holding periods of VCTs. VCTs investing in companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market experience higher abnormal returns and lower abnormal trading volumes than VCTs investing in unquoted companies. VCTs with better asset performance during the required holding period have lower abnormal returns and higher abnormal trading volumes. Income tax relief becomes more generous (increases from 20 to 40 percent) and holding periods shorter (from five to three years) over the sample period. The more generous (to the investors) the income tax relief, the higher the abnormal returns and the lower the abnormal trading volumes.  The second empirical chapter reports that repurchase transactions improve the stock liquidity of closed-end funds suggesting that funds act as “competing market makers”. However, the positive liquidity effect of repurchase transactions is short-lived and positively affected by the frequency of repurchase transactions. The positive effect seems to have been increased by the change in repurchase regulations on 1st December 2003 that allowed funds to re-issue repurchased shares and appears to have increased the ability of funds to manage their stock liquidity.The third empirical chapter finds that fund risk has a positive impact on fund PPS, suggesting that shareholders need to provide greater compensation incentives to managers of riskier firms to reduce the adverse selection problem. PPS has a positive effect on fund risk, which suggests that, in the closed-end fund industry, the increase in the value of the fund manager’s wealth due to a higher PPS outweighs the negative effect of increased pay volatility on the manager’s expected utility." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Erschriebene Religion : die Vielfalt der Stimmen in den Religionserzählungen des modernen Durchbruchs", "The article provides a case study on the impact of literary tendencies on the conception of religion. In the nineteenth century, “religion” became a critical term in various academic disciplines, with different concepts of religion emphasizing its subjective-emotional character (in the line of German Protestantism), its social impact (in the line of French sociological schools), its cognitive function (in the line of the evolutionists in Great Britain), and—as a general tendency—its historical character. In the Scandinavian intellectual scene, intensely monitoring the academic developments in the larger countries, syntheses between these approaches and domains attributed to religion were attempted relatively early on. In the study of the European history of religion, it had long been emphasized that this “scientification” of the concept of religion had an eminent impact on the religious field, leading to new forms of spirituality, religious identities, as well as interreligious dialogue and discourse—which, in turn, influenced academia. The main thesis of this article is that popular literature served as an important catalyst in these dynamics. By concretizing abstract theories of religion in the form of narratives, different types of religious behavior, experiences, and social functions were connected with specific literary characters and plots. The poetic constraints and possibilities of the narrative genres thus, in turn, re-shaped the conception of religion. The Scandinavian “modern breakthrough,” as it had been declared by Georg Brandes in the 1870s, identified “religion” as one of the basic “problems” to be debated in contemporary literature. In the late 1870s and the 1880s, both Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Arne Garborg were intensely involved in this debate, often misunderstood as a personal “religious crisis.” Their literary works document the development of a unique characteristic of the era. While the “voice of the 1870s and the 1880s, both Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Arne Garborg were intensely involved in this debate, often misunderstood as a personal “religious crisis.” Their literary works document thedevelopment of a unique characteristic of the era. While the “voice of the modern breakthrough” is distinct in their earlier works of this period, with enlightened, free-thinking protagonists standing opposed to a powerful and dogmatic Christian society, the focus soon shifts to a new problem area: what is meant by the term “religion” and which domain it belongs to. Influenced by literary naturalism and experimenting with new narrative techniques, the sociological perspective soon shifted to more psychological accounts. While historicizing religion and commenting oncontemporary theories of religion, the writers cultivated new modes of religious speech and identity. Detaching God from religion and suggesting it as a human phenomenon, they allowed for a re-evaluation of the concept of religion and prepared for new non-traditional forms of religiosity." ],

In-depth longitudinal exploration of lung cancer patients' symptom experiences is used to examine patient symptom experiences and distress across the disease trajectory of lung cancer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and their primary caregivers at four time points: at the beginning of treatment and then subsequently at three, six, and twelve months. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed in the data analysis. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that a cluster of interacting respiratory symptoms play a central role in patients' symptom experiences within the lung cancer population. The interviews also suggest that symptoms such as cough which are under-represented in research within this population may play an important role in patients' symptom experiences. DISCUSSION: Longitudinal qualitative investigation offers a valuable method for improving our understanding of patients' experiences of lung cancer and for identifying potential opportunities to improve patient quality of life." ],

  "texts" : [ "New Highways, Induced Travel, and Urban Growth Patterns: A \"Before and After\" Test", "Several recent studies have demonstrated an association between increases in highway capacity and increases in vehicle miles of travel (VMT). That phenomenon, called induced travel, has increasingly been cited as a basis for rethinking travel demand modeling, land-use/transportation interactions, and the environmental impacts of highway projects. Yet before the policy community can firmly conclude that induced travel is an important phenomenon, one lingering doubt must be addressed. Do new highways really induce additional travel, or are the associations between lane miles and VMT driven by a reverse causal link - namely that new highways are built in anticipation of expected increases in travel demand? The debate remains contentious, in part because the empirical evidence on induced travel is mostly from aggregate data that are aggregated over broad geographic areas, such as counties or states is difficult, and focusing on individual projects can help clarify matters. In this light, we examine three highways in a rapidly growing urban area to pose the following question: Do new highways influence urban development in ways that suggest that they induce new automobile traffic, or are urban growth patterns somewhat impervious to the completion of new highways?" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "ISLAM AND THE CHANGING MEANING OF SPIRITUALITAS AND SPIRITUAL IN CONTEMPORARY INDONESIA", "Spiritualitas, an Indonesian term derived from English word’s spirituality, and spiritual from English’s spiritual, are now commonly used in Indonesian discourses. This paper traces earliest usages of the term spiritualitas and spiritual and then explores their changing meaning in contemporary Indonesia. Unlike in the past, where Indonesian government broadly used the terms to refer indigenous mystical legacies of the Aliran Kepercayaan or Kebatinan designing them as not religion but merely cultural legacy (adat, budaya spiritual), the current usage of the terms indicates a growing trend of Indonesian world religions, mainly Islam, in absorbing and acquiring the terms as kind of religious expressions. This trend is quite different from that happen in the West; while the growing of spirituality is correlated to the declining of Western affiliation and participation in religion, mainly Christianity; in Indonesia, world religions, especially Islam, seem to be the sponsor of spirituality. Thus, instead of spirituality will silently take over religion as predicted by Jaremy Carrette and Richard King (2005), the mainstream religious groups seem to take over spirituality. <br />[Istilah spiritual dan spiritulitas akhir-akhir ini banyak digunakan di Indonesia, merujuk tidak hanya pada ekspresi spiritual di luar agama, namun juga yang ada dalam tradsi keagaamaan. Tulisan ini menelaah awal mula penggunaan istilah spiritual dan spiritualitas dalam khazanah literatur pasca kemerdekaan serta fase-fase perubahan makna dari istilah tersebut pada masa-masa sesudahnya. Pada fase awal, pemerintah Indonesia secara massif menggunakan istilah spiritual untuk menunjuk tradisi keberagamaan di luar agama-agama resmi yang berbasis pada mistisisme agama-agama lokal seperti Aliran Kepercayaan dan Kebatinan. Hal ini mengisyaratkan bahwa istilah spiritual tersebut digunakan untuk menekankan bahwa tradisi beragamaan lokal tersebut bukan agama, hanya warisan budaya atau adat istiadat. Namun, kecenderangan baru sejak akhir 1990an hingga saat ini menunjukkan bahwa agama-agama resmi, terutama Islam, secara massif telah menggunakan istilah spiritual maupun spiritualitas sebagai padanan dari ekspresi batin keberagamaan (inner religious expression). Trend semacam ini cukup unik bila dibandingkan dengan yang terjadi di Barat, sebab tumbuh suburnya gerakan spiritual di Barat terjadi pada saat menurunnya tingkat afiliasi publik terhadap agama-agama besar, terutama Kristen; sedangkan di Indonesia agama-agama besar dunia, terutama Islam, menjadi sponsor utama populernya istilah spiritual dan spiritualitas serta munculnya gerakan-gerakan spiritual berbasis agama. Oleh karena itu, prediksi Jaremy Carrete dan Richard King yang menyatakan “pengambil alihan peran agama oleh spiritualitas” sebagaimana yang terjadi di dunia Barat, tidak terjadi di Indonesia. Sebaliknya, yang terjadi di Indonesia adalah agama-agama besar dunia telah mengambil alih peran dan fungsi spiritualitas." ],

Most research that is done about spirituality is principally qualitative in which phenomenological rapprochements and story narration are used. Goal: The goal of the specific research is the study of the qualitative features which came from the use of the questionnaire: “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” in a general population of Thessaly. Material and Methodology: 393 citizens of Thessaly completed the questionnaire “The Royal Free Interview for Religious and Spiritual Beliefs” which occupies with religious and spiritual beliefs. Results: Having 393 participants, 149 (37,9%) were men and 244 (62,1%) were women. The majority of the women (N= 161,66%) stated that they have equally religious and spiritual beliefs compared to 44,9% of the men. A lot of the participants connected their beliefs to issues concerning their health state while others stated that their lives are interwoven with the meaning of the Orthodox religion and the way that their religion is believed: “Believing in the Orthodox religion, in a great degree, and critical observation and belief to the ecclesiastical way of life. Others divide spirituality and religiosity. Spirituality has to do with the prospects- the point of view of each person.” Some participants showed supernatural concerns while we are impressed by the percentage of people who stated that they have lived an intense experience which brought a new, deeper meaning to their lives. They also stated that they felt that they were unified with the world or the universe. 58 participants occupied in describing their experience. Conclusion: The results which came out from their qualitative features of the specific questionnaire are very useful. First of all, there is connection between spirituality and health, while 110 people tried to describe their afterlife state" ],

While I\nthink that account gets at one important sense of moral goodness, I argue here that it\nfails to capture several ways of being worthy of admiration on moral grounds. Moral\ngoodness is more multi-faceted. My title is intended to capture that multi-facetedness:\nthe essay examines saintliness, heroism, and sagacity. The variety of our\ncommon-sense moral ideals underscores the inadequacy of any one account of\nmoral admirableness, and I hope to illuminate the distinct roles these ideals play in\nour everyday understanding of goodness. Along the way, I give an account of what\nmakes actions heroic, of whether such actions are supererogatory, and of what, if\nanything, is wrong with moral deference. At the close of the essay, I begin to\nexplore the flipside of these ideals: villainy." ],

  "title" : "Drive tourism: a view from the road",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Drive tourism: a view from the road", "[Extract] The nature of self-drive tourism is changing globally. In countries where privately owned vehicles have long been a popular choice of tourism transport, increased access to low-cost airfares and increased costs of vehicle\r\nmaintenance and fuel have been critical influences. Holyoak et al. (2009) documented the shift in Australia, for example, from a market dominated by tourists 'in transit' - using the vehicle simply as the most convenient mode of transport between the origin and the destination - to one where the use of the vehicle was more central to the enjoyment of the trip as a whole. Consequently, self-drive tourism research is now beginning to pay more attention to four-wheel-drive travel (Taylor and Carson, this volume,\r\nChapter 17; Prideaux and Coghlan, this volume, Chapter 18), caravanning (van Heerden, this volume, Chapter 6; McClymont et al., this volume, Chapter 16), motorcycling (Walker, this volume, Chapter 12) and other subsets of the market where the vehicle itself is embraced as a core attribute\r\nof the tourism experience, rather than as a necessary evil of transport. In countries where vehicle ownership is only now becoming widespread (Yu et aI., this volume, Chapter 8; du Cros and Ong, this volume, Chapter 9, which highlight the case of China), whole new types of tourism experiences\r\nare being made possible, free from the constraints of scheduled mass transit. The use of the vehicle as conspicuous consumption reflects the rise of new middle classes who want to purchase tourism as part of a confirmation of their new place in a wider world than they previously accessed. It must also be noted that in a number of markets, including China, India, Eastern Europe and South America, self-drive tourism has emerged after the development of low-cost air travel. The development of the self-drive market in these countries will not take the same path as in North America, Europe and Australasia, where the mass ownership of cars pre-dated access to low-cost air travel. Our thesis is that the major change in the global self-drive markets is a shift away from the car as a form of least-cost transport towards the use of a variety of self-driven vehicles that add value to the tourism experience. This book has documented the meaning of that fundamental change in the marketplace from the perspective of the tourist. Chapters have documented what it now means to be a drive tourist in China, a four-wheel-driver\r\nin Australia, a motorcyclist in the UK, a motorhome driver in the US, an international self-driver in Brazil, and so on. There have also been reflections on what the global markets and emerging trends mean for the tourism\r\nindustry - rental car companies in New Zealand, motoring associations, marketers of touring routes and other drive destinations, or emergency services agencies. In this chapter, we use the 'Grand Tour' (Olsen 2002) of Central and Eastern Australia to illustrate the challenges facing destinations and businesses in adjusting to new market dynamics and to synthesise issues raised throughout the book." ],

In Mauritius, this analysis examines historical, yearly tourist arrivals and malaria cases from 1978&#8211;1999, accounting for the background secular trend of increasing international travel. In Dominican Republic, a country embarking upon malaria elimination, it employs a time-series analysis of the monthly, international tourist arrivals from 1998&#8211;2010 to determine whether the timing of significant deviations in tourist arrivals coincides with malaria outbreaks.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile na&#239;ve relationships exist in both cases, the results show that the relationships between tourist arrivals and malaria cases are relatively weak and statistically insignificant once secular confounders are accounted for.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\t\tThis suggests that any economic benefits from tourism that may be derived from actively pursuing elimination in countries that have high tourism potential are likely to be small when measured at a national level. Rather, tourism benefits are likely to be experienced with greater impact in more concentrated tourist areas within countries, and future studies should seek to assess these relationships at a regional or local level." ],

  "texts" : [ "Christian Morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism: A Theological Analysis of Virtue Theory as a Framework for Integrating Christian and Akan Moral Schemes", "This research was submitted to the University of Manchester by Lord Abraham Elorm-Donkor for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Its title, “Christian Morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism: A Theological Analysis of Virtue Theory as a Framework for Integrating Christian and Akan Moral Schemes” indicates the scope of the research within African Pentecostal Studies.  Although scholars and Christian leaders have indicated that there is marked separation between morality and spirituality in the Christian praxis of many Africans and that the African worldview, which African Christians still hold is responsible for this separation, there has not been a detailed study of the issue. The aim of the research is to offer an explanation, of a paradox in Ghanaian society where there is enthusiastic Christian spirituality that is separated from social morality, so that a deeper integration of the Christian and Akan traditional moral schemes can be proposed.My research focuses on Pentecostals in Ghana whose appropriation of the African worldview into Christian praxis has generally been considered as a positive response to African religiosity. By the use of a practical theological method of correlation whereby the Christian truth is represented by the moral theology of John Wesley and brought in dialogue with the Akan traditional moral scheme, this research offers reasons for and proposes a solution to the lack of social morality in Ghanaian Pentecostalism. It uses the virtue theory as a heuristic tool for the analysis of morality in a way that provides explanation for the situation and guides an integration of the two moral schemes at a deeper level. The examination of the two moral schemes has been guided by the elements of character, a central theme of the virtue theory. It has been shown that the ‘Deliverance Theology’ of Ghanaian Pentecostals involves significant misrepresentation of the Akan traditional scheme, and that this situation causes many Christians to focus on religion as a means for the supply of existential needs rather than the transformation of inner dispositions for moral character formation. This research shows that reinterpreting the Akan view of humanity and integrating it with the Wesleyan account of the Christian truth, transforms the ‘Deliverance Theology’ by portraying the Christian life as a pneumatological characterology. The moral responsibility that this entails will ensure that African Pentecostals understand social morality as an essential outcome of their Christian spirituality." ],

We analyzed whether willingness towait was influenced by perceived illness severity, age, race, triage acuity level, or insurance status.\n      Methods: We conducted this survey-based study from March to July 2010 at an urban academicmedical center. After triage, patients were given a multiple-choice questionnaire, designed toascertain how long they would wait for medical care. We collected data including age, gender, race,insurance status, and triage acuity level. We looked at the association between willingness to waitand these variables, using stratified analysis and logistic regression.\n      Results: Of the 375 patients who were approached, 340 (91%) participated. One hundred seventyone(51%) were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving, 58 (17%) would wait 2 to 8 hours, and110 (32%) would wait indefinitely. No association was found between willingness to wait and race,gender, insurance status, or perceived symptom severity. Patients willing to wait >2 hours tended tobe older than 25, have higher acuity, and prefer the study site ED.\n      Conclusion: Many patients have a defined, limited period that they are willing to wait for emergencycare. In our study, 50% of patients were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving the ED withoutbeing seen. This result suggests that efforts to reduce the percentage of patients who LWBS mustfactor in time limits. [West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(6):463-467]" ],

The experiment was conducted in the C6 beamline of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory using the Crystal Ball detector, which is a highly segmented multi-photon spectrometer covering nearly 4&pi; steradian. Data were collected at eight beam momenta: 520, 558, 580, 629, 657, 690, 720, and 750 MeV/<italic>c</italic>, corresponding to center-of-mass energies of 1571 to 1676 MeV.

  "texts" : [ "Waste elimination to improve productivity by using Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in the factory", "This research describes the various types of non-value added processes (i.e. waste) that will downgrade the productivity of the elevator manufacturing factory in the industry. As the international competition and customers' demands are changing from time to time, manufacturer has to change their business strategy and factory management in order for them to adapt and accommodate to these kinds of rapid changes. Not only that, it is also crucial for the manufacturer to remain competitive in the industry, however this is not easy to achieve for most of the manufacturer as there are many internal and external factors that will downgrade the productivity and affect the competitiveness of the firm, thereafter deliver poor quality of products and delay the work processes in the factory. Therefore it is important for the manufacturer to have an effective strategy that will guarantee, or at least help to reduce or minimize the operation cost by identify and eradicate non-value added processes (i.e. waste) in the factory, hence to improve the quality in every area of the value streams, this shall inclusive of factory management. Furthermore, the research also describes the effectiveness of the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in moderating the impacts of the waste towards the factory productivity. Results of the literature review, which was used to identify both manufacturing an9 VSM practises, are presented. Current state map of the SEC's factory processes flow also being documented and discussed in this research. The findings of this literature review were synthesized to adapt its instrument to assess both the waste and productivity level in this factory. This is an exploratory study and the analysis of the survey results had shown that waiting time and defect has negative impact on factory productivity in the Sabah Elevator Company (SEC). VSM does show the moderating effect towards the waiting time on the factory productivity. The major contribution of this research enables the manufacturer to gain better understanding on how the non-value added processes (Le. waste) can downgrade the productivity in this factory. The implication of each variable as well as managerial implications, proposed future state map, and further suggestions for future research were identified and proposed." ],

  "texts" : [ "A comparison of the perceptions of the role of teacher aids in special education classes for trainable and severely profoundly mentally retarded children", "The purpose of the study was to compare the role of the special education teacher aide as perceived by special education administrators, special education teachers, and special education teacher aides in classes for trainable and severely/profoundly mentally retarded. The study involved sixty-four special education administrators, sixty-one special education teachers, and one hundred three special education teacher aides. Data were gathered by use of a questionnaire containing one hundred items representative of behavioral tasks usually performed by special education teachers or special education teacher aides. Participants were asked to respond to each of the one hundred items by marking one of five response categories ranging from \"exclusively or primarily the teacher-aide's responsibility to exclusively or primarily the teacher's responsibility.\" Data were analyzed statistically by use of chi-square and the .05 level of significance was chosen.Only school corporations or special education joint cooperatives employing ten or more special education teacher aides in classes for trainable and severely/profoundly mentally retarded were utilized in the study.Fifty-six of the one hundred questionnaire items met the requirements for statistical significance on the basis of a threeway group comparison at the .05 level. Subsequent, two-way chi-square tests were utilized to determine the response disparities for each possible two-way comparison among the three groups.Conclusions from the findings of the study were:1.  Perceptions held by special education administrators, special education teachers, and special                                 education teacher aides differed concerning the role of the special education teacher aide.2.   Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teacher aides perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than special education administrators and special education teachers. 3. Based upon more frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education administrators perceived the role of the special education teacher aide less clearly than special education teachers.4. Based upon less frequent involvement of statistically significant two-way comparisons, special education teachers perceived the role of the special education teacher aide more clearly than special education administrators or special education teacher aides.5. Pre-service and in-service training programs do not provide the necessary congruent role adaptation and role integration for clear definition of role and role relationships.6. Role responsibilities have not been identified for the special education teacher aide.Data supported similar findings of other researchers that I individual efficiency of the job performance of a special education teacher aide is lessened when role and role relationships are not clear.Data supported similar findings of other researchers that organizational effectiveness is lessened when the special education teacher aide is not efficient in job performance.The emergence of role and role relationships of the special education teacher aide evolved from the interaction between the special education teacher and the special education teacher aide and not through definition.The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when individual need-dispositions are not the same as the organizational expectations of the role.The possibility of conflict or incongruency may occur when role incumbents are expected to conform and perform simultaneously to different reference groups.Evaluation and supervision of the role incombents would be spurious due to different reference groups expectations.Instruction questionnaire items had the greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the special education administrators, special education teachers, and the special education teacher aides.Clerical questionnaire items had the next greatest perceptual response disparity between and among the special education administrators, special education teachers, and special education teacher aides.The least differences of perceptual response disparity regarding the role of the special education teacher aide were in the areas of supervisory and custodial duties.3" ],

  "texts" : [ "Escaping the tyranny of earned income? The failure of finance as social innovation", "Before the crisis which started in 2007, the mass marketing of retail financial products in high income countries since the early 1980s was understood through rhetorics about individual emancipation as the ‘democratisation of finance’ and ‘ownership society’, where supporters and critics debated in a shared framework. From a post 2007 perspective, it is time to revalue these developments. This paper changes the frame around the debate and constructs theextension of credit and ownership as a major social innovation led by profit seeking retail banks. It then presents empirical evidence from the United States, which suggests that the extension of credit and asset ownership in an unequal society is self defeating because it does not abolish the tyranny of earned income and, indeed, it tightens the vice insofar as low income individuals and households accumulate debt but not assets. The implication is that finance as privately led social innovation has failed and it is time for fundamental rethinking of much that has been taken for granted." ],

BACKGROUND: Building therapeutic relationships with patients and carers is a key component of the nursing role in stroke rehabilitation, although this is limited by the constraints of service organization. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was undertaken. Patients with a diagnosis of stroke were randomized to receive continued support from a stroke nurse (n = 87) or usual care and follow-up (n = 89) after discharge from hospital. Patients were recruited from two hospitals in the north-west of England from November 1999 to April 2001. Patient dependence (Barthel Index), general health (Nottingham Health Profile), activities of living (Frenchay Activity of Living Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and carer strain (Carer Strain Index) were assessed at 3 and 12 months after stroke. RESULTS: The continued intervention of a stroke nurse after discharge was associated with improved patient perceptions of general health at 12 months (median difference 42.6, P = 0.012), and in particular reduced negative emotional reaction (P = 0.037) and perceived social isolation (P = 0.002). In addition, the intervention reduced carer strain at 3 months (P = 0.045), and reduced deterioration in physical dependence from 3 to 12 months (P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: The provision of continued intervention from a stroke nurse after discharge from hospital, focusing on education and support, has tangible benefits for patients and carers." ],

  "texts" : [ "Macroalgal responses to experimental nutrient enrichment in shallow coastal waters : growth, internal nutrient pools, and isotopic signatures", "Increased nutrient inputs to temperate coastal waters have led to increased occurrences of macroalgal blooms worldwide. To identify nutrients that are limiting to macroalgae and to determine whether different forms of these nutrients and long-term ambient nutrient conditions affect macroalgal response, we used in situ enrichment methods and tested the response of 2 bloom-forming species of macroalgae, Ulva lactuca and Gracilaria tikvahiae, from shallow estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA, that receive different land-derived N inputs. We enriched caged macroalgal fronds with nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and N + P combinations, and measured growth, nutrient content, and δ15N signatures of fronds after 2 wk of incubation. In these estuaries, P did not limit growth, however, the 2 species differed in growth response to N additions. Growth of U. lactuca was greater in Childs River (CR), the estuary with higher nitrate inputs, than in Sage Lot Pond (SLP); growth in SLP increased with nitrate and ammonium enrichment. In contrast, growth of G. tikvahiae was greater in SLP than in CR, but had no growth response to N enrichment in either site. C and N contents differed initially between species and sites, and after nutrient enrichment. Final tissue % N increased and C:N decreased after nitrate and ammonium enrichment. δ15N values of the macroalgae demonstrated uptake of the experimental fertilizers, and a higher affinity and faster turnover of internal N pools with ammonium than nitrate enrichment in both species. We suggest that U. lactuca blooms in areas with both high nitrate and ammonium water column concentrations, and is more N-limited in oligotrophic waters where DIN levels are too low to sustain high growth rates. G. tikvahiae has a greater N storage capacity than U. lactuca, which may allow it to grow in less nutrient-rich waters.Author Posting. © Inter-Research, 2008.

  "texts" : [ "Case Study: “Hair meets Design”: The Application of Storytelling in the Context of Long-Distance Collaboration and Virtual Teamwork", "<p>Virtual teamwork and long distance collaboration is an increasingly attractive option in design education especially when students and other participants, (for example, industry guests or sponsors) cannot meet in the same physical place or classroom.</p>\n<p>\nThe constant improvement in technology allows this type of electronic communication to be increasingly accepted as an appropriate format for collaboration and evaluation of student projects. </p>\n<p>\nThis paper discusses the collaboration between members of a company in Germany and a group of industrial design students in California. It will present the work flow, the evaluation tools and the formats introduced during the process.</p>\n<p>\nSince the participants of this project could not meet physically to discuss and evaluate ideas, it was imperative for the teams to develop standard visual formats that were easy to understand and re-utilize. These formats had to be flexible enough for the purpose of adding comments from the evaluators. </p>\n<p>\nBecause the physical presence of the presenter is missing, it is necessary to adjust the content and layout of the messages in order to make them more relevant and self-explanatory. The message has to be easy to understand without the help of a presenter or lecturer. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the most significant questions in this project was how to present multiple “layers of information” in one single image at the same time (for example, how to depict work flow, time sequence and object hierarchy in one single frame). </p>\n<p>\nIn a normal situation (where the presenter is physically present in front of an audience) he/she can verbally add secondary information that would not be visually included but it is necessary in order to understand the relevance of the image being presented. This additional verbal information could be related to time, hierarchy, etc.</p>\n<p>\nThis paper will discuss the development and evaluation of visual formats that present multiple layers of information in one single image. It describes the methods used and reports the solutions. Ultimately, this paper explains the relevance of using storytelling in the context of long-distance design collaboration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keywords:</strong> <br />\nVirtual Teamwork; Long-Distance Collaboration; Storytelling; Infographics</p>" ],

Accurate F0 detection is very important in applications such as speech recognition and coding. This work examines the effects of demodulating a signal into its modulator and carrier parts, each bearing low and high frequency content of the signal respectively, on pitch detection accuracy. Since the carrier part is known to contain the high frequency pitch content of a speech signal, using it as an input to pitch detection algorithms proves to be beneficial in most of the tests carried out with different speakers, and under different noise levels." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Patients’ and carers’ views of quality palliative and supportive district nursing care", "Quality of care is conceptualised by professionals and in policy documents as: compliance with ‘best practice’ guidelines; improving satisfaction rates; fiscal efficiency; and ethical care. ‘Quality’ in palliative and supportive district nursing care has been conceptualised in all these ways. However, the empirical research in this area draws mostly on professionals’ and carers’ views with little research addressing patients’ views. With political rhetoric pushing for a ‘patient led’ NHS, research into how patients conceptualise quality in this area is necessary to both critique this rhetoric and/or facilitate its aims. Therefore, this research investigates patients’ and carers’ views on the quality of palliative and supportive district nursing care.Participants were recruited to an exploratory qualitative study resulting in a convenience sample of twenty six patients (all of district nursing caseloads) and thirteen carers. All participants were over eighteen, able to consent, lived in their own homes, were under the care of district nurses, and had palliative care needs. Eighteen participants had a cancer diagnosis, six had a non-malignant diagnosis, one had co-morbidities, and one participant did not disclosed their diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants, five participants were interviewed twice. Post-structuralist theories were used with discourse analysis techniques for the final analysis.The findings identify three of the most influential discourses in relation to the morality and quality of care: Firstly, ‘busyness’, and how its performance by district nurses masks patients’ and carers’ ability to critique care, instead producing a pseudo-quality which fixes patients and carers subjectivities. Secondly, ‘power/knowledge’ and the ways in which it prevents patients and carers accessing care which they need, and altering care to suit their needs. Thirdly, ‘the home’ and how it (re)forms district nursing care and district nursing care (re)forms the home; meaning that actions by district nurses must also consider the impact on the home as well as the patients and carers. In conclusion quality care may be produced by: ceasing to measure quality; involving patients and carers with commissioning and directing palliative and supportive care; supporting groups other than district nurses such as patients, carers and third parties to produce and distribute knowledge about district nursing care; increasing patients’ and carers’ ability to communicate with one another about their care.Further research may investigate: how patients and carers with palliative and supportive care needs may be involved in commissioning; the most appropriate wording and means to distribute knowledge about palliative and supportive district nursing care; ethnographic work to explore how district nursing and the home interact; more detailed theorisation of how the material and the discursive can be accounted for within post-structuralism." ],

  "texts" : [ "Black Caribbean Immigrants in the United States and their Perceptions of Racial Discrimination: Understanding the Impact of Racial Identity, Ethnic Identity and Racial Socialization", "This study sought to address an existing gap in the multicultural research literature by exploring the impact of racial identity, ethnic identity, and racial socialization on perceptions of racial discrimination among Black Caribbean immigrants to the United States. Participants included 120 English-speaking Black Caribbean immigrant adults who completed a survey consisting of: a demographic information sheet, the Black Racial Identity Attitude Scale - Long Form (RIAS-L), the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), the Teenager Experience of Racial Socialization Scale (TERS), and the Perceived Racism Scale (PRS). A Pearson's correlational analysis found significant relationships between racial identity and ethnic identity, with the racial identity status attitudes Encounter, Immersion-Emersion, and Internalization being positively related to overall ethnic identity. Linear regression analyses were then conducted using racial socialization as a predictor variable and racial identity status attitudes as well as overall ethnic identity as criterion variables. Significant positive relationships were found between racial socialization and the racial identity status attitudes Encounter, Immersion-Emersion, and Internalization, as well as between racial socialization and overall ethnic identity. Two simple linear regressions were initially conducted in order to determine whether racial socialization might be predictive of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year as well as the lifetime. Significant positive relationships were found between racial socialization and perceived racism scores for both the year and the lifetime. Further regression analyses also found the racial socialization factor Cultural Alertness to Discrimination (CAD) to be a unique positive predictor of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year as well as the lifetime. Subsequent hierarchical regression analyses later indicated that racial socialization significantly predicted perceptions of racial discrimination for the year and the lifetime above and beyond racial identity. Racial socialization was also a significant predictor of perceptions of racial discrimination for the year and the lifetime after accounting for overall ethnic identity. Finally, MANOVA results indicated that first generation and second generation participants differed significantly on: the racial identity status attitude Encounter, overall ethnic identity, as well as the racial socialization factor Cultural Alertness to Discrimination (CAD). In sum, findings from the current study suggest that racial socialization experiences have a substantial impact on perceptions of racial discrimination and play an important role in racial and ethnic identity development. Implications for research and practice are discussed" ],

  "title" : "Neural correlates of auditory word processing in infants and adults",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Neural correlates of auditory word processing in infants and adults", "For the majority of people, words are first learned and are communicated in high proportions in the auditory modality. However, the neural dynamics underlying speech perception are poorly understood. Even more limited, is knowledge of the neurophysiological processes and neuroanatomical structures that afford developing language abilities in infants. This dissertation investigates these issues in a series of related studies that are aimed at characterizing the spatial and temporal neural dynamics of auditory word processing in both developing 12-19 month old infants and adults. The first study, performed in adults, reveals new evidence for a neural response that is selective for auditory words, relative to acoustically- matched control sounds. This response appears to index a stage in speech processing wherein an incoming word sound is translated from an acoustic signal into a linguistically relevant code. This information can then be passed along the speech processing stream so that eventually the appropriate meaning of a word can be selected amongst representations stored within associative left fronto-temporal networks. The second study, performed in both adults and 12-18 month old infants, demonstrates that the neural mechanism responsible for encoding lexico-semantic word information has similar spatial and temporal characteristics in infants and adults. Prior work has not been able to establish whether infants and adults share similar neural substrates for language, and these findings suggest that the neurophysiological processes important for word understanding reside within similar neural networks throughout the lifespan. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the regional neuroanatomical changes that take place in the developing cortex of 12-19 month old- infants, the third study examines age-related changes tissues signal properties assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. This a period in development that is pivotal for emerging linguistic, cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors, however, the maturational changes that occur brain structures are poorly understood at these ages. This study reveals large changes in structural measures within precisely the specific areas that were demonstrated to generate lexico-semantic activity in study two. Together, these studies help to advance current understanding of neurophysiological processing stages and neural structures involved in auditory word processing in both the developing and mature brain. These findings invite a host of new studies that will continue to further knowledge of how speech processing is instantiated within the brain. Finally, with the use of multimodal imaging techniques such as those described in the present studies, there is increasing potential for new research aimed at understanding the neurobiological underpinning of language and other cognitive behaviors" ],

Imatinib was evaluated both alone and in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) primary cultures and established cell lines representing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib. This work demonstrates a synergistic interaction between cisplatin and imatinib, which may prove to be clinically relevant in the future management of both ACC and HNSCC." ],

  "texts" : [ "Interpersonal dynamics: a communitarian perspective", "<p>Conventional theories of power within organisations focus on the extent to which one party can impose their will on others through social influence. Discussion of the way that same-sex and opposite-sex attraction impacts on the workplace is rarely theorised either because it is considered uncivilised or taboo. Investigations are also hampered by resistance amongst research participants even when care is taken to establish mixed groups from different organisations. As a result, holistic theories of management control that take account of sexual behaviour remain rare.  </p>\n<p>This paper examines empirical data from an 18-month critical ethnography to present new theory on interpersonal dynamics, socialisation and identification. A grounded theory is developed that suggests social decisions are closely linked to the psychology of giving and getting attention and\nassistance. As relationships develop, patterns of giving and receiving create economic and social dependencies that evolve into the tacit rules of social life and affect the bonds between people.</p>\n<p>Sharp conflicts occur when one party wants to change the relationship and the other party resists.  The process of renegotiation affects the stability of directly and indirectly affected relationships and\ncan change patterns of influence and bases of social power.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Competitiveness and Technological Upgrading in Global Value Chains: Evidence from the Indonesian Electronics and Garment Sectors", "Indonesia is a rapidly growing and internationally competitive economy that is well integrated into globalised production systems. The global value chain (GVC) model has proven a popular analytical framework to explain how global lead firms structure and organise global production through dispersed global suppliers. Indonesia’s leading export sectors, garments and electronics, are well integrated into GVCs. Engagement in GVCs, often led by leading global brands, is seen as a basis for local producers to become globally competitive and to grow. It also comes with challenges – local producers must meet the demanding pressures from lead firms on prices, on-time delivery, product quality, and social, environmental and labour standards. The possibilities for local producers to learn, acquire new capabilities and upgrade to enhance their competitiveness are often conditioned by the nature of ties that they have with their global lead firms. Yet, this paper argues, the GVC model fails to recognise agency on the part of local firms in this learning process. Moreover, particular forms of governance arrangements within GVC ties can restrict prospects for local producers to enhance capabilities and upgrade. Drawing on selected case study evidence from the Indonesian garments and electronics sectors, the paper explores the relationship between distinct types of GVC engagements and firm level learning and upgrading, and considers how some GVC ties may restrict upgrading." ],

  "texts" : [ "[[alternative]]Interacting with Ishikawa：A study of Watercolor Artworks Created by Ni Jiang-huai, Ran In-ting, Lee Tze-fan", "[[abstract]]Art in any form is used to carry for future generations the culture, life style and times of a generation. Art education is needed to interpret the message carried in these work of art, be it poetry, dance, painting, etc. to common people. In the present theses an attempt is made to bring out the efforts of three great artists of Taiwan who lived during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. We have come to know a lot of the lives of the people of Taiwan and its semitropical landscapes through their simple water color paintings. In the days their masterpieces still stand out.  \n    The art education in the Japanese colonial period laid the foundation for the fine arts movement in Taiwan. The older generation painters lived under an unequal and arduous environment of the education system, but still demonstrated the firm endurance of the people of this island. \nMr. Ishikawa came to Taiwan to teach art paining. The young painters of that time came under his influence and were encouraged and inspired by him. His influence is diverse. The Taiwanese youth of that time learned to observe their own native landscape, paint from live real life scenery they observe. They also pursued scholarly work such as teaching painting methodology, aesthetic values, attitude of conducting oneself, etc. Students admired and absorbed from the teacher's kind, humorous, witty, graceful, elegant and simple manners. They learned to apply these elegant artistic views, transformed in a perceptible manner, into their one's own artistic creation. Mr. Ishikawa was also responsible for activating an art that needs deeper thinking. \nMr. Ishikawa's painting skills and techniques are seen in the graceful brush strokes in painting and calligraphy. His simple and elegant style brought life into the paintings of the native landscape. They also represent his life full of aesthetics. Mr. Ishikawa carried the nostalgia and romanticism of his native land into his painting of the Taiwanese landscape and they represent the view as seen through the eyes of a Japanese painter. Did his students reflect this phenomenon in their paintings? No. His disciples, while describing the natural beauty of the scenery of Taiwan, brought the beautiful expression, representing local culture and reality. \nIn the application of color, Mr. Ishikawa used hues that are light, fresh and elegant that are characteristic of the Japanese culture and surroundings, with contrast colors emphasizing on the visual impact. The work of the disciples on the other hand reflects the thick strongly fragrant colors of the national characteristic such as bright sunshine, the misty subtropical environment, with gorgeous tones representing straight and passionate styles. \nOn the painting skills, Mr. Ishikawa gives more importance to the technique than the feelings. Thus his technique brings out his feelings. He expressed the rhythm of color and light to represent beauty. He also used a combination of light and colors to give a depth to his paintings. The lines in his paintings are smooth and move fluently. His first student Mr. Ni Jiang-huai followed Mr. Ishikawa’s technique and style totally all through his life. Mr. Ran In-ting is a naturally gifted painter and learnt his skills fully from his teacher. While his paintings reflect the mastery of his teacher they also show a development of his own style. His paintings reflect his feelings. He used his concept to lead his feelings. He draws lines confidently bringing about dramatic effects. His paintings also reflect the rich Chinese style. Mr. Lee Tze-fan, the third student of Mr. Ishikawa shows loving care for the feeling of the land while observing social life deeply. He was involved in presenting real life in his paintings showing the value of people and culture. His painting style is down to earth being steady, rich, and sincere. On the whole, the artistic work of Mr. Ran, In-ting and Mr. Lee Tze-fan reflect the inner heart and the external reality of the social and cultural life and environment of their times.\nThrough insistence and persistence, the three disciples of Ishikawa laid a foundation to the art of water color painting while observing and presenting the special natural conditions and social customs in Taiwan in their paintings. Through their spontaneous feelings and a long time practice they established their faith in watercolor paintings. They used their own eyes to examine the natural beauty of their land closely and presented it to their viewers through their paintings. Thus their paintings represent the scenery as seen through their eyes and reflect the natural pulsation, temperature, the shades, the real hues, tone and chrome of color of Taiwan Landscape. They present trough their paintings the surrounds, the sunshine, the seas, the meadows, the scents in the air and a tropical pastoral image of the beautiful Land of Taiwan for the posterity. Their paintings preserve the collective history of Taiwan and are a witness to the development of art movement in Taiwan. \nThrough their efforts and break-troughs Ishikawa and his brilliant students left behind foot prints taken one at a time revealing the glory of the great artists. From this we see their firm strength as they go from simplicity to complexity. As it is said that to be simple is the most difficult sometimes and greatness lies in simplicity. The proof for this, as in mathematics, comes from the theater of the human life and is no exception as seen from the foot prints left by these great artists. \nThe researcher realizes that it is important to trace the history of art education in Taiwan. In the past hundred years the art in Taiwan has grown leaps and bounds with the focus shifting to oil paintings. But the water color paintings of these three students of Ishikawa cannot be ignored. Let us cherish the memory of Mr. Ni Jiang-huai, Mr. Ran In-ting, and Mr. Lee Tze-fan who gave their lives to the promotion of water color paintings. I present my most profound and heartfelt respects to all of them through this thesis.\nThis study focuses on these developments in six chapters which will discuss the theoretical and structural basis of the research. In addition, art works are also provided as supporting evidence.\nChapter one introduces, the research background and motivation, the purpose, method, range, restrictions and structure. Chapter two documents discussions, about the introduction of research backgrounds related to this research. It is divided into the research of Taiwan art history during Japanese colonial period, art education history of that period, a history of landscape painting development, research into the paintings from western world and Japan, and history of the development of watercolor painting in Japan and Taiwan. Chapter three introduces the main part, i. e. Mr. Ishikawa interacting with his students. It also includes Mr. Ishikawa’s personal life history, his education methodology, aesthetic concepts, art works, and his influence and contributions. To prevent the appearance of a bias, a brief mention is also made of other students who learned from Mr. Ishikawa besides Mr. Ni, Mr. Ran, and Mr. Lee. Chapter four gives an account of about the personal life history, special personality traits, attitude of creating, the way they looked at the nature, artistic concepts, aesthetic views, the statements from other people about the painter, the contributions, and the watercolor works of Mr. Ni, Mr. Ran, and Mr. Lee. Chapter five gives a comparison of the teacher and his students. It relates to their art works, describes how the official exhibitions influenced their standing in society, and acted as means to compare their works in content and form, and how the disciples went out on their own paths finally to create their individual unique styles. Chapter six the gives the conclusions based on the points raised in this study and takes personal responsibility for the shortcomings in the presentation." ],

This chapter provides adiscussion of synthetic efforts toward these intriguing alkaloids, in addition to detaileddescriptions of several recently completed total syntheses. Chapter two discusses an efficientmethod to access the fused indoline ring system present in a multitude of bioactive molecules.The strategy involves the condensation of hydrazines with latent aldehydes to ultimately deliverindoline-containing products by way of an interrupted Fischer indolization sequence. Themethod is convergent, mild, operationally simple, broad in scope, and can be used to accessenantioenriched products. In addition, the synthesis of furoindoline and pyrrolidinoindolinenatural products is demonstrated by the concise formal total syntheses of physovenine andii idebromoflustramine B. Chapter three explores the mechanisms of the Fischer indole synthesisand competing cleavage pathways with SCS-MP2/6-31G(d) and aqueous solvation calculations.Electron-donating substituents divert the reaction pathway to heterolytic N-N bond cleavage andpreclude the acid-promoted [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Chapters four reports the totalsynthesis of (±)-aspidophylline A, one of many complex furoindoline-containing alkaloids thathas not been synthesized previously. Our route features a number of key transformations,including a Heck cyclization to assemble the [3.3.1]-bicyclic scaffold, as well as a late-stageinterrupted Fischer indolization to install the furoindoline and construct the natural product'spentacyclic framework." ],

Such systems are characterized by real time information feedback in their operations and management, and by increasing levels of automation of their various components. The challenges to planning stem from the increased range and added complexity of the choices available to transportation planners. The implementation of IVHS technologies, many of which have system-wide implications will require a change in the institutional arrangements that are currently at work m transportation planning. Recent legislation, such as ISTEA and the California Congestion Management Program, has also posed a challenge to transportation planning as it requires specific processes and imposes certain mandates." ],

  "texts" : [ "A prototypic mathematical model of the human hair cycle.", "The human hair cycle is a complex, dynamic organ-transformation process during which the hair follicle repetitively progresses from a growth phase (anagen) to a rapid apoptosis-driven involution (catagen) and finally a relative quiescent phase (telogen) before returning to anagen. At present no theory satisfactorily explains the origin of the hair cycle rhythm. Based on experimental evidence we propose a prototypic model that focuses on the dynamics of hair matrix keratinocytes. We argue that a plausible feedback-control structure between two key compartments (matrix keratinocytes and dermal papilla) leads to dynamic instabilities in the population dynamics resulting in rhythmic hair growth. The underlying oscillation consists of an autonomous switching between two quasi-steady states. Additional features of the model, namely bistability and excitability, lead to new hypotheses about the impact of interventions on hair growth. We show how in silico testing may facilitate testing of candidate hair growth modulatory agents in human HF organ culture or in clinical trials." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Vitamin k deficiency is associated with incident knee osteoarthritis.", "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, with knee osteoarthritis being the leading cause of lower extremity disability among older adults in the US. There are no treatments available to prevent the structural pathology of osteoarthritis. Because of vitamin K's role in regulating skeletal mineralization, it has potential to be a preventative option for osteoarthritis. We therefore examined the relation of vitamin K to new-onset radiographic knee osteoarthritis and early osteoarthritis changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Subjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study had knee radiographs and MRI scans obtained at baseline and 30 months later, and plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K) measured at baseline. We examined the relationship of subclinical vitamin K deficiency to incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions and osteophytes, respectively, using log binomial regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 1180 participants (62% women, mean age 62±8 years, mean body mass index 30.1±5.1 kg/m(2)), subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis (risk ratio [RR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.25) and cartilage lesions (RR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.05-5.40) compared with no deficiency, but not with osteophytes (RR 2.35; 95% CI, 0.54-10.13). Subclinically vitamin K-deficient subjects were more likely to develop osteoarthritis in one or both knees than neither knee (RR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75 and RR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.24, respectively). CONCLUSION: In the first such longitudinal study, subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with increased risk of developing radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions. Further study of vitamin K is warranted given its therapeutic/prophylactic potential for osteoarthritis." ],

  "texts" : [ "Travel Choices in Pedestrian Versus Automobile Oriented Neighborhoods", "The New Urbanism movement calls for redesigning American neighborhoods so that they are less oriented toward automobile travel and more conducive to walking, bicycling, and transit riding, especially for non-work trips. New Urbanism calls for a return to compact neighborhoods with grid-like street patterns, mixed land uses, and pedestrian amenities. This paper investigates the effects of New Urbanism design principles on both non-work and commuting travel by comparing modal splits between two distinctly different neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. The neo-traditional neighborhood, Rockridge, and the nearby conventional suburban community, Lafayette, were chosen as case studies because they have similar income profiles, freeway and transit service levels, and geographical locations. Rockridge residents averaged around a 10 percent higher share of non-work trips by non-automobile modes than did residents of Lafayette, controlling for relevant factors like income and transit service levels. The greatest differences were for shop trips under one mile. Modal splits were more similar for work trips, confirming the proposition that neighborhood design practices exert their greatest influence on local shopping trips and other non-work purposes. For work trips, compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented development appears to have the strongest effect on access trips to rail stations, in particular inducing higher shares of access trips by foot and bicycle." ],

  "title" : "The Ranking of Financing Methods in Urban Old Texture (Case Study of Isfahan City)",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Ranking of Financing Methods in Urban Old Texture (Case Study of Isfahan City)", "Extended abstract1- IntroductionAging and building of old texture, in various forms, including the reduction or loss of viability conditions and safety problems as well as physical, social, economic and infrastructural can be received and identified. The essential need for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the urban old textures is the development of environment for humans. The necessary requirements are socio - cultural and economic (Shamaei and Pourahmad, 2006: 43).The first thing to be considered in this regard is the ways of providing financial tools for this issue (Jafarzadeh, M. and Jannati, M. 2009:525). According to the latest estimates of Reconstruction Organization of Tehran (2010), the total volume of old textures in country is 65,000 acres. The cost of developing infrastructures of urban old textures is estimated to be about 100 billion Rials per acre and the time needed to reconstruct all old textures, with allocation of current resources and regardless of erosion growth, is 78 years. This shows that because reconstruction and rehabilitation of this enormous volume of urban old textures are capital intensive, they requires a lot of time.  On the other hand, providing required capital is not in the ability of the government, the Municipality or the banking system and it needs more and more private sector's partnership through applying financing tools in financial markets.  In this research, the issue is being addressed by studying the most important and useful financing tools for reconstructing and rehabilitating urban old textures and also studying the important criteria for choosing a suitable financing tool applying AHP.This research is applied and its method is a descriptive one of survey field. Using survey field and library studies, most of the tools which could be used to reconstruct and rehabilitate old urban texture in a way that they have operational experience in large cities and the criteria considered choosing a good financing tool are studied. The spatial domain of current research is financial experts of \"reconstruction and rehabilitation organization of Isfahan city\" and \"Isfahan Municipality\". Time zone of this research is from December 2009 to December 2010. 2-Theoretical basesThe required capital for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the whole old urban textures, according to rehabilitation organization of Tehran's estimates, is 5 times bigger than government budget in 2010 and 59 times bigger than all Municipalities of Iran in 2008. This subject demonstrates that providing required capital is not merely in capabilities of the public sector or Municipality (Ranjbarian, 2010, p.142). But it needs the widely usage of financial markets and the financial tools which is possible via more cooperation between both public and private sectors.From a theoretical perspective, the concept of the cooperation between public and private sectors is related to the \"X-efficiency\" theory which was introduced in 1966 by American economist Harvey Leibenstein (1922-1993). According to his view, until the public economic institutions and enterprises receive official blessing of financial resources and enough monetary policy for release, offset and limit their possible failure, they will never go bankrupt. Kargar (2004), Moezzi Moghadam (2004) and Akbari and Tavasoli (2009) also pointed out the instability and insufficiency of Municipalities' revenue. Providing large amount of capital for reconstruction and rehabilitation of old textures is not possible without cooperation with private sector and collecting people's savings by applying various financing tools in a way that can be used in old texture. Hans Klijn, Erik et al. (2002), believed that because of the instability of the revenues of local government (inelasticity of income cods and reverse impact of increasing the rates of complication on income earned by the municipality) and on the other hand, the increase in these kind of services, local governments have no choice but to bring the private sector's resources. Also, Michael Foster (1995), considering the private sector's role in urban projects, believes that in a situation which the governments because of the economic fluctuations and limitations of financial resources are not able to provide service spaces, the private sector's capitals can well make profit and meantime help in rehabilitation and enhancing urban service usages.By studying financial structure of countries, we find out that basically financial structure of any country can be put on the two main money market or capital markets and according to it, the financing ways lie in two following categories:  -Asset-based financial -Debt-based financial In developed countries, the capital market mostly is the central part of financial structure. By contrast, in most of developing nations, money market is the financing way which causes the companies to be largely dependent on the banking system to meet their financial needs (Dadras Moghaddam and Parivash, 2009: 338(.Asset-based financial method needs transferring part of the project profit for getting capital. The main asset-based financing method which can be used in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures are:  -Assets securitization-Project-shareholders-Sale yards-Private sector participation and investmentDebt-based financing method involves the amount of money that the investor has barrowed and should repay with its interest during a period of time. The main debt-based financing methods which can be used in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures according to the study of Najjarzadeh, Jannati and Farhadi (2009) and Mashhad, Isfahan and Tehran reports include the following: -The deposit and lending system-The use of foreign finance-Foreign investment-The private sector participation and investmentThis research uses Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the priority of the most important financing methods used for reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures and to study the criteria influence the choice of suitable financing tool.Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the best and most accurate methods of ranking and deciding based on several criteria. AHP implementation in a decision involves four phases: the construction of a hierarchy, performing paired comparisons, calculating weights, system compatibility assessment.3-DiscussionThe final results of this research show that the private sector participation with final weight of 0.323 is the best financing method for reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban old textures according to the research's criteria. The risk in this method is much less than in other financing methods. Also, the private sector participation in higher return rate criteria with the relative rate of 0.319 is in first place. The cost of this method is low and only the cost of the money providing process is higher in this method comparing to the others. But the relative weight of the cost of money providing criteria in comparison to the other ones is lower; thus in general, it has not changed the private sector participation rank. After that the private sector investment comes in the second place with its final weight of 0.235. This method is in the first place in low risk criteria. According to return rate criteria, it is in second place after the private sector participation with the relative rate of 0.293. The costs of this method, in comparison to the others, were high. But the importance of cost measure in comparison to the other criteria is low and about 0.091; it has not changed the private sector investment place. The project- shareholder method with final weight of 0.178 comes after and in the second place among all methods. This method has the least cost and its rank according to private sector participation with the relative rate of 0.227 is the second. But according to the budget provided and higher return rates, it is in the fourth rank. The sale yards method with final weight of 0.135 has the fourth rank. This method according to lower cost measure with the relative weight of 0.183 is in the third place. Considering the return rate criteria, it has the least return among the other methods with the relative rate of 0.112. Also, the risk is higher in this method comparing to the others and with the relative rate of 0.197 it is in the fourth place.The banks funding method with the relative weight of 0.129 has the fifth or the last rank. The results of this research do not suggest applying this method in comparison to the other methods introduced in current study. This method has the highest risk and the lowest cooperation of the private sector. Considering the measures of the cost of the money providing process and financial costs, it has the fourth rank. Also, according to the return rate and the budget provided with the relative weight of 0.147 and 0.138, respectively has the third rank.     5- ConclusionAlthough government officials are aware of the importance of executing the project, but government aids to this community is at least and the rules are not supporting using government facilities.As the results showed, the method of private sector participation with total weight of 0.323 is the best method for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture. Thus, government officials need to consider this and provide required facilities to supply bonds. Also, according to results, the private sector investment with final weight of 0.235 is in the second place in financing methods priority. On the other hand, considering the advantages of this method and also its high place in ranking due to criteria, more attention is needed. The bank funding method with relative weight of 0.129 has the last or fifth ranking. The results do not suggest applying this method comparing to the other financing methods used in this research.6- Suggestions -The results show that the private investment with final weight of 0.235 is in the second place in financing methods priority. On the other hand, considering the advantages of this method and also its high place in ranking due to criteria, more attention should be given to it.-As the results showed, the method of private sector participation is the best method for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture. Thus, government officials need to consider this and provide required facilities to supply bonds.-To use private sector resources, whether in the form of investing in a project or the owner's participation, well and on time announcement of project's conditions is one of the main preconditions and advertisement and announcement are among the items which yet no investment is done for them and we can say that this is one of the problems in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of projects and solving it can be very useful for financing resources.  -The rate of return was one important criterion in current research to attract private sector's partnership. So, it is necessary to consider profit rate in financing methods in a way that private sector's capitals instead of being invested in banks, be used in profitable urban projects which will either bring more economic profit or make the city more beautiful, healthier and with more and better services. -Designing new financing methods for reconstructing and rehabilitating old urban texture considering the criteria ranking of this research.Also, it is suggested that in the case of using AHP method, try to have more variation in financing methods.Key words: Financing, Partnership, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Old texture, Analytic Hierarchy Process AHPReferencesAkbari, N and Zahedi Keyvan, M.

  "texts" : [ "The influence of dietary intake on the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system across three ethnic groups: a population-based study.", "OBJECTIVE: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Since dietary factors and ethnicity are considered contributory to the development of these diseases, we examined the IGF system in relation to nutritional intake by ethnic group. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Dietary intake in 257 subjects of White European, African-Caribbean and Pakistani ethnic origin living in Manchester, UK was assessed using ethnic-group-specific food-frequency questionnaires to assess habitual nutrient intake over the previous 12 months. Fasting IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations were determined and their relationship to specific dietary constituents was analysed. RESULTS: Analysis by quintiles of nutrient intake showed a significant increase in circulating IGF-I concentration with increasing dietary fat intake (F for trend=3.9, ), saturated fat intake and for protein intake There was also a significant increase in IGF-II by quintiles of dietary protein intake There was a trend for increasing IGF-I with increasing energy intake. The relationships between circulating concentration of IGFBP-1, an acute regulator of IGF action, and fat/protein intake were opposite to those for IGF-I and IGF-II. Multiple linear regression modelling showed that people of Pakistani origin and older subjects had lower levels of IGF-I (Pakistani origin vs. others, ) (age, for both). There was an independent inverse relationship between IGF-I and dietary carbohydrate intake CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for a dietary contribution to regulation of the IGF system, although the effects of ethnicity on circulating IGF levels remain dominant. We propose that the IGF system's influences on cancer risk in specific ethnic groups are potentially modifiable by dietary intervention." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Essays in corporate finance", "This thesis contributes to the empirical literature on how firms meet exceptional financing needs in relation to “investment spikes” or years with unusually large investment activities. In the earlier part of the thesis, I show that the financing of investment during an investment spike is very different from that at other times. I have done this using data for publicly traded US firms over the period 1988 to 2007 and a filtering procedure suggested by Bond et al. (2006). Specifically, external finance, in particular debt finance, is very important in financing investment in years categorized as investment spikes, confirming the findings of Mayer and Sussman (2005). In addition, it has been found that firms with smaller size, lower profitability, more future growth opportunities, fewer tangible assets and more R&D spending tend to use more equity finance in relation to large investment requirements. I also propose the use of the Markov-switching filter to identify investment spikes. In implementing the Markov-switching filter, I apply a first-order two-state Markov-switching mean model to the investment rates de-trended using Hodrick and Prescott's (1997) filter. A Gibbs-sampling procedure is used to produce the marginal posterior distributions of unobserved state variables and model parameters. Among other advantages, this filter allows us to identify multi-year investment spikes. I show that two-year investment spikes identified by the Markov-switching filter are financed quite similarly to single-year investment spikes and that main findings are robust to calendar-time-dependent clustering of investment spikes generated by macroeconomic shocks.  In the later part of the thesis, I find there is a positive effect of share liquidity on the propensity to raise debt finance. Using a sample of firm-year observations identified as investment spikes, I find that firms with more liquid shares tend to rely more heavily on debt to finance investment spikes. This result is robust to a control for the effects of firm size and other firm characteristics, the use of various leverage measures, and the use of a whole sample with investment spike characteristics. Another important finding is that firms with more liquid shares tend to have higher target leverage ratios. One interpretation of these results is that information spillovers from the presence of more informative share prices allow firms with more liquid shares to borrow on more favourable terms in normal times, as well as to obtain additional debt finance at lower costs when taking advantage of unusually large investment opportunities.This thesis is not currently available via ORA." ],

The quantity of rice imports was considered as a function of factors such as the amount of the lagged import, exchange rate, external reserves, structural adjustment programme (SAP), per capita income and import price of rice. However, quantitative estimates, based on cointegration and error correction specification using the Bound's testing approach, indicate that per capita income is the most important determinant of rice import in Nigeria. The results further alludes that, the error correction mechanism (ECM) indicated a feedback of about 16.9 % of the previous year's disequilibrium from long-run wheat import.&nbsp; It is concluded that for the Nigerian government to reduce importation of rice in the face of increasing rice demand without exacerbating food security problem, then Nigeria should as a matter of urgency put in place policy measures that will significantly improve local rice production and processing. &nbsp; KEYWORDS: Rice, demand, import, SAP, ARDL, error correction mechanism, co-integration" ],

Citizenship from this\nperspective is both expressed in and influenced by civil society struggles, while being\nconstrained by external and structural forces such as globalisation and neo-liberal influences.\nThis thesis examines the interconnections between three key pillars of citizenship in this\ncontext – access to material or livelihood resources and opportunities, educational access and\ncapability requirements, and civil society contestation.\nStructural constraints continue to exist at national or policy level to ‘historically\ndisadvantaged’ (‘black’ and ‘coloured’) groups gaining full citizenship. Socio-economic and\neducational capability requirements are important exclusionary factors in terms of access to\nlivelihood resources and opportunities, including language and literacy requirements\noperating through bureaucratic or politically mediated processes. The analyses use the\nexample of marine resource access for small-scale, informal economy workers to\ndemonstrate these practices. In access to adult education and training opportunities, gaps and\ninequities in infrastructure and provision continue to form the major constraint. In both of\nthese strands of access, accountability of policy-makers, political leaders and decisionmakers\nis a key issue.\nCivil society activities represent one of the few available avenues for challenging inequities,\ndrawing on local action as well as international networks. Civil society efforts have resulted\nin some gains regarding access to marine resources and in pushing for recognition of\ncitizenship for small-scale fishers. This thesis argues that it is the contestation and\ncooperation that has occurred between civil society and government that creates the space in\nwhich citizenship has been expanded and contested, rather than civil society activities alone.\nUltimately, however, overcoming these challenges is likely to require wider interventions,\nincluding a more enabling policy environment and greater access to intermediate skills\ndevelopment." ],

  "title" : "Liquid Gold: Breast Milk Banking in the United States",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Liquid Gold: Breast Milk Banking in the United States", "Over the course of the 20th Century, breast milk banks have facilitated the exchange of breast milk from mothers with an excess supply to infants in need. But while early banks used a seller model, purchasing milk as a commodity from lower class women, today banks use a donor model, relying on middle class women who give their milk away as a gift. This dissertation explores why the commodified model of breast milk banking first arose, and why banked breast milk was giftified (but still commodified) by the end of the century. I use content analysis of institutional records from three banks operating in three different eras, and interviews with current milk bank managers, donors, and parents of recipients to address these questions. My analysis indicates that in each era a confluence of factors, in particular women's employment, conceptions of motherhood, medical practices and beliefs, and technologies shapes the exchange of banked breast milk. In the early 20th century new technologies made the physical disembodiment of breast milk possible, while mothering practices and medical authorities' preferences promoted breast milk's symbolic disembodiment, promoting the milk's commodification, while limited employment opportunities created a pool of willing sellers. During the 1960s new mothering practices and related changes in physicians' preferences sacralized the milk, making its sale by mothers culturally inappropriate. Today, high levels of maternal employment and portable, efficient breast pumps create an excess supply of milk that mothers are loath to dispose of due to its sacralized status, sustaining the donor model. But banks still sell the milk as a commodity, albeit a non-profit one, to parents who use the milk both as food and as a form of good parenting in a bottle. Breast milk banking therefore involves both gift and commodity exchange. And as interviews with donors and parents of recipients demonstrate, many middle class donors want to be paid, while middle class parents who purchase the milk reject the idea of donor compensation, pointing to breast milk's ambiguous status even among those intimately involved in its exchange, and the role of social class in mediating actors' perceptions and experiences." ],

  "title" : "Heterogeneity-awareness in multithreaded multicore processors",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Heterogeneity-awareness in multithreaded multicore processors", "During the last decades, Computer Architecture has experienced a great series of revolutionary changes. The increasing transistor count on a single chip has led to some of the main milestones in the field, from the release of the first Superscalar (1965) to the state-of-the-art Multithreaded Multicore Architectures, like the Intel Core i7 (2009).Moore's Law has continued for almost half of a century and is not expected to stop for at least another decade, and perhaps much longer. Moore observed a trend in the process technology advances. So, the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit has increased exponentially, doubling approximately every two years. Nevertheless, having more available transistors can not be always directly translated into having more performance.The complexity of state-of-the-art software has reached heights unthinkable in prior ages, both in terms of the amount of computation and the complexity involved. If we deeply analyze this complexity in software we would realize that software is comprised of smaller execution processes that, although maintaining certain spatial/temporal locality, imply an inherently heterogeneous behavior. That is, during execution time the hardware executes very different portions of software, with huge differences in terms of behavior and hardware requirements. This heterogeneity in the behaviour of the software is not specific of the latest videogame, but it is inherent to software programming itself, since the very beginning of Algorithmics.In this PhD dissertation we deeply analyze the inherent heterogeneity present in software behavior. We identify the main issues and sources of this heterogeneity, that hamper most of the state-of-the-art processor designs from obtaining their maximum potential. Hence, the heterogeneity in software turns most of the current processors, commonly called general-purpose processors, into overdesigned. That is, they have much more hardware resources than really needed to execute the software running on them. This fact would not represent a main problem if we were not concerned on the additional power consumption involved in software computation.The final goal of this PhD dissertation consists in assigning each portion of software exactly the amount of hardware resources really needed to fully exploit its maximal potential; without consuming more energy than the strictly needed. That is, obtaining complexity-effective executions using the inherent heterogeneity in software behavior as steering indicator. Thus, we start deeply analyzing the heterogenous behaviour of the software run on top of general-purpose processors and then matching it on top of a heterogeneously distributed hardware, which explicitly exploit heterogeneous hardware requirements. Only by being heterogeneity-aware in software, and appropriately matching this software heterogeneity on top of hardware heterogeneity, may we effectively obtain better processor designs.The PhD dissertation is comprised of four main contributions that cover both multithreaded single-core (hdSMT) and multicore (TCA Algorithm, hTCA Framework and MFLUSH) scenarios, deeply explained in their corresponding chapters in the PhD dissertation memory. Overall, these contributions cover a significant range of the Heterogeneity-Aware Processors' design space. Within this design space, we have focused on the state-of-the-art trend in processor design: Multithreaded Multicore (CMP+SMT) Processors.We make special emphasis on the MPsim simulation tool, specifically designed and developed for this PhD dissertation. This tool has already gone beyond this PhD dissertation, becoming a reference tool by an important group of researchers spread over the Computer Architecture Department (DAC) at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC)." ],

We propose a systematic requirements-driven approach for BP design and configuration management that uses requirements goal models to capture alternative process configurations and provides the ability to tailor deployed processes to changing business priorities or customer preferences (i.e., non-functional constraints)  by configuring their corresponding goal models at the goal level. A set of design time and runtime tools for configuring business processes implemented using WS-BPEL is provided, allowing to easily change the behaviour of deployed BP instances at a high level, based on business priorities and stakeholder preferences" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Analysis and design of interference-limited wireless systems", "This thesis is concerned with the performance analysis and design of interference-limited wireless systems. Specifically, we consider wireless systems where transmissions from potential interferers are uncoordinated, i.e., there is no scheduling for the purpose of interference management. Special emphasis is placed on how the spatial distribution of the interferers affects the statistical characteristics of the interference power. The first topic we address is the performance analysis of the downlink of a cellular frequency-hopping multiple-access system, where coherent detection is employed. Channel estimation is performed with the help of hopping patterns which are broadcasted by the base-station and tracked by different users in the cell. In a time and frequency correlated channel, we identify which patterns result in the best performance in terms of the bit-error-probability at the receiver. We then consider the effect of the interference from the base-station of an adjacent cell and assess the importance of interference side information at the receiver on the bit-error-probability. The second topic we focus on is the analysis of random single-hop networks. The model we consider is that of a homogeneous Poisson point process of transmitters, each with a RX at a fixed distance. We evaluate the packet error probability and the network transmission capacity when the channel, consisting of fading and interference, is constant or varying during the packet transmission. The impact of coding, spatial diversity and multiple-stream transmission on the network capacity is identified with closed-form expressions in the small packet error probability regime. The third and final topic addressed is the evaluation of the mean end-to-end delay in random multi-hop networks. We extend the single-hop network model employed previously to accommodate routes, each consisting of a source, a number of relays and a final destination. Combining tools from the analysis of single-hop networks with queuing theory we derive a closed-form expression for the mean end-to-end delay over the typical route. The number of relays and their placement are determined such that the delay is minimized, for different packet arrival scenarios at the sources" ],

  "texts" : [ "Tax Savings as a Provision of Corporate Welfare is a State-Corporate Crime When it Becomes Socially Injurious", "This study focuses on the corporate welfare provided by the US government to corporations despite their high profits and argues that the significant and negative consequences to the federal and state tax bases of such welfare make it a state corporate crime.  Failure to stabilize or rollback corporate welfare initiatives has resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of federal and state revenue that comes from corporate tax contributions.  I use structural equation modeling to analyze the consequences of corporate welfare initiatives on the federal tax base and the California state tax base.  Drawing insights from an integrated theory of state-corporate crime developed by Kauzlarich and Kramer (1998), I examine various forms of deviance and collusion between corporations and the federal government.  Specifically, this study explores this collusion on two levels: the structural and organizational levels. That is, I focus on the period before, during and after the implementation of corporate welfare initiatives and the organizational environment of the two groups involved.  This study reveals that the federal government facilitated state corporate crime in this case by continuing to provide tax breaks, investment incentives, and loans to corporations despite the high yield in corporate profits, declining corporate tax contributions, high delinquency rates on loans, and the continuous outsourcing of jobs. Because of the lack of government oversight, or deregulation, corporations were able to take advantage of the tax-exempt restructuring offered by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Revenue Act of 1987, and tax credits beginning with Economic Recovery Act of 1981. This resulted in social harms that were associated with declining tax contributions to state and federal governments, namely a growing deficit, cutbacks in vital social services, and an increased tax burden among individual taxpayers." ],

  "title" : "Traffic locality oriented route discovery algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Traffic locality oriented route discovery algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks", "There has been a growing interest in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) motivated by the advances in wireless technology and the range of potential applications that might be realised with such technology. Due to the lack of an infrastructure and their dynamic nature, MANETs demand a new set of networking protocols to harness the full benefits of these versatile communication systems. \nGreat deals of research activities have been devoted to develop on-demand routing algorithms for MANETs. The route discovery processes used in most on-demand routing algorithms, such as the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), rely on simple flooding as a broadcasting technique for route discovery. Although simple flooding is simple to implement, it dominates the routing overhead, leading to the well-known broadcast storm problem that results in packet congestion and excessive collisions. A number of routing techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem, some of which aim to improve the route discovery process by restricting the broadcast of route request packets to only the essential part of the network. Ideally, a route discovery should stop when a receiving node reports a route to the required destination. However, this cannot be achieved efficiently without the use of external resources; such as GPS location devices. \nIn this thesis, a new locality-oriented route discovery approach is proposed and exploited to develop three new algorithms to improve the route discovery process in on-demand routing protocols. The proposal of our algorithms is motivated by the fact that various patterns of traffic locality occur quite naturally in MANETs since groups of nodes communicate frequently with each other to accomplish common tasks. Some of these algorithms manage to reduce end-to-end delay while incurring lower routing overhead compared to some of the existing algorithms such as simple flooding used in AODV. The three algorithms are based on a revised concept of traffic locality in MANETs which relies on identifying a dynamic zone around a source node where the zone radius depends on the distribution of the nodes with which that the source is “mostly” communicating.\nThe traffic locality concept developed in this research form the basis of our Traffic Locality Route Discovery Approach (TLRDA) that aims to improve the routing discovery process in on-demand routing protocols. A neighbourhood region is generated for each active source node, containing “most” of its destinations, thus the whole network being divided into two non-overlapping regions, neighbourhood and beyond-neighbourhood, centred at the source node from that source node prospective. Route requests are processed normally in the neighbourhood region according to the routing algorithm used. However, outside this region various measures are taken to impede such broadcasts and, ultimately, stop them when they have outlived their usefulness. The approach is adaptive where the boundary of each source node’s neighbourhood is continuously updated to reflect the communication behaviour of the source node.\nTLRDA is the basis for the new three route discovery algorithms; notably: Traffic Locality Route Discovery Algorithm with Delay (TLRDA D), Traffic Locality Route Discovery Algorithm with Chase (TLRDA-C), and Traffic Locality Expanding Ring Search (TL-ERS). In TLRDA-D, any route request that is currently travelling in its source node’s beyond-neighbourhood region is deliberately delayed to give priority to unfulfilled route requests. In TLRDA-C, this approach is augmented by using chase packets to target the route requests associated with them after the requested route has been discovered. In TL-ERS, the search is conducted by covering three successive rings. The first ring covers the source node neighbourhood region and unsatisfied route requests in this ring trigger the generation of the second ring which is double that of the first. Otherwise, the third ring covers the whole network and the algorithm finally resorts to flooding. \nDetailed performance evaluations are provided using both mathematical and simulation modelling to investigate the performance behaviour of the TLRDA D, TLRDA-C, and TL-ERS algorithms and demonstrate their relative effectiveness against the existing approaches. Our results reveal that TLRDA D and TLRDA C manage to minimize end-to-end packet delays while TLRDA-C and TL-ERS exhibit low routing overhead. Moreover, the results indicate that equipping AODV with our new route discovery algorithms greatly enhance the performance of AODV in terms of end to end delay, routing overhead, and packet loss." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Rethinking sport teaching in physical education", "The purpose of this research was to describe and examine sport literacy in the context of secondary physical education and to investigate the limits, constraints and possibilities that physical education pre-service teachers' face when they attempt to take a progressive pedagogical approach to sport teaching on professional teaching practice. The literature informing the research suggested that evidence of learning is often absent from the physical education curriculum and discourses of physical education are marginalised.\r\nOne of the results of this research was to view sport literacy as an outcome of well thought out design, philosophy and practice that lead to progressive sport teaching in secondary school physical education. A curriculum that supports sport literacy is one that combines concepts from Teaching Games for Understanding (Bunker &Thorpe, 1982,1983) with Sport Education (Siedentop, 1994; Siedentop, Hastie & van der Mars, 2011). Such a curriculum delivers education through sport itself and through ideas and practices associated with sport. Pre-service teachers were taught about the design and practice of sport literacy when they undertook a physical education topic before doing their final professional teaching practice placement.\r\nThe pre-service teachers participated in the study over a six month period. The data collection occurred in four stages: 1. Investigation of a final year cohort of PETE-PS teachers observation and understanding of the important elements when teaching sport in physical education; 2. Investigation of the cohort of PETE-PS teachers responses to sport literacy from their perspective as learners of a sport and for its possibilities as a model that would support their sport teaching in physical education; 3a. Investigation of the cohort of pre-service teachers' experiences attempting to design and enact sport teaching in physical education while on professional teaching practice placement; 3b. Investigation of mentor teacher experiences with TGfU and Sport Education; and, 4. Interviews with pre-service teachers about the limits, constraints and possibilities of sport literacy.\r\nThe data suggested that Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) and Sport Education are unlikely to feature in the observation and understanding of physical education pre-service teachers in schools in South Australia. PETE is the site where pre-service teachers are most likely to be exposed to TGfU and Sport Education approaches. The data revealed preservice teachers were receptive to learning about sport literacy as a framework for teaching but working against the possibilities for sport literacy to inform sport teaching was the absence of examples of TGfU and Sport Education in practice in school settings. Mentor teachers mostly adhered to traditional behaviourist orientated textbook teachings aimed for little more than 'busy, happy, active' time (Placek, 1983). This prevented pre-service teachers from introducing different ideas during their professional teaching practice.\r\nSchools differ widely in terms of social context and complexity; however, sport teaching in physical education is delivered in similar fashion in South Australian secondary schools. Pre-service teachers are encouraged to conform to this community of practice when they undertake professional teaching practice placements. Teacher education programs might encourage graduates to be ambitious and develop expectations of being able to do things differently but these expectations are generally thwarted in the field where there appears to exist a process of hegemonic cultural reproduction which informs and shapes the pedagogical basis of sport curriculum content, and counters anything that confronts or attempts to re-shape the status quo.\r\nSparkes (2003) proposed that there are two types of learning communities; one where teachers work together to introduce innovations that will improve their teaching practices, and another where teachers agree to conform to traditional teaching practices. The evidence from this research suggests that the second is more likely to occur in South Australian secondary schools.\r\nThe data indicated pre-service teachers encountered difficulties translating the vision of sport teaching they were taught at university into the actual school curriculum. The analysis of the data created awareness of the pervasiveness of a normative discourse that mentor teachers communicated either covertly or overtly to pre-service teachers.\r\nThere are personal and institutional implications for PETE and the PETE educator to become agents of change. A new model for PETE (especially course work preparation and the teaching -professional teaching practice placement link) is necessary if PETE is to renew the curriculum and change the way sport teaching is undertaken." ],

  "texts" : [ "School Governance, Teacher Incentives, and Pupil-Teacher Ratios: Experimental Evidence from Kenyan Primary Schools", "Some education policymakers focus on bringing down pupil-teacher ratios. Others argue that resources will have limited impact without systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and pedagogy. We examine a program under which Kenyan Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) at randomly selected schools were funded to hire an additional teacher on a renewable contract, outside normal Ministry of Education civil-service channels, at one-quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82 to 44. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be taught by locally-hired contract teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired civil-service teachers in schools randomly assigned PTA contract teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civilservice teachers also captured rents for their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within PTAs reduced both forms of capture. The best contract teachers obtained civil service jobs over time, and we estimate large potential dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a probationary basis and granted tenure conditional on performance." ],

We argue that bad products are hard to kill because firms face an inherent conflict when designing managers' incentives. Rewarding success encourages managers to forge ahead even when demand is low. To avoid investing in low-demand products, the firm must also reward decisions to kill products. However, rewarding managers for killing products effectively undermines the rewards for success. The inability to resolve this tension forces the firm to choose between paying an even larger bonus for success and accepting continued investment in low-demand products. We explore the boundaries of this argument by analyzing how the timing of demand information affects product investment decisions." ],

We use data from the auditing of Brazil’s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for student, school, and municipal characteristics, we find a significant negative association between corruption and the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. Using a rich dataset of school infrastructure and teacher and principal questionnaires, we also find that school inputs such as computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training are reduced in the presence of corruption. Overall, our findings suggest that in environments where basic schooling resources are lacking, money does matter for student achievement." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Evolution of transcriptional regulatory circuits in yeasts", "A central challenge to post-genomic biology is to elucidate the cellular networks that underlie biological form and function. Such networks of transcriptional, post- transcriptional and post-translation regulation form an essential part of the cellular repertoire. The recent explosion of high-throughput genome-wide technologies has allowed us to begin to elucidate the structure and function of such networks. Additionally, these technologies also allow direct comparisons of networks to be made across species -- a subject that has received comparatively less attention. Simultaneous study of multiple species at appropriate evolutionary distances allows us to make more general statements about the robustness, evolvability, modularity and evolutionary redundancy of cellular networks than can otherwise be made when studying a single species in isolation. In this thesis, I describe the generation and analysis of genome- wide mRNA expression and transcription factor localization data across four diverse species of yeast separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. In Chapter 3, I generate genome-wide transcription factor localization data for the budding yeasts S. cerevisiae, and C. glabrata discovering a system of tightly coupled compensatory trans and cis mutations in the AP-1 transcriptional network. These compensatory mutations allow for conserved transcriptional regulation despite continued genetic change. Such systems of tightly coupled compensatory mutations might serve to counter the widespread divergence observed in transcriptional networks, and may constitute a general evolutionary mechanism maintaining the regulation of transcriptional networks. In Chapter 4, I generate genome-wide transcription factor localization data for several cell-cycle transcription factors, but in the fission yeast S. pombe. Similarly to previous studies, I find relatively poor conservation of binding between orthologous transcription factors. However, further analysis of our data along with that of previous studies suggests that transcription factors while not being particularly well conserved at the level of the binding of target genes show stronger conservation in other ways such as DNA binding motif, the functional enrichment of target genes, transcription factor expression and transcription factor activity" ],

  "texts" : [ "Tracking animals in freshwater with electronic tags: past, present and future", "Abstract\n\t\t\t\tConsiderable technical developments over the past half century have enabled widespread application of electronic tags to the study of animals in the wild, including in freshwater environments. We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and peripheral technologies (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Progettazione di un sistema Steer by Wire e sperimentazione tramite banco Hardware in the Loop", "\"By-wire\" systems are characterized by the lack of mechanical link between the control device and the actuator, being it hydraulic or mechanical. The connection is replaced by a mechatronic system, equipped with redundant sensors and actuators [1]. SBW consists in two electro-mechanical actuators that steer the vehicle wheels and generate a resistance torque against the rotation of the steering wheel during cornering maneuvers. Each actuator is characterized by the presence of an electric motor, the first is connected to the pinion of the steering system, the other is connected to the steering wheel. The electric motor connected to the pinion is controlled in position and the command signal is generated by a PID controller. Reference position depends only on steering wheel angle and steering ratio. The torque control of the second electric motor is more difficult; the reference torque value has to be realistic in order to grant the proper feeling to the driver. The steering column is removed, as well as every hydraulic component that is part of the classic servo-assisted steering system. The logic that controls the system needs the information provided by two position sensors: one encoder is devoted to measure the steering wheel angular position, one linear position transducer measures the position of the rack [2]. The connection between the control units of the two sub-systems is realized through a communication bus. The aim of SBW technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible, thus simplifying the car interior design, increasing the driver safety in case of frontal crash. Moreover, active safety and handling are increased thanks to the variable ratio between steering wheel angle and tyres' steering angle, determined by a control logic [3]. SbW system's steering wheel has to generate a resistant torque which adds to the friction one. Such torque must be felt as natural by the average driver and carry information about vehicle dynamic condition. The paper describes the design of a SBW prototype, obtained from a classical steering system (see Fig.13) [4] [5]. A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test bench is also described: it is realized in order to test feedback torque generation and steering wheel efficiency influence on vehicle behavior. Actual steering wheel angle is used as input for a ten degrees of freedom model that calculates the vehicle dynamics, defining the steered wheels motion and the resistance torque at the pinion (see Fig.10). An analog signal is generated in order to control the steering wheel electric motor torque. Experimental tests are performed to optimize the feedback torque control. The reference torque is then calculated only using signals coming from vehicle on board sensors. Control logic is finally improved in order to stiffen the steering system unnaturally when lateral acceleration is about to reach adherence limit and prevent further steering action (see Fig.14)" ],

  "texts" : [ "3D virtual worlds as environments for literacy learning", "<b>Background:</b> Although much has been written about the ways in which new technology might transform educational practice, particularly in the area of literacy learning, there is relatively little empirical work that explores the possibilities and problems - or even what such a transformation might look like in the classroom. 3D virtual worlds offer a range of opportunities for children to use digital literacies in school, and suggest one way in which we might explore changing literacy practices in a playful, yet meaningful context.<p></p> <b>Purpose:</b> This paper identifies some of the key issues that emerged in designing and implementing virtual world work in a small number of primary schools in the UK. It examines the tensions between different discourses about literacy and literacy learning and shows how these were played out by teachers and pupils in classroom settings.<p></p><b>Sources of evidence:</b> Case study data are used as a basis for exploring and illustrating key aspects of design and implementation. The case study material includes views from a number of perspectives including classroom observations, chatlogs, in-world avatar interviews with teachers and also pupils, as well as the author’s field notes of the planning process with accompanying minutes and meeting documents.<p></p><b>Main argument:</b> From a Foucauldian perspective, the article suggests that social control of pedagogical practice through the regulation of curriculum time, the normalisation of teaching routines and the regimes of individual assessment restricts teachers’ and pupils’ conceptions of what constitutes literacy. The counternarrative, found in recent work in new litearcies (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006) provides an attractive alternative, but a movement in this direction requires a fundamental shift of emphasis and a re-conceptualisation of what counts as learning.<p></p><b>Conclusions:</b> This work on 3D virtual worlds questions the notion of how transformative practice can be achieved with the use of new technologies. It suggests that changes in teacher preparation, continuing professional development as well as wider educational reform may be needed." ],

  "title" : "On the programmability of heterogeneous massively-parallel computing systems",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "On the programmability of heterogeneous massively-parallel computing systems", "Heterogeneous parallel computing combines general purpose processors with accelerators to efficiently execute both sequential control-intensive and data-parallel phases of applications. Existing programming models for heterogeneous parallel computing impose added coding complexity when compared to traditional sequential shared-memory programming models for homogeneous systems. This extra code complexity is assumable in supercomputing environments, where programmability is sacrificed in pursuit of high performance. However, heterogeneous parallel systems are massively reaching the desktop market (e.g., 425.4 million of GPU cards were sold in 2009), where the trade-off between performance and programmability is the opposite. The code complexity required when using accelerators and the lack of compatibility prevents programmers from exploiting the full computing capabilities of heterogeneous parallel systems in general purpose applications. This dissertation aims to increase the programmability of CPU - accelerator systems, without introducing major performance penalties. The key insight is that general purpose application programmers tend to favor programmability at the cost of system performance. This fact is illustrated by the tendency to use high-level programming languages, such as C++, to ease the task of programming at the cost of minor performance penalties. Moreover, currently many general purpose applications are being developed using interpreted languages, such as Java, C# or python, which raise the abstraction level even further introducing relatively large performance overheads. This dissertation also takes the approach of raising the level of abstraction for accelerators to improve programmability and investigates hardware and software mechanisms to efficiently implement these high-level abstractions without introducing major performance overheads. Heterogeneous parallel systems typically implement separate memories for CPUs and accelerators, although commodity systems might use a shared memory at the cost of lower performance. However, in these commodity shared memory systems, coherence between accelerator and CPUs is not guaranteed. This system architecture implies that CPUs can only access system memory, and accelerators can only access their own local memory. This dissertation assumes separate system and accelerator memory and shows that low-level abstractions for these disjoint address spaces are the source of poor programmability of heterogeneous parallel systems. A first consequence of having separate system and accelerator memories are the current data transfer models for heterogeneous parallel systems. In this dissertation two data transfer paradigms are identified: per-call and double-buffered. In these two models, data structures used by accelerators are allocated in both, system and accelerator memories. These models differ on how data between accelerator and system memories is managed. The per-call model transfers the input data needed by accelerators before accelerator calls, and transfers back the output data produced by accelerators on accelerator call return. The per-call model is quite simple, but might impose unacceptable performance penalties due to data transfer overheads. The double-buffered model aims to overlap data communication and CPU and accelerator computation. This model requires a relative quite complex code due to parallel execution and the need of synchronization between data communication and processing tasks. The extra code required for data transfers in these two models is necessary due to the lack of by-reference parameter passing to accelerators. This dissertation presents a novel accelerator-hosted data transfer model. In this model, data used by accelerators is hosted in the accelerator memory, so when the CPU accesses this data, it is effectively accessing the accelerator memory. Such a model cleanly supports by-reference parameter passing to accelerator calls, removing the need to explicit data transfers. The second consequence of separate system and accelerator memories is that current programming models export separate virtual system and accelerator address spaces to application programmers. This dissertation identifies the double-pointer problem as a direct consequence of these separate virtual memory spaces. The double-pointer problem is that data structures used by both, accelerators and CPUs, are referenced by different virtual memory addresses (pointers) in the CPU and accelerator code. The double-pointer problem requires programmers to add extra code to ensure that both pointers contain consistent values (e.g., when reallocating a data structure). Keeping consistency between system and accelerator pointers might penalize accelerator performance and increase the accelerator memory requirements when pointers are embedded within data structures (e.g., a linked-list). For instance, the double-pointer problem requires increasing the numbers of global memory accesses by 2X in a GPU code that reconstructs a linked-list. This dissertation argues that a unified virtual address space that includes both, system and accelerator memories is an efficient solution to the double-pointer problem. Moreover, such a unified virtual address space cleanly complements the accelerator-hosted data model previously discussed. This dissertation introduces the Non-Uniform Accelerator Memory Access (NUAMA) architecture, as a hardware implementation of the accelerator-hosted data transfer model and the unified virtual address space. In NUAMA an Accelerator Memory Collector (AMC) is included within the system memory controller to identify memory requests for accelerator-hosted data. The AMC buffers and coalesces such memory requests to efficiently transfer data from the CPU to the accelerator memory. NUAMA also implements a hybrid L2 cache memory. The L2 cache in NUAMA follows a write-throughwrite-non-allocate policy for accelerator hosted data. This policy ensures that the contents of the accelerator memory are updated eagerly and, therefore, when the accelerator is called, most of the data has been already transferred. The eager update of the accelerator memory contents effectively overlaps data communication and CPU computation. A write-backwrite-allocate policy is used for the data hosted by the system memory, so the performance of applications that does not use accelerators is not affected. In NUAMA, accelerator-hosted data is identified using a TLB-assisted mechanism. The page table entries are extended with a bit, which is set for those memory pages that are hosted by the accelerator memory. NUAMA increases the average bandwidth requirements for the L2 cache memory and the interconnection network between the CPU and accelerators, but the instantaneous bandwidth, which is the limiting factor, requirements are lower than in traditional DMA-based architectures. The NUAMA architecture is compared to traditional DMA systems using cycle-accurate simulations. Experimental results show that NUAMA and traditional DMA-based architectures perform equally well. However, the application source code complexity of NUAMA is much lower than in DMA-based architectures. A software implementation of the accelerator-hosted model and the unified virtual address space is also explored. This dissertation presents the Asymmetric Distributed Shared Memory (ADSM) model. ADSM maintains a shared logical memory space for CPUs to access data in the accelerator physical memory but not vice versa. The asymmetry allows light-weight implementations that avoid common pitfalls of symmetrical distributed shared memory systems. ADSM allows programmers to assign data structures to performance critical methods. When a method is selected for accelerator execution, its associated data objects are allocated within the shared logical memory space, which is hosted in the accelerator physical memory and transparently accessible by the methods executed on CPUs. ADSM reduces programming efforts for heterogeneous parallel computing systems and enhances application portability. The design and implementation of an ADSM run-time, called GMAC, on top of CUDA in a GNU/Linux environment is presented. Experimental results show that applications written in ADSM and running on top of GMAC achieve performance comparable to their counterparts using programmer-managed data transfers. This dissertation presents the GMAC system, evaluates different design choices, and it further suggests additional architectural support that will likely allow GMAC to achieve higher application performance than the current CUDA model. Finally, the execution model of heterogeneous parallel systems is considered. Accelerator execution is abstracted in different ways in existent programming models. This dissertation explores three approaches implemented by existent programming models. OpenCL and the NVIDIA CUDA driver API use file descriptor semantics to abstract accelerators: user processes access accelerators through descriptors. This approach increases the complexity of using accelerators because accelerator descriptors are needed in any call involving the accelerator (e.g., memory allocations or passing a parameter to the accelerator). The IBM Cell SDK abstract accelerators as separate execution threads. This approach requires adding the necessary code to create new execution threads and synchronization primitives to use of accelerators. Finally, the NVIDIA CUDA run-time API abstract accelerators as Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). This approach is fundamentally incompatible with ADSM, because it assumes separate virtual address spaces for accelerator and CPU code. The Heterogeneous Parallel Execution (HPE) model is presented in this dissertation. This model extends the execution thread abstraction to incorporate different execution modes. Execution modes define the capabilities (e.g., accessible virtual address space, code ISA, etc) of the code being executed. In this execution model, accelerator calls are implemented as execution mode switches, analogously to system calls. Accelerator calls in HPE are synchronous, on the contrary of CUDA, OpenCL and the IBM Cell SDK. Synchronous accelerator calls provide full compatibility with the existent sequential execution model provided by most operating systems. Moreover, abstracting accelerator calls as execution mode switches allows application that use accelerator to run on system without accelerators. In these systems, the execution mode switch falls back to an emulation layer, which emulates the accelerator execution in the CPU. This dissertation further presents different design and implementation choices for the HPE model, in GMAC. The necessary hardware support for an efficient implementation of this model is also presented. Experimental results show that HPE introduces a low execution-time overhead while offering a clean and simple programming interface to applications." ],

Efforts to manage this growth and the adverse impacts associated with it have been mostly ineffective. Promising technology solutions include telecommunications (telecommuting, electronic commerce, teleconferencing, etc.), small personal vehicles (electric bikes and neighborhood vehicles); and new \"smart\" transport modes (car sharing, \"smart\" paratransit, etc.).\n      These options have the potential to be environmentally and economically superior to today’s car-dominated system. Yet none have flourished. Why? One hypothesis is that many automobile substitutes and complements have been rejected because they have been introduced individually and incrementally - not as part of a coordinated transportation system\n      New mobility is a fundamentally new approach to this problem, focusing on intermodal clustering of innovative technologies with existing transportation options to create a coordinated transportation system that could substitute for the traditional auto. The concept of new mobility was explored at a workshop hosted by the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis on November 2, 1998. This report describes the technologies of new mobility and suggests ways that they might be coupled together through public-private partnerships and experimentation at the local level." ],

A second aim was to compare survival rates of implants placed in healed versus fresh extraction sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 113 consecutive patients about to have their maxillae rendered fully edentulous (mean extractions per patient: 6.7 teeth) received four to eight implants each (total number = 675) which were immediately placed in healed sites (323 implants, 47.9%) or fresh sockets (352 implants, 52.1%). Immediate loading of provisional prostheses was performed and all patients were followed up for 6 months. The success criteria included prosthesis success, assessment of individual implant stability and complications. RESULTS: No patients dropped out and all 113 patients received definitive fixed prostheses after 6 months of loading. The overall implant survival rate after 6 months was 99.1%. Six implants were lost in 6 patients (5.3%). Five of them were inserted in fresh extraction sockets (1.4%) and one in a healed site (0.3%). No significant difference (P = 0.1621) was found for implants placed in healed sites versus fresh extraction sites. Ten patients had fractures of the provisional prostheses as complications. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate implant placement and loading resulted in high implant as well as prosthetic survival rates. Placement in healed or fresh extraction bone sites may not influence implant survival." ],

  "texts" : [ "Making Their Way-Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities", "Abstract of Making Their Way—Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities Susan Agatha Maley People with disabilities have marked lower rates of employment than people without disabilities in both Australia and the United States, the countries chosen for this research inquiry. That this is the case decades after the introduction of anti-discrimination laws in these developed democratic countries highlights the continuum of constraints people with disabilities still experience in securing work. Some of these constraints include socially discriminatory attitudes and perceptions, the lack of available accommodations and adaptations in work settings (and the misconception that they will be onerous and expensive to implement), lack of accessible transportation, the unavailability of work within established job markets and the restrictions of vocational rehabilitation and disability employment programs’ past focus on existing jobs in organisational settings. These constraints have a negative impact on the overall quality of life for many people with disabilities as employment is a key component to individual self-sufficiency and personal fulfilment and also crucial to inclusion in community and social settings. Among the notable initiatives to address these persistent inequities are research-informed projects focusing on self-employment as a viable alternative mode of employment to the established job market. Within the last decade, myriad research reports, model demonstration projects, and a US national research program, funded by the Office of Disability Employment Policy, have been demonstrating the success of self-employment in expanding self-determined income generation. Within this burgeoning and productive investigation on self-employment, one gap is that there has been little focused inquiry on creative work. Such a void is significant since the predominant work mode among visual artists is self-employment, albeit sometimes supplemented with other arts, and non-arts related work. This study addresses the lack of investigation of artists’ modes of work by examining the working lives of practicing professional visual artists with a range of significant physical, sensory and neurological disabilities. There are a number of reasons for this research study’s focus on the area of visual arts. Visual arts has been documented to be one of the largest groups among artistic disciplines in studies in both Australia and the US, as well as European countries. Within this sizable arts arena, there are established and emerging markets for sale of visual arts products. This discipline can also offer flexible work locations, hours and adaptations in art making. Thus, there may be numerous benefits to pursuing careers in the visual arts for creative people with disabilities. Yet, little is known about the lived work experience of practicing visual artists with disabilities and their career strategies. Thus, an exploration of visual artists with disabilities working in a range of mediums such as this research study can reveal new, and potentially useful, knowledge about their methods of art-making and marketing, adaptations in the design and execution of their work, their experiences of disability and the facilitators and obstacles they face when preparing for and pursuing their working lives as artists. This research study is based on the results of in-depth, face-to-face interviews of twenty-one visual artists, eleven in Australia and ten in the US, who used multiple artistic mediums. The conceptual lens for the analysis is intersectionality with an underlying critical realism foundation. These theories were used to explore the intersecting social positions of being a person with a disability and a practicing artist and the related interplay of agency and structure in shaping the careers of these artists. The main findings from this research focus on how the artists in this study made their way, made art and made money. These findings commence with an examination of the early shaping and continued sustaining influences in their artistic development and education. It continues with an exploration of the influence of their disability experiences on making art including their adaptive methods and conceptual process. The analysis continues with a focus on factors involving their means of making money, marketing and self-promotion methods and professional progressions. The findings conclude with an analysis of aids and obstacles these artists with disabilities experienced during interactions with a range of organisations including disability employment and vocational rehabilitation counselling and financial support agencies, arts educational institutions, art galleries and arts and disability agencies. Highlights of the findings are that the majority of the artists in the study earned their income from arts and arts related work, that they made active use of their own personal and collective agency to meet their artistic and professional goals and that their actions influenced structural change. They also positioned aspects of their social and personal identity to best suit their career progressions and some made artistic use of their conceptions of disability with innovative impact on social conceptions of disability. Implications of these findings are that artists experiencing disability developed strategic skills to negotiate difficult terrain while forging an income-producing arts practice. In addition, their creation of new options for themselves, and other artists with disabilities, has wider implications for improving equity for artists with disabilities." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "A bistable gene switch for antibiotic biosynthesis: The butyrolactone regulon in Streptomyces coelicolor", "Many microorganisms, including bacteria of the class Streptomycetes, produce various secondary metabolites including antibiotics to gain a competitive advantage in their natural habitat. The production of these compounds is highly coordinated in a population to expedite accumulation to an effective concentration. Furthermore, as antibiotics are often toxic even to their producers, a coordinated production allows microbes to first arm themselves with a defense mechanism to resist their own antibiotics before production commences. One possible mechanism of coordination among individuals is through the production of signaling molecules. The ??-butyrolactone system in Streptomyces coelicolor is a model of such a signaling system for secondary metabolite production. The accumulation of these signaling molecules triggers antibiotic production in the population. A pair of repressor-amplifier proteins encoded by scbA and scbR mediates the production and action of one particular ??-butyrolactone, SCB1. Based on the proposed interactions of scbA and scbR, a mathematical model was constructed and used to explore the ability of this system to act as a robust genetic switch. Stability analysis shows that the butyrolactone system exhibits bistability and, in response to a threshold SCB1 concentration, can switch from an OFF state to an ON state corresponding to the activation of genes in the cryptic type I polyketide synthase gene cluster, which are responsible for production of the hypothetical polyketide. The switching time is inversely related to the inducer concentration above the threshold, such that short pulses of low inducer concentration cannot switch on the system, suggesting its possible role in noise filtering. In contrast, secondary metabolite production can be triggered rapidly in a population of cells producing the butyrolactone signal due to the presence of an amplification loop in the system. S. coelicolor was perturbed experimentally by varying concentrations of SCB1, and the model simulations match the experimental data well. Deciphering the complexity of this butyrolactone switch will provide valuable insights into how robust and efficient systems can be designed using \"simple\" two-protein networks. ?? 2008 Mehra et al." ],

  "title" : "Academic Knowledge Transfer in Social Networks",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Academic Knowledge Transfer in Social Networks", "The rise of online social networks has presented many new opportunities and meth- ods for human communication in general and academic communication in particular. Knowledge is created at every level of academia, including individuals, project groups, and research communities. For knowledge to have lasting utility, it must be transferred from one mind to another, for only when knowledge is instantiated in someone's mind can it be used as the base for future action and thought. Today, despite decades of re- search, computer support for knowledge workers in academia is fragmented and poorly integrated. While office automation and other forms of CSCW approaches have ben- efitted academics, no single environment today integrates the basic research activities of the academic knowledge worker, including: individually or collaboratively writing re- search papers, sharing research papers, reviewing papers for publication in a journal or conference and persistently sharing comments and observations on existing literature.This thesis explores academic knowledge transfer within social networks in several ways. It first presents a model of academic knowledge transfer, along with the requirements for a software system that instantiates that model. The proof-of- concept, named Whisper, for that software system is described, along with the feedback from its users and the changes made to the system's design based on that feedback.Additionally, an experiment in gamification of knowledge transfer within the Facebook social network is explored, with implications for the knowledge transfer system design. Finally, data from celebrity users and regular users of the Twitter social network is contrasted, providing insight into how often information from the different types of users is re-shared to others, how the \"packaging\" of that information (a simple statement vs a link to a website) affects the re-sharing rate, and methods users might try to increase the depth their messages can reach in the Twitter network.Academics currently have very poor tool support for some of the most common tasks they perform, such as organizing the files (both data and research output) across software applications, and linking research output back to the raw data. Both of these concerns, and others, would be addressed by a knowledge sharing environment based on the model described here. The full development of such a system presents additional opportunities for research in human factors, CSCW, and social psychology." ],

  "title" : "Financing and internationalization of R&D intensive firms",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Financing and internationalization of R&D intensive firms", "Knowledge and knowledge-based value creation processes play an increasing role in modern economies. In the last two decades investments in knowledge have gained importance relative to investments in physical assets. The OECD reports that private and public investments in knowledge as percentage of GDP have increased by 0.7 percentage points in OECD countries during the years 1997-2004. At the same time, investments in physical assets such as machinery and equipment have decreased by 1.1 percentage points. The increasing importance of intangible assets in the value creation process presents a significant challenge for innovation policies in knowledge-based economies. Innovative firms that intensely invest in research and development (R&D) highly rely on intangible assets and are faced with serious market failures. These frictions can restrict R&D intensive firms' innovation and internationalization activities and are expected to hamper overall technological progress and economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nImperfect financial markets that are characterized by information asymmetries can restrict the access to finance for R&D intensive start-up firms. These firms have only short track records and due to their focus on R&D, they have only few tangible assets that can be used as collateral for financial investors. Thus, financial frictions are particularly severe for new firms and firms undertaking innovative activities (Hall and Lerner, 2009). At the same time, young and small firms significantly contribute to technological progress and economic growth (OECD, 2013). Financial constraints restrain the innovation activities of these firms and result in an overall decelerated rate of innovation and a slowdown in economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, R&D intensive firms additionally face the problem that their created knowledge exhibits the characteristics of public goods. Once information on inventions is revealed, the knowledge is non-rival and non-excludable. A sufficient patent protection is necessary to maintain investment incentives and to overcome problems of underinvestment. In their internationalization strategy, R&D intensive firms have to consider that patent law is a territorial concept, i.e., the scope of patent protection is limited to the territory of the country where the right is granted. The foundation of a foreign affiliate represents a transaction, whereby sensitive knowledge is transferred outside the firm and intangible assets are exposed to a high risk of infringement. A lacking or insufficient patent protection in host countries can distort global investment decisions and prevent profitable projects. Particularly R&D intensive multinational firms that intensely rely on intangible assets are expected to be highly affected by these frictions. Distorted investments could adversely affect a firm's growth and restrict the technological progress in host countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dissertation attempts to shed more light onto these market imperfections, which are aggravated by firms' reliance on intangible assets and are expected to adversely affect firms' innovation and internationalization strategy. The first two chapters deal with frictions in financial markets. Chapter 1 takes a step back and investigates how access to finance can be precisely measured. A precise measurement is essential to design effective policy measures in order to foster access to finance. On the basis of these findings, Chapter 2 considers the access to external finance of R&D intensive start-up firms and empirically investigates whether patents can mitigate financial frictions of these innovative firms. The third chapter considers frictions in the internationalization strategies of R&D intensive firms. It empirically investigates, whether a strengthening of national patent law affects the global investment decision of multinationals and encourages foreign direct investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first chapter is concerned with the empirical methodology of measuring access to finance. Measuring and identifying financial constraints represents an important challenge in empirical studies. Due to data limitations, access to finance has often been approximated by the usage of finance or by perception-based indicators. However, these types of measures disregard firm-specific differences in the demand for external finance. Firms that do not use external finance can either be financially constrained or might have no demand for external finance. Similarly, firms reporting that they do not face problems with access to finance may either have sufficient access or may have no financial demand. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing unique firm-level survey data which provides information on a firm's demand for credit, we develop a direct measure of access to credit. This measure takes into account whether a firm that has credit demand is successful in obtaining access to credit. In the first part of the analysis, we use our direct measure to estimate the determinants of access to credit. Thereby, we can separate the determinants affecting credit demand from those affecting access. In the second part, we estimate the determinants affecting the usage of credit and the perceived access respectively. A comparison of the identified determinants with those from the access estimation reveals whether the approximating measures allow for a precise identification of credit constraints. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that the usage of credit is not adequate to identify financially constrained firms, since the determinants of demand and the determinants of access are not disentangled in the usage measure. Perception based indicators, however, are found to be surprisingly precise, even when information on demand is not available. Based on these findings, recommendations for future survey design for investigating access to finance are drawn. Our results imply that including questions on the demand for external finance is essential to identify access to finance. Further, since firms can be discouraged from applying, information on the application for finance is not sufficient and reasons for why firms have not applied for external finance should be additionally considered. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe contribute to the literature by evaluating whether the usage of credit is a suitable approximation for access to credit and whether perception-based indicators provide precise measurements of credit constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical evaluation of these measures. A precise measure of access to finance is essential for drawing correct policy recommendations from economic research and to design efficient policy measures with the aim of fostering access to finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second chapter turns to the financing of R&D intensive start-up firms. It investigates the role of patents in their external finance and examines whether patents can improve the access to external financing for innovative start-up firms. Patents have the potential to reduce information asymmetries between patentees and investors (Long, 2002) and can also be seen as a type of property rights, since patents are fully transferable as well as exclusive and binding against third parties (Davies, 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing detailed firm-level survey data of German start-up firms, we identify a firm's financial demand for venture capital and bank financing and investigate whether a firm that has demand for a particular source of finance is successful in obtaining it. To measure a firm's patenting activity and to distinguish high valuable patents, we use value-weighted patent counts that are based on the direct valuations by the patent owners. Instrumental-variable estimations take into account the potential endogeneity of patenting and establish a causal effect of patents. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis reveals two important findings. First, we find strong evidence for its endogeneity and provide a possible instrumentation strategy for patenting. Ignoring the endogeneity of patenting can result in highly biased estimates. Second, our results indicate that patenting significantly increases the probability of using venture capital and bank financing, especially when the values of patents are considered. However, it is not clear whether an increase in the usage of external finance can be fully attributed to an improved access to finance or whether part of the increase is due to an increased financial demand of patenting firms. Using separate measures for demand and access, we can clearly identify a demand driven effect of patents. Patenting firms have a significantly higher demand for external finance, while, after controlling for financial demand, no effect on access to external finance has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contribution of the second chapter is primarily methodical. For future research on the financial role of patents, our findings emphasize the importance of considering endogeneity issues of patenting and controlling for firm-specific differences in financial demand. We can show that a large part of the increase in the usage of external finance can be attributed to a significantly higher financial demand of patenting firms. This leads to the question, whether the findings in the previous literature on the usage of external finance can be fully attributed to a signaling effect of patents or whether the identified effect is driven by a higher financial demand of patenting firms. Further, most previous studies on the role of patents in financing have not considered issues of endogeneity. Taking into account our results, it is not clear whether previous findings can be interpreted as causal effects or mere correlations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe third chapter deals with frictions due to a lack of patent protection and empirically investigates the role of patent protection in the global investment decisions of German multinationals. Using a firm-level panel dataset on the universe of German outward foreign direct investment (FDI), we investigate individual firm-level investment decisions at the extensive and intensive margin of FDI. At the extensive margin, we explore the impact of patent protection on the decision where to locate a foreign affiliate. At the intensive margin, we analyze how the strengthening of patent rights affects the size of the established affiliates and the ownership share held in the foreign affiliates. To isolate the effect of patent protection, we exploit variation of patent protection across countries and time, as well as variation of the dependency on patent protection across sectors and time. A firm's dependency on patent protection is approximated by sector-specific measures of R&D intensity and the perceived effectiveness of patent protection for protecting innovation. By conditioning on an extensive set of fixed effects, we account for unobserved firm- and country-specific heterogeneity and capture potential omitted variable bias. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that patent protection affects German foreign direct investment in different ways. Strengthening patent protection positively affects the location decision of German multinationals. Furthermore, we find significant nonlinear effects in a host country's initial legal and economic development. With regard to the intensive margin, we find some evidence for a positive effect of patent protection. However, the effect is much weaker than for the location decision. For the ownership shares held in foreign affiliates, we find that average ownership shares increase significantly after strengthening patent protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis complements and contributes to the previous literature on the relation between intellectual property right (IPR) protection and FDI in different manners. It provides the first firm-level evidence on German multinationals. Insights into how German multinationals are affected by international patent protection are particularly interesting, since Germany is second in the ranking of FDI outward countries (UNCTAD, 2011). Further, the analysis provides a strong identification strategy that allows for nonlinear effects of patent protection and considers various sources of omitted variable bias. Additionally, we take into account host countries' previous levels of legal and economic development, which enables us to draw more precise policy recommendations for reforming countries. Finally, the analysis provides a comprehensive firm-level analysis of FDI decisions at various levels of FDI, something which has been missing in previous research." ],

  "texts" : [ "OMake: Designing a Scalable Build Process", "Modern software codebases are frequently large, heterogeneous, and constantly evolving.  The languages and tools for software construction, including code builds and configuration management, have not been well-studied.  Developers are often faced with using 1) older tools (like make) that do not scale well, 2) custom build scripts that tend to be fragile, or 3) proprietary tools that are not portable.\n\nIn this paper, we study the build issue as a domain-specific programming problem.  There are a number of challenges that are unique to the domain of build systems.  We argue that a central goal is compositionality---that is, it should be possible to specify a software component in isolation and add it to a project with an assurance that the global specification will not be compromised.  The next important goal is to cover the full range of complexity---from allowing very concise specifications for the most common cases to providing the flexibility to encompass projects with unusual needs. Dependency analysis, which is a prerequisite for incremental builds, must be automated in order to achieve compositionality an reliability; it also spans the full range of complexity.\n\nWe develop a language for describing software builds and\nconfiguration.  We also develop an implementation (called OMake), that addresses all the above challenges efficiently and portably. It also provides a number of features that help streamline the edit/compile development cycle.\n\nOMake is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and is actively being used in several large projects." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Systems biology and cancer, [Editorial]", "The systems approach to complex biological problems has rapidly gained ground during the first decade of this century. There are several reasons for this development. An important one is that while the achievement of sequencing the complete human genome, and those of other species, has been of great benefit to fundamental science, for example in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology, it has not led to the expected quick and simple solutions to multifactorial diseases (2010). On the contrary, cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and nervous diseases have all been resistant to reductionist analysis. In the case of cancer the hope that by identifying what are called oncogenes we would not only understand cancer but be led naturally to its cure has not been fulfilled ([Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999] and [Sonnenschein and Soto, 2011]). In all areas of medical science, despite the identification of hundreds more potential targets by genome sequencing, the pharmaceutical industry has been faced with a decline in the production of new successful drugs. The more we find out about the fundamental elements of biology, the DNA, RNAs, proteins, metabolites, membrane systems, organelles, the more puzzling the picture becomes. Even central biological concepts, like that of a gene, have changed and have even become difficult to define (Beurton et al., 2008 In: P.J. Beurton, R. Falk and H.-J. Rheinberger, Editors, The Concept of the Gene in Development and Evolution: Historical and Epistemological Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (2008).Beurton et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nReassessment of the fundamental concepts of biological science is therefore necessary. This is happening in all fields, including genetics (Beurton et al., 2008), evolution ([Pigliucci and Müller, 2010], [Gissis and Jablonka, 2011] and [Shapiro, 2011]), cancer (Soto et al., 2008), development and the relationships between genomes and phenotypes ([Noble, 2011b] and [Noble, 2011a]). What once were heresies seem to be creeping back into mainstream biology.\r\n\r\nOne of the driving forces of this development is the use of mathematical modelling in systems biology. This has brought a rigorous quantitative approach to what otherwise would be largely untestable theories. Mathematical models provide a framework in which to interpret the vast amount of experimental data generated on a daily basis and to suggest subsequent experiments necessary to test theories. The traditional verbal reasoning approach is not appropriate in many cases due to the complexity of biology (Gatenby and Maini, 2003) which renders intuition insufficient as results are often counter-intuitive, a characteristic outcome of scientific research that goes as far back as Copernicus’ proposal of an heliocentric planetary system. This vast complexity requires a mathematical approach.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this focussed issue of the journal is that the field of cancer is ripe for the systems biology approach. As editors we have collected an eclectic mix of articles. This is not a ‘one view fits all’ approach. It is rather one to ‘let a hundred flowers bloom’. At this stage in our understanding we cannot be sure where the next big insights are going to come from.\r\n\r\nSince the 18th century biologists and philosophers tried to define the place of biology1 in science and in particular its relationship with physics. A two hundred year debate followed, with biologists adopting “physicalist” or “vitalistic” stands. Was life to be explained in a totally materialistic way by the laws of physics? Or were there additional “forces” present in the living matter but absent in the inert one? Curiously, as vitalism dwindled among biologists in the 20th century, physicists like Schrödinger (1944) and Elsasser (1987) were the ones that tried to understand biological order and were prepared to find new laws that applied only to living matter.2 No new laws resulted from this search, but from the emerging field of information theories, biologists adopted information as the metaphor for the study of biological organization.3 This, however, has not produced the desired effects either, probably because the attempts to formalize this approach failed, which in turn suggests that it was conceptually wrong. Can biology achieve formalization through mathematics, a feat that physics has accomplished so successfully?\r\n\r\nThe article by Giuseppe Longo and Mael Montevil (2011) (mathematicians), analyzes the principles of intelligibility in physics, which is based on symmetries, and posit that the role of symmetries in biology is different: in their words “the permanent change of symmetries …per se modifies the analysis of the internal and external processes of life, both in ontogenesis and evolution”. They propose to consider the roles played by local and global symmetry changes, along extended critical transitions. According to them, the mathematization of this state of extended criticality may provide the adequate frame to understand biological complexity. Paul-Antoine Miquel (2011) (a philosopher), reflects on the philosophical aspects of the theoretical analysis by Longo and Montevil and concludes that “the philosophical key point for us is that they (Longo and Montevil) interpret this mathematical space in which anti-entropy is realized in biological criticality as an extension of the classical physical theoretical frameworks.” These two contributions aim at improving our understanding on why the principles governing living organisms are different from those defining the physicality of inanimate objects and provide a conceptual frame of reference and a point of departure for constructing a mathematics for biology.\r\n\r\nStuart Baker (a bio-statistician) and Barnett Kramer (a cancer epidemiologist) (2011) evaluate the potential contributions of different approaches to Systems Biology when applied to uncover buried messages in the genesis of cancer which may set new trends in research and in ways to benefit patients. They anticipate both promises and perils in applying systems biology to cancer. The great promise of systems biology comes from the idea that studying a system can provide information not available by separately studying the workings of each part. However, they perceive a divide between systems biology based on the principles of biology or biophysics, systems biology related to statistics, bioinformatics, and reverse engineering, and systems biology involving clinical predictions, sometimes without full appreciation of other viewpoints. The peril comes when the rules leading to a complex system vary over many components and the sample sizes are limited for identifying the rules and making predictions. Baker et al. have introduced the concept of “paradigm instability” when referring to current state of affairs through which the field of cancer research is traversing. Thus, they focus on a number of paradoxes that exist in this field and cautiously point at ways that might increase knowledge about the disease and also benefit patients.\r\n\r\nSimon Rosenfeld (2011) (a mathematical physicist) makes a critical analysis of the assumptions and concepts used in the emerging field of network biology, particularly those on the actual physics and chemistry happening inside cells. He posits that, in biology there is dual causality, that is, in addition to the constraints imposed by the laws of nature, there is the evolutionary history of the organism: “…inherent dynamical instability represents the natural laws and physico-chemical principles whereas biological robustness is the result of evolutionary history in which this dynamical instability has been effectively used for gaining evolutionary advantages and survival.” He subscribes to the notion that “Mathematics represents a systematic and orderly way of describing and organizing knowledge. In the majority of scientific disciplines, mathematical reasoning has proven to be an unparalleled and indispensable tool for understanding complex dynamics.” He forcefully argues for adopting a Systems Biology approach to resolve complex biological problems while complying with a comprehensive evolutionary perspective.\r\n\r\nPlankar et al. (2011) challenge the genetically determined paradigm of cancer from another angle to characterise cancer as the result of impaired coherence leading to progressive destabilisation of molecular and gene regulatory networks. As they write in their conclusion “It is becoming clear that even with potentially unlimited insight into the dynamics of genetic changes, cancer could not be sufficiently explained, and neither could it be explained in terms of separate linear molecular pathways alone. During the last decade, scientific attention has turned dramatically towards the metabolic, bioenergetic, developmental, and systems biology aspects of cancer, reflecting a gradual paradigm shift towards its non-genetic origin.”\r\n\r\nEnderling and Hahnfeldt (2011) analyse the dynamics of a growing solid tumour composed of cancer stem cells and cancer non-stem cells using a simple hybrid cellular automaton (CA) model. They illustrate the counter-intuitive finding that increasing the rate of apoptosis, while obviously reducing tumour size in the short-term, actually enhances growth in the long-term. They show that tumours can remain dormant for a long time but stimulation of apoptosis can cause the tumour cell population to aggressively invade. Their work suggests that the widely regarded “evading cell death” as a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000) needs to be revisited.\r\n\r\nKim et al. (2011) begin by reviewing the interactions between a tumour and its microenvironment, highlighting how this plays an important role in the transition from benign or pre-malignant tumour to invasive cancer. They then describe a continuum model for the mechanics of a growing tumour in three spatial dimensions, and use it to investigate the effects on tumour growth of agarose gel inhomogeneities and other microenvironmental factors. This framework is extended to explore ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in which the stroma is modelled as a continuum but the cells of the tumour are modelled discretely. The mechanical model is coupled to the biochemistry via a system of reaction–diffusion equations which describe the dynamics of key signalling factors. This multiscale model is solved numerically and effects of perturbing the system mechanically or biochemically are illustrated. This approach allows us to begin to understand the outcome of the nonlinear interactions of some of the fundamental processes involved in tumour growth, with the potential to then consider methods to control growth and spread.\r\n\r\nGerlee and Anderson (2011) focus on mechanisms present in organisms that allow it, or parts of it, to maintain a given shape or architecture (structural homeostasis). They consider a hybrid CA model for a two-dimensional mono-layer of cells which may, for example, approximate the epithelial lining of an organ. In their model, each cell has an intracellular network which integrates the cues a cell receives from its microenvironment (for example nutrients or growth factors, whose dynamics are modelled by reaction-diffusion equations) and other cells and determines the response of the cell, in terms of its behaviour or phenotype. The problem is then reduced to finding a set of network parameters (or genotype) which maximises a fitness function such that structural homeostatis is attained. Perturbations of the system, such as wounding or mutation, are investigated.\r\n\r\nVera et al. (2011) present an in-depth review which focuses on JAK-STAT (Janus kinase – signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway in the context of cancer. This pathway plays a fundamental role in growth control, cell differentiation and maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation plays an important role in tumourigenesis. They review the biology of the pathway and then survey systems biology approaches that have helped elucidate the dynamics of the pathway under physiological and diseased states.\r\n\r\nScianna et al., (2011) address the multiple levels of organisation involved in vascularisation, an important step enabling tumour growth and the formation of metastases. Their work forms an innovative multiscale hybrid framework within which to test potential anti-angiogenic strategies in treating cancer.\r\n\r\nInsuk Lee (2011) presents a holistic model of genes as a collaborative society. To the standard approaches involving protein–protein interaction networks (PPIN) and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN) he adds the probabilistic functional gene network (PFGN) to show how robustness can arise despite noisy genomics data. Mapping epistatic interactions between genes is identified as the key way to understanding the genetic organisation of complex traits. Amongst the applications of this approach he considers epistatic interactions between hub cancer genes such as p53.\r\n\r\nKeith Baverstock (2011) uses models of cell regulation to address the important question of whether regulatory networks are hard wired into the genome or whether they are better represented as open systems involving an attractor interacting with the environment. In the latter case, environmental stress can trigger inherited transitions in the phenotype without necessarily involving DNA sequence changes. The second type of model works best. As he says “the power of the model lies in its ability to make evident how it is that a rigid and highly conserved coding sequence in DNA, the genotype, can give rise to phenotypic plasticity and responsiveness to environment” and that it helps to understand “the origins of non-genetic somatic and inherited disease, arising from switches to variant attractors representing phenotypes with abnormal characteristics.” The relevance to diseases like cancer is obvious.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, this set of articles not only challenges some of the current paradigms, but also lays the groundwork for alternative approaches and in many cases takes those approaches further towards the goal of understanding cancer as a systems-level process." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Khmer Tour Guide: An Economical, Political and Cultural Nexus in Siem Reap, Cambodia", "The goal of this research project was to investigate the current network of relationships involved in Siem Reap, Cambodia’s tourism network, focusing on the tour guide specifically as a cultural, economic, and political nexus. Closer examination and interviewing revealed the tour guide licensing process as complex and corrupted, but crucial to the tourism industry in Cambodia’s current economy. The question of cultural transmission and self-identification through state intervention is also examined from the tour guide perspective. Rather than focusing on the negative effects of tourism development in a country emerging from third-world status, the focus of this paper was merely to examine the current day-to-day relationships that contribute to the intricacy of the tourism industry with the utilization of a singular position. It is impossible to consider the Cambodian tour guide’s social position without placing it into historical context. Cambodian culture and economy was greatly diminished by the Khmer Rouge; how did this effect the tour guide’s position in society as transmitters of Khmer culture and history? What was the economic and social position most commonly associated with the Khmer tour guide, and how did this affect everyday life and self-identification? Cambodia is still renowned for political corruption, however, the tourism industry seems to be the most bureaucratic and enforced sector as it remains one of the largest sources of income for the country. By exploring the details of becoming a tour guide, interviewing individuals, and observing everyday struggles and successes this paper attempts to approach these conceptual questions." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Structure, Rhetoric, Imagery: Intersections of Literary Expression and Musical Narrative in the Vocal Works of Beethoven", "Beethoven’s vocal works are often neglected or overshadowed as a result of his prominent involvement with large-scale instrumental genres such as sonata, symphony, or string quartet. Nevertheless, he sustained throughout his life a significant interest in literature and poetry; his personal library, as well as his letters, Tagebuch, and conversation books all document this by way of numerous direct quotations from—and indirect references to—the literary materials that interested him. The numerous vocal works he produced between 1783 and 1826 are one relevant manifestation of this interest and engagement with words. Beethoven produced a significant body of vocal works, the majority of which have not received the same intensity of analytical treatment as the instrumental works. Specifically, this study examines the relationship between words and music in the solo songs and other vocal works of Beethoven. The points of intersection between literary and musical expression are evaluated within four aspects of text setting: structure, rhythm, meaning, and narrative. Firstly, elements of derivation and deviation are explored to determine the diverse ways that he deliberately constructed musical structures in response to the poetic (and semantic) structures of each source text. Secondly, and by extension, rhythm and metre—and varying degrees of derivation, deviation, and manipulation—are assessed so as to demonstrate how these works illustrate Beethoven’s awareness of the expressive possibilities for adhering to or altering the relationship between poetic and musical metre.Thirdly, various types of musical rhetoric—including Beethoven’s implementation of the conventions for affective tonality, as well as the reliance on both conventional and uniquely-Beethovenian depictive idioms and gestures—illustrate his response to various levels of semantic content. Fourthly, his response to individual (though interrelated) aspects of narrative in his selected texts are evaluated. Drawing concepts from key figures of narrative theory—including Gérard Genette, Roland Barthes, Mieke Bal, and others—this study assesses the narrative content in selected texts as a means by which to gauge Beethoven’s compositional response to aspects of temporality, focalisation, spatiality, and so forth, both individually and in combination. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that—contrary to frequently voiced opinions—Beethoven responded quite closely and deliberately to the expressive implications of his selected texts, while aspects of poetic and musical structure, rhythm, syntax, imagery, and layers of meaning coalesce within complex narrative processes. Beethoven was aware of the inherent musicality of poetic texts and the significance of forging a close compositional relationship between words and music; thus he consistently demonstrated in composing these works his ideology that within vocal works ‘words and music form a unit’." ],

  "texts" : [ "Shaping the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during the nineties", "The aim of this study is to explore the process that shaped the identity of peripheral art museums in Israel during decade the 1990s. This process is examined though the eyes of the curators who artistically guided and directed two of these museums, the Janco Dada Museum in Ein Hod and the Ein Harod Museum of Art at Kibbutz Ein Harod. Both museums are non-profit organizations and this study is the first to seek to understand the identity of these two small but significant art museums located in villages in the north of Israel. The research examines the meaning of the identity of the museums by drawing upon theories of museology, centre and periphery, personal and group identity and organization identity. This research is based on knowledge that is personal, unique and subjective. It is conducted using an inductive approach towards gathering, analysing and interpreting data. The research utilizes a case study approach in order to provide an explanation for the cultural organization of the museum and for the attitude of the curators. This is documentary research that is based on only one source, the museum's archives which are examined according to multi- method procedures for gathering data. The evidence showed that in both cases the process of constructing the identity of the art museums links the personal views as well as the professional aims of the curators and their activities. These activities link the identity of the art museum to the natural setting. In addition, these activities, in both cases, link the identity of the museum to the relationship of the centre and periphery. In addition, both curators wished to differentiate their museum from the centre. In the research process new links were created between diverse scientific disciplines such as museology and social science and theories derived from different fields such as art history, sociology, and centre and periphery studies. These links, contribute new insights into our understanding of museology." ],

  "texts" : [ "Spirituality and Depression in Young Adult Survivors of Childhood Physical and Sexual Abuse", "There has been a large body of literature on the robust protective benefits of religion and spirituality against mental illness. The majority of these studies have looked at the buffering effects of religiosity against depression and the positive association between a religious worldview and wellbeing. A primary understanding of this relationship has been that religiosity increases one's ability to cope with life's stress as well as make meaning out of suffering yet little research has been done with survivors of trauma, a population at increased risk for mental illness. Furthermore, there is evidence that the pathway to developing the protective buffer of intrinsic religiosity inherently includes periods of depression and spiritual searching which serve as the catalyst for the process yet it is not well understood how trauma may impact this development. The primary aims of this study are to investigate the relationship between religiosity and depression in adult survivors of childhood physical and sexual abuse across several religious and spiritual dimensions. Results suggest that 1) In the overall sample, high attendance and high religious faith importance are protective against a diagnosis of depression while high spiritual life importance, having a religious experience, childhood physical abuse, and childhood sexual abuse are associated with a depression diagnosis; 2) For individuals without a reported abuse history, high attendance and high religious faith importance are protective against depression while having a religious experience and rating one's spiritual life as highly important were shown to be associated with depression; 3) Childhood physical abuse significantly impacts the protective relationship between high attendance and depression diagnosis and high religious faith importance and depression diagnosis and survivors of childhood physical abuse who also rated their religious faith as important and reported high attendance were more likely to have a depression diagnosis; 4) When childhood physical abuse survivors endorse strongly agreeing that their religious/spiritual beliefs are a guide to daily living they are less likely to have a diagnosis of depression; 5) In survivors of childhood sexual abuse, high religious faith importance and being led spiritually are protective against a depression diagnosis" ],

Our quantitative analysis of diphthongization in real time examines both the trajectory of this change through the community as well as individual speakers’ participation in it across their lifespans. Our study also provides acoustic measurements of the Montreal French vowel system.We tracked individuals’ vowel trajectories across a 24-year span for a panel of six speakers of diverse social classes. Matched trend samples from the 1971 and 1984 Montreal corpora, with four speakers sampled per year, provide a picture of the community as a whole. We find that the vowels [i:, y:, E:, and œ:] show significant lowering and/or backing in the community, and that all long vowels show decreased diphthongization. Some panel speakers’ longitudinal movements mirror these changes, while other speakers are stable across their lifespans and still others show apparently anomalous movements. We discuss these results and their interpretation." ],

In STVM, participants see a study display with ambiguous figure-ground relations. After the study display, participants have to decide which of two shapes in a match display was seen before in the study display. STVM has been used by Vecera, Vogel, and Woodman (2002) to demonstrate that the lower region is a figure-ground cue. In our modified version of STVM, the study stimulus was preceded by a brief prime. This caused a biasing of the figural interpretation of the ambiguous figure-ground displays that contained the lower region cue. We show that 100-msec priming with an unambiguous display is enough to affect the subsequent interpretation of the ambiguous figure-ground display. It takes maximally 350 msec to complete a transition from the nondominant interpretation to the dominant interpretation of an ambiguous figure-ground display that contains the lower region cue." ],

  "texts" : [ "\"The New Development of Dispersed Production System: A Case from the Japanese Toy Industry in the Inter-war Period\" (in Japanese)", "This paper explores Japan's pre-war industrialization from the viewpoint of small- scale businesses. A typical case can be seen in the development of rural weaving industry before the World War I. There functioned the production form besides factory such as putting-out system based on the peasant's sideline work. After the World War I, however, putting-out system in the weaving industry rapidly gave way to factory system that equipped the power looms. Contrastively, the industrial development in large cities, especially in Tokyo during the Inter-war period, entailed the increase of newly formed petty and small workshops. There functioned the production system based on the complex transaction of merchants, factories, small workshops and domestic works. Toy manufacturing, which developed as an export industry in the Inter-war Tokyo, was one of the typical industries based on that production system. As the urban area lacked the peasants and the intimate communities, urban small businesses stood on the different foundations. The skill was trained in the quasi-apprentice system where juvenile workers experienced a sort of on the job training. Based on this skill formation, not a few employees set up their own businesses and competed even with the wholesalers. Their activities were supported by the positive externality of the cluster. The formal and informal institutions played significant roles to prevent the transactions from disorder. The role of production organizer that combined the function of the merchant was also important. The combination of the merchant and the household economy, together with the social and institutional basis, promoted an industrialization based on the small businesses." ],

The applicability of legitimate peripheral participation to school mathematics classrooms is critiqued by considering: the nature of social practice, learning relationships, power, agency, and identity.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Knowledge, attitudes and practices in travel-related infectious diseases: the European airport survey", "BACKGROUND: The European Travel Health Advisory Board conducted a cross-sectional pilot survey to evaluate current travel health knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and to determine where travelers going to developing countries obtain travel health information, what information they receive, and what preventive travel health measures they employ. Subsequently, the questionnaire used was improved and a cross-sectional, multicenter study was undertaken in airports in Europe, Asia, South Africa and the United States. This paper describes the methods used everywhere, and results from the European airports. METHOD: Between September 2002 and September 2003, 5,465 passengers residing in Europe and boarding an intercontinental flight to a developing country were surveyed at the departure gates of nine major airports in Europe. Questionnaires were self-administered, and checked for completeness and validated by trained interviewers. RESULTS: Although the majority of travelers (73.3%) had sought general information about their destination prior to departure, only just over half of the responders (52.1%) had sought travel health advice. Tourists and people traveling for religious reasons had sought travel health advice more often, whereas travelers visiting friends and relatives were less likely to do so. Hepatitis A was perceived as the most probable among the infectious diseases investigated, followed by HIV and hepatitis B. In spite of a generally positive attitude towards vaccines, 58.4% and 68.7% of travelers could not report any protection against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, respectively. Only one in three travelers to a destination country with at least some malaria endemicity were carrying antimalarial drugs. Almost one in four travelers visiting a high-risk area had an inaccurate risk perception and even one in two going to a no-risk destination were unnecessarily concerned about malaria. CONCLUSIONS: The large variation in destinations, age of the travelers and reasons for traveling illustrates that traveling to a developing country has become common practice. The results of this large-scale airport survey clearly demonstrate an important educational need among those traveling to risk destinations. Initiatives to improve such education should target all groups of travelers, including business travelers, those visiting friends and relatives, and the elderly. Additionally, travel health advice providers should continue their efforts to make travelers comply with the recommended travel health advice. Our common objective is to help travelers stay healthy while abroad, and consequently to also reduce the potential importation of infectious diseases and the consequent public health and other implications." ],

Comparison was with similarlyresourced social contact (without communication therapy) from employedvisitors.Outcome measures Primary outcome was blinded, functionalcommunicative ability at six months on the Therapy Outcome Measure(TOM) activity subscale. Secondary outcomes (unblinded, six months):participants’ perceptions on the Communication Outcomes After Strokescale (COAST); carers’ perceptions of participants from part of the CarerCOAST; carers’ wellbeing on Carers of Older People in Europe Indexand quality of life items from Carer COAST; and serious adverse events.Results Therapist and visitor contact both had good uptake from serviceusers. An average 22 contacts (intervention or control) over 13 weekswere accepted by users. Impairment focused therapy was the approachmost often used by the speech and language therapists. Visitors mostoften provided general conversation. In total, 81/85 of the interventiongroup and 72/85 of the control group completed the primary outcomemeasure. Both groups improved on the TOM activity subscale. Theestimated six months group difference was not statistically significant,with 0.25 (95% CI –0.19 to 0.69) points in favour of therapy. Sensitivityanalyses that adjusted for chance baseline imbalance further reducedthis difference. Per protocol analyses rejected a possible dilution oftreatment effect from controls declining their allocation and receivingusual care. There was no added benefit of therapy on secondary outcomemeasures, subgroup analyses (such as aphasia), or serious adverseevents, although the latter were less common after intervention (oddsratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.1)).Conclusions Communication therapy had no added benefit beyondthat from everyday communication in the first four months after stroke.Future research should evaluate reorganised services that supportfunctional communication practice early in the stroke pathway." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Is Kierkegaard's radical faith a defensible justification for religious belief?", "Fideism, or basing one’s religious belief on faith, is popular especially amongst modern Protestant Christians. For the fideist, religious belief-systems are not subject to rational evaluation, and faith as the act of belief forms the essence of truth and the ultimate criterion for embracing a religion. Critics of fideism say that epistemologically, a hierarchy of methods can be used to derive the truth, and each method gives us varying confidence levels. These methods include mathematics and logic, science, personal experience, history, expert testimony, inference and Faith. Among these, the critic says, pure faith in something is the least successful in getting at the truth. Radical fideists like Kierkegaard do not cite logical reasons for defending their belief that God exists. Personal reasons are instead offered for their decision to believe. In this thesis I seek to demonstrate that the radical fideism advocated by Kierkegaard constitutes good justification for belief in the Christian God. I will begin with a discussion on fideism and some of its proponents, followed by a discussion on the place of faith (as a non-rational belief in God’s existence) in religion. I will then appeal to Kierkegaard’s philosophy in defending my view that religious belief in God is a matter of faith and personal commitment, feeling and passion, and this is an inner process not grounded in arguments. References will be drawn from Kierkegaard’s themes of faith, subjectivity and inwardness. I conclude by saying that even if no objective grounds exist to justify our belief, Kierkegaard standpoint remains right in two ways: Firstly, the fideist rejection of the attempt to justify his belief through offering reasons for it is precisely what makes his decision to believe deeply meaningful in his life. Secondly, those who ‘try to judge faith by objective, critical reflection will go on forever that way, and will never reach the point of having faith and of being religious’.

  "texts" : [ "Associations of neighborhood characteristics with active park use: an observational study in two cities in the USA and Belgium", "Abstract\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBackground\n\t\t\t\t\tPublic parks can be an important setting for physical activity promotion, but to increase park use and the activity levels of park users, the crucial attributes related to active park use need to be defined. Not only user characteristics and structural park attributes, but also characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood are important to examine. Furthermore, internationally comparable studies are needed, to find out if similar intervention strategies might be effective worldwide. The main aim of this study was to examine whether the overall number of park visitors and their activity levels depend on study site, neighborhood walkability and neighborhood income.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMethods\n\t\t\t\t\tData were collected in 20 parks in Ghent, Belgium and San Diego, USA. Two trained observers systematically coded park characteristics using the Environmental Assessment of Public Recreation Spaces (EAPRS) tool, and park user characteristics using the System for Observing Play and recreation in Communities (SOPARC) tool. Multilevel multiple regression models were conducted in MLwiN 2.25.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\t\tIn San Diego parks, activity levels of park visitors and number of vigorously active visitors were higher than in Ghent, while the number of visitors walking and the overall number of park visitors were lower. Neighborhood walkability was positively associated with the overall number of visitors, the number of visitors walking, number of sedentary visitors and mean activity levels of visitors. Neighborhood income was positively associated with the overall number of visitors, but negatively with the number of visitors being vigorously active.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\t\tNeighborhood characteristics are important to explain park use. Neighborhood walkability-related attributes should be taken into account when promoting the use of existing parks or creating new parks. Because no strong differences were found between parks in high- and low-income neighborhoods, it seems that promoting park use might be a promising strategy to increase physical activity in low-income populations, known to be at higher risk for overweight and obesity." ],

This paper develops a distinctly sociological explanation of that crisis based on Fligstein’s (1996) markets as politics approach and the sociology of finance. We use archival and secondary sources to show that the industry became dominated by an “industrial” conception of control whereby financial firms vertically integrated in order to capture profits in all phases of the mortgage industry including the production of financial products. The results of multivariate regression analyses show that the “industrial” model drove the deterioration in the quality of securities that firms issued and significantly contributed to the eventual failure of the firms that pursued the strategy. We show that large global banks which were more involved in the industrial production of U.S. mortgage securities also experienced greater investment losses. The findings challenge existing conventional accounts of the crisis and provide important theoretical linkages to the sociology of finance" ],

  "texts" : [ "Hypertension in four African-origin populations: current 'Rule of Halves', quality of blood pressure control and attributable risk of cardiovascular disease.", "OBJECTIVE: To assess the public health burden from high blood pressure and the current status of its detection and management in four African-origin populations at emerging or high cardiovascular risk. DESIGN: Cross-site comparison using standardized measurement and techniques. SETTING: Rural and urban Cameroon; Jamaica; Manchester, Britain. SUBJECTS: Representative population samples in each setting. African-Caribbeans (80% of Jamaican origin) and a local European sample in Manchester. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cross-site age-adjusted prevalence; population attributable risk. RESULTS: Among 1,587 men and 2,087 women, age-adjusted rates of blood pressure > or =160 or 95 mmHg or its treatment rose from 5% in rural to 17% in urban Cameroon, despite young mean ages, to 21% in Jamaica and 29% in Caribbeans in Britain. Treatment rates reached 34% in urban Cameroon, and 69% in Jamaican- and British-Caribbean-origin women. Sub-optimal blood pressure control (> 140 and 90 mmHg) on treatment reached 88% in European women. Population attributable risks (or fractions) indicated that up to 22% of premature all-cause, and 45% of stroke mortality could be reduced by appropriate detection and treatment. Additional benefit on just strokes occurring on treatment could be up to 47% (e.g. in both urban Cameroon men and European women) from tighter blood pressure control on therapy. Cheap, effective therapy is available. CONCLUSION: With mortality risk now higher from non-communicable than communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, systematic measurement, detection and genuine control of hypertension once treated can go hand-in-hand with other adult health programmes in primary care. Cost implications are not great. The data from this collaborative study suggest that such efforts should be well rewarded." ],

  "texts" : [ "Capturing complexities of student leadership: knowledge, power and practicalities", "Over the past decade student participation in school leadership has gained prominence in the field of education. However, the concept of ‘student leadership’ remains broad and elusive, allowing many school leaders to misuse it in ways that serve their own needs. Student leadership is defined here as student participation in activities which promote self-advocacy (Lansdown, 2000: 16). There are very few studies which actually examine the relationship between student leadership and school decision-making. This paper reports on a case study of student-led project at an independent high school in England. The students lead a consortium of teachers and administrators at the school to draw up policy recommendation on learning with ICT at the school, which are forwarded to the school’s senior management team. Using the case study as reference, this paper argues that student leadership although full of hopes and aspirations for the future of education, is at present fraught with complexities. These include issues of knowledge: when the roles of learner and teacher are reversed, power: based on who decided what is included in the agendas, and practicalities such as time and resources.Lansdown, G.

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "eLearning courses about national tourism destinations: destination management organizations’ offers and travel agents’ perceptions and motivations", "A broad number of studies have been undertaken so far both by the  academic research and by industry communities on the use of the  internet for educational purposes. However, very limited research has  been done previously on the use of Information and Communication  Technologies (ICTs) as educational and training modes within the  hospitality and tourism field. Travel agent training, certification  processes and the use of ICTs to deliver training to the travel trade have  been largely excluded from the previous academic research. This study  aimed to address this research gap with the purpose to understand  eLearning offerings within the tourism field. It explored the use of  eLearning courses created by Destination Management Organizations  (DMOs) for the education and certification of their travel trade partners.  Additionally, it investigated the reactions and motivations of the users –  travel agents based in the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand – on  those training activities. In order to answer specific research questions,  this thesis adopted a mixed method approach including both qualitative  (benchmarking and case studies), and quantitative (online  questionnaires and phone interviews) research instruments. This  interdisciplinary research project contains elements of the following  research fields: tourism and eTourism, education and eLearning, Human  Resource Management, as well as motivational theories. This study  explored all existing eLearning offers provided by DMOs worldwide. 75  available eLearning courses about national tourism destinations were  analysed looking thoroughly at their structure. Additionally, semi- structured interviews were undertaken with the representatives of two  DMOs: Tourism New Zealand and Swiss National Tourism Office, in  order to provide an in-depth corporate view on the subject matter: Kiwi  Specialist Program and Switzerland Travel Academy. An online  exploratory questionnaire with the travel agents globally has been done  in order to evaluate participation in and awareness about eLearning  courses about tourism destinations and subsequent reactions of the  travel agents on them. Phone interviews with travel agents based in the  United Kingdom (#190), India (#272) and New Zealand (#165) were then  conducted in order to discover the rates of current usage. This study  also looked at the rates of awareness of eLearning courses in the three  studied countries, as well as investigated what motivates and  discourages travel agents to participate in online training activities. The  final online questionnaire (#249) tested a new theoretical model on the  motivational factors for attending eLearning courses about tourism  destinations. The model was based on the series of elements derived  from the previous steps within this study as well as incorporated the  elements from existing motivation theories. This study revealed benefits  of eLearning as a new form of training within the tourism industry.  eLearning courses are believed to be a convenient mode of training,  which gives a greater access to education for travel agents globally,  especially to those based in geographically isolated locations. eLearning  courses are financially viable from both the provider and the user  perspective as well as enhance the performance of travel agents within  their roles, and presumably the satisfaction of their current or potential  clients. Travel agents undertake eLearning activities, as they believe  them to be helpful in work-related tasks as well as are beneficial for  updating needed knowledge. Additionally, travel agents appreciate the  opportunity to study online, while being able to update their knowledge  on their own pace and in a flexible environment. The research revealed  that travel agents in the three studied countries are not attending  eLearning courses about tourism destinations due to a desire to feel  related to their managers or colleagues. The study showed that  participation in the eLearning courses depends on the country where  travel agents are based, the type of agency they work for and their  gender. While the age of the travel agents and their educational level did  not show any significant influences on the participation level. At the  same time, awareness about the existence of eLearning courses about  tourism destinations depends on the county where travel agents are  based, and doesn’t depend on their age, gender, type of agency they  work for or their educational level. This thesis provided the first empirical  results in the field for the use of ICTs for Human Resource Management  of the travel trade. It is the first extensive study on eLearning usages  within on-the-job training in the hospitality and tourism industry. This  study contributed to eTourism and eLearning literature, within a given  professional family, that of the travel agent. The research has analysed  and tested the factors influencing travel agents’ participation in and  awareness about eLearning courses about tourism destinations.  Furthermore, this research has proposed and tested a sound empirically  based theoretical framework for the evaluation of the motivational  drivers in the specific context, those of travel agents on undertaking  destinational eLearning courses. The results of the study also have  industry implications, particularly the first understanding of the eLearning  options through a benchmarking study of all existing national eLearning  courses about tourism destinations as well as through two case  studies, which presented the managerial perspective on the studied  issue. Furthermore, marketing, trade partnership and training managers  within national, regional and local tourism offices are presented with the  first research on travel agents’ evaluation of eLearning training  platforms, on the rates awareness and participation in the United  Kingdom, India and New Zealand and on their motivations on starting an  online training activity. This research can help representatives of the  DMOs to understand better the role of eLearning for travel agents, and,  therefore, develop more efficient and effective strategies and actions in  their trade and training partnerships globally." ],

  "title" : "Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Pain management for women in labour: an overview of systematic reviews.", "BACKGROUND: The pain that women experience during labour is affected by multiple physiological and psychosocial factors and its intensity can vary greatly.  Most women in labour require pain relief. Pain management strategies include non-pharmacological interventions (that aim to help women cope with pain in labour) and pharmacological interventions (that aim to relieve the pain of labour). OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to manage pain in labour. We considered findings from non-Cochrane systematic reviews if there was no relevant Cochrane review. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 5), The Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2 of 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 31 May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to 31 May 2011) to identify all relevant systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of pain management in labour. Each of the contributing Cochrane reviews (nine new, six updated) followed a generic protocol with 13 common primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Each Cochrane review included comparisons with placebo, standard care or with a different intervention according to a predefined hierarchy of interventions. Two review authors extracted data and assessed methodological quality, and data were checked by a third author. This overview is a narrative summary of the results obtained from individual reviews. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 15 Cochrane reviews (255 included trials) and three non-Cochrane reviews (55 included trials) for inclusion within this overview. For all interventions, with available data, results are presented as comparisons of: 1. Intervention versus placebo or standard care; 2. Different forms of the same intervention (e.g. one opioid versus another opioid); 3. One type of intervention versus a different type of intervention (e.g. TENS versus opioid). Not all reviews included results for all comparisons. Most reviews compared the intervention with placebo or standard care, but with the exception of opioids and epidural analgesia, there were few direct comparisons between different forms of the same intervention, and even fewer comparisons between different interventions. Based on these three comparisons, we have categorised interventions into: \" What works\" ,\"What may work\", and \"Insufficient evidence to make a judgement\".WHAT WORKSEvidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural (CSE) and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects. Epidural, and inhaled analgesia effectively relieve pain when compared with placebo or a different type of intervention (epidural versus opioids). Combined-spinal epidurals relieve pain more quickly than traditional or low dose epidurals. Women receiving inhaled analgesia were more likely to experience vomiting, nausea and dizziness.When compared with placebo or opioids, women receiving epidural analgesia had more instrumental vaginal births and caesarean sections for fetal distress, although there was no difference in the rates of caesarean section overall. Women receiving epidural analgesia were more likely to experience hypotension, motor blockade, fever or urinary retention. Less urinary retention was observed in women receiving CSE than in women receiving traditional epidurals. More women receiving CSE than low-dose epidural experienced pruritus.  WHAT MAY WORKThere is some evidence to suggest that immersion in water, relaxation, acupuncture, massage and local anaesthetic nerve blocks or non-opioid drugs may improve management of labour pain, with few adverse effects.  Evidence was mainly limited to single trials. These interventions relieved pain and improved satisfaction with pain relief (immersion, relaxation, acupuncture, local anaesthetic nerve blocks, non-opioids) and childbirth experience (immersion, relaxation, non-opioids) when compared with placebo or standard care. Relaxation was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and acupuncture was associated with fewer assisted vaginal births and caesarean sections.INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCEThere is insufficient evidence to make judgements on whether or not hypnosis, biofeedback, sterile water injection, aromatherapy, TENS, or parenteral opioids are more effective than placebo or other interventions for pain management in labour. In comparison with other opioids more women receiving pethidine experienced adverse effects including drowsiness and nausea.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most methods of non-pharmacological pain management are non-invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, however, their efficacy is unclear, due to limited high quality evidence. In many reviews, only one or two trials provided outcome data for analysis and the overall methodological quality of the trials was low. High quality trials are needed.There is more evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological methods, but these have more adverse effects. Thus, epidural analgesia provides effective pain relief but at the cost of increased instrumental vaginal birth.It remains important to tailor methods used to each woman's wishes, needs and circumstances, such as anticipated duration of labour, the infant's condition, and any augmentation or induction of labour.A major challenge in compiling this overview, and the individual systematic reviews on which it is based, has been the variation in use of different process and outcome measures in different trials, particularly assessment of pain and its relief, and effects on the neonate after birth. This made it difficult to pool results from otherwise similar studies, and to derive conclusions from the totality of evidence. Other important outcomes have simply not been assessed in trials; thus, despite concerns for 30 years or more about the effects of maternal opioid administration during labour on subsequent neonatal behaviour and its influence on breastfeeding, only two out of 57 trials of opioids reported breastfeeding as an outcome. We therefore strongly recommend that the outcome measures, agreed through wide consultation for this project, are used in all future trials of methods of pain management." ],

  "texts" : [ "Business Regulation, Inward Foreign Direct Investment, and Economic Growth in the New European Union Member States", "Purpose â The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which institutional convergence has taken place in the new European Union (EU) member states. It does so by contrasting arguments that are inspired by transaction-cost economics within the mainstream international-business literature and contentions within the comparative-capitalisms perspective. A corollary of arguments within the\nformer is that those countries that have less transparent ways of doing business will post poorer economic growth records than those with more predictable and less costly regulations. By contrast, contentions within the comparative-capitalisms literature lead to expectations that a broader set of institutional factors will shape economic growth.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach â The article adopts a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach to examine the necessary and sufficient causal conditions for economic growth in the region.\n\nFindings â There is a great deal of institutional diversity within the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe. There are no clusters of countries around a specific variety of capitalism or an economic model that has above-average economic growth rates and that is characterized by\ninstitutions that lower the costs of market transacting. This, in turn, suggests that convergence pressures are not as great as the mainstream international-business literature has argued.\n\nResearch limitations/implications â Future research could complement this study by adopting a cross-country, comparative micro- or firm-level approach to examine the ways in which different institutional factors, both individually and collectively, shape the growth of businesses and consequently, economies.\n\nOriginality/value â Mainstream international business tends to focus on regulation and market-supporting institutions to explain growth in developing economies. This research has shown that a broader view of institutions needs to be adopted, as some countries have been able to post strong economic growth figures despite institutional environments that do not lower the costs of market-based contracting." ],

Gender and Wealth (Dis)Accumulation in the Subprime Boom", "Subprime lending has become the penultimate case study for critics of the recent period of financialization, or neo-liberalism more broadly, because it exposes the most profligate tendencies of predatory lending and the pernicious social costs visited on society's most vulnerable groups. This article builds on the social stratification and wealth accumulation literature. We assess how mounting debt levels and crippling costs of servicing these debts compared to relatively flat income growth for female-headed households have resulted in wealth (dis)accumulation. We use the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze how single female-headed households, and in particular how African American single mothers were affected by the subprime boom in different, arguably more pernicious, ways. There is already considerable evidence showing that subprime lending was disproportionally sold to women, particularly minority women. Focusing on single mothers reveals important gender and racial dimensions of the lending techniques, but it also shows how marginalized families increasingly relied on housing wealth (equity) to adjust to shrinking purchasing power. Thus, contrary to the lofty expectations of the ownership society, the high mortgage debts of many low-income women suggest they own a lesser share of their homes – (dis)accumulation of wealth – than at any previous time." ],

We also perform a rolling analysis of robust estimation for a window of seven overlapping samples. Our empirical findings show that there are some main differences across industries as far as the weights attributed to the underlying factors.

A study by Gibbon (1994) demonstrated a potential role for community nurses in helping patients and carers to cope with the aftermath of stroke. This article reassesses the issues that affect the capacity of community nurses to develop this role. A focus group conducted with community nursing students identified a number of barriers to the expansion of service provision for this patient group, including workload pressures, training and management support. Understanding of the problems faced by stroke patients and their carers in the current organization of continuing care and rehabilitation is required to support expansion of nursing practice in this area." ],

  "texts" : [ "Skin scar preconceptions must be challenged: importance of self-perception in skin scarring.", "Greater objective scar severity and visibility should intuitively cause greater psychosocial distress for patients. Previous research is contradictory and has employed non-validated scar severity measures whilst neglecting patient-rated severity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of objective and patient-rated scar severity, scar type and location on psychosocial distress. Skin scars were quantitatively assessed on two independent occasions using the 'Manchester Scar Scale' (MSS) - a validated measure. Scars were scored twice independently. Patients also rated their scars (from 'very good' [zero] to 'poor' [four]) and good completed the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS24) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Eighty-two patients, with an average+/-SD (range) age of 34+/-15 (16-65) years were recruited. Mean psychosocial questionnaire scores were: DAS24 45.5+/-17.8 (15-91); DLQI 7.5+/-6.7 (0-26). Participants had 1.9+/-1.5 (1-8) scars with an MSS score of 31.3+/-24.0 (6.6-162.0) and subjective score of 2.6+/-1.2 (0-4). Correlation between psychosocial distress and objective severity was not significant (DAS24 0.14 p=0.11; DLQI 0.16 p=0.06). Correlation between psychosocial distress and subjective severity was significant (DAS24 0.48 p<0.0001; DLQI 0.46 p<0.0001). Patients with non-visible scars experienced greater psychosocial distress than patients with visible scars (DAS24 9.7 p=0.046; DLQI 4.2 p=0.014). Scar type was unrelated to psychosocial distress. Patient-rated scar severity and scar visibility are correlated with psychosocial distress rather than clinician's objective severity rating or scar type. Although counter-intuitive, results are consistent with research into other disfiguring conditions and patient self-assessment should therefore form an integral part of clinical assessment." ],

  "texts" : [ "Moral Beauty and Moral Taste From Shaftesbury to Hume", "My dissertation is a historical study which attempts to recover the classical synthesis of aesthetics and ethics as expressed in the concepts of moral beauty and moral taste.  I begin by observing how the ancients saw goodness and beauty as one concept such that moral goodness was conceived as an intrinsically attractive ideal.  Next I show how, at the start of the modern era, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke shifted the basis of moral motivation from internal attractiveness to the external constraints of law, thus eliminating moral beauty from their accounts.  I then trace the emergence of the modern moral taste view in the Cambridge Platonists (viz., Benjamin Whichcote, Henry More, and Ralph Cudworth) and the Third Earl of Shaftesbury and argue that Francis Hutcheson's moral sense theory diverged from this tradition in important ways.  Here I draw a distinction within early modern sentimentalist views between moral taste theories (which build motivation into moral judgment) and moral sense theories (which do not).  Finally I show that David Hume followed Shaftesbury's moral taste theory more closely than he followed Hutcheson's moral sense theory. I conclude that Hume's account is superior to Hutcheson's insofar as the analogy with aesthetic taste emphasizes the importance of tradition, community, and intersubjective conversation whereas the analogy with sense perception appeals only to an ahistorical essentialism.  Moreover Hume's account is superior to Shaftesbury's insofar as Hume's version of the moral taste doctrine is based on a naturalized account of moral beauty which does not rely on natural teleology and is therefore more accessible to us today than ancient Greek accounts." ],

Life span can also be influenced by the composition of the intestinal microbiome, and C. elegans life span can be dramatically influenced by its diet of Escherichia coli. Although C. elegans is typically fed the standard OP50 strain of E. coli, nematodes fed E. coli strains rendered respiratory deficient, either due to a lack coenzyme Q or the absence of ATP synthase, show significant life span extension. Here we explore the mechanisms accounting for the enhanced nematode life span in response to these diets.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResults\n\t\t\t\t\tThe intestinal load of E. coli was monitored by determination of worm-associated colony forming units (cfu/worm or coliform counts) as a function of age. The presence of GFP-expressing E. coli in the worm intestine was also monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Worms fed the standard OP50 E. coli strain have high cfu and GFP-labeled bacteria in their guts at the L4 larval stage, and show saturated coliform counts by day five of adulthood. In contrast, nematodes fed diets of respiratory deficient E. coli lacking coenzyme Q lived significantly longer and failed to accumulate bacteria within the lumen at early ages. Animals fed bacteria deficient in complex V showed intermediate coliform numbers and were not quite as long-lived. The results indicate that respiratory deficient Q-less E. coli are effectively degraded in the early adult worm, either at the pharynx or within the intestine, and do not accumulate in the intestinal tract until day ten of adulthood.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusions\n\t\t\t\t\tThe findings of this study suggest that the nematodes fed the respiratory deficient E. coli diet live longer because the delay in bacterial colonization of the gut subjects the worms to less stress compared to worms fed the OP50 E. coli diet. This work suggests that bacterial respiration can act as a virulence factor, influencing the ability of bacteria to colonize and subsequently harm the animal host. Respiratory deficient bacteria may pose a useful model for probing probiotic relationships within the gut microbiome in higher organisms." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "The Effects of Teleshopping on Travel Behavior and Urban Form", "This dissertation employs structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to explore the tradeoffs people make when engaging in teleshopping activities from home. Using the Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) 2000 this dissertation performs an activities analysis to investigate these relationships. Time use variables are included that predict the amount of time each individual spends during the day on work, maintenance, discretionary, and shopping activities, both in and outside of the home. These activities are used to predict the amount of shopping travel each person undertook. Results suggest that people substitute home teleshopping time for shopping travel time, and teleshoppers take fewer shopping trips and travel shorter total distances for shopping purposes. However, these effects are mainly “indirect” and appear to be mediated through two time-use variables – In-Home Maintenance and In-Home Discretionary activities. Home teleshoppers tended to spend more time on In-Home Maintenance and less on In-Home Discretionary activities than non-home teleshoppers.\n      Variables constructed to represent the degree to which people are “time-starved” from the demands of their work and maintenance activities revealed that female heads of households tend to home teleshop more, make more shopping trips and shopping trip chains, shop out-of-home more, and shop travel for longer periods than the rest of the survey population. A variable constructed to measure each survey participant household’s accessibility to shopping opportunities suggests that people who live in high retail accessibility areas tend to home teleshop slightly (but statistically significantly) more, take more shop trips, make more shop trip chains, and travel shorter total distances for shopping purposes than those who live in lower accessibility neighborhoods.\n      These results suggest that home teleshopping is primarily used as a tool to restructure a person’s daily activities participation, which in turn, restructures a person’s shop travel behavior. The degree to which someone is time-starved – particularly, female head of households – appears to play a role in determining the propensity to home teleshop as does a person’s relative accessibility to retail opportunities. While confirmatory analysis is necessary, these results suggest that activity-based travel demand models would benefit from the inclusion of home teleshopping, time-starved, and retail accessibility variables." ],

  "title" : "Health problems of travellers: an examination of GeoSentinel and expedition data",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Health problems of travellers: an examination of GeoSentinel and expedition data", "Childhood memories recall the endeavours of famous travellers in time whose moments of great occasion were often wrecked by diseases encountered on deployment.  Take Genghis Khan, whose most indirect, though by no means benign, gift to the 13th century was the plague. Originating in the jungles of southern China and Burma, bubonic plague travelled with Mongol armies and then from caravan to caravan till it reached the Crimea in 1347. From there it would take a third of all Europeans. \r\n\r\nTake this example as one of the human spread of disease and extend it to global travel in the 21st century. It is so much easier now to spread disease as travel is quicker, easier and many more people are partaking in it. Short incubation periods indicate the potential to promulgate disease processes is so much greater, and indeed with more disastrous effect. In addition, as there are so many different communicable diseases, there is the very real risk of mis-diagnosis with resultant dire consequences.\r\n\r\nTo focus energies on the prevention of traveller’s diseases would be akin to guiding good health in a way that supports not just the traveller, but the region of travel as well. To spotlight certain dis-ease, and diseases, in order to give clear examples of the work that goes into preventing traveller-health unwellness became, for the author, a logical nidus for energy. The projected outcome of such a fixation would be a set of parameters within which safe travel is possible. \r\n\r\nWhilst not wanting to stifle travel with such apparent ‘rules’, popular thinking in the speciality of travel medicine has it that ‘guidelines for travel’ contribute to safe and secure travel, and also to diseases’ awareness with their resultant measures of prevention. \r\n\r\nThe stimulus to investigate illnesses that may affect travellers extended into those that may affect groups of people on collective journeys, and even those who were mounting expeditions to remote regions of the globe for venture or adventure. As it was not possible to be all encompassing with respect to the spectrum of travellers’ health diseases, it was important to acquire primary sentinels upon which to bass understanding of the disease processes and from them to make practical inference from the results. \r\n\r\nThis thesis thus centres on the general epidemiology of travel diseases and then seeks to investigate some focal aspects such as rabies immunisation, groups and expedition medicine, and incidental case studies to give clear example of the scope of this rather exciting field of medicine. From consideration of these examples, the development of policies on travel health management is a logical extension. Reviewing available data on outstanding issues such as: health of sportspeople at a major sporting event, vaccine preventable diseases and setting up a travel health clinic, is both exhilarating and intellectually challenging. \r\n\r\nEnveloping all these aspects of travel medicine is personally energising and gives thought to clinical practice. It also gives energetic notice to want to pursue the field further in the future.  \r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nMethods of data collection and analysis were dependant upon the each of the three focus groups analysed. Firstly, those returning from their travels and who presented to travel health clinics in Auckland or Hamilton were assessed for illnesses acquired abroad.  Secondly, those in the group targetted for either rabies pre-travel immunisation or port-travel rabies exposure were scoped in detail. Thirdly, the group that undertook remote travel by way of expeditions or premium travel tours were assessed for illnesses as they may have been obtained; viz, in the field. Some of these patients may have had a pre-travel consultation to anticipate overseas health issues from travel health professionals before they departed for overseas. \r\n\r\nGlobal surveillance of emerging infections by way of a sentinel network enabled the collection of data for analysis of each of groups one and two, above. Being part of a expedition group, as the medical provider, guided the collection of information in group three. Group one was studied from 1997 until 2001. Group two from 1998 through until 2006. Finally, group three was studying from 2001 until 2004. \r\n\r\nRecorded data for all patients presenting for travel-related illnesses, seen at the two sites in New Zealand, were extracted for analysis. Variables analysed included age, sex, pre-travel encounter, reason for travelling, patient classification (whether a New Zealander having returned from abroad, or a foreigner being assessed in New Zealand clinic ) and a post-travel diagnosis. In addition, patients with a diagnosis of animal-related injury (mammal bites or scratches) were included for analysis as a separate disease focus within the greater spectrum of general global ill health following travel abroad.  \r\n\r\nPatients seeking care for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis were also included. Data was collected on the following: gender, country and world region where exposure occurred, age of subject exposed, animal related to the exposure, site of exposure on the body, the World Health Organization category of exposure to potential rabies, pre-exposure prophylaxis status, post-exposure immunoglobulin given, post-exposure vaccine given, type of post-exposure vaccination regime and whether it was an approved vaccine, and finally, the presence or absence of travel health insurance. \r\n\r\nThe third group for micro-focused study in this thesis involved those going to remote global regions. From the commencement of the Sir Peter Blake Expedition to Brazil and Venezuela in 2001, the author (as expedition physician) recorded all illnesses and injuries amongst the crew and also amongst the indigenous people encountered, whilst undertaking the expedition. Information recorded included age, sex, subjective and objective nature of the presenting illness, the assessment of the condition based on presenting information and the treatment employed. The outcome of each presentation was tracked and follow-up was continuously maintained wherever possible. \r\n\r\nThere continues to be a growing popularity of travellers wishing to go on premium tours or expeditions, and little is known or written on the illnesses and injuries that may occur whilst travelling. Studies on the injuries and illnesses of various group-travels to countries such as may be encountered on the Silk Route in Middle Asia, the Arctic Circle, and the Mongolian Gobi are presented. All seek to investigate the prevalence of health problems suffered by travellers on a premium, expedition or remote medicine journey.  \r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nInformation on travel-related illnesses, when reported through a global reporting system, can be useful for the travel health adviser in identifying issues of current concern. Diarrhoeal disease was assessed as being the most common diagnosis of illness in the returning traveller, followed by animal bites, skin diseases and schistosomiasis. Other tropical diseases however, such as malaria, were uncommon diseases amongst returning travellers. GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network, makes a significant contribution to the assessing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases through a network of individual sites in various countries including New Zealand. Such information can be used to help provide preventive advice for travellers as well as help in assessing illness in post-travel patients. \r\n\r\nAnimal-associated injuries are not uncommon among returned travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites. The highest proportion of potential rabies-exposure injuries was recorded in travellers to Asia, mostly in regions which are endemic for rabies, and this had led to a requirement for Post Exposure Prophylaxis. There is an inadequacy in current practice for rabies-exposed injured travellers, who need to be adequately counselled about animal-associated injuries and rabies risk when visiting rabies-infected countries. Concern must be expressed for the small number of travellers who were immunised prior to their travel, of whom a quarter were bitten overseas and received initial post-exposure treatment consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines. The risk of rabies in children younger than 8 years, who are at particular risk for animal bites requires particular attention; especially as this group represented nearly twenty percent of cases in this study. It is thus important that travellers from New Zealand are made aware of the risks of developing rabies secondary to animal exposure in countries they travel to, and all travellers need to obtain adequate pre-travel health advice, on the prevention of a disease that is virtually 100% fatal, from a qualified travellers’ health source.\r\n\r\nIntradermal rabies immunisation appears very effective when given according to the standard WHO protocol in a cohort of intending New Zealand travellers. Thus, intradermal rabies immunisation is highly recommended for those travelling to endemic areas for the risk of rabies, particularly where follow-up serology can be done before travel and where there are staff who are experienced in this form of immunisation administration. \r\n\r\nExploration and adventure travel are increasingly attractive to people of widely differing ages, experience, physical health and interests. Whilst there are significant health challenges to practitioners of expedition medicine, the aims remain to anticipate preventable medical problems, to maintain health throughout the expedition, to optimise achievement and enjoyment, whilst not stifling enthusiasm or ambition. The modern practice of expedition medicine is to minimise the risk of trauma and diseases by proper pre-travel planning involving risk assessment, preventive measures such as vaccinations, prophylactic drugs and medical equipment, knowledge of first aid, emergency and primary healthcare skills, communication skills, and an attitude of caring for both the anticipated team and the anticipated cultures of the expedition.  This planning should cover all contingencies; from mild illnesses and disease to group health insurances, through to unforeseen events such as evacuating a seriously ill, injured or dead person. \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of an expedition physician on an expedition increased the independence of the travelling group on their journeying, yet decreased the reliance on local health services, a source which is often scarce or absent on more remote location expeditions. \r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nInformation changes quickly, and often dramatically. Anyone providing travel health information needs to be aware of the requirements of international travellers, for information on travel-related illnesses, when reported through a global reporting system, can be useful for the travel health adviser in identifying geographical diseases of global concern. Whilst illnesses and injuries encountered by international travellers tended to centre on ‘syndromic presentation’ of diarrhoeal, respiratory or dermatological illness, the travel health professional needs to be knowledgeable on their presentation. In being so, the clinician is acting as a clinical sentinel for transmissible disease processes. Being part of such a sentinel group makes a global contribution to the surveillance of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases through a network of individual sites in various countries including New Zealand. This information can be used to help provide preventive advice for travellers as well as help in assessing illness in post-travel patients. Such is the case with the disease of rabies. There is increased awareness in New Zealand to make travellers aware of the risks of developing rabies secondary to animal exposure in countries they travel to. \r\n\r\nAs there is no clear distinction between those who travel either as expedition team members or others who travel to ‘wilderness’ areas, there is considerable overlap between adventure travel and leisure travel.  Exploration and adventure travel are increasingly attractive to people of widely differing ages, experience, physical health and interests and this tends to create new challenges to practitioners of expedition medicine although the aims remain to anticipate preventable medical problems, to maintain health throughout the expedition, to optimise achievement and enjoyment, but above all not to stifle enthusiasm or ambition of the journey!" ],

  "title" : "Guided tourism : the role of guidebooks in German tourist behaviour in Sweden",
  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Guided tourism : the role of guidebooks in German tourist behaviour in Sweden", "Tourism is a spatial phenomenon. Tourist behaviour on-site is not only dependent on the destination itself, but also on the situation in other places, tourists’ spatial mobility and access to information. On the basis of this argument, the whole tourism system is taken into account in this thesis. The aim is to analyse the interplay between mobility, tourist behaviour and guidebooks. The focus lies on German tourists in Sweden. Due to the importance of guidebooks to this visitor group, the thesis concentrates particularly on guidebooks as source of information. In the first article, power relations that steer the selection of Swedish tourist sites in German guidebooks are analysed. The results show that the selection of tourist sites is dependent on personal, editorial, geographical, economic and tourism-sociological factors. The production of information is dependent on a complex web of power relations, the core of which is constituted by authors, publishers and readers. In the second article, the content in German guidebooks on Sweden is analysed. Besides Stockholm and Northern Lapland, the regions presented most frequently are usually located in the south of the country. It is found that guidebooks influence German tourists’ choices of tourist sites in Sweden, and that this influence increases with the distance from Germany. The study also shows that guidebooks contribute to constructing tourism space and providing places with meaning. In the third article, it is shown that information and time availability influence tourist mobility. The existence of an individual travel rhythm is confirmed, which is defined as a travel pattern that is independent of the tourist sites that are visited. It includes, among other things, long travel distances the first and last days of the holiday, a short first stay-over, the longest stay in the region with the greatest distance from home, and a relation between the length of stay at one place and the distance covered when departing. In the last article, tourist behaviour is analysed. The results dispel the predominant impression in current tourism discourse that states that tourists are continually active during their holidays. It is found that the major difference between home and tourist behaviour is not constituted by the activities themselves, but by a difference in place, followed by a slower pace in which activities are performed and a limited time period. Spatial mobility, the characteristics of place and access to information all influence tourist behaviour on-site. In conclusion, it is found that tourist information, mobility and behaviour on the spot are closely connected. Tourists consume the tourism space created in guidebooks, and recreate this space when travelling, as they choose individually how to respond to the information provided. Actors, places and tourist structures all exist in relation to each other. For the resulting behaviour in place, this means that it is not only the supply at the destination that is important, but also the situation in tourists’ home regions and along their travel routes." ],

The paper introduces these conflicts through an overview of the background and management of Vietnam’s protected natural areas and the development of eco-tourism in Vietnam in recent years. Subsequently, detailed case studies of two particular Vietnamese national parks are presented to illustrate specific manifestations of these conflicts. An analysis and discussion of the findings of the case studies arrives at an articulation of common defining conflicts facing national parks in Vietnam, including recommendations for future policies and division of roles to address these conflicts." ],

Such studies tell us that secularisation happens because each cohort is less religious than the one before, and that socialisation in childhood and habits formed in young adulthood are overwhelmingly responsible for religious decline. In this article we use data from the International Social Survey Programme to consider the extent and magnitude of religious decline at the level of families, whether parental influence is greater in more religious countries, and which individual variables influence the intergenerational transmission of religious practice and whether these vary between different countries. We find that secularisation happens largely because many people are a little less religious than their parents, and relatively few are more religious. We also find that the patterns of transmission are remarkably stable: parents are no more influential in religious countries than in nonreligious countries, and there is no indication that they have lost influence over time." ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Forging an Ascetic Planet: Jesuit Lives and Virtues on the Mission Frontier of Eighteenth-Century New Spain", "This work examines how a uniquely Jesuit ascetic ideal, or will to power over the self and others, developed on the Spanish-American frontier and was represented in Jesuit-authored hagiographies and natural histories in both New Spain and the metropole during the eighteenth century. As missionaries and prolific authors, the Jesuits were crucial to the expansion and representation of the frontiers of New Spain; likewise, the Spanish-American mission frontier was essential to Jesuit subjectivity as a space of meaningful action where the missionary could perform the ideal of ascetic conduct preserved in Christian tradition. Through the performance of this ideal and the production of missionary narratives and natural histories, the Jesuits bridged the ascetic ideal and the inner-worldly exercise of self-discipline and social control that is central to theories of modernity. The idealized representation of the Jesuit subject's conduct not only reaffirmed the order's corporate identity but also actualized a political and cultural hegemony through narratives that served as a medium for establishing value orientations in all strata of Novohispanic society. Originating in the Society's tradition of \"Edifying Letters,\" eighteenth-century Jesuit narratives increasingly turned towards more detailed accounts of individual subjects' lives and reiterated a common narrative structure covering their early childhood, education within the order, work as teachers and finally the fulfillment of their apostolic vocation on the frontier. This phenomenon is observable in the boom of Jesuit-authored missionary hagiographies appearing in New Spain from 1725 until the expulsion of the order in 1767, coinciding with the Society's most embattled period in both New Spain and Europe. The proliferation of works representing individual missionaries' \"vidas y virtudes\" was accompanied by the differentiation of missionary biography from Jesuit-authored natural histories, which increasingly focused on a secular European reading public. Nevertheless, both genres reflect the enactment of the Jesuit ascetic ideal in distinct value spheres of colonial and European modernity: while the biography of the exemplary missionary responded to the imperatives of social control and the ethical rationalization of the colonial order, Jesuit natural history presupposed an ascetic subject that increasingly pursued knowledge of the natural world as an end in itself." ],

I argue that the appropriate context of the non-realists understanding of religious belief is provided by philosophical pragmatism as this is presented in the work of John Dewey and Richard Rorty. This context outlines important aspects of the 'Sea of Faith' religious non-realists' self-understanding; and provides them with an argumentative resource which they can employ against alternative critical-realist approaches to religious belief I show that John Dewey's understanding of religious faith coheres with many of the ideas expressed by religious non-realists and that Rorty's  pragmatism  provides  religious  non-realism   with  a contemporary philosophical articulation of its theology. In order to defend this assertion I argue that Rorty's pragmatism does not necessarily lead to radical subjectivism nor to a dangerous political ideology as some interpreters have suggested. Further, I argue that his ideas are open to theological appropriation and that his rejection of religious belief is tempered by a tolerance toward those who still find a use for it. Rorty, I claim, has such a use. He employs the term 'God' as a backdrop against which he can present his own account of a pragmatic culture. I show that his work contains positive references to the influence that religious belief has had on the development of such a culture and argue that this pragmatic culture fits well with a non-realist understanding of religious belief" ],

  "description" : null,
  "texts" : [ "Regional Versus Local Accessibility: Neo-Traditional Development and Its Implications for Non-work Travel", "The question of how particular forms of metropolitan development affect travel patterns has long been of concern to planners but has recently been at the centre of a heated debate. Much of this debate has focused on the effects of suburbanization in particular, with some arguing that the decentralization of housing and jobs reduces overall travel (for example Gordon et al., 1989; 1991) and most others arguing that the low-density development that is associated with decentralization leads to more automobile travel and gasoline consumption (for example Newman and Kenworthy, 1989; 1992). The debate has taken on a very practical form in proposals that address the problem of growing levels of travel, particularly non-work travel, by changing the way in which individual suburbs are designed. The sprawling, low-density suburban development that has proliferated in recent decades in the United States is defined as the problem and a new approach to design is put forth as the solution. This approach is commonly dubbed 'neo-traditional development'.\n      Despite the popularity of the neo-traditional concept, the evidence on how effective these developments will be at reducing non-work travel is limited. This paper begins to remedy this situation, by providing both a framework through which these proposals must be evaluated and evidence from case studies of four communities within the San Francisco Bay Area as to the relationship between alternative forms of suburban development and the travel patterns of suburban residents. The question addressed is whether 'traditional' suburban forms engender less non-work travel than alternative forms, and the answer is ambiguous." ],

The structure of the model system is recursive, depicting a sequential decision-making mechanism. The results were based on a data set from the Detroit metropolitan area. They were compared with those of a previous study that used a data set from the Netherlands. Differences were observed not only in the values of the regression parameters estimated but also in the decision mechanism inferred." ],
