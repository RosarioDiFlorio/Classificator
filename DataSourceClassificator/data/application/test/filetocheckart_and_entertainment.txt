UCSD Art Collective : articulating identity through art and activism
In this thesis I examine the multiplex correlations between art, activism, and identity using data collected from my Participatory Action Research in Art Collective, a group of socially conscious UCSD student-artists. I draw from my experiences dating from January of 2010 to the present. I begin by mapping out the student mobilizations that occurred between February 15th and March 4th of 2010 at UCSD in response to the UC budget crisis and the underrepresentation and under-servicing of black students on campus. This context provides a deeper understanding of the conflicts that Art Collective grappled with in our performances and activism. Next, I uncover some of the historical issues of racial and economic elitism that underscore UCSD's history and how this context informs the current power dynamics in the university's spaces. Using spatial and postcolonial theory, in addition to my personal reflections as a member of Art Collective, I assert that our public music making is a means through which we bodily reclaim institutional space and rearticulate our voices and identities on our own terms. Finally, after outlining some of our key performances, I situate Art Collective within a realm of processes: reflection, coalition building, and sharing subjectivities and experiences. These processes make the collective's performance style distinct, as it cultivates common bonds that strengthen community and foster personal growth. In essence, this thesis is a representation and an extension of my praxis as an artist-activist engaging in reflexive community work

Ruth Reid and Kent Hyde Collection
Working with the collections at the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives is a unique experience, each collection has its own sense of itself, serving as a window into individual lives, formative political moments and thegrowth and development of the lesbian community. One of the first collections that I processed was the Ruth Reid and Kent Hyde collection. Ruth and Kent were both writers, lifelong intellectuals, weavers and lovers. Their collection covers the duration of their relationship of over forty years. What makes this collection so rich is the breadth of materials which includes a large amount of correspondence between Ruth and Kent and an array of their friends and family. These letters range in subject matter and through their reading one can get a sense of each woman’s particular sense of humor, specific interests and professional tone.

Expanding Horizons: Kim Hongdo's Album of the Four Districts of K&#365;mgang and European Inspiration in Korean True Scenery Painting of the Eighteenth Century
ABSTRACT OF THE THESISExpanding HorizonsKim Hongdo's Album of the Four Districts of K&#365;mgang and European Inspiration in Korean True Scenery Painting of the Eighteenth CenturyByNathaniel KingdonMasters of Arts in Art HistoryUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2012Professor Burglind Jungmann, Chair	The authenticity of the Album of the Four Districts of K&#365;mgang attributed to Kim Hongdo (1745-before 1818) is contested by scholars. Yi Song-mi argues that the style of the paintings correspond to a European sensibility that was not known in Korea in the late eighteenth century, whereas, Oh Ju-seok does not question the attribution to Kim Hongdo or the early dating of the album to ca. 1788. This debate contests Kim's progressive role in the development of the genre of true scenery painting as well as the extent to which Korean artists utilized European techniques and styles at the end of the eighteenth century. 	In order to understand whether Kim's painting is truly an anomaly, I examine the development of true scenery painting through two other major figures, Ch&#335;ng S&#335;n (1676-1759) and Kang Sehwang (1713-1776), with special attention as to the extent to which they integrate and expand on tradition. I also compare Kim's album with his set of eight hanging scrolls (ca. 1788) that contain similar techniques, styles, and calligraphic elements. My research indicates that both Ch&#335;ng and Kang were keen innovators in the true-scenery genre, experimenting with many of the European techniques and styles that appear in the Four Districts album. In addition, Kim's set of eight hanging scrolls confirm that he used a similarly detailed style of painting for other commissions and that there may be calligraphic evidence to prove that the contested album is by his same hand. Although the true origin of the album may never be proven, my research indicates that it sits comfortably within the development of true-scenery painting in the eighteenth century as well as Kim's oeuvre of landscape works.

Personal Names: Function and Significance
In ancient Egypt, an individual’s name was of vital importance for defining his identity insociety and assuring his survival for posterity. A person might have two or even three names,one of them sometimes being a basilophorous name (a name that incorporates a king’s name)adopted by the individual at a certain stage of life. For foreigners, taking an Egyptian namewas frequently a means by which they integrated into Egyptian society. Grave crimes wouldentail damnatio memoriae, a process by which a person’s identity could essentially beerased by mutilation and obliteration of the name. Certain personal names also hadapotropaic potential, and the names of the sages of the past could even be used in magic.

Redefining Interpretation at America's Eighteenth-Century Heritage Sites
For over a decade historians have debated the "history wars," discussions of difficult history and public memory that have identified problems in the American meta-narrative. While these debates have produced fruitful academic discussion they have mainly identified problems, rather than addressing viable solutions. The solution is to alter public memory through public history that incorporates multiple historic voices and integrates geographic and regional contexts. This study analyzes interpretation at American heritage sites of the eighteenth century to consider the standard interpretive narrative and understand how alterations to narrative and interpretation can shape public memory. The heritage sites included represent the four prominent colonial regions of the eighteenth century--Chesapeake, New England, Middle, and South--and cover mainly historic house museum installations. Current interpretation of the eighteenth century by public historians has been largely dominated by an American meta-narrative that is not multi-cultural in focus. While public history has incorporated elements of the "new social history," most sites have not developed unified narratives that acknowledge multiple voices and influences in the shaping of American history. The history presented is largely overly localized, lacks larger historical context, and overlooks topics of difficult history such as race and slavery. Altering current narratives to include topics that were significant to the everyday life of eighteenth-century Americans has the ability to reform public memory and create a popular American history that is more textured and accurate. These proposed alterations focus on reconsidering the power of the presidency in the Early Republic, contextualizing the significance of landscape, recognizing the Atlantic context, reforming depictions of slavery, and developing better concepts of the reality of life in the period. The creation of new and more challenging narratives at heritage sites has the potential to dramatically alter American public memory.

Ernest T. Kretschmer: Reflections on Santa Cruz Musical Life, Volume II
his volume was the Project's second publication on Kretschmer, a notable presence in Santa Cruz musical life for more than 30 years. In this volume, Kretschmer reflected on the significant local cultural developments of the last decade and his role in those events. He described the coming-of-age of the Santa Cruz County Symphony under maestro Larry Granger, the need of the symphony and other musical organizations for a performing arts concert hall in north county, and recent efforts to establish such a facility.
      Kretschmer also discussed the Henry J. Mello Center for the Performing Arts, the premiere cultural venue in south Santa Cruz County, which Kretschmer was instrumental in founding.
      Kretschmer discusses the world-renowned Cabrillo Music Festival, which he participated in since its inception. He recalls the festival's acclaimed 1999 production of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass," and the innovative tenure of the festival's Music Director/Conductor, Marin Alsop. He also gave a lively history of Santa Cruz's New Music Works, directed by Phil Collins, which has highlighted the work of local composers, including Lou Harrison.
      Kretschmer's philanthropy over the years included the donation of concert grand pianos to local venues, the establishment of music scholarships for UCSC students, the support of UCSC's resident student ensemble program, and, most recently, the establishment of a permanent endowment to enrich musical archives in the University Library's Special Collections.
      Krestchmer's memoir demonstrated the importance of dedicated volunteers in local cultural organizations and how their contributions have created in our small community unusually diverse and thriving performing arts and musical organizations.

[painting, ordinary, sleep, image]

No ordinary sleep
No ordinary sleep includes nine works that combine oil painting with photographs printed on canvas. The painting and the photograph are not resolved into a continuous image but rather left with the seams exposed: painted figures floating in an uninhabitable, photographic space. The nine images depict the same two young men, nude and in close proximity to each other but rarely touching. These paintings raise questions about modes of reproduction, the use of the composite, fantasy, kitsch, desire, homoeroticism and identity. In No ordinary sleep, instead of making "straight" paintings, I am muddying the waters of identity, gaze and viewpoint to create queer images that are a hybrid of painting and photography, that cross and confuse assumptions about desire, and that are not defined by established plateaus

[station, american, dolorosa, drama]

Stations; A Multimedia Performance for Eight Players
Stations combines staged theater, live and recorded music, video installation, and electronic audio effects via ChucK music processing software to create a "tragic drama."  Symbolically, Stations retells the story of the traditional Via Dolorosa, the Catholic Stations of the Cross.  The theatrical, symbolic, and metaphysical manifestations of elements of the Via Dolorosa that exist in Stations create an aesthetic phenomenon wherein an object's perceived identity conflicts with its physical presence in reality.   The works of James Joyce, Ulysses in particular, served as an artistic model for Stations, because the fictional story of Ulysses serves as a symbolic signifier for the quasi-historical events in Homer's epic poem. Similarly, the actors in Stations exist simultaneously as performing musicians (their reality), characters in a play, and symbolic icons of the Via Dolorosa, making a consistent allusion to the Christian ceremony.  	 The musical and theatrical design of Stations reflects the influence of three American composers for theater, Broadway's Stephen Sondheim, American composer and musicologist Arthur Farwell, and avant-garde opera composer Robert Ashley.  Sondheim's muti-faceted treatment of ensemble, presenting large groups as a Greek chorus as well as a party made up of individuals, influenced the character and story development of Stations.  Farwell's dedication to American folk music and the presentation of community dramas as a unique American art form became the inspiration for the source material of Stations, the American hymns "Were You There," "In the Garden,"  "Beach Spring," and the Venezuelan Christmas Carol "Ni&#324;o Lindo."  Ashley's Perfect Lives utilizes video as a commentary on the action, in the same way that the electronic elements of Stations act as an actor in the drama.    	The form of Stations reflects the dichotomy between the biblically accurate accounts of the Via Dolorosa and the apocryphal, traditionally accepted events.  The representations of true historical accounts, fictional events, and commentary on religion and the afterlife combine to create the tragic drama in a multimedia theater environment.

Modelli scolastici nel Boccaccio napoletano
Scholastic Schemes in Boccaccio's Neapolitan Works 
      The aim of this article is to investigate the consistency and meaning of the logical-dialectical processes emerging in the wider context of rhetorical means in the works written by Boccaccio in Naples and immediately after his return to Florence. In these works, dialectical schemes sometimes take the more complex structure of quaestio disputata. By using the disputatio form, a good number of medieval authors show how the disputatio leaves the narrow university milieu, and reaches the literary context. A possible reason for the reception of the quaestio disputata within the literary context can be identified in the rediscovery of the similarities of late medieval dialectic and rhetoric, since both are “sciences of the probable,” and therefore aim at persuading rather than at demonstrating. A second reason can be found in the dramatic nature of philosophical disputatio, a veritable tournament fought with the weapons of the mind. In Boccaccio's works, scholastic language and mental processes are widely diffused, a phenomenon that can be explained by the intermingling of philosophical and literary models. Nevertheless, it should also be noticed that the disputatio adopted by Boccaccio is reinforced by his return to its scholastic sources. Those texts were not unknown to a writer who was in touch with the scholars of the court of King Robert the Wise in Naples, studied canon law, read and loved Dante’s works, and was acquainted with Aristotle, Boethius, the Platonic Tradition, and Thomas Aquinas. The presence of scholastic language and techniques leads us to evaluate their narrative role in Boccaccio’s literary production, their nature of prospective tools allowing the game of viewpoints. In Boccaccio’s writings, sometimes a quaestio opposing two possible positions has the task of seeking the “truth.” Boccaccian use of disputatio hides a subtle literary strategy that both seems to give the reader the option of choice, and/or the author to take his position and direct the reading, and deserves to be analyzed more deeply.

Developing a Training Program for Collection Managers
Training new collection managers (bibliographers) in an academic research library is an enduring challenge, especially in the modern collections environment. Many bibliographers come to the job with limited subject expertise, and must also master a constantly evolving collection development environment featuring interdisciplinary collecting, aggressive cooperative purchasing, and a myriad of technological issues.  This paper examines collection manager training at UC Santa Barbara.  It describes a new program of training sessions, and the concurrent creation of a "Collection Managers' Manual" (http://www.library.ucsb.edu/collman) of advice and information for the subject bibliographer.

[composer, setting, symbol, female, chapter, song, genre]

Gender and Compositional Choice: Four Songs on a Poem of Heinrich Heine by Female and Male Composers
As an accepted genre of female composition, song lies in a unique position among musical genres.  This allows it to stand largely outside the area of Claude Steele’s notion of “stereotype threat,” and being absent such weighty pressures, it could then furnish an arena in which female composers can do their best work.  As a genre that combines the arts of music and poetry, song is based upon a given set of symbols that provide the composer with inspiration.  The study of these symbols and their possible metaphorical meanings can offer a guide to that inspiration.  By studying two settings by male composers and two settings of female composers, we can compare their individual and gendered approach to those symbols for elements of a masculine or feminine style.
	Heinrich Heine’s 23rd poem in Die Heimkehr, analyzed thoroughly in Chapter 2, is the focal text in this study.  In Chapters 3 through 6 each of the settings is examined at length using both a standard formal analysis and the “Grundgestalt” concept of Schoenberg.  The settings examined are “Ihr Bild” by Franz Schubert, “Ich stand in dunkeln Träumen” and “Ihr Bildniss” (two versions of the same work) by Clara Schumann, “Ich stand in dunkeln Träumen” by Hugo Wolf, and a setting of the same name by Ingeborg von Bronsart.  Each discussion focuses on the individual reactions to the specific symbols identified in Chapter 2, as well as the global approach to some well-known literary aspects of paternalistic literary culture of the time.   The thesis concludes with a summary of the similarities and differences in the preceding four examinations. Chapter 7 also draws conclusions based on those contrasts, which yields an evaluation of gendered reactions and the possibility of a feminine style in the nineteenth century.

Monte Carlo simulation in systems biology
Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) is a framework within the field of Systems Biology which aims to understand cellular metabolism through the analysis of large scale metabolic models. These models are based on meticulously curated reconstructions of all chemical reactions in an organism. Instead of attempting to predict the exact state of the biological system, COBRA describes the physiological constraints that the system must satisfy and studies the range of solutions satisfying these constraints. Monte Carlo Sampling is one of the COBRA methods used to study how biological properties are distributed over the entire solution space. A set of randomly distributed solutions is generated and serves as a proxy for the entire space. Various aspects of Monte Carlo Sampling in Systems Biology are illustrated : 1) Monte Carlo Sampling has been used historically (Chapter 1), 2) A faster and more efficient procedure for generating Monte Carlo Samples is developed (Chapter 2); 3) Carbon 13 tracing experiments are an important tool for measuring reaction rates through a network. Monte Carlo Sampling was used to optimize the choice of label and explain and measure the dimensionality of output data (Chapter 3); 4) It is possible to incorporate the thermodynamic "loop-law'' into many COBRA methods including sampling (Chapter 4). Additionally two software projects are presented which assist in analyzing COBRA models : 1) the BiGG knowledgebase of reconstructions (Chapter 5) and 2) the COBRA Matlab toolbox v. 2.0 (Chapter 6). These two projects make COBRA methods available to the scientific community

[love, loved-one, chapter, dissertation, normative]

Love and Morality: Toward an Ethic of Universal Love
In this dissertation, I examine the normative force of the claim that one should love others. 	In the first part of the dissertation I provide an account of loving. In chapter 1, I argue that love necessarily involves activity aimed at benefiting the loved-one for her own sake. In Chapter 2, I develop this definition and argue that loving-activity is activity which aims to contribute to the well-being of the loved-one. I advance this view against the influential view of loving-activity given by Harry Frankfurt, who claims that loving-activity is aimed at the interests of the loved-one. In Chapter 3, I show how theories of listening can help us to understand how those who love can disagree with a loved-one while continuing to act lovingly toward the loved-one. I argue that by listening to the loved-one, one-who-loves allows the loved-one to exercise her ability to direct her own life thereby treating her as an individual and contributing to her well-being.	In the second portion of the dissertation I account for the normative force of the claim that one should love others. While several philosophers have claimed that cultivating love is impossible, I argue in chapter 4 that love can be cultivated. I explore two methods of cultivating love: Stoic oikei&#333;sis and Buddhist metta meditation. I argue that these methods do in fact cultivate love. In chapter 5, I argue that given the influential account of right and wrong developed by T. M. Scanlon, there can be no moral obligation to love. Finally, I argue in chapter 6 that the imperative to love others expresses a normative ideal, which supports various values including philanthropy, charity, forgiveness, and loving-community. In so far as one embraces the ideal of love, one should recognize the goodness of these values.	 As love is a topic that has been neglected by most moral philosophers, the aim of this dissertation is to raise as well as resolve questions about the role of love in moral life. The framework developed in the final chapter is meant to start a conversation about how philosophers could begin to integrate the importance of loving into our normative frameworks.

"I Respond": Alissa Goldring's Photographs of Mexico in the 1950s: An Oral History
This oral history, conducted by Lizzy Gray of the Regional History Project, centers on the photographs Goldring took in Mexico between 1955 and 1971. It is intended as a guide and supplement to Goldring's Mexican photos, slides and negatives, now preserved in the Special Collections Department of the UCSC Library. A finding aid to that collection is available at http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9x0nd1bc/
      
      Alissa Goldring was born Alice Berman in lower Manhattan in 1921 and knew from an early age that she wanted to be an artist. She majored in art at Brooklyn College and also studied photography and other forms of art at the American Artists' School in Manhattan. Through these years Goldring was rarely without her sketchbook, and developed a beautiful abbreviated ink style capturing the character of people, boats and buildings in Manhattan. Two of these pieces appeared in The New Yorker magazine under the name Alice Reiner. She eventually earned a Masters in Art from Teachers College of Columbia University.
      In 1954, newly divorced and with two children, Goldring flew to Mexico, despite not speaking Spanish, and knowing no one there. Her photography enabled her to support herself and gave her an avenue into the local culture. Initially, she did photographic portraits of children. She then worked on assignment for Mexican magazines, such as Gente and Claudia, as well as for local newspapers and non-profit organizations such as Planned Parenthood. She was sent to schools and monasteries, psychiatric hospitals and rural villages. On her own, she roamed through open markets and mountain towns with her camera, unobtrusively capturing rituals, such as children floating candles on water on the night of el Dia de los Muertes (the Day of the Dead), and services at a tiny Jewish temple in Venta Prieta. Goldring was especially intrigued by Lacondonian and Chomula cultures. She also met well-known figures such as Erich Fromm and Daiset Suzuki, and the archive contains photographs of Rufino Tamayo, Dolores del Rio, Alma Reed, architect Juan O'Gorman, and the clowns Firulais and Cantinflas.

Sandra Kay Martz : Papier-Mache Press & the gentle art of consciousness raising 1984-1999
Following in the footsteps of the second wave feminist publishers of the 1970s, Sandra Kay Martz founded Papier-Mache Press in 1984. Papier-Mache Press was known for publishing accessible books which, "presented important social issues through enduring works of beauty, grace, and strength," and "created a bridge of understanding between the mainstream audience and those who might not otherwise be heard." This accessibility, combined with hard work, and savvy marketing and business sense, catapulted Papier-Mache to remarkable financial success and visibility. Of the 60,000 book titles published in the United States each year, less than one percent sell over 100,000 copies. Over 1.6 million copies of the anthology When I Am An Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple were sold in bookstores and gift stores across the United States. This groundbreaking collection was one of the first non-clinical and positive books on women and aging, and was written by older women themselves. It challenged stereotypes and confronted the invisibility of older women in America. Several years later, another book in Martz's anthology series entitled I Am Becoming the Woman I've Wanted won the 1995 American Book Award. By 1998, Papier-Mache Press had published over sixty titles.
      In this oral history Martz discussed the successes of Papier-Mache Press, as well as the enormous changes in the book industry which took place in the late 1990s. She credited feminist culture and politics with her success, and discussed her collegial relationships with other feminist publishers in the United States and Canada, many of whom were her inspiration. She provided an astute assessment of the future of feminist and independent publishing, and discussed the implications of the changes in book publishing in the 1990s for literacy and the exchange of ideas in a free society.
      Papier-Mache Press is one of three presses archived at UC Santa Cruz's University Library, as part of the UC/Stanford US History and Women's Studies Consortium California Feminist Presses Project. The project is designed to preserve the output as well as the history of feminist presses in California. The other two presses collected are Shameless Hussy Press and HerBooks.

The musical representation of Asian characters in the musicals of Richard Rodgers
The study of the American musical is emerging in two different research streams. The first treats the musical as an aesthetic object and applies traditional methods of structure and historical analysis. The second treats the musical as a cultural product representing the goals and interests of a particular power structure, and applies new methods of sociopolitical and cultural analysis. A small number of scholars, like Raymond Knapp, are connecting the musical structures in the scores of Broadway musicals with their sociopolitical considerations. Even fewer scholars, like Graham Wood, are connecting specific musical structures with dramatic functions across a corpus of scores. In this study, I will demonstrate how "orientalist" musical features in Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Michener 1949), The King and I (Rodgers, Hammerstein, Sirmay, and Landon 1951/2005), and Flower drum song (Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Fields 1959) are used to portray Asian characters--Tonkinese, Thai, and Chinese Americans--and dramatize their actions and struggles. Orientalist musical features are those Western appropriations, inventions, and musical clichés which Western composers use to represent characters from Asian locales without having to interact with actual indigenous musics. These features, like other orientalist usages, are a way of "dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the Orient" (Said 2003, 3). Some typical orientalist features include unusual modes, scales, instrumentation, and so forth. Rodgers' use of these features in characterization has consistent patterns across his corpus of works with Hammerstein and in his one Asian-themed musical with Lorenz Hart. These features are dramatically linked to issues of cultural assimilation, especially in The King and I and Flower drum song. The Western hegemonic project represented in The King and I is connected to the same types of musical features and patterns of usage as the American melting pot project represented in Flower drum song. These types of assimilation to Western ways and values are further connected to the theory of Andrea Most (2004) who regards the Broadway musical as representing the complexities of Jewish assimilation in America. I demonstrate that the use of orientalist musical features dramatizes a particular perspective on assimilation, and that Flower drum song actually rejects the notion of total assimilation in favor of community

Understanding dandyism in three acts : a comparison of the revolutionary performances of Beau Brummell, George Walker, and zoot suit culture
My objective in this research was to find a usable definition for dandyism and to understand why the performance has been culturally important and adopted in different eras. I looked to performance theory and to real -life performances of dandyism by Beau Brummell, George Walker, and the zoot suiters, as well as to the literary productions and historical research of dandyism by such writers as Ellen Moers, Ian Kelly, and Barbara Webb. I was able to locate, within the life performances of these three historical subjects, three aspects of the dandy's performance that are the most salient and translatable : the dandy shocks his community with a performance of superiority, delimiting his otherwise marginal status in that community; he alienates that society by putting himself on a pedestal of self; and he entertains, maintaining a seamless mask of truth and fiction that pleases his alienated society while he, always the stoic, appears not to notice. Performance takes place and is passed on in the liminal space, or the topsy-turvy space in the margins of society, which often results from social and political ruptures. The dandyism that is born here is always revolutionary, pushing back against oppression and creating a new space of performance that opens doors to the possibility of future dandies. This holds true for the performance of the three dandyisms explored in the dissertation: Beau Brummell, George Walker, and the zoot suiters' cultural moments suffered epistemic ruptures from which the dandy performance was spawned: late eighteenth- century England was shifting as the aristocracy fell, late nineteenth-century America shifted with the rise of a newly freed black population, and the mid-twentieth century saw great changes in the United States with the Second World War and the influx of migrant workers to the cities. I found that all of my subjects were indeed performing against erasure in their societies, whether the oppression was set upon their class, race, or, in the case of the zoot suiters, age, family hierarchy, and ethnicity

Neuro-linguistic Programming and Learning Theory: a Response
<p>In an earlier issue of this journal, Craft (2001) explored Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) in relation to a classification of learning theories. Craft also offered various observations on, and criticisms of, aspects of NLP such as its theoretical coherence, modelling, Dilts's 'logical levels' and possible dissonance of NLP's espousal of individuality in learning with its experiential emphasis.

</p>
<p>This article offers a response to Craft's article. It describes the origins and nature of NLP, and explores its theoretical identity. NLP is portrayed here as based primarily on the cybernetic epistemology of Gregory Bateson (1972, 1979). The article offers a critique of many of the views put across in Craft's article, and builds on her attempt to position NLP theoretically.

</p>
<p>The broad aims of this article are to offer an informed perspective on the nature of NLP; to extend the academic literature on NLP; and to develop debate about its relevance to the theory and practice of education.</p>

THE ART OF TOURISM
<p>This article offers two innovations. First it proposes a new method, “virtual curating”, which is an extension to methods (such as content analysis and discourse analysis) deployed to interrogate written texts. In this case the texts are works of art and virtual curating elaborates and evaluates a method for using these works to understand tourism. Second it mounts a virtual exhibition in tourism art distilled from the collection of around nine hundred works. It organizes the art into themes, or galleries, and offers a guide to the exhibition. The outcomes of the article are a novel reading of, and fresh insights into both the phenomenon of tourism and its representation.</p>

Review: Paper Machines: About Cards & Catalogs, 1548-1929 by Markus Krajewski
Markus Krajewski, a professor of Media History at Bauhaus University in Weimar, describes his book as the first attempt to trace the development of the card catalog, beginning as an aid to libraries’ flood of books and scholars’ deluge of citations, and later as the corporate office’s ubiquitous indexing system, ordering people, money, and inventory. He sees in the paper index card the prototypical universal machine defined by Alan Turing, and for this he puts its in lineage with the jacquard loom, electronic punch cards, the desktop computer, and today’s palm-sized processors.

Easy Fire : You walking pyre! : Strung out, horny- hip for hire! : Please him 'till he'll never tire! : The broken, boring, selfish liar!
My thesis exhibition consists of four acts, with each act manifesting in a total of four locations and nine separate performances. Act One took place at the San Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park, with the following three acts on UCSD campus and in downtown San Diego. My thesis work conjures up a viewer's relationship with performance art, as well as ponderings from my own identity and my critique on the interactions and exchanges of the people in Southern California. The work appears as hand crocheted, full body masks that perform self-generated rituals articulated by an actor. Each performance is meant to guide a viewer into a participator, to direct a physical or psychical engagement with art, performance, and actor. In my thesis, my hope is that the viewer develops an emotional relationship with the work I create, which alters their relationship with the work of performance in and out of Art Institutions. In my paper, I describe and locate indigenous impulses for ritual, the use of myth in contemporary culture, and a spiritual energy surrounding a person experiencing Art

An assemblage of fragments : history, revolutionary aesthetics and global capitalism in Vietnamese/American literature, films and visual culture
This project examines the politics of knowledge production in Vietnam during the transition from socialist realism to post-socialist aesthetics and neoliberalism. I look at literary, filmic and visual culture productions that challenge and present alternatives to the construction of history in the discourses of Vietnamese nationalism, French colonialism and U.S. imperialism. I attend to the cultural violence that came out of the Vietnamese civil war and that continues to haunt the post-socialist society. I first focus on works produced by writers and filmmakers in the North to examine how they responded to the state vision of history-making. To recover the suppressed histories of those who fled Vietnam after 1975, I also examine diasporic Vietnamese films and visual culture that disrupt the unitary discourse of Vietnamese nationalism. Moving from the literary to the visual, I look at short stories, war novels, films, installation art and photography made from within the nation and from the diaspora. I examine how literature and films can be productive sites for the interrogation of nationalist historiography, and how they can be sites for the staging of a modern, heterosexual masculine subject through their elisions of women. I also look at visual culture that unsettle positivist trajectories by attending to the reversals, openings and closings, ruptures and fissures in history-making. This is a comparative, interdisciplinary, and multilingual study that brings together the fields of Asian Studies, U.S. Ethnic Studies, Feminist Studies, Cultural Studies, and Transnational Studies, and contributes to the body of research on postcolonial societies negotiating global capitalism

How Europe is Changing
The author of this book was born in 1954 in Iran. As a university student, he joined an underground movement that first rebelled against the Shah and later against Khomeini. For his clandestine publications, he adopted the alias Kader Abdolah in honor of two of his comrades in the underground who were assassinated by Iran’s successive regimes of oppression. In 1988, he reached the Netherlands where he received political asylum. Little by little, he began to master the Dutch language. Abdolah’s literary career in Dutch began in 1993. His debut was an astonishing success and paved the way for a career that would lead him to the top of contemporary Dutch literature. In addition to his work as a novelist, he became a weekly columnist. Fifty of his columns appear here. Kader Abdolah is widely seen as one the most original and thought-provoking voices in the debate on the profound transformations that are taking place in Europe in consequence of the immigration in the lastdecades.

Mary Lea Heger Shane: The Lick Observatory
Dr. Shane was an astronomer, historian, and wife of the former Director of the Lick Observatory. Her association with the Lick Observatory began in 1919, when she moved up to Mount Hamilton for a year's postgraduate work, work which eventually resulted in her Ph.D. thesis. The first section of her manuscript is concerned with the workings of the Observatory in the 1919 period-- the apparatus, the astronomers, the duties of the graduate assistants-- as well as the more mundane subjects such as food, lodging, water supply, and health care. Since Dr. Shane had for years been the Observatory's unofficial historian-in-residence, she and the interviewer took an all-day trip to Mount Hamilton. The resulting eighty pages of manuscript, which form the middle portion of the volume, focus on the history of the Mount Hamilton road and development of the various telescopes. Dr. Shane also comments on a number of astronomers and observatories throughout the world. In the final portion of the volume, Dr. Shane describes the administrative and technical problems her husband, Dr. Donald Shane, faced as Director of the Observatory from 1945-1958, as well as amusing anecdotes of everyday life on the mountain.

WPP, No.111: The Intonation of Tongan
This paper presents a model of the intonational system of Tongan, an Austronesian language, taking the autosegmentalmetrical theory as its framework. Tongan has lexical stress which appears on the penultimate syllable of prosodic words and is marked postlexically with one of two bitonal pitch accents—a rise, LH*, or a low tone, L*. Measurements show that the first tone of both pitch accents aligns with the stressed syllable onset, while the second tone aligns with the stressed syllable offset. There is evidence for two tonally marked levels of prosodic phrasing in Tongan, the intonational phrase (IP) and the accentual phrase (AP). The IP is about the size of a full utterance or major phrase and is marked by a final boundary tone and are realized on the IPfinal syllable. Four boundary tones have been observed. The smaller unit, the AP, usually contains one lexical word plus preceding functional elements. Two APfinal tones have been observed, realized on the final syllable of the phrase. Lastly, focus is only realized intonationally through increased pitch range on the focused element. Tongan is typologically interesting because it provides another case in a growing list of languages that intonationally marks both head and edge prominence.

Integrating 3D and 2D Representations for View Invariant Object Recognition
This thesis presents representations and corresponding algorithms which learn models to recognize objects in the full continuous view space. Particularly, we propose to integrate the 3D object-centered representations with 2D viewer-centered representations, which fills in the representation gap between the sparse and simple 3D shapes and their view variant appearances observed as image pixels. Towards this goal, this thesis studies the following models and corresponding algorithms:1. A mixed model and a pursuit algorithm that integrates 3D object primitives and 2D image primitives according to their information contributions measured as information gains. This proposed measure is consistently used in subsequent models, and also provides a numerical answer to the debates over object-centered representation and viewer-centered representation.2. A 2D compositional image model and a sum-max data structure which groups the 2D image primitives to represent middle level image structures, such as line segments, curves and corners. This middle level image model can be used to find sparse representations of natural images, and connects the low level 2D image representations to 3D object representations.3. A 3D hierarchical compositional object model and an AND-OR tree structure which represents a huge number of possible 3D object templates using a limited number of nodes. This AND-OR tree hierarchically quantizes the infinite and continuous space of object geometry and appearance, and decomposes the 3D object representation into 3D panels, whose appearance on images are further decomposed into active curves and the 2D primitives. Though with multiple hierarchies, learning and inference can be done efficiently by dynamic programming,which is essentially composed of layers of sum and max operations.

The Political Nature of Plato’s Symposium
The dramatic setting of Plato’s Symposium obscures its function as a discourse that establishes the political philosophy of its author. The effort to identify the political within an ostensibly apolitical dialogue reflects the ancient attempt to use the casual and leisurely as a tool for prying open the more serious. I want to suggest that readings of the Symposium which do not attempt to uncover fully the political achieve only a partial understanding of Plato’s program within the work. I also want to establish the possibility that Plato relies on a historical and literary intertext with writers such as Thucydides and Aristophanes in order to key the reader into the underlying, and potentially dangerous, political nature of the dialogue. When such historical intertext goes unnoticed or is dismissed, the reader constructs, I submit, an insurmountable obstacle for the understanding of the work. On the other hand, only when the reader recognizes Plato’s use of historical material, can the Symposium be viewed properly as a forum for the development of political philosophy in the guise of a literary drama.

Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra
Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra is an original music composition for symphonic orchestra, featuring an alto saxophone soloist. The music presents a conflict between fast, short accents from the orchestra, and lyrical sustained notes from the saxophonist, embodied in a motive consisting of three step-wise descending notes. Part I is resolved with the saxophonist succeeding in converting the orchestra to lyrical passages. Part II is a slow movement, in which the conflict is materialized in the awakening of an original chorale melody that utilizes the inversion of the three-note motive from Part I.

Vessel network detection using contour evolution and color components
Automated retinal screening relies on vasculature segmentation before the identification of other anatomical structures of the retina. Vasculature extraction can also be input to image quality ranking, neovascularization detection and image registration, among other applications. There is an extensive literature related to this problem, often excluding the inherent heterogeneity of ophthalmic clinical images. The contribution of this paper relies on an algorithm using front propagation to segment the vessel network. The algorithm includes a penalty in the wait queue on the fast marching heap to minimize leakage of the evolving interface. The method requires no manual labeling, a minimum number of parameters and it is capable of segmenting color ocular fundus images in real scenarios, where multi-ethnicity and brightness variations are parts of the problem.

Internal Colonization and Revolt: Rap as an Underground Political Discourse in Oakland, CA from 1965-2010
This study examines the relationship between rap music and internal colonization in Oakland, California from 1965-2010. As rap music continues to gain exposure and popularity, hip-hop culture has increasingly become a topic in the social sciences and humanities. Most studies of hip-hop culture have predominately focused on the mass-market trend toward worldwide commercialization of rap rather than fully examining how underground units continue to inform and innovate the mass trend. Inadequate attention is currently paid to the political development of rap as an underground narrative from a single location. Using primary sources from Oakland, this project explores rap's development from its origins in the "war" between the Black Panther Party (BPP) and COINTELPRO efforts. I argue two points. First, the messages in Oakland rap were shaped and influenced by the militant, radical, and political nature of the BPP in a way that mainstream rap music was not. Second, the styles of Oakland rap blended into a robust local brand before the scene gained a modicum of popular attention--while the New York/Los Angeles paradigm was in the spotlight. This raises significant questions about the agenda setting role of local rap artists--namely, their ability to create messages and styles of music that are resistant to co-optation even while achieving popularization and commercialization. As such, this study offers new insights into urban politics and addresses fundamental questions of power and equality in a liberal democracy.

A Monte Carlo-based framework enhances the discovery and interpretation of regulatory sequence motifs
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Discovery of functionally significant short, statistically overrepresented subsequence patterns (motifs) in a set of sequences is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Oftentimes, not all sequences in the set contain a motif. These non-motif-containing sequences complicate the algorithmic discovery of motifs. Filtering the non-motif-containing sequences from the larger set of sequences while simultaneously determining the identity of the motif is, therefore, desirable and a non-trivial problem in motif discovery research.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We describe MotifCatcher, a framework that extends the sensitivity of existing motif-finding tools by employing random sampling to effectively remove non-motif-containing sequences from the motif search. We developed two implementations of our algorithm; each built around a commonly used motif-finding tool, and applied our algorithm to three diverse chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data sets. In each case, the motif finder with the MotifCatcher extension demonstrated improved sensitivity over the motif finder alone. Our approach organizes candidate functionally significant discovered motifs into a tree, which allowed us to make additional insights. In all cases, we were able to support our findings with experimental work from the literature.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our framework demonstrates that additional processing at the sequence entry level can significantly improve the performance of existing motif-finding tools. For each biological data set tested, we were able to propose novel biological hypotheses supported by experimental work from the literature. Specifically, in Escherichia coli, we suggested binding site motifs for 6 non-traditional LexA protein binding sites; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we hypothesize 2 disparate mechanisms for novel binding sites of the Cse4p protein; and in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we discoverd subtle differences in a general transcription factor (GTF) binding site motif across several data sets. We suggest that small differences in our discovered motif could confer specificity for one or more homologous GTF proteins. We offer a free implementation of the MotifCatcher software package at

Romancing race and gender : intermarriage and the making of a 'modern subjectivity' in colonial Korea, 1910-1945
This dissertation investigates the discourse and representation of interracial marriage and transnational romance through an examination of popular texts and colonial policies during the Japanese colonial era in Korea (1910-1945). For the colonial ruler, the unusual promotion of interracial marriages between the colonizer and colonized (Japanese and Koreans), which was a part of an assimilation policy, could act as a means to demonstrate the benevolence of the Japanese Empire and encourage Koreans to advance into full imperial citizens. For the colonized people, it might have started as a subjugating colonial project, but then it presented the possibility of becoming much-desired modern subjects, thus it changed construction of "modern subjectivity" and further complicating understandings of race, gender, and sexuality in everyday life. This dissertation traces how an assimilative colonial state program - the promotion of intermarriage between Koreans and Japanese - turned into diverse discourses that impacted public discourses and literary representations of racial and gender norms. The dissertation is organized into four chapters. The first sketches the historical context of interracial marriage between Koreans and Japanese. The remaining chapters focus on analyzing popular texts and contextualizing them within particular issues surrounding intermarriage and romance, such as the construction of domesticity in intermarriage texts (Chapter Two), the representation of international marriage and modern home in popular print culture (Chapter Three), and race and gender in encountering others at the end of the colonial era (Chapter Four). In conclusion, this dissertation aims to unveil the influence of colonial intimacy and articulations of race and gender discourses in the making of a "modern subjectivity" in Korea in the time of Japanese empire-building. It contributes to the growing discussion of modern colonialism and imperialism by examining the everyday life of colonized territories and how colonized people understood, articulated, and manipulated colonial discourse

Connectivity of West Coast Marine Sanctuaries: Tracking Sooty Shearwaters Throughout Dynamic Upwelling Ecosystems in the California Current System
We propose that as a super-abundant, top-level-predator, Sooty Shearwaters are an ideal California Current Ecosystem (CCE) bioindicator species. Sooty Shearwaters dominate the CCE avifauna during the spring-summer 'upwelling season' and depend on massive amounts of energy-dense forage fishes (anchovy, sardine, krill). We hypothesize that Sooty Shearwater distribution (and abundance), and residency patterns, are related to upwelling dynamics (i.e., offshore transport, upwelling retention, wind-stress curl) that structure and control bottom-up productivity and energy transfer through the CCE foodweb.

Creating Revolutionary Cuba’s National Hero: The Cultural Capital of the Cimarrón
Through an examination of Cuban sociologist Miguel Barnet’s Biografía de un cimarrón, a ethnographic oral history of the life of an ex-slave, this essay consider the manners in which radical anti-slavery have been remembered and appropriated into national narratives, with attention to who has taken the responsibility of textualizing these memories, and who these memories are purported to represent.  Barnet’s Biografía narrates the life of Esteban Montejo (circa 1860-1973), a man born into Cuban slavery at the end of the nineteenth century, and provides the reader with a transcription of Montejo’s spoken testimony of his experiences as a slave, as a fugitive, as a paid mill-worker, and as a revolutionary independence fighter which was published during his lifetime as a testament to the trajectory of Cuban national identity.  To rescue his story and make it known nationally and internationally represents the hegemonic cultural authorities desire to create a more representative national imaginary through the inclusion of radical black figures.

'Ambisextrous:' The Universal Appeal of Julian Eltinge
According to a newspaper of the time, there 'has probably never been an impersonator of feminine characters in this country who has created such a sensation' as Julian Eltinge.1  This is a consensus borne out by the modern scholarship, as is the assertion that he was not 'like the ordinary female impersonator.'2  He was critically and financially unparalleled.  Whilst Eltinge enjoyed undeniable success with his female audience, largely due to the rise of the emancipated, sexualized 'New Woman,' this paper will focus on some of the reasons for Eltinge's considerable success with a male audience.

Old Silver Readings: Mythology, Portraits, and Booker T. Washington
Normative historical narratives of Booker T. Washington continually underestimate the genius of this politically savvy educator.  Despite the recent groundswell of interest in photography in the history of education, only a handful of scholars have excavated BTW’s meticulously produced portraits in light of his impact on North American civil rights.  Washington’s images did not simply accentuate his message, they possessed an indelible mythological argument in themselves, reifying a time and place not yet achieved in full by his African-American community.  While his Tuskegee Institute mostly accommodated the temperaments of White America, his photographs dissolved the very boundaries between black and white.

Aeriality : music for orchestra
As a composer, my primary objective is to write music over words. I prefer to express myself in sounds rather than prose, which is why the piece Aeriality, written for a large orchestra in 2010/2011, constitutes the primary content of this dissertation. As the focus is on the music itself, via the music score, the amount of written text is minimal. The introduction to the dissertation is an introduction to Aeriality, describing the inspiration for the piece and the conceptual approach to the music. The main section of the dissertation presents the music score. (Since the work is written for a large orchestra, the music notation had to be reduced considerably in size to fit the format of the dissertation.) The music is written for a large orchestra of 41 individual parts that are at times divided even further within instrumental sections. The music features layers of sound structures and moments of lyrical emphasis. Quartertones are used as a device to construct walls of sounds beyond the chromatic scale in order to achieve a massive sound structure. The final section of the dissertation presents the program notes that are written to accompany the work for performance. Aeriality is the seventh piece I write i.e. have written for orchestra, and it distinctly reveals my passion to search for sound-worlds that are produced by a large instrumental force. It presents layers of internally related materials, often within a chromatic and quartertone setting that is constructed around a harmonic progression that the music flows through from beginning to end. This progression is presented both in the form of collective orchestral efforts going through the same materials as well as in layered entities of smaller instrumental alliances to create a conjuration of a musical atmosphere that does not dwell within a single melodic sphere but rather travels between the various sonic fields that are inspired by the visual indication that the title suggests

WPP, No.111: A preliminary model of Singaporean English intonational phonology
Recent research has sought to identify the systematic features that make Singa-porean English (SgE) distinct from other varieties of English. Although the intonation of SgE has been described previously (Deterding 1994; Lim 2004; Ng 2011), no phono-logical model has yet been proposed. This paper proposes a model of SgE intonational phonology within the Autosegmental-Metrical phonology framework (eg. Pierrehum-bert 1980). Three native speakers were recorded reading declarative and question sentences of varying length and stress pattern. Preliminary results suggest that SgE has three prosodic units above the word: the Accentual Phrase (AP), Intermediate Phrase (ip) and Intonational Phrase (IP). An AP is slightly larger than a word and is characterized by a general LH (rising) contour. The L can be attributable to either an L* tone on a lexically-stressed syllable or an L initial boundary tone if the stressed syllable occurs late in the AP. The AP-_nal syllable always has a phonologically high boundary tone (Ha). Intermediate phrases are marked by L- and H- tones and IPs are marked by L% and H% tones. Finally, preliminary data suggests that SgE speakers use an expanded pitch range and occasionally lengthening to mark contrastive focus.

Power, politics, and prints : redefining art practice in Oaxaca City
This thesis considers the interplay of various social and historical factors that shape the practice of art in Oaxaca City, Oaxaca, in southern Mexico. It looks at printmaking as a discipline particularly suited to challenging colonial and aesthetic hierarchies that have traditionally structured art markets, art practice, and art education in Oaxaca City. In Mexico, art and cultural production have maintained a more direct relationship with state power than in other countries, and this thesis outlines various artistic authenticities that, while no means exhaustive, have been important in establishing a certain aesthetic of Mexican printmaking since the Mexican Revolution. These include the legacies of José Guadalupe Posada, muralism, the Taller de Gráfica Popular, La Ruptura, and the student movement of 1968, as well as particularly Oaxacan authenticities established by the Oaxacan Style and the street art produced in response to the teacher's strike of 2006-2007. As the idea of the nation-state is disintegrating with the rise of a global capitalism and increased ease and speed of communication, it is important to consider the changing relationships between the state and cultural production in Mexico, and especially in Oaxaca. In Oaxaca, many people depend on a successful tourist industry, which is inherently linked to state policies and state money. Political and social upheaval in Oaxaca have reshaped the relationship Oaxacans have with their government, and have created new spaces for art that allow young printmakers to challenge traditional artistic Mexican and Oaxacan hierarchies

Daniel H. McFadden: The Chancellor Mark Christensen Era at UC Santa Cruz, 1974-1976
UC Santa Cruz’s second chancellor, Mark N. Christensen, served the campus from July 1974 to January 1976. Christensen arrived at UCSC during a tumultuous point in the campus’s history. Founding Chancellor Dean McHenry had brought to fruition his singular vision for UC Santa Cruz as an innovative institution of higher education which emphasized undergraduate teaching centered in residential colleges, each with a specific intellectual theme and architectural design. McHenry oversaw the planning and building of UCSC from 1961 until his retirement in June 1974. In the early years, UCSC drew high caliber students and earned a reputation as a prestigious and unique university. But by the mid-1970s, enrollments were falling. Internally, the campus was fracturing along fault lines between the colleges and the boards of studies (now called departments), as UCSC experienced the political and economic pressures of trying to establish a decentralized, innovative campus within the traditional University of California.
      Christensen’s tenure as chancellor rather tragically ended in controversy after only eighteen months. Although most of the faculty liked Christensen as a person, they lost confidence in his ability to govern the campus. The Regional History Project never conducted an oral history with Mark Christensen, and he passed away in 2003. But in 1980, former director Randall Jarrell interviewed Christensen’s special assistant, Daniel McFadden, about the Christensen era. McFadden’s oral history is a perceptive and balanced reflection on the political climate of UCSC in 1976, just as what McFadden characterizes as a “Bicentennial Rebellion” was taking place.
      The Regional History Project published this transcript in 2012, nearly forty years after the interview was recorded (on May 20, 1976), because McFadden was only able to turn his attention to editing and approving the transcript after his retirement. Dan McFadden holds a BA and MA in intellectual history and a Ph.D. in public policy from the University of Pittsburgh. Before coming to UCSC, McFadden served as assistant chancellor for public affairs at the University of Pittsburgh. After leaving UCSC, McFadden held a variety of administrative positions, including deputy city manager for the city of San Jose, California.

Deaf people, modernity, and a contentious effort to unify Arab sign languages
This dissertation examines a project to unify sign languages across twenty-two Arab countries. Proponents of the project, mainly pan-Arab governmental bodies with the support of members of the staff at the Al Jazeera satellite network, have framed the project as a human rights effort to advance the welfare of deaf Arab people. They have urged its institutionalization in schools for deaf children and have promoted it as the official language of deaf Arab people. The project is controversial and has a number of shortcomings. First, from a lexicostatistical analysis of five natural sign languages found in the region: Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, and Palestine, the author finds that they are unlikely to be descendants of a common ancestor. As such, attempting to unify them would be unsound by scholarly linguistics standards. Second, there are cultural, political, and social objections to the project that have been raised by deaf Arab people who are resistant to the unification effort. They say they cannot understand the unified sign language nor can they find a purpose or utility in the language, which they believe threatens to diminish and eventually obliterate their natural sign languages. This dissertation reviews arguments held by those supporting and opposing the project. Both sides claim a vision of modernity in which progress is perceived as a continuation of a past that is consistent with their present practices and beliefs. For proponents supporting the unification project, progress is tied to pan-Arab nationalism and the unifying Arabic language. Those opposing the project define progress as gaining more autonomy through official recognition of their natural sign languages and by transforming disparaging concepts of deafness. The unified sign language project may fail in achieving its goal of wide acceptance by deaf Arab people throughout the Arab region. Its potential demise can be attributed to its architects' lack of understanding of the deep complexity of human languages, including sign languages, as well as a lack of appreciation for informal, local practices and knowledge that are required for the project's success

Notation as a compositional tool : three exemplary pieces
The relationship between imagination and image has significant influences on a composer's engagement with musical creation. There is more to this than simply recognizing notation as an outlet for creative energy: it is also a process that is not without certain resistances, simultaneously freeing and limiting one's imaginative capacities. On the one hand, musical expression and meaning might be compromised by the visual concreteness that is necessarily a part of notational processes; on the other hand, notational images might carry the potential for previously unimaginable musical possibilities. Throughout the history of Western music, composers have dealt with the creative potentialities of notation--that is, the complex relationship between sound and image--in a variety of ways, balancing the freedoms and limitations of imagining and drawing to different degrees. My own compositional endeavors have tended toward fairly dynamic relationships between visual- and sonorous-based streams of decision-making, generally shaped into an overall process that begins with two entirely independent sets of ideas--one visual and one sonorous--and then works toward a dialectical resolution of this fundamental abstraction, always with the manual labor of notation forming an essential component of the decision-making process. This dissertation consists of three examples of such process: three individual works for varying instrumental forces that all began with the same visual impetus--a pencil drawing that functions as an abstract notation. The processes of decisionmaking that branch out from this starting point lead to three independent sonorous works, exploring issues of translation while simultaneously opening up a vast potential for depth of compositional engagement and richness of final product. The uniqueness of each work is evidence of the creative power of notational labor as both instigator of musical imagination and solidifier of musical structure and material

Space, Place, and Music in New Orleans
This dissertation explores ways in which many people in New Orleans use, experience, form emotional attachments to, and make sense of space through music. It analyzes how music intersects with geography and how the musical experiences of New Orleanians bring meaning to the built form. It examines the role of the agent in the social construction of space, and how people use music as a spatial enabler in New Orleans. It proposes that music enables people to socially construct space because it accesses the nexus of memory and emotion, operates in a greater cultural context, and is a useful tool for variable expression. In order to present varied experiences with the musical construction of space, this dissertation approaches its subject through four case studies: place attachment through the "second line" parading tradition and North Claiborne Avenue, the fixing of memories in space at the Ernie K-Doe Mother-in-Law Lounge, the negotiation of public space through musical performances in various contexts, and the creation and growth of a music community in the New Orleans Habitat Musicians' Village. In so doing, it illustrates that New Orleans, as a musical city, is greater than a soundscape or a cultural identity--it is the sum of myriad musical experiences that individuals in New Orleans have had as they interact with the space around them.

Transmission and Performance:  Memory, Heritage, and Authenticity in Korean Mask Dance Dramas
In this dissertation I explore the effects of the Republic of Korea's Cultural Property Protection Law (1962). Faced with decreased interest in traditional arts, many governments have instituted well-intentioned but unavoidably bureaucratic protection efforts; these policies can potentially turn once-vibrant and ever-evolving art forms into stale, taxidermized re-enactments. Although the Cultural Property Protection Law has been widely praised and even imitated, ethnographic research into arts transmission reveals complications. I conducted the research that informs this eleven-chapter dissertation between 2004 and 2011 including over three years of intense participant-observation. Methods included learning and performing half a dozen Korean arts, structured and open interviews and an examination of relevant documents. The dissertation utilizes the lenses of heritage, authenticity and memory to examine transmission of the Korean performing arts. In the dissertation I develop an understanding of transmission in the pedagogical and performance context for three Korean mask dance dramas: Songpa Sandae Noli, Bongsan Talchum and Goseong Ogwangdae. This understanding builds a comprehensive portrait of how heritage legislation impacts the transmission of performing arts knowledge. Through this dissertation I contribute to discussions of intangible heritage on three fronts: first, the impact of global and transnational cultural flows in Korea and on traditional culture; second, the ossification of traditional arts after preservation programs are established; and third, the way memory, heritage and authenticity are constructed, maintained and negotiated through the arts.

[body, modernist, form, artist, corporeality]

The Art of the Modernist Body
The Art of the Modernist Body explores the fraught relationship between corporeality and the genesis of new language in modernist literature.  The dissertation argues that the history of disability in the early twentieth century facilitates a revised account of Anglo-American modernism; specifically, the modernists' formal preoccupation with loss, deficiency, and absence, long regarded as a vital aspect of the movement, can be re-imagined productively through the heuristic of disability theory.  The project likewise reveals that many of modernism's signature novelties, including free verse, Imagism, and the embrace of ordinary speech, are influenced by artists' attempts to represent physical deviance.  Each text in question is generated out of repeated encounters with extraordinary figures or forms, and the artists openly challenge the conceptual, social, and political parameters that delimit the ideal human body.  Their literature also reminds us that the modernist period is a remarkably inchoate time in terms of how the body is imagined.  Two World Wars, the rise of the machine age, and advances in prosthetic and rehabilitative medicine are just a few of the phenomena that brought the human form to the forefront of British and American culture, with politicians, cultural critics, industrial scions, workers, artists, and soldiers all tussling over the social and economic value of imperfect bodies.  Accordingly, many accounts from the period resist any entrenched, discrete notions of normality and abnormality, and acts of corporeal discipline, normalization, and rehabilitation are neither roundly condemned nor applauded.  The confluence of multiple visions of corporeality not only alters the cultural landscape, but it also affects the very language through which the experience of physical difference is articulated.  The novelists and poets herein record both processes, namely by producing what might be called a "contingency of corporeality:" they define the superlative modernist body as a hybrid entity, a form that registers the dueling forces of normalization and destabilization.

Capitalism and the production of realtime : improvised music in post-unification Berlin
After the fall of the Berlin wall in '89, and the subsequent implosion of the East German economy, the Berlin improvised music community flourished with venues springing up almost overnight in the East's abandoned industrial and residential areas. Artists from around the world, inspired by West Berlin's reputation as a counter- culture Mecca, moved in, taking advantage of cheap living costs and a depressed rental market. Berlin supported much of the (often illegal) activity as the artists generated cultural capital, refurbished derelict buildings, and gentrified neighborhoods. Twenty years later, Berlin has transformed into a 'global city,' while improvised music continues to flourish. What role are improvisers, and the broader subcultural arts scene, playing in this economic and political production? In this thesis I consider the possibility that improvised music functions in important ways as a formalist 'avant-garde' for the dominating and hegemonic forces of global capitalism and representative democracy. In this sense, Berlin provides a unique and liminal cultural field in which to study and shed light upon 'state-of-the-art' social, political and economic processes. Improvised music, referred to in Berlin as 'realtime music' (Echtzeitmusik), is structurally aligned with a contemporary organization of society in which commodity value lies in process instead of fixed objects, authenticity resides in the realtime spectacle of becoming and change, and power is a direct measure of speed and maneuverability

Linguistic Encounters Now and Then: Amara Lakhous and Tahar Lamri Engage in the Debate on (Dis)United Italy
This essay investigates the use of Italian dialects in two novels written by contemporary Italophone writers, Scontro di civiltà per un ascensore a piazza Vittorio by Amara Lakhous and I sessanta nomi dell'amore written by Tahar Lamri, both published in 2006. These two texts can be positioned, in the first place, within the ongoing cultural debate on old and new multiculturalisms in today's Italy.  Secondly, they are clearly influenced by the discussion on the renewed questione della lingua, so central in the history of (dis)united Italy.
             
         
       
      The essay seeks to illustrate the different approaches to the use of dialects adopted by these Algerian-born writers and the outcomes achieved.  The main focus here is to establish the extent to which literary, cultural and political potential of dialectal use is unlocked in order to challenge the dominant, canonical culture. 
      The essay will also highlight the different ways in which the two authors attempt to question the ideas of Italianness and monolithic national culture in the context of rapidly changing cultural dynamics of contemporary Italy.

The Role of Japan in Modern Chinese Art
“This ambitious, very important project defines no less than a new field of inquiry, one that scarcely could have been attempted in the past. The essays in this volume add enormously to the documentation of what late-period Chinese art learned from Japan, and begin to formulate conclusions that will enrich future accounts of both Japanese and Chinese art.” James Cahill, University of California, Berkeley
      The modern histories of China and Japan are inexorably intertwined. Their relationship is perhaps most obvious in the fields of political, economic, and military history, but it is no less true in cultural and art history. Yet the traffic in artistic practices and practitioners between China and Japan remains an understudied field. In this volume, an international group of scholars investigates Japan’s impact on Chinese art from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1930s. Individual essays address a range of perspectives, including the work of individual Chinese and Japanese painters, calligraphers, and sculptors, as well as artistic associations, international exhibitions, the collotype production or artwork, and the emergence of a modern canon.
      Joshua A. Fogel is Canada Research Chair and a professor of history at York University, Toronto, and a specialist in the history of cultural and political ties between China and Japan in the modern era.

The Erotic Conceit: History, Sexuality and the Urdu ghazal
This dissertation pursues the literary-historical tracks of the image repertoire of "boy-love" (<italic>amradparasti</italic>) versified for over two centuries in the Urdu ghazal. It critically engages with key positions in sexuality studies and ghazal criticism that have reduced this theme to visible sexuality, submerging its historical narrative elements.  It is a part of my argument to show why the ghazal (as genre and predominant form of poetry) matters to the study of modern South Asian identities (sexual and political) and what historical forces have operated through its aesthetic lineaments to give it the illusion of traditional cultural continuity.	The dissertation is divided into two parts presenting the concentric circles of a historical problematic including poetry, sexual representation, the colonial archive and historiography. In Chapter One, I broadly describe colonial reformism in which sexuality emerged as a category of social and intimate experience. My aim is to show that modern sexual identities (e.g. homosexual) belong to a nationalist problematic whose assumptions are still with us in our postcolonial, `sexually liberated' era. Chapter Two narrows the genealogical focus on "boy-love" as a distinct historical-narrative element in the ghazal as well as in literary-historical recountings of its tradition. This chapter mirrors the larger argument as it places reformist (Hali), postcolonial (Firaq) and premodern (Yaqin) meditations on the image of the beautiful boy in the same argument.In Part Two, I cross the threshold of the premodern into the South-Asian eighteenth century but not before delineating, in Chapter Three, the historiographic roadblocks in transitioning from categories of modern analysis (the state, family, subjectivity, identity) into the pre-existing social unities of premodern life. I make a critique of revisionist historiography to argue against a naively mimetic and sentimental understanding of literary objects from the past and posit the condensation of an erotic terrain in the rhetorical and vignette-like patterns of `classical' ghazal poetry. To highlight the operation of this terrain I study the formation of the boy-love image repertoire as part of the vernacularizing process from which elements of later "Urdu" first emerged. The exemplary figures here include the satiric-obscene verse of Jafar Zatalli and the <italic>iham</italic> set of poets (Abru and Naji in particular)	Finally, Chapter Four presents the case of Muhammad Taqi Mir and through the canonized stability of his oeuvre I draw the outer form of its erotic content as a social value form in whose negative relation with social conditions, a historical expanse becomes possible to imagine. In the final turn to Mir, I demonstrate that it is possible to read historical forms of subjectivity in the heavily routinized idiom of the ghazal, and not settle for a depoliticized history of surfaces (images, representations, typologies) which has been the fate of the ghazal and several other expressive practices in the postcolonial world.

Sisters and Soldiers
In September 1894, an agent of the French Intelligence Bureau discovered alist of French military secrets in a wastebasket at the German Embassy in Paris.This document was quickly misattributed to a Jewish officer, Alfred Dreyfus,who was convicted in a hasty court martial and sentenced to deportation inperpetuity. Over the next four years, his sentence was challenged by allies,called “dreyfusards,” who found in the effort to reopen the case a quasi-mysticalquest in defense of truth, justice, and liberal republican ideals. They were counteredby others, the “antidreyfusards,” who saw truth as less important thanthe well-being of the nation or who believed that, being Jewish, Dreyfus wasnecessarily a traitor. In French history, memory, and culture, the Dreyfus Affairis a red-letter event – the cradle of the contemporary Left and Right and thebirthplace of the public intellectual. It is a daunting subject for a researcher, notonly because of the enormous body of literature around it but because its verysignificance has given it a degree of impenetrability. There is a certain difficultyin breaking through to the event itself, in asking different questions when faced with such familiar faces and texts.

Spanish Colonial Liturgical Music in the Philippines: Inventing a Tradition
Spanish colonial music, both sacred and secular, enjoyed a long and widespread performance tradition in the Philippines from 1565 to 1898, but this has largely been forgotten or obscured in scholarship of the last hundred years.  Musical practices that survive from the colonial period with an intact performance tradition are often reworked, or invented, to serve modern institutional and nationalist purposes, and often function as indicators of Philippine nationality both in the Philippines and abroad.  This state of affairs is the result of both American and Post-independence era historiographies that sought to minimize or erase the perceived Spanish cultural influence on the country.  Spanish liturgical music has not been a part of these invented cultural traditions, but recent interest in the form is driving scholarship that may serve as an impetus toward such an invention.  Liturgical music is an interesting case among other arts that demonstrate a high level of syncretism with the various additional cultural influences surrounding the Spanish colony: Mexican, Chinese, and Islamic as well as Spanish.  The extent to which it exhibits Philippine-ness will go a long way toward determining its existence as a practice among the nationally accepted and exported cultural practices.

Shifting Hecke Eigensystems in Positive Characteristic
We study congruences modulo p between modular forms arising from different contexts. In the first part of the dissertation we use geometric methods to show that the (mod p) PEL Hecke eigensystems associated to a reductive group G coincide with the (mod p) algebraic Hecke eigensystems associated to an inner form of G. In the second part of the dissertation we use cohomological methods to construct weight shiftings for (mod p) automorphic forms associated to a definite quaternion algebra over a totally real field in which p is unramified. In particular, we construct cohomological avatars of the partial Hasse invariants.

Sleights of Hand: Black Skin and Curzio Malaparte's La pelle
This article reconsiders Curzio Malaparte’s polemical novel La pelle 1949, which either has been condemned as a false historical account of post-Liberation Naples or defended as true “art.” Focusing on La pelle’s representations of translation between the Allies and the Italians, I draw on contemporary translation theory to analyze how the text constructs these claims of “fidelity,” and to ask why they require the bodies of marginalized figures (the soldato negro, the Moroccan goumier and the “virgin”). While La pelle “erases” these bodies, converting them into metaphors for art and war, my reading insists on their metaphorical and literal significance.

Cold War love : producing American liberalism in interracial marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women
This project analyzes how "Japanese war brides" who married American GIs as a result of the U.S. occupation of Japan became visible in the political context whereby the United States and Japan established an allied relationship. The marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women became controversial subjects in both the United States and Japan because they crossed the constructed racial line as miscegenation. They also became an ideological symbol of war politics between the victor and the defeated. This postwar period was the first time that American soldiers and Japanese women became so intimate that their marriages became the subject of much discussion and concern in the U.S.-Japan history. This dissertation examines how such controversial marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women became subjects that invigorated American Imperialism at the beginning of Cold War. First, I analyze how the intimacy between American soldiers and Japanese women became visible within the shift of the political relationship between the United States and Japan as they moved from wartime enemy to postwar allies; as well as analyzing representations of intimacy between American soldiers and Japanese women in the early 50's. I situate configuration of American soldier husbands within the U.S. occupation of Japan as liberation and rehabilitation whereby the marriages were understood as loving projects that liberated Japanese "enslaved" wives. Second, this dissertation captures the shifting moments when the United States realized its cultural pluralism whereby it asserted its capability of accommodating people regardless of race and confirmed its democratic principle. I analyze how mixed racial families consisting of American soldier husbands, Japanese wives, and their "mixed blood" children that were impossible subjects of miscegenation became possible subjects as a model family who self-evidently invigorate American cultural pluralism during the Cold War

John C. Daly: A Life of Public Service in a Changing Santa Cruz, 1953-2013
John C. Daly is a sixty-one year citizen of Santa Cruz, and as a doctor, a family man and a former mayor he has had a central vantage point on the process of evolution and change Santa Cruz has gone through. This oral history hinges on his perspective on and involvement in the development of Santa Cruz from the small, tight-knit city he moved to in ’53 to the college town it is today, where there is a city population of ca. sixty thousand and a student population that exceeds seventeen thousand. However, the scope of the sessions  go beyond his public involvement in Santa Cruz to give a broader context of his life, including his childhood, his family, and his service in World War II.
      Early in his career he took an opportunity to buy an existing practice in Santa Cruz, a quiet town centered on summer beach tourism. It essentially shut down for the rest of the year, leaving rents low and the businesses small. Variety came with its popularity as a convention locale, and the Miss California Pageant at the start of the summer. Daly relates the slow progress his business had in this context, which gave him time to get involved with public service organizations like the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the Salvation Army. A few years later, at the urging of local businessmen, he ran for the city council. A newspaper advertisement for his campaign advertised his priorities as establishing a “wider tax base,” supporting “residents with fixed incomes,” working on “governmental agency cooperation,” an “improved storm drain system,” and “municipal wharf modernization.” He was elected and served one term as a councilman from ’59 to ’63, including a stint as mayor from ’61-’62.
                 During those four years Daly helped support and initiate a series of key growth projects. In the late fifties and early sixties, Santa Cruz acquired the Sky Park Airport, constructed the yacht harbor, built the Loch Lomond Reservoir, oversaw downtown redevelopment, worked with a developer on a major international complex, and competed with San Jose for a University of California campus. The goal of all of this, Daly relates, was to make Santa Cruz into a “very desirable upper-middle class community with a great university,” characterized by a thriving business and convention culture. The international complex, for instance, was designed by the lead disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright and featured a glass pyramid hotel, a series of ‘courts’ showcasing the goods and products of foreign countries, and a concert hall that would show primarily non-domestic acts, speakers and films. The plans were put on display at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. The developer estimated it would grow to have two million visitors a year. Just up the hill, the proposed UC campus was to grow to twenty seven thousand, five hundred students by 1990. Daly thought it was perfect. The town was busy in the summer, when many students were away, and then during the off-seasons there would be a robust student presence to fill the town and fuel business.
      While the Court never came into being due to funding issues, during John’s tenure as mayor the UC Regents unexpectedly settled on Santa Cruz as the site for their new campus. It was the culmination of protracted outreach efforts by the city, spearheaded by public officials like Daly. He was thrilled, expecting a wave of well-funded young people in sun tan pants and plaid skirts and bobby socks, like he and his fellow students dressed during his time at Berkeley. However, in the long run the university proved to not conform to these expectations. In these interviews he relates how the students increasingly became politically radicalized in the late sixties and seventies, and began to dress more casually and messily. To compound this trend, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment lowered the voting age to eighteen in ’71, and Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that made it easier for students to register to vote in their adopted college communities.
      The political landscape of the town gradually shifted under these factors. The professional, business culture dominant in the city in the fifties and early sixties was challenged by what Daly terms “no-growthers:” people who were (and are) consistently opposed to development on personal, environmental and political grounds. During Daly’s time on the council issues like building the Loch Lomond Reservoir were matter of course, and did not face significant opposition. During the seventies, however an attempt to build another dam, the Zayante Dam, was killed. A second effort to build a convention center at Lighthouse Point, where the Court of the Seven Seas was to have stood, was defeated by popular vote and a major public campaign. Since the sixties and seventies there have been almost no new hotels, and convention business has become marginal. In the eighties the Miss California Pageant relocated after years of protest, and the city council has become the site of increased political conflict. Today Daly feels that the town has been held back in significant and damaging ways by this shift towards a “no-growth” attitude.
      On personal and professional notes, Daly reflects at length about other challenges he and the city have faced, including the Flood of ’55 and the Quake of ’89. He discusses the damage, and how the town recovered from those two disasters. More intimately, he reflects on how Santa Cruz has been as a place to raise a family, and for his practice. He discusses the pros and cons of having the UC, including the prestige it has brought the town, and closes with a retrospective and prospective on his own life. He talks about what has been meaningful to him, and returns to dwell on the transformative power education has had for him and his family.

Building a Grand Paris: French Neoliberalism and the Politics of Urban Spatial Production
This dissertation is an in-depth analysis of the Grand Paris regional agglomeration and redevelopment initiative launched in 2007 by French President, Nicolas Sarkozy. At the base of this multifaceted project is a political and economic mandate to address unrest caused by racialized segregations and vast inequalities in wealth and social service provision between the historic core and the peripheral suburbs, and to recast metropolitan Paris as a socially cohesive and globally competitive region. Through an examination of three important Grand Paris policy sites--artistic re-imaginings of the region, improved transportation infrastructure and government rescaling--the dissertation argues that the attempt to create a unified and poly-centric Greater Paris region is, paradoxically, poised to further entrench existing social and spatial inequalities by orienting the city around the values of economic growth and territorial competition. It argues that the emerging urbanization regime of Paris has serious detrimental consequences for sociospatial justice and for possibilities of grassroots control over spatial production. Furthermore, the dissertation identifies a new mode of neoliberalism in France that combines the republican values of social cohesion and vast public spending, particularly in infrastructures of mass transit, with speculative development, global finance and private enterprise.

Epode 5 as a Response to Eclogue 4: The Anti-Augustan in Horace
This paper offers a new reading of Horace’s Fifth Epode as a response to Vergil’s Fourth Eclogue. Vergil’s poem heralds a savior-child that will restore the Roman state, while Horace’s poem narrates the tale of a child captured and killed by witches. I argue that by pairing these two poems the reader uncovers a latent Horatian commentary on civil war and Roman leadership from the seemingly innocuous witch fable of Epode 5. 
      To my knowledge, a sound linking of these two contemporary poems has never been published. I draw a concrete link between Eclogue 4 and Epode 5 first through textual and then thematic comparison.  Vergil says that his messiah will destroy poisonous plants and snakes (24-25) and these are the very two things that Horace’s child cannot overcome in the witch tale. Thematically, Eclogue 4 is centered in the ideas of birth and growth, the amicable integration of Eastern and Western cultures, and the natural peacefulness of the countryside. Epode 5 is concerned with the exact opposite themes: death and devolution, clashing of Roman and foreign cultures, and the murderous and unnatural filth of the city. I argue that these oppositions are intentional and highlight the tension between Vergil’s hope for a savior-child that will rebuild Rome and Horace’s pessimism that this abducted child will perish and take the city down with him. I then argue that contextual clues identify the savior-child as Octavian. 
      Although Horace is known for his patriotic poetry, the uncovering of this biting political commentary in superficially non-political Epode 5 begs reconsideration of other seemingly non-political Horatian poetry. Perhaps the poet safely conceals his honest opinions in these poems lest he compromise his political allegiances.

'Show Me How it Feels to Work Here': Using Photography to Research Organizational Aesthetics
<p>In this paper I discuss the potential role and utility of photographs in exploring the aesthetic dimension of processes of organizing. Beginning with a review of the growing significance within organization and management studies literature of the so-called ‘non-rational’ elements of human-being at work, I question why these issues appear to have become subjects worthy of specific scholarly attention at the turn of the century (Williams 2001). Within this discussion, I recognise the embodied nature of organization and make links between some of the characteristics of contemporary (Western) consumer culture, and aesthetics – with particular emphasis on the context of work and organizations. Following from this, I move to consider how it might be possible to gather data about these phenomena in an organizational setting. The limitations of language as a medium of articulating aesthetic experience due to the sensory nature of these phenomena are examined as a condition which undermines the efficacy of traditional text-based research methods and I argue that these issues necessitate the employment of a more ‘sensually complete’ methodology – introducing the idea of photography as one step towards this end. In order to discuss the epistemological and methodological implications of this approach, I reflect on my experiences during an ethnographic study of the web-site design department of a global IT firm to suggest that photographs taken by the respondents of their work environment helped them to express the largely ineffable aesthetic experiences that resulted from the relationships they had with their physical surroundings. The photographs were used by the respondents in this research as a means of communicating their aesthetic experience during semi-structured interviews where the images served both as an ‘aesthetic lens’ through which to explore my research questions and as foci for discussion and reflection about those questions. Some of these photographs are displayed in this paper, juxtaposed with my narrative accounts to create what Mitchell (1994) has called an image-text. This rests on the assumption that written texts and images have relative merits as modes of dissemination in their own right, with neither taking precedence over the other in terms of authority, or claim to ‘truth’. As part of this discussion I problematize some assumptions about the capacity of images to serve as realist representations, arguing instead that photographic images are partial, selected and subjective interpretations of one reality wholly dependent on the photographers ‘visual culture’ (Pink 2001). In concluding, I briefly mention some of the practical and ethical issues surrounding the use of a camera and the taking of photographs in the research arena.</p>

Trio Webster: Toshi Ichiyanagi’s Fusion of Western and Eastern Music
This document contains a synopsis of Toshi Ichiyanagi’s compositional style, a discussion of his musical philosophy, and an analysis of Trio Webster. Ichiyanagi is a renowned Japanese composer who studied in New York under John Cage’s mentorship. He is also the first composer to introduce Cage’s concept of chance operation to Japanese society. Trio Webster realizes the true exchange of Western and Eastern cultures, and it is accomplished because of Ichiyanagi’s unique
experience and philosophy as an international composer. The concept of Japanese classical music and Japanese aesthetics are observed in Trio Webster which is the basis for the depth of the work. Eastern concepts, especially Japanese, can be ambiguous and may be difficult for Westerners to fully appreciate. This study shows the cosmos beyond the practical analysis of Trio Webster and is meant to serve as a guide for those who will perform the works of Ichiyanagi, especially Trio Webster, in the future. This study was facilitated through research and interviews with Ichiyanagi and members of the Webster Trio. Ichiyanagi’s interview is included as an appendix to this document.

Experiencing Maya Palaces: Royal Power, Space, and Architecture at Holmul, Guatemala
This dissertation investigates Classic period (AD 250-900) Maya palaces as experiences.  As unique built environments, these palaces were created to engender and facilitate specific experiences for those who interacted in and around their bounds.  These experiences were inextricably tied to the rhetoric of rulership which made constant claims of power based on legitimacy, status, and authority.  The research focuses on Group III at Holmul, Guatemala, which is compared to other palaces in the Maya region.  My approach builds upon multiple theoretical perspectives, informed by the work of de Certeau, Foucault, Hall, and Soja.  In the process, I examine palace architecture to explore how the Maya state expressed power through architectural design features.  These features were parts of strategies to affect the experience of those in and around the palace.  I examine how the movement and sensory perception of both royal and non-royals persons were affected by palace architecture by concentrating on the spatial layout of morphological features.To understand these experiences, I set out a rationale on the relationship between the built environment and people.  It is termed the archaeology of experience and it explicates how architecture acts as more than a backdrop to social engagements and directly affects behaviors.  Experiencers are first treated as bodies, simply the array of their human senses.  Once the built environment is perceived and understood, the experiencer reacts.  These responses are considered to fall within one of three categories: conceptual, behavioral, and emotional.  Ancient Maya palaces were places where rulership enacted their strategies of self-preservation.  Demonstrations of divine power, the exhibition of blood ties to important ancestors, and exhibitions of military prowess were constantly enacted.  Yet, palaces were more than a setting for these activities.  They were designed to facilitate these activities, but more than that they were created in ways that communicated the same themes of qualitative difference, legitimacy, strength, and authority in completely different ways.  By affecting human sensory perception and bodily movement, palaces contributed to the social claims of the ruler.  Palaces were a rhetoric made material, but one that worked subtly and symbolically on both the brain, body, and heart.

Heroides 1 as a Programmatic Letter
The Heroides is Ovid’s collection of verse letters between classical heroines and their lovers. The set of fifteen single letters and several paired letters begins with Penelope’s letter to her husband Odysseus, who has been gone from Ithaca for twenty years due to the Trojan War. While Odysseus’adventures were chronicled by Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey, Ovid sets out to share Penelope’s perspective on, arguably, the eve of Odysseus’ return. However, Penelope’s letter is not just the first in the collection, it is a programmatic letter for the Heroides because it introduces the theme of the later letters, and it more closely follows epistolary style markers than the other letters. Penelope’s letter occurs in a situation that is more realistic than others in the collection, and so readers are persuaded to accept the later letters, even if the situations seem less plausible. Ovid’s interpretation of Homer’s Penelope also prepares readers for his views of later heroines and demonstrates the important place of imitatio and aemulatio in his writing. Therefore, in acting as a programmatic letter, Penelope’s letter introduces the collection and gives Ovid firm ground to explore with his later “writers.”

Above Sea: Modern and Contemporary Art  from the Ruins of Shanghai's New Heaven on Earth
Shanghai (translated as Above Sea) has long been characterized as Mainland China's most East meets West, and modern metropolis. Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, artists, designers, and filmmakers have confronted this identity, formulating diverging notions of Chinese modernity and contemporaneity vis-à-vis Shanghai's cultural hybridity. This dissertation examines these formulations by analyzing examples of art, as well as fashion, print media, and film produced in dialogue with cross-cultural Shanghai in three key periods: the 1920s-30s during the city's semi-colonial modernist heyday, the 1960s-70s during the Cultural Revolution (Wenhua dageming), and the 1990s-2000s as Shanghai has re-emerged as a global center. My analyses problematize the trope of East meets West that has long informed the discourses both on Shanghai and modern and contemporary Chinese art, by exposing other cultural collisions (e.g., semi-colonial cosmopolitanism vs. anti-imperialist nationalism in the 1920s-30s, Maoist collectivity vs. individualism in the 1960s-70s, and local identities vs. globalization in the 1990s-2000s). The examples explored (e.g., Liang You/Young Companion magazine, revolutionary woodcuts, and painting by Parisian-trained artist, Pang Xunqin, in the 1920s-30s, socialist realist murals, revolutionary Peking opera, and a documentary by Italian auteur, Michelangelo Antonioni, in the 1960s-70s, installations by transnational artists, Xu Bing and Gu Wenda, and films by Shanghai-based artists, Zhou Tiehai and Yang Fudong, in the 1990s-2000s) span time, media, and national boundaries, allowing for analyses of diverging notions of Chinese modernity and contemporaneity vis-à-vis visual culture and its transnational movements. Many of these examples are locationally linked through a particular neighborhood said to epitomize contemporary Shanghai. Today the site of Xintiandi (translated as New Heaven on Earth), a retail and cultural complex in Shanghai's former French Concession, this neighborhood encompasses an underground history of revolutionary art, film, and design, which this dissertation uncovers. While filtered through the lens of Shanghai, this dissertation confronts broader issues, including the stakes of non-Western art's integration into art historical canons, and the role modern and contemporary Chinese art plays in the emergence of a globalized culture industry.

Learning-based trimap generation for video matting
Object extraction is a critical operation for many content -based video applications.For these applications, a robust and precise extraction technique is required. This thesis proposes an efficient and accurate method for generating a trimap for video matting.We first segment the foreground using motion information and neighboring pixel coherence via graph cuts. Also, we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model for the foreground and background with segmented foreground and estimated static background. Next, we classify the pixels of each frame into models by performing maximum likelihood classification and generate a trimap which is an image consisting of three regions: foreground, background and unknown. Finally, we use the trimap as a guide in spectral matting for video matting. Our experimental results show that the proposed method yields accurate and natural object boundaries

Konrad Lorenz:  A Prisoner of War for Three Years
Complete insight into scientific concepts, and especially scientific schools, is impossible without an overview of the history of their origins, without knowledge of the originators of those concepts, and their personal histories and their aspirations. Konrad Lorenz, one of the founders of ethology, had a very complex personality. His contribution to world science is undoubtedly great, but at the same time, his idea that the laws of animal life are directly extrapolative to human society is fallacious.

Modification of Market: John Smith and the Mezzotint Print in Eighteenth-Century England
The starting point for this paper was Anthony Griffiths' short twelve page article, "Early Mezzotint Publishing in England--I John Smith, 1652-1743." Griffiths' focus in the article was a rather obscure artist of the late-seventeenth-early-eighteenth-century, John Smith (1652-1743). With a decidedly unassuming name, it is not difficult to imagine that such an individual might easily be forgotten to history. However, what Mr. Griffiths' rightly points out is that Smith was considered the premier artist of the mezzotint printing technique of his time.      Until this moment, the British struggled to establish themselves in the artistic world. The empire typically relied on expatriates of other nations and the imported techniques they brought with them to provide the nation with an artistic identity. Such was the case with the mezzotint technique. Popularized during the seventeenth-century by Dutch artists, mezzotint was well suited to the replication of portraits.  It became so extensively used in England, that internationally it was known as la manière anglaise. With Smith, the English found themselves a national artist and technique.      Smith's earliest prints were completed under the direction of other print publishers. However by 1689, Smith acquired the workshop of his publisher, Isaac Beckett, and began a long-standing business relationship with the portraitist Godfrey Kneller. With the acquisition, Smith was no longer simply an artist. He was now both printmaker and publisher in absolute control of his market.     England's eighteenth century portrait print market is understood as a multilayered industry dependent on the cooperation of several autonomous key agents closely working together: the portrait painter, printmaker, patron, publisher and sitter.  The complex roles of these individuals were often not clearly defined and generally complicated the market's business structure. This paper will focus on the question of the conception of authorship and originality that were possible in a market that encouraged the displacement of its structural order and dependent on multiplicity.

Teuf Love: Verlan in French Rap and Beyond
My research was performed with the intent of understanding the particular poetic and symbolic strategies at work behind the many uses and representations of the syllable-switching slang practice, verlan, in French society. I traveled to France and performed interviews with rappers (who systematized it in its current form), suburban residents, bourgeois adults and young adults, professors and employees of the language bureau the Académie Française. I also performed participant observation, observed its appearance in print and mass media, and found that though it can now be found everywhere, it is still stigmatized for its association with the lower class immigrant communities that brought it to the public’s attention in the 1980’s through rap lyrics and street culture. While I found that immigrant youths and rappers use it as an identity marker, poetic tool and symbol of linguistic freedom and cultural interaction, language authorities and mass media tended to depict it as a violent affront to traditional republican values and French national identity.  My research revealed the power relations that brought about and perpetuate this language game : canonical versus experimental knowledge, normative policies versus individual freedom, commercial gain versus artistic expression.  Though I am far from having a complete answer to why and how, my interviews led to me to see verlan as used in the suburbs as an act of reinterpretation that defines self and one’s community not by its adherence to monologic codes but by its accomodation of multiple codes, origins and individual perspectives.

A do-it-yourself protocol for simple transcription activator-like effector assembly
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors) are powerful molecules that have broad applications in genetic and epigenetic manipulations. The simple design of TALEs, coupled with high binding predictability and specificity, is bringing genome engineering power to the standard molecular laboratory. Currently, however, custom TALE assembly is either costly or limited to few research centers, due to complicated assembly protocols, long set-up time and specific training requirements.
				
				
					
						Results
					We streamlined a Golden Gate-based method for custom TALE assembly. First, by providing ready-made, quality-controlled monomers, we eliminated the procedures for error-prone and time-consuming set-up. Second, we optimized the protocol toward a fast, two-day assembly of custom TALEs, based on four thermocycling reactions. Third, we increased the versatility for diverse downstream applications by providing series of vector sets to generate both TALENs (TALE nucleases) and TALE-TFs (TALE-transcription factors) under the control of different promoters. Finally, we validated our system by assembling a number of TALENs and TALE-TFs with DNA sequencing confirmation. We further demonstrated that an assembled TALE-TF was able to transactivate a luciferase reporter gene and a TALEN pair was able to cut its target.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We established and validated a do-it-yourself system that enables individual researchers to assemble TALENs and TALE-TFs within 2 days. The simplified TALE assembly combined with multiple choices of vectors will facilitate the broad use of TALE technology.

The Function and Significance of Inter-Species Acoustic Cues in the Transformation of  Budgerigar (Melopsittacus Undulatus) Sounds Into "Speech"
Analysis of speech-imitation sounds produced by pet budgerigars (Melopsittacus imdulatus) reveals a consistent focus on acoustic components of speech which have counterparts in the species-specific vocalizations of budgerigars. These budgerigar vocalizations include whistle sequences (which, with their rapid glides in pitch contour, need only slight modification to constitute a second-formant representation of speech), the contact call (which is acoustically similar to the secondformant transition of high front vowels), and sounds with harmonic spectra (which can be modified to represent the formant structure of certain vowels). This transformation of species-specific sounds into speech-imitation sounds by focusing on shared acoustic features prompts the hypothesis that, with the appropriate social stimulation, pet budgerigars perceive human speech as modified budgerigar sounds. The hypothesis is supported by the fact that the shared acoustic features are particularly important cues in the perception of species-specific communication sounds by both humans and budgerigars. Such inter-species vocal communication cues, having a common origin somewhere in vertebrate phylogeny. would help to explain the many reported examples of human-like speech perception by nonhuman vertebrates. The shared neural mechanisms which correspond to these shared acoustic patterns could constitute a phylogenetically conservative level of auditory perception which is communication sound-specific but not species-specific.

Benjamin's Bards:  Myth, Memory, and Zeitgeist in the Making of the Modern Storyteller
In 1936, Walter Benjamin, fearful and frustrated with the traumatic residuals of the First World War and perhaps foreseeing a second one approaching, wrote an essay mourning what he perceived to be the loss of relevancy to storytelling in modern civilization.  In this text entitled, "The Storyteller," Benjamin argued that the advent of modernization has alienated humanity from the histories and mythologies of their communities and has rendered the narrative and ultimately the storyteller, irrelevant to modern civilization. The storyteller, whose job was to pass on experience that allowed the community to deal with threatening "forces of nature" became irrelevant, because mankind was facing dangers it had never previous known and no amount of previous experience existed that properly equipped humanity to deal with the perils of modern warfare (102).  Our stories no longer served their purpose of preparing us for any impending threat.  Consequently, stories, which serve to define and interconnect communities, became ineffective because our modern technologies have distanced us from our traditions and, ultimately, from each other. 	Through an examination into the art of mediating a story by considering not only Benjamin's definition of the storyteller, but equally his understanding of the story and its role in the community, it is this discussion's intent to illustrate that the role of the storyteller is still pertinent to modern culture. As Benjamin argued stories must evolve to meet the needs of the community, so must the manner in which the narrative is mediated.  Technology, rather than alienating the community from its histories and mythologies, can through the medium of modern cinema fulfill this role of the bard in modern society. It will be illustrated that filmmakers can serve as modern bards that maintain ritual of keeping history alive through storytelling, counseling, advising and helping modern cultures to define themselves. This discussion will concentrate on the work of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Luc Besson, Terry Gilliam, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Christian Duguay, and Tim Burton.  Each filmmaker addressed will respond to Benjamin's contention by illustrating the modern method of mediation by which history and mythology is accessed and kept a relevant force within our modern cultures.

Radical Cosmopolitanism: W. E. B. Du Bois, Germany, and African American Pragmatist Visions for Twenty-First Century Europe
This essay originally appeared in Representation and Decoration in a Postmodern Age, edited by Alfred Hornung and Rüdiger Kunow (Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag Winter, 2009), 65–96.
      Günter H. Lenz’s important essay focuses on W. E. B. Du Bois’s education and experiences in Germany. Tracing Du Bois’s time in Germany, from his university years there (1892–1894) to his visits in the 1920s and 1930s, and finally to his last stay in 1958 when he received an honorary doctorate in Berlin, Lenz’s analysis of Du Bois’s work indicates how political factors and social change in Germany influenced and transformed Du Bois’s interpretation of the US but also shifted the ground of Du Bois’s critique to the larger forces of global imperialism and colonialism. Moving from a study of The Souls of Black Folk (1903) through an analysis of the less popular Dark Princess (1928) and on to essays and books such as Color and Democracy: Colonies and Peace (1945), Lenz develops an argument for reading Du Bois’s “radical cosmopolitanism” as “an open, trans (and post-)national, diasporic discourse that acknowledges and negotiates intercultural multiplicity, heterogeneous interests and positions, and hybrid publics.”

The sweet burnt smell of history : a self-reflexive analysis on the conception of the 8th Panama Biennial
This text is witness to the research process leading to the theme and concept of the 8th Panama Biennial. Entitled The Sweet Burnt Smell of History, the Biennial took on the former American Canal Zone as its main theme, with the purpose of bringing about a reflection on the nation's recent social and political history, through the lens of contemporary visual arts. This text analyzes the historical backdrop against which the works that composed the exhibition developed, and draws a conceptual background of its curatorial framework. It consists of three chapters. Contrasting the historical, political and ideological significance of the building of the Canal both in the Panamanian and North American contexts, the first chapter describes the construction and projection of the Panama Canal Zone as a social tropical utopia. The second chapter is an analysis of the historical evolution and transformation of the 19th century model of exhibitions as it leads up to the prevailing format of contemporary art biennials. Chapter three is a reflection on how the 8th Panama Biennial rethought its own model in order to problematize its localization in the contemporary global circuit

Nomads in transition : mortuary archaeology in the lowlands of Edom (Jordan)
This dissertation examines the appearance of Edomite identity as reflected in the mortuary archaeology of Southern Jordan in the Iron Age (ca. 1200-500 B.C.E.). This study contributes to the collective understanding of social structure among a nomadic people as it grows in complexity on the edges of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In Chapter 1, the historical records relating to Edom are described, in order to identify the people studied. This is followed by an analysis of the region's archaeology, which is shown to represent a nomadic people. Traditionally recognized markers of ethnic identity are also discussed. In Chapter 2, mortuary archaeology is considered, first theoretically, and then with specific reference to the Near East. Finally, the limited corpus of archaeological material, excluding Wadi Fidan 40, from Edom is discussed. This includes published data from the major Edomite archaeological sites, as well as unpublished data from the Edom Lowlands Archaeology Project expeditions. Chapter 3 follows with a study of power in pastoral society and an analysis of the importance of graves and shrines in organizing such a society. Chapter 4 presents the previously unpublished complete corpus of mortuary data from Wadi Fidan 40. Chapter 5 examines the standing stones and surface architecture at Wadi Fidan 40 in the context of the burial monuments of the self- identifying groups found in the Levant at the time. Chapter 6 examines the economic and social significance of the objects of personal adornment worn by the deceased at Wadi Fidan 40. Finally, in Chapter 7 the dissertation is summed up. This analysis of the cemetery at Wadi Fidan 40 presents a nomadic population in transition, one which displays competition between families and which draws on close ties to Arabia in order to obtain portable displayable wealth in order to cement leadership in a changing society

Mutatis Mutandi: Spanish Literature of the New 21st Century
Mutatis mutandi: <italic>literatura española del nuevo siglo XXI<italic>,  focuses on how the new hybrid prose and poetry created by the so called &ldquo;Generación Mutante&rdquo;&mdash;or Generación Nocilla&mdash;is able to question the purpose and nature of art in the current context of information technology. Chapter 1 deals with the writing of Vicente Luis Mora. I argue here that his written representation of other media within the general tradition of the &ldquo;book&rdquo; brings to the fore the technological mediation present in today's artistic creation. Grammatical and orthographical subversions in Mora's poetry projects aim to alter our habitual reading practices and force the reader to take an active role as interpreter and constructor of meaning. Chapter 2 elaborates on the idea of technological representation and its subversion in the marketplace through the experimental literary work of Agustín Fernández Mallo. I claim that his <italic>poesía postpoética<italic> challenges established uses of everyday objects and questions their artistic essence. My final chapter explores the use of new hybrid narrative methods in the work of Jorge Carrión. Carrión's use of Google as a narratological structure in charge of organizing information, reflects on new reading practices intrinsic to the current way of online reading, updating traditional genres like the <italic>récit de voyage<italic>. 	These authors' mash-up techniques and their juxtaposition of alien materials accessible through the Web call our attention to new ways of production where art is based on the manipulation of products understood as creation. The possibility of talking about this group of writers as a new Spanish generation is challenged by their relation with this network of universal collaboration. I argue that, although, these writers all benefit from the changes in access, manipulation and generation of information within a global system, a shared historical and social background, together with a change in their operational systems within the conventional literary panorama, allows us to establish them as a representative sample of a new wave of Spanish writers whose production will grant us an understanding of today's tensions between the Spanish individual &mdash;writer&mdash; and an all encompassing network of information technologies.

John Dizikes: Reflections on a Life of Learning and Teaching at UC Santa Cruz, 1965-2000
John Dizikes first saw UC Santa Cruz when it was still rolling hills and the buildings were only artist’s renderings.  He agreed to stake his career on this new, untried campus because he understood the vision of UCSC as a place where higher education would be reformed and teaching would be a priority—and he followed through on the gamble, coming here as one of UCSC’s founding faculty in 1965. In his ensuing thirty-five-year career at UC Santa Cruz, he was a professor of history, a professor and co-founder of the American Studies Department, a provost of Cowell College and chair of the Council of Provosts, and throughout and above it all a dedicated educator and an ongoing student. This oral history was conducted in 2011 by Cowell alum Cameron Vanderscoff for the Regional History Project.

Choreographing Politics, Dancing Modernity: Ballet and Modern Dance in the Construction of Modern México (1919-1940)
In this dissertation, I analyze the pivotal role that ballet and modern dance played in the construction of modern México during the development of its post-revolutionary history and culture from 1919 to 1940. In this doctoral research, I approach dance as a means of knowledge production that contributes to shaping the cultural contexts in which individual and collective identities are produced while perpetuating systems of sociopolitical and economic domination and/or offering alternatives to restructure unequal power relations. As an organizing principle, this dissertation presupposes that dances always enact, explicitly and/or implicitly, sets of political assumptions that affect the bodies that participate by dancing or by watching dance. In other words, I examine how dance represents race, class, gender, and sexuality; how corporeal difference is arranged in space; what does the dance say about human relations; and how subjectivity is constructed through dance training and performing on stage. I also consider whose worldview, values and interests are enacted on stage and thereby normalized beyond the stage. In exploring these questions, I connect their answers to multiple forms that corporeal social interactions take in the formation of subjectivity at the world at large. Also, by examining specific dances and the discourses these engender, I offer various views of what it meant to be a modern Mexican across the different historical moments in which the country continually redefined and redirected its nationalist project of modernization. This discussion is framed by the various forms that México's revolutionary nationalism took as well as by cultural and political imperatives modeled by countries of the "first world".

Charles Donald Shane: The Lick Observatory
Dr. Shane was a noted astronomer and former Director of the Lick Observatory. This interview was designed as a supplement to one conducted by the American Institute of Physics in 1967, hence only a small portion of this volume deals directly with Dr. Shane's work or his administrative career. Instead it concentrates primarily on Dr. Shane's knowledge of the early years of the Lick Observatory.
      At the time Dr. Shane first went to Lick Observatory as a student in 1914, many of the astronomers were men who had been with the Observatory since its very early years. Dr. Shane was asked to comment upon the various men who have been Directors of the Observatory and to discuss the progress of the Observatory under each man. The final portion of the manuscript deals with various items that Dr. Shane felt should have been included in the AIP interview, specifically comments on the establishment of the Statistics department at UC Berkeley, his experience working with the University's Academic Senate, and a discussion of some of the astronomy advisory committees on which he has served both in the United States and abroad.

Musical Momennts
Musical Moments
abstract
The inspiration for this piece came largely from my encounters with Miles Davis’s composition “Flamenco Sketches” from his album “Kind of Blue”. Initially, I wanted to write a piece that would have a highly dramatic emotional content with some influences drawn from flamenco music. The only thing that I drew from flamenco is a progression of chords that loosely hint at Phrygian mode (often used in flamenco). Other elements of the music and the development of musical material are not
related to flamenco or to Davis’s “Flamenco Sketches”. “Musical Moments” presents four different moods: calm but anxious, joyous and assertive, indecisive and contemplative, restless and explosive. Each of these moods creates a separate section of the piece which when combined shape a single movement work.

Choreographing in Pakistan: Indu Mitha, Dancing Occluded histories in "The Land of the Pure"
This critical biography of Indu Mitha, a Pakistani dancer and choreographer, lays out an alternate, creative history of sixty-four years of post-Partition Pakistan. Her life and work enable choreographing an occluded space on stage and beyond, which I call space of hope --a space of alterity, a place where narratives countering the nation state boundaries enforced by the 1947 Partition of British India into the three independent states of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh (1971). This space is not a post-colonial one, but is based on a longer shared historical specificity of South Asia. Indu Mitha's life and work enable this journey into occluded spaces, into an alternate history of sixty-four years of post-Partition Pakistan. These spaces of hope are foci to probing broader questions about the place of the outliers, i.e. Muslims in India, and non-Muslims and "non-Pakistanis" in Pakistan (Post 1971), in the aftermath of the 1947 Partition of India. This dissertation stages the untold history of these minority voices of classical dancers and musicians in Pakistan, and in the process questions whether their marginal statuses are due to factors connected to the aftermath of Partition, or to a redundant pre-colonial baggage, or both.By taking a creative approach to writing a shared history of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh beyond Partition, this dissertation presents controversial, contested histories that are closer to the ground realities of people in the region. Methodology involved triangulating Indu's bharata natyam, kathak and Uday Shankar choreographies with her life history, parallel to key moments of South Asian history from the early twentieth century to the first decade of the twenty-first century. This new "creative approach" brings together, for the first time, cutting edge work in the fields of post-colonial histories and Partition aftermath studies with dance history scholarship, in particular critical bharata natyam studies. This project uses the rich lyric mode and story-telling tradition of bharata natyam, syncrethic aspects of kathak, and the creative style of Indu's Uday Shankar repertoire to narrate alternative histories that have been silenced and/or ignored in official narratives. These histories call for a rethinking of the occluded inclusive and secular vision of founding father Jinnah as protector-general of the minorities.

Il diritto all’immagine nella Napoli aragonese : i ritratti di Pontano e Sannazaro
The study of all the portraits of Giovanni Pontano and Jacopo Sannazaro aims to enlighten the process of iconographical creation in Naples in the Renaissance (fifteenth and sixteenth century). These famous humanists, very close to the Aragonese dynasty, used the same patterns but in a different way than the kings. The "right to portrait" at the royal court had precise codifications. The portraits of Pontano and Sannazaro are at the same time inside and outside this frame of codes. That's why their study allows a wider analysis of the question of the portrait in Aragonese Naples, the unique monarchy of the peninsula and great example for the other Italian and European courts.

Electric field-tunable BaxSr12xTiO3 films with high figures of merit grown by molecular beam epitaxy
We report on the dielectric properties of BaxSr1xTiO3(BST) films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on epitaxial Pt bottom electrodes. Paraelectric films (x<0.5) exhibit dielectric losses that are similar to those of BST single crystals and ceramics. Films with device quality factors greater than 1000 and electric field tunabilities exceeding 1:5 are demonstrated. The results provide evidence for the importance of stoichiometry control and the use of a non-energetic deposition technique for achieving high figures of merit of tunable devices with BST thin films.

Representations of Sicily in the Contemporary Narrative of the Risorgimento
The island of Sicily has served as one of the most important and common settings for the narrative of the Risorgimento. Italian literature dedicated to narrating the events of the country’s period of unification seems to be somewhat obsessed with this island, which has been created and recreated in novels, novelle and short stories written by both Sicilian and northern writers.  The purpose of this paper is to explore how the land, culture and population of Sicily are depicted in three key narrative texts of the twentieth century to see how they may participate of the cultural, social, political and literary phenomenon known as Meridionalismo, which, we intend to prove, may be compared in attitude and scope to Orientalism (as described by Edward Said). We will limit ourselves to these three twentieth century narrations written: Lampedusa’s Il Gattopardo, Sciascia’s Il quarantotto and De Cataldo’s I traditori all deal with the events of 1860 and the process of the Risorgimento as it occurred in Sicily and they were all written by men born in the South but that were writing from the North. We will attempt to see whether the social and cultural stereotypical representations of Sicily that characterized much of Meridionalist literature are present in these texts and, if so, how they may or may not connect the literature written about the Meridione by southern writers with the literature written about the Orient.

Esther Abbott: Photographer and Social Reformer, 1911-2003
In her mid-nineties at the time of this interview, Esther Abbott achieved a long and impressive career as a photographer whose work was published in Arizona Highways and other publications in the 1940s and 1950s. With her husband Charles (Chuck) Abbott, she also shaped the urban landscape of downtown Santa Cruz through her historic preservation activities, and her advocacy on behalf of the pedestrian-centered Pacific Garden Mall, which was constructed in the late 1960s. This oral history, conducted by Evelyn Richards of the University Library's Regional History Project, illuminates the life and career of this remarkable and vibrant woman.
      The University Library's Visual Resource Collection also has a collection of 4,700 slides of the Abbotts' photographs of architectural reconstructions of national urban and suburban landscapes in the 1960s. Their photographs of the buildings of Santa Cruz are of special importance to local patrons. In addition, Special Collections has a collection of Chuck Abbott's photographs documenting his time in World War I Europe, as well as his career from 1920 to 1935.

Altman on Jacobs on Dior: Fashion Through Fractals and Archives
 
      On February 25, 2011, the fashion luxury company Christian Dior suspended John Galliano, who had been its creative director since 1996, after his arrest over making anti-Semitic remarks at a Paris bar. Quickly following his suspension, a video from December 2010 was distributed showing Galliano hurling anti-Semitic invectives at several bar patrons. On March 1, 2011, Dior fired Galliano. At stake in the considerable interest and speculations regarding who takes over at Dior is control of a €24.6B business empire and access to a historic couturier’s archive. In this sense, its designer will influence the label’s "books" both financial and what will be stored in its physical repository as part of the brand’s creative and artistic repertoire. Despite fashion’s apparent ubiquity, the anticipation surrounding who takes over at Dior is proof that despite fashion’s professed democratization, there still exists a fashion hierarchy with Dior occupying its upper echelon. Since Galliano’s dismissal, fashion insiders have moved from breathlessly feverish in their speculations to desperately calling out for relief in the face of an unexpectedly drawn-out waiting game that is now over a year old and otherwise an eternity in fashion’s hyper accelerated production cycle. To purposely counter fashion’s accelerated internal clock, the purpose of this commentary is to keep fashion in a reflective state rather than a reflexive stance and uses fashion on film, and specifically Robert Altman’s Prêt-à-Porter (1994), to give cultural and historical context to all the online speculation and chatter. Altman’s film is the fractal, or the repeating pattern, in a dramatized form, as well as the cultural archive against which to examine the entangled relations of the designer Marc J

Tecnologías en escena: Del teatro multimedia al teatro cibernetico
"Staged Technologies: From Multimedia Theatre to Cybernetic Theatre in Spain and the Americas" explores the use of new technologies in theatre today and how they are incorporated in Latin American, Spanish and U.S. Latino Theatre productions from 1985-2008. From the wide spectrum of possibilities the dissertation privileges multimedia and cybernetic theatrical practices. The study is based on the analysis of twenty-one theatrical productions from Spain, Chile and U.S. Latinos' within their national as well as international theatrical and historical context. The pieces include staged productions by well-known theatrical groups, new avant-garde groups, street theatre and a religious festival. The aim of this diversity is to demonstrate that multimedia and cybernetic theatrical practices are transnational and transcultural. In this study the main topic of discussion is the use of multimedia and digital techniques as a means of theatrical and performative communication. It also sheds light on the relationship between theatre production and economic trends such as postmodernism, neoliberalism and globalization.The corpus of study is a multitude of very diverse theatrical forms and expressions. As is common in theatre, Latin American, Spanish and U.S. Latino playwrights search for new aesthetics and avant-garde means by which to communicate with a very large community and multicultural society. The assumption of this research is that the performances with emphasis on technologies coexist with a diversity of theatrical trends and developed parallel to other more canonical theatrical discourses. Yet much of the mode of theatrical communication and techniques by theatre groups today has appropriated a cyber-cultural means of communication.I argue that these trends in contemporary theatre transcends national boundaries and implements transnational and multimedia codes to reach today's spectator, one whose visual competence is strongly influenced by contemporary visual cultures, cinema, modern art, television, marketing, mass media, digital and cyber-culture. The new technologies allow the contemporary playwright new modes of representation and to include new cultural and social spaces such as women, gay, lesbian, marginal individuals and marginal social groups. The approach I use integrates cultural studies, semiotics of theatre, discourses theories, performance, film and visual studies. In spite of critics who question multimedia, cybernetic and internet theatre, I propose that playwrights have adapted to the new technologies in order to represent singular world visions and social imaginaries. Multimedia, virtual, cyber and internet theatres are the contemporary versions of a long tradition of the interrelationship between technologies and theatre.

Travel
Travel was a crucial element of ancient Egyptian culture. An extensive traffic system by land and by water already existed as early as the Old Kingdom, including various means of transport that did not fundamentally change right through to the New Kingdom. Traveling activity attested for various professions demonstrates that Egyptian society exercised a high degree of mobility. In the majority of cases, a journey was undertaken within the scope of the traveler’s work and on behalf of the pharaoh. Travel had a significant impact on the Egyptian world-view as well as on the development of the identity of Egyptian society as an entity.

Probabilistic topic models for automatic harmonic analysis of music
Though music is an art form with tremendous expressive capacity, the underlying frameworks of most musical compositions are highly structured and organized. As such, musical pieces are commonly studied by analyzing their melodic and harmonic structures. Two important concepts in any such analysis are the key and tonic. The key of a musical piece identifies a principal set of pitches that the composer uses to build its melodies and harmonies; the tonic is the most stable pitch in this set. Each musical piece is characterized by one overall key. However, the key can be shifted within a piece by a compositional technique known as modulation. Notwithstanding the infinite number of variations possible in music, most pieces can be analyzed in these terms. In this dissertation, we propose novel methods for modeling a corpus of musical pieces in terms of its harmonic structure. We describe several different models for symbolic and audio musical input, as we find both to be valuable data formats to perform harmonic analysis on. Our models are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular probabilistic model traditionally used for discovering latent semantic topics in large collections of text documents. In our variant of LDA, we model each musical piece as a random mixture of keys. Each key is then modeled as a key-profile -- a distribution over a set of pitch classes. Using this representation, we show how to accomplish the tasks of key-finding and modulation- tracking, the first steps to any kind of harmonic analysis. Our approach to such tasks is unlike that of previous studies, which depend on extensive prior music knowledge or supervision by domain experts. Based on a model of unsupervised learning, our approach bypasses the need for manually key-annotated musical pieces, a process that is both expensive and prone to error. As an additional benefit, it can also discover correlations in the data of which the designers of rule-based approaches are unaware. Since we do not rely on extensive prior knowledge, our model can also be applied in a straightforward way to other, non-western genres of music with different tonal systems

Un modello beneventano per il Virgilio altomedievale di Napoli (ms ex vind. 58. Lat.6)
The Neapolitan Virgil (Naples, B.N., ms ex vindob, lat.6) was written and illuminated in Naples about 950 and was part of the library of the Duke John III and his wife Theodora. The manuscript derives from a model of lateantiquity, but the closeness of its drawings to the wall paintings in the church of S. Sophia in Benevento can assume the existence of an intermediate model that was written and illuminated for the wife of duke Arechi II, Adelperga, who was Paul the Deacon’s student.

Americanization of Russian Cities?
Not unlike their counterparts in the United States, Russian cities are undergoing profound change in terms of both form and process, although in a uniquely Russian context. Understanding these core drivers can help shed light on how future Russian urbanization will proceed, on whether it will maintain a more compact city form or follow an explicitly Americanized model of low-density suburbanization.

[severus, author, image]

Methods of Remembrance: The Images of Septimius Severus
Septimius Severus presented an image of himself as a traditional Roman emperor.  He linked himself visually to Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Aurelius; going as far as being adopted into Marcus Aurelius's family.  Severus portrayed himself as ordained by the gods, and as the restorer of peace to Rome through his victories over Parthia.  All of these connections were needed to fortify Severus's reign and Dynasty.  This is only half the story.  In literary authors from the third to the fourth century, this image is fiercely contested.  Dio Cassius, Herodian, and the author of the Historia Augusta all display Severus as inept, cruel, and harmful to the aspirations of the Senate.  This paper examines not only why these sources criticize Severus's propaganda, but how each author's criticisms change in order to stress their contemporary concerns.

Advances in Display Technology
We live in a digital age. As more of our interactions are mediated by computers, their visual displays become our windows to the world. Every year, new and `more-realistic' displays bring the world to our fingertips, and we recognize the quaint limits of last year's printers, televisions, and phones.   This dissertation pushes display technology on four fronts, each immersing us more deeply in the scene we're shown, letting us forget the display itself.First, we introduce printed photos that respond to ambient light as would the depicted 3D scene. Shadows and shading in a printed image change to match its new lighting environment. With a 3D object and a print side by side, a light to their right will casts shadows to the left on both. Shiny, dimpled `Reflectance Paper' - with opaque ink on an overlaid transparency - selectively blocks light from each direction independently.Second, we look to 3D displays, where stereo glasses funnel different images to each eye.  Typical 3D displays show a confusing double-image to those not wearing stereo glasses. Our 3D+2DTV gives a 3D view to those with the glasses, but presents a single, 2D view to those without. For those without glasses, we cancel one of the two stereo images with an inverted third image that only they see.Third, we increase the fidelity of mobile displays' power-saving backlight dimming. With maximum brightness reduced, intermediate brightness levels are remapped to preferentially retain detail at strong edges in the image.Fourth, we personalize photography.  Displaying photos with content-aware image manipulations and eyetrack-based saliency subtly preserves photographers' intentions as recorded in their eye gaze history.Display technology's relentless evolution enriches our increasingly digitized world.  This dissertation's four contributions raise the immersiveness of our digital portals, heightening our view of the world and our communication with one another.

Spur reduction techniques for fractional-N PLLs
Fractional-N phase locked loops (PLL) are widely used in modern communication systems to synthesize a highly pure frequency from a lower reference frequency. Stringent requirements are often placed on the spectral purity of the synthesized frequency so that overall system-level requirements are met. Unfortunately, spurious tones are inevitable in the output signals of fractional-N PLLs, and in conventional designs they can be attenuated only with design tradeoffs that degrade other aspects of performance. This dissertation presents a PLL that utilizes a successive requantizer in conjunction with an offset current technique to suppress both the fractional and reference spurs. A passive, type-II, sampled loop filter (SLF) is also introduced to mitigate the increased reference spurs that result from the use of an offset current. Chapter 1 describes a phase-noise canceling, fractional-N PLL utilizing the techniques mentioned above. It details the system level and circuit level design and presents measured results. Chapter 2 presents a discrete- time model for a PLL utilizing the passive SLF described in Chapter 1. A mathematical basis for the model is also presented. Chapter 3 describes an integer-N, realigning PLL utilizing a relaxation oscillator and a calibration scheme to suppress the realignment spur. Realignment can suppress the noise of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and hence finds application in systems utilizing non -LC based VCOs. However, implementation challenges exist with regard to the VCO and many previously published designs suffer from a large realignment spur. The use of a relaxation oscillator and the calibration scheme address these two challenges

"The Power of Suggestiveness:" Sadakichi Hartmann, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, and American Modernism
At the turn of the twentieth century, art and cultural critic Sadakichi Hartmann was deeply invested in fostering an indigenous American modernism.  Although he is generally allied with Alfred Stieglitz, Hartmann wrote on a variety of topics outside of modern photography.  This thesis explores Hartmann's criticism of the American painter Thomas Wilmer Dewing.  While Dewing is often considered a Gilded Age artist, Hartmann's consideration of his work identifies what the writer calls "a suggestive style" or "suggestivism," which draws influences from French Symbolism and classical Chinese and Japanese art.  For Hartmann, this suggestivism was essential to creating a national modernism.  This thesis presents suggestivism as a means of broadening the scholarship on both Hartmann and Dewing, as well as the historiography of American modernism.

A "Study of Truth and Suffering": Matilde Serao's Early Writings on Naples
In this essay, which serves as an introduction to the set of six new translations included in this same volume of the journal, the author examines briefly the life and works of Matilde Serao, one of Italy's leading women writers of the post-Unification period, with particular attention to her early writings on Naples. The essay explores Serao's essentially hybrid prose writing in these texts, which blend together traits of narrative and essay, literary and oral traditions, and concludes with some remarks on the particular problems posed by Serao's style for an English-language translator.

Polyrhythmic Dance Currents: Race Multiculturalism and the Montreal Dance Community
This dissertation examines African and African Diaspora concert dance in Montreal in relation to Canadian multicultural policies and Québec nationalism. The multiple layers of colonization and various waves of immigration to Québec have made the province a unique nation with its own complex history of racial construction, quite unlike the racial histories of the U.S. or the rest of Canada (though still greatly informed by these racial paradigms). In the debates that arise in Québec over multiculturalism, language is often seen as the main cultural component in need of preservation. However, this focus on language often masks other elements at play in these cultural debates, in particular, how "race" informs notions of cultural belonging in Québec. A focus on African Diaspora dance in Montreal (Québec's largest and most demographically varied city) helps bring racial construction to the fore for two reasons. First, language differences do not distinguish Québec's Black community from the white French-Canadian majority as Québec's Black population is comprised mainly of French-speakers, and accordingly, studying Montreal's African Diaspora reduces the significance of linguistic difference. Second, concentrating on dance practices helps identify how the Montreal public interprets bodies and their cultural meanings. By analyzing the public support and critical reception of African Diaspora dance practices in Montreal, this dissertation examines how racial difference is constructed through multicultural rhetoric, policies, and debates about dance; it also suggests that dance practitioners have the ability to change and inform these constructed identities and the social landscape that frames them. To conduct this research, I use archival material along with personal interviews and participant-observer ethnography to examine: the early visits of Les Ballets Africains to North America (with a particular focus on Montreal); the Montreal-based company Les Ballets Jazz; the 1999 Montreal festival Afrique: Aller/Retour; and the work of Contemporary African dance choreographer Zab Maboungou. With these subjects, my projects contributes a partial history of African Diaspora dance in Montreal and analyzes the effectiveness and the shortcomings of Canadian Multiculturalism on this community.

The Cowell Press and Its Legacy: 1973-2004
his oral history, conducted and edited by book arts scholar and UCSC alumnus Gregory Graalfs, focuses on the history and impact of the Cowell Press at UCSC's Cowell College. It features interviews with fine printers Jack Stauffacher and George Kane, who taught at the Press, as well as with former students Aaron Johnson, Peggy Gotthold, Felicia Rice, and Tom Killion, who have gone on to have illustrious careers in the book arts. The Cowell Press shaped the careers and creative lives of many UCSC students in its thirty-year history.
      Far more than a letterpress print shop where students could make pretty books, the Press was a laboratory to explore the history of tangible words — whether printed, cut in stone, or calligraphed — and to address the interrelationship of word and image. In addition, the influence of twentieth-century literature and visual art on typography was considered, as well as how typography was concerned with design principles that can be applied to film, architecture, and information design. The study of bookmaking — of how thoughts and knowledge are communicated through the vital medium of a book — fit well within the parameters of the unique and experimental quality of the UC Santa Cruz campus envisioned by founders Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry.

Tap routes : the changing role of the contemporary artist-percussionist
This dissertation is a history of classical contemporary multi-percussionists in the 20th and 21st centuries. My research is aimed to counterbalance the existing literature on percussion history that fails to include the personal accounts of percussionists who have contributed immensely to modern music. I have conducted interviews with some senior percussionists in order to view the changes in the field. I argue that a historical view of contemporary percussion that highlights the personal, and the subjective, can give present and future percussionists larger vantage points to understand the salient capabilities of our art

Essays in Structural Econometrics of Auctions
The first chapter of this thesis gives a detailed picture of commonly used structural estimation techniques for several types of auction models. Next chapters consist of essays in which these techniques are utilized for empirical analysis of auction environments. In the second chapter we discuss the identification and estimation of the distribution of private signals in a common value auction model with an asymmetric information environment. We argue that the private information of the informed bidders are identifiable due to the asymmetric information structure. Then, we propose a two stage estimation method, which follows the identification strategy. We show, with Monte-Carlo experiments, that the estimator performs well. Third chapter studies Outer Continental Shelf drainage auctions, where oil and gas extraction leases are sold. Informational asymmetry across bidders and collusive behavior of informed firms make this environment very unique. We apply the technique proposed in the second chapter to data from the OCS drainage auctions. We estimate the parameters of a structural model and then run counterfactual simulations to see the effects of the informational asymmetry on the government's auction revenue. We find that the probability that information symmetry brings higher revenue to the government increases with the value of the auctioned tract.
In the fourth chapter, we make use of the results in the multi-unit auction literature to study the Balancing Energy Services auctions (electricity spot market auctions) in Texas. We estimate the marginal costs of bidders implied by the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of the multi-unit auction model of the market. We then compare the estimates to the actual marginal cost data. We find that, for the BES auction we study, the three largest bidders, Luminant, NRG and Calpine, have marked-down their bids more than the optimal amount implied by the model for the quantities where they were short of their contractual obligations, while they have put a mark-up larger than the optimal level implied by the model for quantities in excess of their contract obligations. Among the three bidders we studied, Calpine has come closest to bidding its optimal implied by the Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of the multi-unit auction model of the BES market.

Conclusion to the Special Issue: Ecology and Regional Context of Tidal Wetlands in the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve
China Camp State Park and Rush Ranch Open Space Preserve contain rare examples of historic tidal wetlands, undeveloped coastal hills and grasslands, and a variety of ecotones once common (but now rare) in the San Francisco Estuary. The San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve was designated in 2003 to support coastal management through long-term monitoring and research at China Camp and Rush Ranch. This two-part Special Issue 9(3) and 10(2) summarizes the current regional context of the marshes at China Camp and Rush Ranch and reviews key aspects of their ecology. Scientific activities at these sites are complemented by stewardship and education programs that offer unique opportunities to improve the conservation and restoration of tidal wetlands throughout the estuary.

Death and Rebirth in Photography: Palazzo Ducale, Venice by the Fratelli Alinari
In the late nineteenth century, Venice underwent political, economic, and cultural changes that affected its heritage and identity. The development of photography, the development of the mass tourism industry, and the success of Italian Unification in 1861 significantly influenced these changes. Photographs like Palazzo Ducale, Venice by the Fratelli Alinari came to represent both the death and rebirth of Venice. To Venetians, the depiction of the Palazzo Ducale in isolation was a melancholic reminder that the era of the independent and economically prosperous Republic of Venice had died following Napoleon’s invasion of Venice in 1797. To tourists, photographs of Venice’s art and architecture were an affordable visual commodity that preserved the memory of their visits. As an easily distributable form of advertisement, photographs of Venice’s art and architecture promoted the tourism industry that reinvented Venice’s economy based on the sale of the experience of historic Venice. The city's embrace of photography and tourism helped to preserve its heritage while it also helped to settle its relationship with the rest of the Italian peninsula. Popular albums of photographs that combined images of Florence, Rome, and Venice propagated a unified Italian identity, even if that identity was not yet fully ingrained in the Italians themselves by the late nineteenth century.

Drawing a straight line and following it : realizing open scores, conceptualizing concert programs, and original sound poetry
Section I of the thesis discusses the author's development and performance of a realization of La Monte Young's Composition 1960 no. 10, with its famous instructions to "draw a straight line and follow it." Section II addresses the author's concept and performance of a concert of music and text compositions, with particular attention paid to her interests both in recontextualizing and defamiliarizing older works by juxtaposing them with dissimilar (and often new) works, and in exploring the connections and disconnections between spoken text and wordless music. Section III is a collection of the author's original sound poetry

"Calling the Magician": The Metamorphic Indo-Caribbean
This dissertation examines the relationship between bodily shapeshifting in the literature of the Asian Indian Caribbean and the construction of postcolonial Indo-Caribbean identity.  Metamorphosis, in opposition to hybridity, is the lens through which I examine the political and literary relationship between the Indo- and Afro-Caribbean.  In contrast to creolization, mestizaje, and other hybridizations, various forms of metamorphosis, including mimicry and doubling, provide agency in the colonial and postcolonial context.  Metamorphosis suggests ways of intervening in the historic ethnic and political divides in postcolonial Caribbean nations like Trinidad and Guyana.  It is thus the key literary figure deployed in the texts under consideration.The Indo-Caribbean is a distinct subgenre within Anglophone Caribbean literature that includes works produced by the descendants of nineteenth-century East Indian indentured laborers in, primarily, Trinidad and Guyana.  Most of the texts examined in this dissertation are written and set in the 1960s and beyond, i.e., during and after the Caribbean independence period.  While employing the common theme in Caribbean literature of indigenizing post-independence national identities, Indo-Caribbean literature focuses on tensions over the acculturation and assimilation of East Indian indentured laborers and their descendants into Afro-Creole culture--tensions that are expressed on the bodies of women and queer people.  The literature also engages with the larger Caribbean fabulist literary tradition of animal-human shapeshifting, and socio-political interventions by land-based spirits.I draw on fiction and poetry by Shani Mootoo, Ramabai Espinet, Ryhaan Shah, Wilson Harris, Cyril Dabydeen, and others to show how Indo-Caribbean literature imaginatively configures the way bodies function in the national space and in the natural environment.  Race, gender, politics, sexuality, and the definition of being human are interconnected and always in flux in the Caribbean colony and postcolony.  Metamorphosis offers a non-assimilationist intervention into the Indo-Afro-Caribbean divide by articulating and promoting an ever-changing ontological (and thus epistemological) diversity in a way that static conceptions of hybridity cannot.

The 1964 Festival of Music of the Americas and Spain: A Critical Examination of Ibero-American Musical Relations in the Context of Cold War Politics
In 1964, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Institute for Hispanic Culture (ICH) sponsored a lavish music festival in Madrid that showcased the latest avant-garde compositions from the United States, Latin America, and Spain.  Critics reserved much of their praise for the serial works, such as Alberto Ginastera's Don Rodrigo Symphony and Gustavo Becerra's Wind Quintet.  Recently, various scholars have asserted that during the Cold War, avant-garde music--especially that employing serial techniques--promoted ideologies of freedom, anti-Communism, and scientific exploration. However, much of this research has focused on relations between the U.S. and Western Europe, leaving other Cold War battlefields, such as Latin America, on the periphery. Formed in 1948, the OAS became a virulently anti-Communist organization, disrupting Leftist movements in Latin America in the name of inter-American cooperation. In the 1960s, the OAS reached out to Spain, as it found Franco's anti-Communist stance and the country's cultural ties with Latin America particularly attractive. During the festival, tropes about solidarity that typified OAS discourse intertwined with commentary on the avant-garde. Serialism, touted as a "universal" language, became symbolic of Latin American progress, while nationalistic styles were labeled as divisive.  Likewise, the new generation of Spanish composers, led by Cristóbal Halffter and Luis de Pablo, professed to leave Spain's nationalist musical legacy behind, and attempted to reshape Manuel de Falla's image from that of nationalist to innovator.  Still, like many composers from countries on the margins of Western music, the Latin American and Spanish composers experienced a doubly binding paradox, wherein to be valued by the European serialists, they must also retain their difference:  their Spanish "essence." I propose to problematize the debates about nationalism and the avant-garde of the early 1960s by drawing upon the rhetoric generated by both critics and composers during the Madrid festival.  Moreover, as this festival dovetailed with Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, an important Cold War project aimed at Latin America, I also deconstruct the nuanced rhetoric of the festival, which reflected centuries of interaction among the Americas, and helped advanced U.S. political goals with regards to Latin American foreign policy.

Dancing with Nostalgia in Taiwanese Contemporary "Traditional" Dance
This dissertation focuses on Taiwanese contemporary choreographies that incorporate traditional materials. I examine the works of two female-led dance companies in Taiwan: Pilgrimage, staged by Taipei Folk Dance Theater in 2004 and Jiao, performed by Legend Lin Dance Theater in 1995 and in 2006. My dissertation engages with interdisciplinary perspectives on the concept of nostalgia. Focusing especially on the dancing body, which is living and changing, I theorize a body-based understanding of engagements with nostalgia, and argue for the dancing body a site of nostalgic negotiation. This approach reevaluates the critical possibility of Asian dance practices and offers a critique to the binary ideology between the West and the East. In chapter one, I demonstrate how, historically, Taiwanese female choreographers engaged nostalgically with "traditional" Chinese Min-Zu dance in ways that somehow empowered them in post-war Taiwan. In chapter two, I discuss the development of Taiwanese subjectivity after the 1980s and suggest that another kind of nostalgia, focusing on local culture, was generated widely during this period. My discussions of the search for Taiwanese cultural symbols and the desire to redefine Taiwanese bodies provide historical and political background that situates the two dance companies analyzed later. In chapter three, I examine how Li-Hua Tsai, the choreographer of Pilgrimage, incorporates folk elements that highlight female spirituality in this dance.  I suggest this dance piece negotiates different nationalism(s) in its attempt to fulfill the audiences' and governmental desires for the staging of cultural representations of Taiwan. Tsai's self-positioning in the local culture of Taiwan also achieves visibility in the international folk dance festivals. In chapter four, I explore how Lee-Chen Lin, the creator of Jiao, constructs a specific body aesthetic that demonstrates a body-based nostalgia, one that choreographs both her local resistance and her niche in the global market. By exploring how contemporary women choreographers in Taiwan continue to engage with their different longings, I bring Asian female choreographers back into dance discourses and recognize their complicated strategies of choreographing nostalgia(s) that bridge not only the past and the present, but also the local and the global.

Guarino Guarini:  His Architecture and the Sublime
Guarino Guarini's dome of San Lorenzo in Turin is singular.  There are three predominate features that make it so:  first, the pattern of the exposed ribs; second, the radical opening of the webbing between the ribs; and third, the conceit that it is not fully supported by the structure below it.  While scholars have long questioned the reasoning behind the domes appearance, the impetus for its creation has not been fully addressed.After noting a radical alteration in Guarini's architectural designs during his time in Paris, I explore the intellectual discourses of the city during this period.  One such conversation in particular may account for these changes &mdash; the discussion surrounding the antique manuscript <italic>On the sublime</italic> attributed to Longinus.  By comparing this manuscript with Guarini's <italic>Architettura civile</italic> and San Lorenzo, I demonstrate how Guarini thought about architecture in terms that are very similar to the way Longinus explains the sublime.  Then, by addressing the design of San Lorenzo as a vehicle of persuasion for both the Savoy and the Teatine Order, a very strong motivation to use Longinus' manuscript for the composition of the church emerges.Another important observation included in this exploration is a new alternative approach to the reading of the iconography of the dome.  I point out a similarity between the design of the dome of San Lorenzo and an unexecuted window for the Chapel of the Holy Shroud.  I propose that both of these designs represent a passionflower &mdash; a symbol of Christ's passion and a popular meditative symbol in theological literature of the period.  The passion of Christ is also the significance of the relic of both San Lorenzo and the Chapel of the Holy Shroud &mdash; the Holy Shroud itself, the most important relic held by the Savoy family and used to confirm its pretensions to a royal title.  Therefore, the passionflower symbol served both the needs of the Theatine Order and the Savoy family.

Music Draws Blood: A Monodrama of East and West
The cross-fertilization and convergence between Eastern and Western cultures ranks as one of the most influential developments of the twentieth century. Surprisingly, few serious efforts have been made to integrate Chinese and Western traditions and styles into the same production and aesthetic space. My performance project, whose background and gestation this dissertation addresses, attempted to do just that.My search for a Chinese source of inspiration ended when Prof. Chi Li of our Department of Ethnomusicology brought to my attention the only surviving collection of early Chinese texts with music: seventeen poems set to music by the celebrated Chinese poet and composer of the Song dynasty, Jiang Kui (ca. 1155-1221). My "Prelude" describes Kui's elusive love experiences with two remarkable sisters whose virtuosity on the pipa was a pivotal element in their relationships. With the assistance of Prof. Peter Kazaras (UCLA's Director of Opera) and my advisor, Prof. Winter, we identified three Western arias that could provide both dramatic contrast and continuity: Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck's "Divinités du Styx" (Ye Divinities of Styx) from Alceste (1767); Giuseppe Verdi's "Una macchia e qui tuttora" from Macbeth (1847); and Dido's Lament from Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1688). The blending of these two seemingly disparate styles using the style of Nian bai, a recitative-like delivery used in traditional Chinese Kun qu opera, created a structure that derives its dramatic integrity and strength from these unlikely pairings. Chapter 1 elaborates on "The Chinese Context" of Jiang Kui, while Chapter 2 discusses "The Western Connections" through Gluck, Verdi, and Purcell. Chapter 3 details the extraordinary power and significance of costume, makeup, facial expression, bodily movement, and use of the water sleeve adapted from Kun qu opera. Chapter 4 discusses not only our decision to employ a Chinese instrumental ensemble but the challenges confronted by Prof. Chi Li in orchestrating, arranging, and even composing under the inspiration of historical practices. My "Postlude" reacts to the overwhelmingly positive feedback we received from the premiere by outlining possible next steps in the evolution of this project, including opportunities for presentation in China.

A longtime Aptos resident who spent part of his youth in Soquel, Mr. Johnston began his interview with descriptions of turn-of- the-century Capitola, the Soquel paper mill, and the mid-county fruit industry. He then discussed the history and economy of the old village of Aptos-- its businesses, school, roads, water supply, and volunteer fire department, of which he was long an active member. He also described the men who were the large landowners in the mid-county at that time and the coming of the modern real estate developers, specifically the creation of Rio Del Mar and Seacliff. In the latter part of the manuscript he described the rum-running and mountain stills of the Prohibition era, while the concluding chapters were devoted to World War II, particularly the Civil Defense efforts in the County during those years.

Geographic and environmental interpretation of photographs
The geographic and environmental interpretation of photographs is of increasing in-
terest due to the growing availability of large scale datasets annotated with location
information. An automatic interpretation system can assist humans in undertanding
landscapes of large areas, provide cues for the scenicness of a location, or pre-filter the
unrelated images for further processing, such as object and event recognition. My work
mainly focuses on two problems: estimating atmospheric visibility from static images
and estimating the "scenicness" of the scene depicted in an image and generating a cor-
responding map.
For the problem of using images to estimate atmospheric visibility, I construct the
analytic mapping from image feature space, which consists of spatial contrast between
pixels or frequency energy, to the optical measure of atmospheric visibility. Also, I explore
a manifold learning algorithm from machine learning to obtain a more reliable estimator
by constructing a graph of images based on their temporal order, since the direct mapping
is very challenging.
To automatically estimate the scenicness of an image, I perform experiments using
global image features. A set of manually labeled images are used to learn a regressor for
predicting the labels of novel images. I also investigate two extensions: first, I propose
a novel composite visual-geographic location kernel which considers both the visual similarity and geographic proximaty of images; and second, I improve the accuracy of the
learned regressor by incorporating unlabeled images in a graph Laplacian semi-supervised
learning framework. I also investigate a novel composite visual-geographic graph Laplacian regularization term. I demonstrate the approach by using ground-level images to
label how scenic a location is.

Repatriation and the Smithsonian: An examination of repatriation at the National Museum of the American Indian and the National Museum of Natural History
As a research based institution, the Smithsonian's involvement in the debate over the control of indigenous history between indigenous and scientific communities has largely been at the defense of free access to all knowledge despite the destruction of indigenous people's cultural heritage. However, the passage of the National Museum of the American Indian Act in 1989, which established a new Smithsonian museum devoted to indigenous cultures and created a federally mandated repatriation statute for all Smithsonian museums, has caused the Smithsonian to evaluate the ethical and moral issues surrounding its involvement in this debate.This thesis seeks to examine the differing perceptions of cultural property being utilized at the Smithsonian through its two repatriating bodies, the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of the American Indian. This study provides an example of the current larger debate as well as emphasizes the Smithsonian's influence on this controversy. Through this study I will provide possible mediations between the two opposing sides of the contest for control of indigenous history and propose the need for a collaborative partnership towards a shared authority over indigenous history.

WikiTrust: Content-Driven Reputation for the Wikipedia
The Wikipedia was initially created to promote collaboration between writers before submitting their work to a peer review process, to address complaints about the speed of peer review. Ironically, the criticism most widely levied against the Wikipedia is the lack of accountability for authors, and the potential to misinform readers.  There is a large community around the Wikipedia project which actively fixes errors as they are discovered, but an unending stream of vandals and spammers chip away at the good will of volunteers who maintain the project for the collective good. We suggest that vandalism detection systems can be used to help direct the volunteer effort on changes more likely to be a problem, making more efficient use of the project's human resources.We use edit distance to quantify the effort of authors, and propose automated methods to evaluate the quality of this effort and how they might be combined into an author reputation system. We desire that an author's reputation be correlated with the stability of the text they contribute &mdash; low reputation should be a predictor of future author contributions being edited or deleted. Reputation can then be another input to a vandalism detection system.Instead of measuring the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of contributions, our quality ideas measure the &ldquo;group consensus&rdquo; in a piece of text. As the article text stabilizes over time, we conclude that it has reached a form which most members of the community can reasonably agree on. As group collaboration increases in prominence on the Internet, we feel that this research will open the door on new applications and quality measures.

The Constructed Landscapes of Horace’s Poetic Autobiography in the Odes
In this paper, I explore how the Latin poet Horace uses and transforms landscape in order to establish his poetic autobiography. This is accomplished through a close reading of Odes 3.13, O Fons Bandusiae. The facets of this particular landscape that are highlighted through Horace’s poetry reflect the way the poet sees the world and his place in it. By manipulating the aesthetic and temporal qualities of the scene, Horace transforms it into a poetic landscape, one that cannot exist outside this particular poem. In this way, Horace asserts several facets of his poetic identity and demonstrates his poetic prowess, claiming his place in the canon of Greek and Latin lyric poets.

Number theory type formulae appearing in graphs
In Chapter I, a brief history of expander graphs will be discussed. In Chapter II, I will introduce many elementary terms and concepts related to graphs and graph covers. Subsequently, in Chapter III, I will study logarithmic derivatives of L-functions associated to graph covers. In this chapter I will show how to use the representations associated to a graph covering, to determine the number of paths which split completely in a given cover. In Chapter IV, an explicit formula for graph zeta functions will be presented. Subsequently I will combine elements of the previous chapter to deduce an explicit formula for graph L -functions. In the next chapter, the subject of the universal cover of a graph and its spectrum will be discussed. A result of Angel, Friedman, and Hoory will be discussed. I will prove a theorem allowing one to increase the speed of their result. I will use this to apply the aforementioned result to a new graph ; this will allow us to provide new evidence of a conjecture they provide in their paper 3

The Transatlantic Paddy: The Making of a Transnational Irish Identity in Nineteenth-Century America
This dissertation addresses the image of Irishmen in political cartoons from England, Ireland and the United States during the latter half of the nineteenth century.  The image of "Paddy," as this violent Irish figure was popularly called, which was so pervasive in the British and Anglo-American political cartoons of the late nineteenth century has provided scholars with a new medium for re-examining American and British attitudes towards the Irish.  It is important to note, however, that the variety of Irishmen depicted in political cartoons from the late nineteenth-century offer a more nuanced picture of Irish experiences during the period than can be found in the image of "Paddy" alone.  Furthermore, scholars have not paid similar attention to images produced by the Irish themselves.  This dissertation addresses the issue of the Irish image in cartoons by utilizing a transnational framework that compares images of the Irish produced by Anglo-Americans and Britons, with Irish images of themselves with a particular emphasis on the 1880s.  This decade was chosen for two specific reasons; not only was the Irish nationalist movement particularly vibrant during this decade, but it also was the decade in which Irishmen produced cartoons on a consistent basis.  This dissertation will show that the American Irish-produced cartoons concentrated on the theme of Irish nationalism, rather than addressing the prejudices of British and American cartoons or exploring the Irish experience in the United States, subjects one might expect they would address, given their prevalence in the mainstream press.  Additionally, this dissertation reaffirms the importance of the burgeoning scholarship associated with political cartoons and their value as a tool for historical analysis.  As the first in-depth study of Irish-American produced political cartoons in the 1880s, this dissertation opens up a variety of new avenues for scholarly investigation concerning the experiences of the American Irish in the nineteenth century.

Three essays on music, mimesis, and meaning
In this thesis, I will present essays centered on two recent projects of my own and one work by Edgard Varèse. In Future fantasy: identity, imagination and internet design I will explore the construction of a promotional web site that functions as an art object. I will also focus on the manipulation and creative organization of digital materials for public display within that website. In Nature musics of the West I will draw on selected philosophical and theoretical works from Horkheimer, Adorno, Derrida and Rousseau to develop a detailed conceptual framework for a small-scale musical play. In the final paper, I will analyze Varèse's Nocturnal, working towards a theoretical study of meaning in his work

Noise and meaning : a cognitive ethnography of San Diego musicians
A genre label of 'Noise Music' or 'Noise' has emerged over the last two decades and become an increasingly common descriptor for artists working at the fringes of various forms of rock and popular music. Yet in theorizing noise (in the theoretical sense) and Noise (a genre and culture), discourse has often been limited to those artists with strong ties to the Western Avant-Garde and its institutions, or at the very least, those who profess creative indebtedness to that tradition. Though this is true of many prominent Noise musicians, this framing can exclude or marginalize many of the rich details that constitute the aesthetic and personal identities of Noise culture. This paper will address the gap between existing academic Noise discourse and the experiences of musicians living in San Diego whose music, at times, may be considered Noise. Through interviews and observations of performances, I will provide an ethnographic account of these musicians, their work, and their communities as a means of grounding discussion in lived experience. After locating these musicians and their work within various cultural and aesthetic topographies, I will use observations about their creative practices and their descriptions thereof to theorize the significance of physical materials in meaning-making processes

The Outside Within: Literature of Colonial Hokkaido
This thesis examines how historical, social, and political factors influence the creation of literary space, focusing on representations of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido in modern Japanese literature. The works examined below are set in Hokkaido from the 1880s to the 1930s, and they all exhibit a certain ambiguous duality. This ambiguity derives from Hokkaido's dual position as an internal colony, simultaneously being both within sovereign borders and without as a colonial space. Given its status as an internal colony, however, the tension between naichi (mainland Japan) and Hokkaido gives rise to issues over national and ethnic authenticity.  These issues of authenticity and belonging are encoded spatially in the texts, and in the dialectical relationship between naichi and Hokkaido, Japanese "authenticity" itself is created, questioned, or reaffirmed. Because of its nature, these works make up the first corpus of colonial literature of Japan. After the "Introduction," the works of Kunikida Doppo (1871-1908), Arishima Takeo (1878-1923), Kobayashi Takiji (1903-1933), It&#333; Sei (1905-1969), and Honj&#333; Mutsuo (1905-1939) will be examined.

Site Insecurities: Thomas Hirschhorn's <italic>Skulptur-Sortier-Station</italic> (1997 and on)
This paper is a study of Skulptur-Sortier-Station (1997), a sculpture by the Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn (1957-), which was first realized for the third "Skulptur. Projekte in Münster," an international exhibition that takes place every ten years in Germany. Attending closely to the work's unique material qualities, the circumstances of its original realization, and the implications of its subsequent reiterations in other European cities, this paper argues that Skulptur-Sortier-Station proposes a new sculptural syntax by destabilizing received notions of the relation between object and site. The work's site condition is such that it engages (in order to ultimately reject) the modernist model of sculpture as autonomous and nomadic, as well as the postmodernist model of sculpture as site-specific and context-bound. Repeatedly dismantled and reconstructed in a potentially ongoing series of locations, Skulptur-Sortier-Station is a precarious physical structure that inhabits and produces a precarious spatial condition. I argue that this precariousness is in itself a contemporary sculptural value for Hirschhorn and is related to theories of "non-place," a new paradigm of contemporary space as decentered and transient.

[stereotype, master, work, tool, artist, visual]

Using the master's tools : representations of blackness and the strategies of stereotype
Attending to Audre Lorde's speech where she famously said, "For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house," this dissertation argues for the reformation of the master's tools and cites four plays and an oeuvre of visual art that speak to this radical re-envisioning. The playwrights Kia Corthron, Lynn Nottage, and Suzan-Lori Parks, and visual artist Kara Walker utilize the master's tools in order to expose the inadequate craftsmanship in the master's house. Here, the tools used by these women are stereotypes that American culture created in order to oppress African Americans : the historical stereotypes of Sambo, Mammy, Uncle Tom and contemporary stereotypes of the welfare queen and black criminal. As African American artists, these women deliberately deploy stereotypes in their work as a way to defuse their lingering power. These images have haunted America for centuries, and the artists' works surveyed here tap into collective memories that question how these memories may continue to haunt our future. The "dismantling" that occurs in the various artistic works varies in its aim and scope, and in this dissertation I track the particular devices used in conjunction with the artists' works to uncover the intentional and conscious intervention implicit in the plays and visual art. By looking at the work of Walker, Parks, Corthron, and Nottage, I would like to consider the possibilities for alternative narratives and ruptured stereotypes and discuss how stereotypes and representations of blackness can be recalled, reviewed, and re-envisioned

The Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989, A UCSC Student Oral History Documentary Projec
On October 17, 1989 at 5:04 p.m. a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault shook the Central Coast of California and lasted for fifteen seconds. The epicenter of the quake lay near Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, about ten miles northeast of the city of Santa Cruz, deep in the redwoods of Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. The focus point was at a depth of ten miles. This earthquake killed sixty-three people and injured 3,757 others, and caused an estimated six billion dollars in property damage. It was the largest earthquake to occur on the San Andreas fault since the great San Francisco earthquake in April 1906.
      While the national media covered the damage in the San Francisco Bay Area extensively, far less attention was paid to the effects of the earthquake in Santa Cruz County, where the earthquake was actually centered. In the city of Santa Cruz much of the downtown Pacific Garden Mall, composed of older brick structures located on unconsolidated river sediments, collapsed, killing three people and injuring others. Ten miles to the south in Watsonville, a largely Spanish-speaking city, buildings also crumbled and people were killed. In the Santa Cruz Mountains, landslides closed many roads including Highway 17, which traverses the rugged mountains between Santa Cruz and San Jose, and for several days traffic was allowed through only in escorted convoys.
      In the spring quarter of 1990 the Regional History Project sponsored a student internship class entitled, "An Interdisciplinary Oral History of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake". Randall Jarrell, who was the project's director for many years, was the instructor for the class, which was co-sponsored with UCSC faculty members John Dizikes in history and Conn Hallinan in journalism. Five students signed up for the course. They completed eleven oral history interviews.
      One of the interviews is with Barbara Garcia, who was director of Salud Para La Gente, a bilingual primary health care facility serving the greater Watsonville area. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, this community organization stepped in to address the enormous problems created by the lack of bilingual/bicultural volunteers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Red Cross. Diane Chang-Wilson interviewed eleven members of a fifth grade class at Rio del Mar School in Aptos. Chang-Wilson's oral histories provide candid reflections from children on how they felt and experienced the earthquake. Other interviews include Quinton Skinner, who was a UCSC student and an employee at Universes Records on the Pacific Garden Mall at the time of the quake; seventy-two year old Mayme Metcalf, who managed a small apartment complex in the Beach Flats area of Santa Cruz; Ramona Noriega, a UCSC re-entry student and mother of four children; and several narrators who had committed to a program of recovery from addiction to alcohol or other drugs when the earthquake happened. These oral histories illuminate the diverse subjectivity of this historical event in ways that are not captured in news photos and articles, and geological or engineering reports on structural damage.

Francesco Cangiullo e il "suo" Teatro della Sorpresa (1921)
Francesco Cangiullo e il suo  “Teatro della Sorpresa”  (1921)
      This article deals with Italian Futurist theater, and in particular with “Teatro della Sorpresa”, created in august 1921 by the Neapolitan poet Francesco Cangiullo (even though the final Manifesto was later signed also by Marinetti, in January 1922). It was Cangiullo's last contribution to his personal artistic research for Futurism, which he eventually abandoned in 1924, at the end of a long theatrical tour throughout Italy. The “Teatro della Sorpresa” is the ultimate peak reached by the Futurist theater research in general. This new theater is based on the incredible explosion of “Surprise” on stage, with the consequence of a revolutionary involvement of the audience. Such involvement was guaranteed by the contagious effect of laughter. This pattern of results is achieved by very short, synthetic and always unsettling texts. Not only: Cangiullo decided to use other strange and unexpected stratagems. For example: “Voice Orchestra” (musicians without instruments: the sounds of the different instruments were instead imitated by their voices), fake brawls in the hall, chairs covered with strong glue, selling of the same ticket to different spectators (to provoke chaos), etc.; all this to evoke the spontaneous laughter in audience. So the “Teatro della Sorpresa” can be considered a development and a joyful overrun of the previous “Teatro Futurista Sintetico” (1915). Moreover: for the first time in Futurist theater history, with this new experience Marinetti and Cangiullo were able to provide their “discovery” of a management structure and organizational order, creating a true theater company that was first called “Compagnia del Teatro della Sorpresa” (until 1923) and then “Nuovo Teatro Futurista” (in 1924). The company toured Italy (with fluctuating success) for more than 3 years.  Its first tour begun very soon, in 1921, only a few days after the company's birth. Marinetti just decided to start this new theatrical “adventure” from Naples, as a tribute to its “inventor” Cangiullo. In fact the tour started September 30th, 1921, at the “Mercadante” theater in Naples. The last part of this article is devoted to a precise and detailed reconstruction of this unknown event, with many quotations taken by personal memories of the protagonists and by the still unknown testimony and comments of the newspapers and magazines reviewers who witnessed this event.

Neoconcretism and the making of Brazilian national culture, 1954-1961
In the 1950s Brazil experienced transformative changes including the nascent emergence of democratic elections after 15 years of repressive dictatorship, the suicide of its President and the construction of a new federal capital city in Brasília. Optimism and a forward-looking spirit, summarized in the 1956 Presidential motto, "50 years of progress in 5," suffused all spheres of the national experience. The modernization of Brazil would translate into the end of underdevelopment and a structure of dependency put in place with colonialism. My dissertation explores this historical moment through the Rio de Janeiro-based geometric abstract art movement, Neoconcretism. I study how this group of artists intersected with and contributed to the growing network of modernizing institutions that held the promise of a Brazil finally "catching up." Influenced by early twentieth century European avant-garde art styles, Neoconcrete art brought together an art practice and theory based in expressiveness, intersubjectivity and sensorial experience, which continues to influence contemporary Latin American art production today. In this project I argue that Neoconcretism was a transformative cultural force that shaped Brazilian modernism and national culture. Neoconcrete artists and aesthetic ideals contributed to many areas of national production including literature, the newspaper industry, education, and architecture and urbanism. Departing from scholarship that examines Neoconcretism within the internationalization of Latin American art, I am especially attentive to the influence of local discourses on its stylistic and intellectual formation. Given the group's collaborative nature, I use an interdisciplinary and cultural studies methodology to examine the artworks and writings of the group members in relationship to the national project of modernization and nation-building developed by the governmental sectors, private institutions and the intellectual and cultural classes. My dissertation underscores the way culture operated as an essential political tool, distinct from traditional genres such as propaganda, in the production of the "national". The collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of the Neoconcretists structures the organization of the dissertation and each chapter is conceived as a dialogical relationship between members of the group and Brazilian society. Chapter one establishes the broader Brazilian concrete project, and positions the emergence of abstract art in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as directly tied to the developing political and social climate proposing the construction of a "new" Brazil. In chapter two I argue for the equally generative roles of word and image in the production of meaning in Neoconcretism through an analysis of Neoconcrete poetry and the two main theoretical texts that defined Neoconcretism. I demonstrate how the movement was marked by positions of anti-progress and anti-rationalism that challenged the dominant political ideology. Chapter three turns to the Brazilian newspaper, Jornal do Brasil, which served as a place of employment for Neoconcrete artists, as well as a place of publication and circulation of Neoconcrete artworks and writings. I argue for the paper's generative role as a site of publicity for the group and its significance as a place of translation between high art and popular culture. Chapter four puts Neoconcretism and the construction of Brasília into direct engagement to argue for the influence of the national architectural boom on the artistic production of the Neoconcrete artists, but also to demonstrate how their works performed a critique of the state-sponsored project of modernization. In the dissertation I argue that the study of Neoconcretism unsettles any single narrative of Brazilian modernism and provides a lens to re-evaluate Brazil's "Years of Confidence" and the making of the nation through industrialization

Betraying the Island. Identidad puertorriqueña y subalternidad en No quiero quedarme sola y vacía.
The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of Puerto Rican identity in No quiero quedarme sola y vacía (2006), by Ángel Lozada. Significantly disregarded by most Puerto Rican critics, this novel deals with the seemingly impossible task of constructing a subjective and cultural identity from the perspective of a homosexual Puerto Rican exiled in the United States - something that is reflected in the “pastiche” character of both the novel, its mutating narrator and its hybrid language. But the novel actually goes beyond that. Rejecting any kind of “political correctness”, Ángel Lozada constructs a narrator who, despite his double “subaltern” condition, disrupts any discourse that could eventually question the basis of his own “subalternity”. Instead, he attempts to “assimilate” himself within the “dominant” culture. Indeed, rejecting his Puerto Rican origins - in great part, due to the homophobia he felt on the island -, all the while sustaining a superficial nationalism, the narrator of this novel paradoxically reproduces the same homophobic logic when referring to other “subalterns”, namely citizens of other Caribbean nations. By analyzing the ambiguous relationship the novel’s narrator sustains with his homeland I show not only how he denounces the contradictions implied by any effort to establish a Puerto Rican identity, especially from a homosexual perspective, but that he can actually be seen as a traitor, someone who is, at the same time, in and out his own group and culture.

Unity and variety : a study of the Chinese language and its cultural implications
Unity and Variety is a study of the relationship between language and culture in pre-modern China. Language here is understood as both speech and writing. In fact, the written form of Classical Chinese is the focus of the current project. The dissertation argues that there is a clear affinity between the Chinese language and diverse cultural expressions, including philosophy, literature, particular ways of theorization, historiography, etc. The Chinese written character and its consequences on the grammatical level have far-reaching influences on the perceptual modes and expressive strategies of ancient Chinese people. Therefore, an adequate understanding of the language, including the writing system, is essential for the proper understanding the culture. "Unity and Variety" in the title means through the single most essential feature of the language we may find the key to understanding a variety of cultural issues. The key I identify in this dissertation is xiang, or image, an idea systematically introduced in I Ching, the Book of Changes, and later embodied in the Chinese writing system. The dissertation is divided into four chapters. Chapter One, "Introduction," propounds the thesis of the dissertation, defines key terms in the title, and discusses the scope, methodology, structure, and possible contributions of the dissertation. Chapter Two, titled "Xiang, Chinese Character, and Imaged Thought in Chinese Literature and Culture," is a systematic investigation of the idea of xiang, or image, its embodiment in the Chinese writing system, and its manifestations in various domains of Chinese culture. Chapter Three, titled "Syntax and Chinese Historiography: Reconsidering the Form of Shiji, annals- biography, based on linguistic analyses. Chapter Four "Conclusion" summarizes the main points of the dissertation and points to possible directions for future research

Energetic excess : the visual structure of movement in early Italian futurism, 1910-1915
In the early work and theory of the Italian futurists, physical motion constituted a modern and modernizing condition that informed their visual ideas and signaled a new mode of subjectivity associated with mass, urban collectivity. In particular, energetic discharge served as both a central visual analogy and as a conceptual framework for representing social and cultural renewal. Using a range of methodologies including visual and textual analysis, historicism, intellectual and cultural histories, and interdisciplinary comparison, one of the leading revisionisms of this research in an attempt to re- adjudicate both the nature and the critical centrality of the machine metaphor as an interpretational key to the first phases of futurism. In contrast to contemporaneous images of motion based on precise linear progressions or mechanical sequences, early futurist visual works employed various strategies often centered on the complex interaction among internal and external forces generated in that through the human body to indicate psychic, physical, and social processes. Physical exertion, for example, came to signify mobility across a wide spectrum of literal and abstract connotations. Although mechanical reproduction influenced their approaches, artists such as Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Anton Giulio and Arturo Bragaglia, and Carlo Carrà responded with nonmechanical imagery that was formally and conceptually rooted in action, agitation, and sensorial intensity--that is, in psychophysical and social automatism. The seven chapters address specific motifs, media, and contexts that shaped these ideas, including futurist crowd imagery, futurist photography, mechanomorphic imagery, the convergence of early futurism and early Italian cinema, futurist sculpture (especially Boccioni's Unique Forms of Continuity in Space), and avant-garde theories of color. Instead of simply demonstrating mechanical, linear, or chronological sequences in their imagery, many of their most inventive and convincing works represent immaterial forces manifesting in material forms and associated with the feeling anticipation, in which the future seems to unfold in the temporal present

The antecedents of Taiwan new cinema : the state of Taiwan film in the 1960s and 1970s
In many ways there could not be a more fascinating method to investigate how Taiwan's Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang, KMT) Government defined itself as the representative government of all of China in the 1960s and 1970s than to consider its state-sanctioned film industry. The films produced by the state represent ideas of national unity and a glorious "homeland" during decades that witnessed the most intense of transformations : in film with the rise and eventual decline of the popularity of Taiwan cinema in Southeast Asia, in literature with the xiangtu (nativist literature) debates, in the economy as factories and the emergence of small business replaced an agricultural infrastructure, and in politics with the end of the Nationalist's international status after losing its seat in the United Nations in 1971. At each stage the state propagated its ideal of "free China" for all to see on the silver screen -- an ideal made all the more complicated by competing regional and cultural influences : from the west by the People's Republic of China, from the north by the heritage of Japanese colonialism, from the east by the United States of America's concurrent military and economic aid, and from the south where a vast capitalist market was governed by lines drawn during the Cold War. Thus, situating these multiple discourses involves both a historical analysis, that is to bring the material and historical moment to light, and a cultural analysis, that is to consider how it is that the state believed images produced in a pop-medium might bolster a government's political status as its films competed on the open market. This dissertation both excavates the socio- historical context of Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s in part by way of on site research in Taiwan thanks to the Ministry of Education (Taiwan, R.O.C.) "Talent Cultivation Project of Taiwanese Literature, History and Art in Globalization" Grant, and it pays close attention to the cinematic form using the lens of cultural studies. All the while it remains focused on the primary motivation for this project : a curiosity to explore a blank space on the map of English language scholarship concerning Mandarin language Taiwan cinema

Memory and power : reflections on history, memory, and Auschwitz in contemporary art and film
This project aims to explore the connection between history, memory, political power, and visual art. It aims to contribute insight to how contemporary visual artists, like the filmmaker Jean Luc Godard, and the installation artist Christian Boltanski, confront politics through the reformation of collective memory. In their case the memory and history that they evoke are connected to Second War World and the Holocaust. In a very schematic way I will try to describe their role as a provider of a sight; a sight of the political struggle. I structured our investigation of Boltanski and Godard's works around three general questions on art, history and power. These questions provided a point of departure for my exploration, and helped with the formation of my arguments. At first, I tried to understand the presence of history in both Boltanski's and Godard's works. As I explained in this project, their motivations come from different reasons and events. Above all, as I have presented in this project, these artists use history in order to understand the conditions of the present moment. Therefore, I will argue that both Boltanski and Godard are historians of the present. Secondly, it was important for me to understand their specific use of the Holocaust and Auschwitz in their works. Here we notice how this event is perceived, as a reflection of social structures, and our understanding of the way power operates has grown accordingly. In this respect, Boltanski and Godard's works fall, both directly and indirectly, under the theoretical framework formulated by Michel Foucault, Adi Ophir, and Giorgio Agamben. The third question relates specifically to the art world and art practice, focusing on the attempt to expose how artistic methods and technique function as apparatuses of power. In other words, I wanted to understand and expose how power suffuses art through artistic practices.

Mary Lea Shane: The Lick Observatory
Dr. Shane was an astronomer, historian, and wife of the former Director of the Lick Observatory. Her association with the Lick Observatory began in 1919, when she moved up to Mount Hamilton for a year's postgraduate work, work which eventually resulted in her Ph.D. thesis. The first section of her manuscript is concerned with the workings of the Observatory in the 1919 period-- the apparatus, the astronomers, the duties of the graduate assistants-- as well as the more mundane subjects such as food, lodging, water supply, and health care. Since Dr. Shane had for years been the Observatory's unofficial historian-in-residence, she and the interviewer took an all-day trip to Mount Hamilton. The resulting eighty pages of manuscript, which form the middle portion of the volume, focus on the history of the Mount Hamilton road and development of the various telescopes. Dr. Shane also comments on a number of astronomers and observatories throughout the world. In the final portion of the volume, Dr. Shane describes the administrative and technical problems her husband, Dr. Donald Shane, faced as Director of the Observatory from 1945-1958, as well as amusing anecdotes of everyday life on the mountain.

A Specter of Surfaces: Modernism and the Decorative in Edouard Vuillard's Large Interior with Six Figures
This thesis examines the function of the decorative in Edouard Vuillard's 1897 painting <italic>Large Interior with Six Figures</italic>. Departing from previous scholarship, which positions the <italic>Large Interior</italic> as the fulcrum of Vuillard's earlier intimist paintings and his later bourgeois genre scenes, I argue that the <italic>Large Interior</italic> exacerbated his experiments with the depiction of decorated interiors and the subjects who inhabit them. The use of the decorative in the <italic>Large Interior</italic> shows space itself to be the consequence of a subject's relationship to interiors--her own interior, and the interior in which she finds herself. This thesis situates Vuillard's insight within the historical context of decoration's heightened literal, pictorial and metaphorical significance in fin-de-siècle France, from the chauvinist agenda for the French decorative arts to the alignment of decorated interiors with new psychological theories and corresponding conceptions of selfhood. Through a close analysis of the <italic>Large Interior</italic> as well as other paintings from Vuillard's early oeuvre, I suggest that Vuillard's 1897 painting deploys the decorative to generate a space with equally radical consequences for painting and for subjectivity. Only such a strong characterization of decoration could possibly merit the role it would perform for modernism: the great "decorative threat," supposedly vanquished by cubism and yet plaguing painting for decades to follow. Decoration remained for Clement Greenberg the menace that must be used against itself for art to prevail over contemptible elements--not just commodity culture and kitsch, but everything domestic, feminine, and excessive associated with decoration. If, as Peter Wollens has written, the decorative is modernism's symptomatic shadow, understanding its role in modernist aesthetics and ideology demands that we develop a rigorous concept of it. In doing so, this thesis interrogates what has been repressed by the marginalization of the decorative, and why. In a final section, it traces the reemergence of the decorative in Picasso's 1914 collage and sculpture to suggest some conclusions to this end, and to attest to the radical relevance of Symbolism and the decorative for the history of modernism.

Harold A. Hyde: Recollections of Santa Cruz County
A fifth-generation Santa Cruz County resident, Hyde has been in on the creation of organizations and institutions ranging from UCSC and Cabrillo College to the Community Foundation and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. His contributions to California and Santa Cruz are documented in his oral history.
      Following infantry combat service with the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II and graduate studies in business at Harvard, Hyde returned to Santa Cruz County and a career at Ford's Department Store. By the late 1950s he was chairing a committee to promote a local bond issue for higher education, had been elected to Cabrillo College's first board of trustees, and was also on a local committee helping the University of California select a Central Coast location for a new campus. All this was in addition to his position as merchandising manager of Ford's.
      After the UC Regents selected the Cowell property for their next campus and named Dean McHenry founding chancellor, McHenry approached Hyde and offered him the job as vice chancellor of business and finance. Hyde was responsible for the start-up of all nonacademic aspects of the new campus.
      Central to Hyde's work was overseeing creation of UCSC's infrastructure, including construction of the first colleges, residence halls, and administrative buildings, and the siting of campus roads. He also hired key staff. Hyde held the vice chancellor position from 1964 to 1975, a period in which the campus grew from no students and some decaying ranch buildings to an enrollment of 5,600 students with modern classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, playing fields, performing arts theaters, and administrative buildings, including those for the Lick Observatory.
      Hyde's commitment to UCSC continued after he returned to retailing in 1975. He was a founding member of two groups supporting UCSC, serving as the first president of the Arboretum Associates and a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.

Integration of Molecular Networks in the Shoot Apical Meristem that Controls Floral Specification in Arabidopsis thaliana
Post-embryonic development in plants derives from the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM). The floral transition is a major developmental phase change that transforms the identity of SAM from vegetative to inflorescence. The transition from juvenile to adult vegetative phase is regulated by miRNA156 (miR156) and miRNA172 (miR172). In Arabidopsis, the endogenous flowering time pathway is mediated by miR156 and a subset of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes including SPL3, SPL4 and SPL5. During shoot development, a subset of SPLs is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR156. The miR156/SPLs module functions to specify floral meristem identity by activating floral integrators and floral meristem identity genes including APETELLA1 (AP1). The universal florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) promotes floral induction by activating, in part, SPL3, SPL4 and SPL5. In turn, SPLs act in parallel with FT to promote floral meristem identity. Two related BELL1-like homeobox genes, PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF), which are expressed in the SAM, are required for floral specification. Previous genetic studies indicate that the floral specification function of FT depends upon PNY and PNF. However, the relationship between these homeodomain proteins and miR156/SPLs is not known. Results from this study indicate that the photoperiodic floral induction of SPL3, SPL4 and SPL5 is dependent upon PNY and PNF. Moreover, the levels of miR156 fail to decline in pny pnf apices under floral inductive conditions. Therefore, PNY and PNF appear to regulate levels of miR156 during reproductive development. In addition, PNY and PNF control SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 expression by negatively regulating miR156. Furthermore, results demonstrate that ectopic expression of miR156 resistant SPL4 partially restores reproductive development in pny pnf plants whereas SPL3 and SPL5 failed to promote floral specification. This suggests that the function of SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5 is dependent upon PNY and PNF as well as expression of multiple SPLs is required for completing floral specification in pny pnf plants. Lastly, GA application activates SOC1 and AGL24 in pny pnf plants but failed to promote flower formation. Therefore, PNY and PNF acts downstream of GA signaling pathway and SOC1 and AGL24 are dependent upon PNY and PNF for flower specification.

"Measures Meet for Every Sort" : the social dynamics of late-Elizabethan genre
"Measures Meet for Every Sort" explores how genre shaped and was shaped by the discursive and material constructions of social status in late-Elizabethan England. While genre can be narrowly defined as a set of literary models that writers inherit from the past, my work asserts that generic meaning is also informed by writers' and audiences' extra-literary modes of knowledge. Chapter One explores Elizabethans' understanding of genre as socially positioned. Chapter Two shows how Book VI of Spenser's Faerie Queene reconfigures the genres in which Elizabeth's court conventionally represented nobility-- pastoral and chivalric romance--by foregrounding a georgic vision of courtesy. Chapter Three turns to the work of Thomas Nashe. Nashe merges elite and non-elite genres in the Unfortunate Traveler to create a witty, marginalized protagonist who appeals to yet advertises Nashe's independence from both humanist and popular audiences. Chapter Four focuses on Shakespeare's use of broadside ballads to depict Ophelia's madness. Exploiting the ballad's "lowness," Shakespeare encourages spectators to interpret Ophelia's madness as a critique of the Danish court

Papertown: The Image of Naples and the Foundation of Poetry in Boccaccio’s Early Works
This short essay deals with the literary treatment of the site and image of Naples in Giovanni Boccaccio’s early works. The idealized construction of the city as an area where life is peaceful according to the rules of courtesy is part of a cultural strategy the young writer conceives in order to authorize himself. Just as Virgil found in ancient Partenope his tomb, just as the poet Ovid is associated with Sulmona, and Petrarch with Arquà, Boccaccio presents Neapolitan landscape and topography as the framework for his personal (auto-)portrait as a literary author.

Remembering Modernity: Technics of Temporal Memory in Twentieth-Century Literature and Film
My dissertation explores the notion that human memory is technical, prosthetic, and has been connected throughout history to writing. This thesis, when applied to modernist criticism, suggests several important questions: since modernist art, both literary and visual, often seeks a greater fidelity to its own contemporary condition, can an entire age be contemporary to itself? If traditional memory is eradicated by modernism, what takes its place? How can we remember modernity? To answer these questions, I develop a culturally-specific reading of the technics of modern memory. While the dissertation, on the one hand, continues the long-standing tradition of interpreting the cultures of modernity and contemporaneity through technology, it offers a new critical and theoretical matrix that departs from this tradition in significant ways. Ultimately, I argue that the changing philosophical conception of technics must be central to the project of analyzing twentieth-century literature and film, focusing on a series of modernist and postmodernist texts that engage in this process of refiguring memory and subjectivity through writing. Because my framework depends on the conception of technical development as a production-related global phenomenon, I analyze concurrent Eastern European modernisms as well. Also, since the very idea of radical mnemonic reevaluation suggests a disruption of conventionalized epochality, each chapter presents a nonlinear argument, often connecting works from different periods. Additionally, to account for the importance of technics for this project, chapters include intermedia analyses, or discussions of alternative textual forms.The dissertation consists of five chapters. The first, a general introduction, explores the theoretical and philosophical groundwork outlined above to position the cultural production of modernity within a larger technological history of the human. The second focuses on modernist texts that engage in the process of refiguring memory and subjectivity through writing. The third examines performative memory and its relationship to the prosthetic body, while the fourth concentrates on textual memory following the rise of cybernetics. Finally, the fifth chapter examines film, continuing the comparative study of works from the West and the former Eastern Bloc to trace the differences in their treatment of memory attributable to each culture's relationship to technical production.

Towards grammaticality and fluency : characterizing and correcting ESL errors using dictionary random walks and other means
We present two novel classes of noisy channel models to address verb infinitive/present participle confusion and word choice production errors in text produced by English as a second language (ESL) authors in an extension of Park and Levy (2011). In our word choice model, which is the primary contribution of this work, we model the English word choices made by ESL authors as a random walk across an undirected bipartite dictionary graph composed of edges between English words and associated words in the author's native language. We use cascades of weighted finite-state transducers (wFSTs) to model language model priors, verb form confusion and random walk-induced noise, and observed sentences, and expectation maximization (EM) to learn model parameters. Additionally, we explore the use of online EM for model training. We show that such models can make intelligent verb form and dictionary-based word substitutions to improve grammaticality and fluency in an unsupervised setting

The relocation of Butler to the north side of Indianapolis left the community without its “town and gown” feeling of which it boasted. In 1938, after a decade of planning and waiting for funds, Thomas Carr Howe High School was built on the western edge of Irvington. The use of WPA funding made the construction possible. Carr had been president of Butler 1908-1920. By the 1940s, Howe was fulfilling the role that Butler had once played; it became the common thread for many in the neighborhood.

Rock Art in the Public Trust: Managing Prehistoric Rock Art on Federal Land
Cultural resource management conducted by the United States government revolves around the concept of proper stewardship of the land and the resources contained therein.  By definition, stewardship means to take proper management for the good of the items entrusted.  Practically, however, stewardship is a set of cultural resource management practices that seeks to manage the cultural resources that fall within the bounds of federally-managed lands, consistent with the perceived needs and desires of the public at large.  Rock art is a unique and valuable resource that can and should be inventoried, recorded, protected, researched, and used to educate the public on the past lifeways of native peoples who occupied the United States in the pre-contact era.  While the federal government has had some success in rock art management programs on public lands, for the most part federal land managers have historically disenfranchised Native Americans by minimizing their input into management practices of archeological resources, including rock art.   This dissertation analyzes the salient aspects of managing rock art sites on federally-administered land, and argues for a more comprehensive, inclusive, and effective management strategy that is inclusive of Native Americans.  For effective rock art site management, historians, archeologists, and land managers must focus on three main goals in management strategy: more actively and effectively incorporating Native Americans in the management process, taking a multidisciplinary approach to site management that incorporates concepts of landscape and cultural heritage principles, and maximizing the potential for rock art sites as an educational tool to teach about Native American lifeways, practices, and philosophies.

Giambattista Della Porta's Histrionic Science
One of the lifelong concerns of Giambattista Della Porta (1535-1615) was the description and the production of seemingly extraordinary and hence inexplicable experiments that would testify to his amazing abilities as a natural magician. But this Neapolitan nobleman was not only one of the most renowned "professors of secrets“ in his time, he was also the author of highly influential books on physiognomy and exercised his literary gifts in more than a dozen successful works for the theater. This paper looks into several instances where Della Porta managed the contemporary political and religious situation in order to stage his natural philosophy, thus pointing to specific examples where both the realms of theater and early modern science interacted on a literary as well as on a conceptual level. The paper relates Della Porta's  writings to his ideal of a silent audience that watched mirabilia with amazement and delight.

Exhuming caliban : gothic and madness in late twentieth and twenty-first - century Caribbean literary fictions
Exhuming Caliban: Gothic and Madness in Late Twentieth and Twenty-First - Century Caribbean Literary Fictions identifies a late twentieth and twenty-first - century (1980-2007) creative literary trend that is characterized by applications of quasi-gothic and traditional gothic literary conventions and features in Caribbean fictions, and extensively investigates the historical, cultural and literary origins of each contributing aspect of this phenomenon. This dissertation analyzes the interactive relationship between knowledge and discourse and its discursive power in the formation of representation processes. I, then, trace the historical origins and literary genealogies of gothic literature to mark the cultural and discursive connections between Western European and Caribbean literatures. In addition to this literary genealogy, I present a psychoanalytical analysis that configures a psychological profile to explain an overarching thematic emphasis on madness in gothic literature. I examine the Western European historical and cultural preoccupation with madness and its diagnoses, a trend that influenced the formations of many late medieval, early modern and modern Western European social norms, cultural systems, political institutions, philosophical notions, ideological principles and literary production. It is within the context of Europe's sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth - centuries' development of a "cultural madness" that I connect Western European literature and gothic literary conventions to the development of Caribbean literature. I illustrate how this concept of madness permeated the discursive process that constructed the Caribbean region and its inhabitants within preconceptions formed by the Western European Imaginary. I, then, illustrate how Caribbean manifestations of Western European "culture of madness" have been internalized by generations of Caribbean inhabitants and show how these conventions and features function to reveal the hidden, unspoken unspeakable in late twentieth and twenty-first - century Caribbean literary works. I contend that this literary trend allows Caribbean writers to rewrite Caribbean subjectivities on their own terms, negating those constructed by the European Imaginary, and to address the general invisibility that shrouds the region and its peoples in the midst of global neocolonial indifference and exploitation

Advertising Stigmatas: The Evolution of Advertising in American Poetic Culture
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONAdvertising Stigmatas: The Evolution of Advertising in American Poetic CulturebyElizabeth Jean Spies     In my dissertation, I outline the ways that technological developments in twentieth century advertising have infiltrated, altered, and affected American Poetics.  Beginning in late nineteenth century, I discuss the expansion and maturation of twentieth century advertising and marketing techniques and how poetry fashioned new techniques of appropriating such advertising advancements within their critical discourse. Through the interweaving of historical turning points, technological developments, and the rhetorically motivated appropriation of advertising techniques, I show how the modernist poets, the Cold War poets Sylvia Plath, Allen Ginsberg, and postmodern poet Amy Gerstler develop new doctrine within semantic and cognitive poetics which in turn affect a new understanding of twentieth century aesthetics. 	In the first chapter, "Advertising Stigmatas: The Evolution of Advertising in 20th Century Poetry," I examine how the modernist poets incorporated advertising through the appropriation of war advertising, through the development of multi-medium collage poetry, and through avant garde marketing strategies.  In chapter 2, I discuss Sylvia Plath's internalization of suburban culture as she peppers her poetic work with advertisements for household products and even suburban architecture as a national symbol of cold war domestic politics. In chapter 3, I begin with the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, whose promotion of marginalized figures began through the re-use and de-coding of mainstream advertising. Called "subvertising," Ginsberg's poetics engendered a new aesthetics with which to market his own poetic celebrity. And lastly, through the postmodern poetry of Amy Gerstler, I discuss poetry in terms of traditional semantic understandings of mainstream media exposes cognitive pattern creation, social stereotyping, ad imagery and popular semantic stimuli within popular advertising.   	In the broader sense, each of the aforementioned poets admit a dimension of complicity within a mainstream advertising system, either in their use of advertising imagery or through their employment of marketing strategies to publicize their poetic images. However, at its very core, poetry and aesthetics have been embedded with how we perceive and cognitively translate our individual sensory perceptions, our emotional milieu, and our contemporaneous intellectual forum.  If poetic aesthetics can be understood as a perceptual, critical reflection on culture, nature and philosophy, my work shows that in the field of mass advertising culture, cognitive studies and poetics there lies dormant a new, unacknowledged social standard of beauty.

Double Negatives, Present Absences and Other No-Nos: Dialogic Community Action in Ana Castillo’s So Far From God
Ana Castillo's So Far From God works to reconcile a multiplicity of civic and cultural institutions that compete for prominence in the American Southwest, a region marked by diverse social and linguistic practices. Amerindian and Chicano cultures, for example, confront their marginalization amidst mainstream economic orders, competing religious dogmas and models of civic government.  The resulting intercultural synthesis—endemic to the physical and psychological regions Gloria Anzaldúa defines as “the Borderlands”—surfaces in the narrator’s language, which marks her as a non-native speaker of so-called Standard American English. Abundant double negatives and other quirks in her speech conform to conventional Spanish constructions; as such, they give voice to ambiguous, doubly-spoken utterances that can be instructively analyzed in terms of Mikhail Bakhtin’s account of dialogic discourse. As we will see, such linguistic complexity harbors an empowering capacity to engage lived experience by renaming it; wielded effectively, it may usefully contest and revise conventional patriarchal and socio-economic paradigms that would otherwise restrict human agency. Characters may employ dialogic discourse to speak new realities, in a sense. This reality-making—the naming of that which was formerly inexpressible—finds powerful activation in the narrator’s unique sensibility, the arrival, perhaps, of “a new mestiza consciousness” that Anzaldúa announces in her work (77).  In So Far From God, mourning mother and activist Sofi follows the narrator’s model to rise as la mayor. In this role, her dialogically expressed mestiza consciousness uses cross-language complexity to subvert the powerful systems that have conditioned Tome’s poverty and dysfunction. Meanwhile, Sofi’s daughter, la Fe, fails to successfully voice such a challenge and finds herself relegated to a position of impotent exclusion.

Rita Bottoms: Polyartist Librarian
Project Director Irene Reti conducted fourteen hours of interviews with Rita Bottoms, Head of Special Collections at the University Library, UC Santa Cruz, shortly before her retirement in March 2003. This oral history provides a vivid and intimate look at thirty-seven years behind the scenes in the library's Special Collections.
      For thirty-seven years Bottoms dedicated herself to collecting work by some of the most eminent writers and photographers of the twentieth century, including the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein, photographer Edward Weston, composer John Cage, visual poet Kenneth Patchen, poet and letterpress book printer William Everson, poet and visual artist Lawrence Ferlinghetti, composer and poet Lou Harrison, singer and photographer Graham Nash, and philosopher Norman O. Brown. But her role as a curator and librarian extended far beyond acquiring collections; she developed intense and profound intellectual and emotional relationships with each of these individuals. It is her detailed and deeply personal stories of these relationships which form the heart of this volume, and provide the kind of human amplification of the library's collections which can only be captured through oral history. Bottoms' recollections of these individuals are an important contribution to the history of twentieth century art and literature in the United States.

Dwelling in Dreams: A Comparative Study of Dream of the Red Chamber and Finnegans Wake
Both the Chinese novel The Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou meng) and James Joyce's masterpiece Finnegans Wake are dream fictions in that they employ dreams as both their frameworks and subject matters. While Finnegans Wake is a fictional representation of its assumed dreamer's dream during one night, Dream of the Red Chamber portrays its protagonist's life as a dream in the metaphorical sense. The two works share a predominant interest in probing and representing, through dreams and literary devices, the often elusive workings of the human psyche. This dissertation investigates the psychic mechanisms in terms of how they contribute to the issue of subjectivity formation. The theoretical approach employed is psychoanalytical theories, especially Sigmund Freud's dream theories and Jacques Lacan's concepts of the mirror stage, the symbolic order, and the gaze. Freud's theorization of the dream language as an arena where the unconscious struggles against the conscious to express itself is also applicable to poetic devices. This dissertation argues that the subject's enthrallment to the Other's approving gaze is paradoxically both a necessary and a fictitious means of self-confirmation. The first two chapters on Dream of the Red Chamber apply the principles of the dream work to literary devices as well as dreams to map out its protagonist Jia Baoyu's psychic dynamics. Jia Baoyu's behavior can be traced back to the psychic trauma inflicted on him by the Great Mother and explore the issue of (mis)recognition by the (m)other. The following two chapters on Finnegans Wake study the dreamer's desires and anxieties related to his precarious status as the patriarch of his family. In both narratives, the subject is brought into being, or the drama of the dream is set into motion, by (the subject's response to) the Other's gaze. Both narratives also show that the other's gaze, which the subject desires and depends on for an image of wholeness and power, is imaginary.

More like this : machine learning approaches to music similarity
The rise of digital music distribution has provided users with unprecedented access to vast song catalogs. In order to help users cope with large collections, music information retrieval systems have been developed to automatically analyze, index, and recommend music based on a user's preferences or search criteria. This dissertation proposes machine learning approaches to content-based, query-by-example search, and investigates applications in music information retrieval. The proposed methods automatically infer and optimize content-based similarity, fuse heterogeneous feature modalities, efficiently index and search under the optimized distance metric, and finally, generate sequential playlists for a specified context or style. Robust evaluation procedures are proposed to counteract issues of subjectivity and lack of explicit ground truth in music similarity and playlist generation

Factors associated with presenting >12 hours after symptom onset of acute myocardial infarction among Veteran men
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Approximately 2/3 of Veterans admitting to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities present &gt;12&#8201;hours after symptom onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (&#8220;late presenters&#8221;). Veterans admitted to VHA facilities with AMI may delay hospital presentation for different reasons compared to their general population counter parts. Despite the large descriptive literature on factors associated with delayed presentation in the general population, the literature describing these factors among the Veteran AMI population is limited. The purpose of this analysis is to identify predictors of late presentation in the Veteran population presenting with AMI to VHA facilities. Identifying predictors will help inform and target interventions for Veterans at a high risk of late presentation.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					In our cross-sectional study, we analyzed a cohort of 335 male Veterans from nine VHA facilities with physician diagnosed AMI between April 2005 and December 2006. We compared demographics, presentation characteristics, medical history, perceptions of health, and access to health care between early and late presenting Veterans. We used standard descriptive statistics for bivariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of late presentation.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Our cohort was an average of 64&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10&#8201;years old and was 88% white. Sixty-eight percent of our cohort were late presenters. Bivariate comparisons found that fewer late presenters had attended at least some college or vocational school (late 53% vs. early 66%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that presentation with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was associated with early presentation (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.4 95%CI 0.2, 0.9) and &#8805;2 angina episodes in the prior 24&#8201;hours (versus 0-1 episode) was associated with late presentation (OR&#8201;=&#8201;7.5 95%CI 3.6,15.6).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					A significant majority of Veterans presenting to VHA facilities with AMI were late presenters. We found few differences between early and late presenters. Having a STEMI was independently associated with early presentation and reporting &#8805;2 angina episodes in the 24&#8201;hours prior to hospital admission was independently associated with late presentation. These independent predictors of early and late presentation are similar to what has been reported for the general population. Despite these similarities to the general population, there may be untapped opportunities for patient education within the VHA to decrease late presentation.

Everyday Imaginings Under the Lion Rock: An Analysis of Identity Formation in Hong Kong
This dissertation examines the ways in which Hong Kong identity is discursively constructed through banal everyday instances, which do not, on their face, speak to issues of political identity. Fifteen years after Hong Kong's change in sovereignty, the embracing and acceptance of a Hong Kong identity is at an all time high. Despite efforts by Beijing and the Hong Kong government to increase cooperation and integration with Mainland China, Hong Kongers are increasingly distinguishing themselves from the Chinese nation. Typical explanations for such divisions focus on issues such as universal suffrage, school curricula, and press freedom. In contrast, this study demonstrates that divisions in identity can also be seen in (1) the politics, practices, and discourses of the Hong Kong-Mainland China border; (2) discussions on redevelopment and heritage preservation; and (3) the commodification of nostalgic everyday items such as toys, clothing, and household goods. While not a nation per se, this dissertation finds that Hong Kong's strong place-based identity shares many similarities with conceptions of nationalism and national identities, and exhibits what I refer to as "near-nationalism." Similar to many other nations, a founding myth is central to understanding the context of Hong Kong identity. This dissertation demonstrates how what was a colonial myth about Hong Kong's founding and development entrenched in the colonial power's ideology became decolonized, localized and embodied by Hong Kongers. The new formulation of the myth emphasizes the work ethic, go-getting spirit and upward mobility of a displaced community of immigrants coming together under hardships to build a global city. The ideological aspects of globalization and neoliberalism make up the core of this myth and, by way of that, Hong Kongers' self-understanding. The paradox is that despite increasing similarities between Mainland Chinese cities and Hong Kong, the myth remains an integral part of the everyday debates and heightened political moments in which Hong Kongers distance themselves from Mainland China.

Musings on the Ruptures: Examining the Circulations of Chinese Modern Dance in the U.S.
This thesis addresses (inter-)cultural ruptures in perceiving Chinese modern dance. I examine how the history of representing Chinese-ness on American stages, U.S. mainstream rhetoric about the inception of modern dance, as well as U.S. Orientalist constructions about Chinese opera/ China's ethnicity and Asian American exploitations of such have affected the reception of Chinese modern dance today. I further illustrate by reading particular Chinese modern works as circulated in the U.S. culture, including those by companies that tour in the U.S., in particular, the Beijing Dance/ LDTX Modern Dance Company, and one piece by a Chinese choreographer based in the U.S.--Shen Wei. I focus on the structures of the gaze and the position of the audience by comparing my readings with those of several mainstream reviewers as the works circulated in the U.S..       The thesis formulates two central issues encompassing my research project --the Chinese modern dancing body as agent as well as the mobilization of its "immobile audience." I attempt to theorize how, on the one hand, an exclusively kinesthetic mode (or "muted" speech) helps negotiate political visibility in China for most Chinese dancing moderns, and how, on the other, rehabilitating the dancer's voice on stage can to some extent theorize the Chinese dancing body as complex agent. By means of the endeavors envisioned above, I hope to credit the agency of the Chinese modern dancing body and to open up a forum for discussing the possibility of alternative modernity or subversive authenticity for Chinese modern dances circulated in the U.S.      Seeing dance/ the body as a flexible, creative site for negotiating ethnic, cultural identity and political force, I employ kinesthetic analysis to parse the politics in some LDTX works--drawing on my dance and choreographic training in both countries--so as to fulfill part of the interpretative tasks. Further, traveling to Purchase NY in October 2008 to witness LDTX perform in front of a U.S. audience, as well as collecting interviews and critical reviews, I look at the circulation of Chinese modern dance from a transnational perspective. I pose questions about reception, that is, ethno-racial construction of Chinese bodies inside the Chinese border as viewed from outside.

Mary Ann Borina Radovich: Croatian Apple Farmer, Watsonville, California, 1918-1977
This oral history, conducted with Mary Ann Borina Radovich on June 7 and June 22, 1977, focuses on Radovich's extensive experience as an apple farmer in Watsonville, California from the 1930s to the 1970s. It is also a significant contribution to the ethnic history of the Croatian community in the Pajaro Valley of California.
      In this oral history Radovich discusses her family's history and their emigration to the United States. She describes the early apple industry in Watsonville, and the changes that took place over the years in terms of labor, mechanization, irrigation, crop varieties, pest control, harvesting, and land use. Her detailed and reflective narration makes this oral history a singular contribution to the agricultural history of Central California.
      Radovich owned Borina Orchards from the 1940s through the time of this interview in 1977, and beyond. For many of those years her husband, Rafael Radovich, was her business partner, and in fact beginning in 1957 he was primarily responsible for the apple business. They had no children. In 1977 the orchard was about one hundred acres, mostly planted in dwarf apple trees. They grew Pippin and Delicious apples.

Eros, Thanatos: Amsterdam in Contemporary Anglophone Fiction
This article compares a recent American fiction set in Amsterdam (David Liss’s The Coffee Trader, 2003) with several other Anglophone fictions set in the same city to show how several centuries of literary heterostereotypes of Amsterdam have influenced American ideas on the city in literature. Foreign spaces in fiction almost inevitably draw American projections of the American self that cannot be recognized at home, yet Amsterdam’s particular nexus of projection is perhaps one of the most striking and underexamined, with roots reaching back to the founding mythos of America as Pilgrims’ last stop in Europe and extending to today’s often negative projections of libertinism contrasted with traditional American-style Puritanism. How do the spaces of Amsterdam in a highly detailed work like Liss’s allow a range of issues pertinent to contemporary American society to play themselves out on an “othered” stage? Contemporary questioning of capitalism, sexual and ethical mores, and Americans’ relationship with death are highlighted in this space safely outside the American self, and which thus provides a more comfortable locus for their analysis and narrative development.

Automation in image cytometry : continuous HCS and kinetic image cytometry
Image based high content analysis (HCA) and high content screens (HCS) are powerful tools used predominately in the study of cellular and molecular dynamics, function, and structure and for cDNA, RNAi and compound library screens. Analyses and screens based on fully automated image cytometry create a vast wealth of information in a hands free, unbiased manner. Large-scale screens of tens of thousands to millions of compounds and potential clinical diagnostic applications would benefit from increased image acquisition speeds. Section I of this dissertation (Chapters 1-6) discusses the development of an HTHCS instrument that uses TDI image capture and dynamic autofocus. Current instruments typically scan at peak speeds of 20,000 to 50,000 wells/day (1-4 image(s)/well), whereas many define "high throughput" screening as > 100, 000 wells/day. Progress is reported about routine continuous scanning with time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) 3- color fluorescence imaging at ̃70,000 wells/day (20 x 0.75 NA Nikon objective, 384-well plate, 8-10 usable images/ well depending on wall thickness and edge effects). Image cytometry quality (e.g., precision, accuracy and dynamic range of measurements) is directly linked to the contrast and resolution (detail) available in each image, and is thus dependent on the quality of autofocus. The system was validated using a synthetic assay and compared with the Perkin Elmer Opera using an assay screened by the Sanford- Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (Chapter 4). Section II of this dissertation discusses the development of an HCS instrument capable of automatically stimulating, monitoring, and analyzing kinetic activity in cells. The Kinetic Image Cytometer or KIC will electrically stimulate (0r pace) the cells, record the resulting Ca⁺⁺ transients from cells in microtiter plates (e.g., with 96 wells), and automatically quantify characteristics such as the duration of the Ca⁺⁺ waves on a cell-by-cell basis in a fully automated manner on large scale screens. Chapters 1 and 2 are a summation of research to develop the technology using cardiomyocytes as the control model. Chapters 3 and 4 are a summation of research to use the KIC to perform dose response assays of different sources, including hESC--derived cardiomyocytes (hESC--CMs) and hiPSC--derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC--CMs)

[word, vowel-initial, segment]

Segmentation of vowel-initial words is facilitated by function words
Within the first year of life, infants learn to segment words from fluent speech. Previous research has shown that 7.5-month-olds can segment consonant-initial words, yet the ability to segment vowel-initial words does not emerge until 13.5-16 months of age (11-months in some restricted cases). In Experiment 1, we test 8- and 11-month-olds' ability to segment vowel-initial words that immediately follow the frequently occurring function word 'the'. In two subsequent experiments we rule out the role of bottom-up cues such as phonotactics or allophonic variations in explaining these results. Our results indicate that the function word 'the' facilitates 11-month-olds' segmentation of vowel-initial words that appear sentence-medially.

Real Proper :
Real Proper serves as the written component (and ideological backdrop) to the series of objects and images presented alongside it towards fulfillment of the title "Master of Visual Arts." This component covers to varying degrees of detail shifts in the way we think of objects and artistic production in contemporary networked society. Further, it serves to describe and provide some degree of context for the work I have completed in my time as a graduate student at UC San Diego and where I hope to take my work in the immediate future. This document consists of two parts: the first (I) is a statement of intent originally released for free download as a draft at the end of 2010 under the title The Image Object Post- Internet. This original text has been expanded upon and altered after a series of discussions and written correspondences it provoked, some with individuals I have never and may never meet. It is deliberately positioned somewhere between academic probing and manifesto. The second (II) gives a detailed account of the exhibition presented as my Thesis Exhibition, the works included, and the way I am framing these projects

There is no there there
When I first moved to San Diego, I was a weekend guard at an art museum. I noticed that the museum visitors usually followed a set path from art work to art work usually pausing to read either the artist's name and pieces title or a longer pause to read a longer description / interpretation of the work. I noticed very few real variations to this pattern. I also felt, as a transplant to Southern California, that since the built environment is entirely oriented towards automobiles, the experience of being a Californian is often one of being stuck repeating the same path, and seeing the landscape in the same limited way from day to day. Older roads and the visually apparent history that goes with them seem to be entirely replaced by the freeway system, which replaces and obfuscates the older roads and in many cases is the original road in the area. This installation created a narrative about southern California, combining these experiences of the built environment and the paths followed by the viewer in a gallery space. I decided to program the art show in a form emblematic of southern California, as a ride. The ride is a kind of indigenous entertainment. They existed before but were popularized as a form of mass entertainment through the Disneyland amusement park and the exposure of movies and television. Although this form was taken up in other locations, it is very closely associated with the southern California region

George Barati:  A Life in Music
George Barati was a distinguished cellist, conductor, and composer. Born in Gyor, Hungary, Barati lived in the United States from 1938 until his death in 1996. His recollections include highlights of his international career as cellist, conductor, and composer spanning some 60 years, and reflections on the state of the musical arts in the United States since the end of World War II.
      Barati graduated from the Franz Liszt Conservatory of Music in Budapest in 1935. During the 1930s he was a member of the Budapest Concert Orchestra, where he played under the most celebrated conductors of his era. He was a founding member of the Pro Ideale Quartet and studied or performed with Bartok, Dohnanyi, and other eminent faculty members at the Liszt Conservatory. While still a student he became first cellist with the Budapest Symphony and the Municipal Opera. Barati settled in the United States in Princeton, New Jersey in 1938. There he taught cello at Princeton University and studied composition with Roger Sessions from 1938 to 1943.
      In 1946 Barati moved to San Francisco, where he was a member of the San Francisco Symphony during the tenure of Pierre Monteux. He was also a member of the California String Quartet and founding conductor of the Barati Chamber Orchestra of San Francisco from 1948 to 1952. Barati also began to achieve recognition for his own compositions at this time.
      From 1950 to 1968 Barati was music director of the Honolulu Symphony and Opera. During this period he also began an extensive international conducting career that included guest and visiting conducting appearances with some 85 orchestras on five continents, including Japan, Europe, and Latin America.
      In 1968 Barati returned to the mainland and became executive director of the Villa Montalvo Center for the Arts and conductor of the Villa Montalvo Chamber Orchestra in Saratoga, California. From 1971 to 1980 he was music director of the Santa Cruz County Symphony.
      In addition to his conducting career, he was a juror for the Mitropoulos Competition for Conductors from 1957 to 1970, and participated as a juror for both the Metropolitan and San Francisco Opera Competitions. His honors and awards include the doctor of music, Honoris Causa, from the University of Hawaii in 1955, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965-66, the Ditson Award in 1962, and the Naumberg Award for Composition in 1959.

Vislumbres do exílio na poesia de Cecília Meireles e Florbela Espanca
“Glimpses of the exile in Cecília Meireles and Florbela Espanca’s poetry”        The aim of this paper is to analyze the work of two poets, Cecília Meireles and Florbela Espanca, in order argue that being exiled does not, necessarily, mean being geographically dislocated. Although exile has never been imposed to either writers, anguish and suffering, whether in a higher or lower scale, is present in their work. This unpleasant feeling is possibly associated to the harm of being misplaced in the environment they live in. Nevertheless, this statement applies not only to their work but also to their own lives, seeing that they were both women writers, and to the literary period they both created their poetry. Thus, we propose a dialogue between Cecília Meireles and Florbela Espanca’s poetry in the attempt of finding a place where the speakers of those poems belong. Along this path, we are able to catch a glimpse of their displacement as well as their pursuit of belonging or being part of the world.

Los Angeles Man
"Los Angeles Man" is the story of Martin Dietrich, a music journalist who refuses to write the only story anyone wants from him: a memoir about his father, an infamous music-producer. When Martin has a compulsive tryst with his wife's erratic twin Laurel, she becomes pregnant and they're exiled from the Hollywood Hills to the outskirts of LA County. In order to support their imminent child, Martin finally agrees to write the memoir. By confronting the legacy of his father's failures and his own disastrous choices, he finds that his own path to redemption may not include forgiveness. Between the blighted immigrant neighborhood where he's landed and his old life, Martin must somehow find the elusive secrets to fidelity, fatherhood, and love.

The threepenny opera : connect, confront, create
The theatrical framework provides a storytelling spectrum to explore the human experience. My graduate school stage management work consisted of stories fraught with difficult themes, painful emotions, and graphic sexual imagery. I took notes about the psyche of a child molester during table work for Ronald McCants' new play Refraction. I wrote blocking notation for depictions of the angel Gabriel (Callimaco) and the Virgin Mary (Lucrezia) dissolving into passionate sexual displays in Machiavelli's La Mandragola. In my thesis production, The Threepenny Opera, I called lighting cues while Polly shot up heroin and Mack the Knife sang about abortions. As a stage manager, I am responsible for maintaining the continuity and integrity of a show from pre-production through closing. It is critical that I form authentic and truthful connections with each person and embrace the work even in challenging contexts. My confrontation with content can lead to a company's realization of expression and creativity as I facilitate communication and remain receptive to the redefinition of traditional process. I discovered that Bertolt Brecht's verfremdungseffekt (the distancing effect) works on both the artists involved and the audience who watches. Brecht's plays are alienating and distancing in process and final product. Through my own connectedness to the work as well as my multi-faceted personal and professional advocacy for all artists, I offered a spirit of comfort, safety, and trust for each collaborator. My absolute presence and active engagement allowed me to successfully lead the company through the disconcerting isolation of The Threepenny Opera

Becoming historians : a project- based learning curriculum
Many students think of history as a subject that explains the past with little application to the present or life today. Because they are unable to relate history to their own lives and present experience, they are perhaps more likely to see the subject as "boring." However, historians are active seekers of primary sources, which allow students of history to experience moments from the past in an active and present sense. Teaching students to become historians begins with teaching students how historians actually think about history, which is often based on finding and interpreting primary sources, and then formulating opinions about history. Becoming Historians: A Project-Based Learning Curriculum was developed for educators to teach their students historical thinking skills such as connecting, analyzing and applying. By acquiring historical thinking skills, students will learn both the content of history and transfer those skills in order to be effective citizens in society. The overall goals of the curriculum are for students to learn how to think historically about a topic through connecting a historical figure's actions to a historical time period, analyzing the causes and effects of a historical figure's actions and applying a historical figures actions to the world today, while collaboratively engaged in a project- based research project. Becoming Historians was implemented in a fifth grade multiple subject classroom. Data from research reports, poster board projects, world exploration essays, observations and field notes were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum. The results indicate that students become motivated, work collaboratively and learn how to think historically when immersed in an inquiry-based project that incorporates graphic organizers and explicit modeling. Becoming Historians assists teachers to teach history in an engaging and interactive way that helps students learn important thinking skills such as connecting, analyzing and applying concepts that they can use in history as well as in their lives

Poetic Gestures in Narrative: Prose Poetics in Selected Works of Roberto Bolaño, Cristina Rivera Garza, and Darío Jaramillo Agudelo
This dissertation analyses the many ways in which the notion of "the poetic" can be perceived in the novels of three contemporary Latin American writers: the Chilean Roberto Bolaño (1953-2003), the Colombian Darío Jaramillo Agudelo (1947), and the Mexican Cristina Rivera Garza (1964). In all cases, I demonstrate the many ways in which the "poet's vocabulary" -which includes images, topics, and several technical procedures that express his or her perception of the world through the poetic word- permeates the novels and how it allows to expand his or her poetics. Furthermore, I explain how the individual aesthetic of these three authors is closely related to precepts of the historical avant-garde and certain marginal figures in Latin America in order to take up again the project of developing "new" modalities of writing. In addition to this, I point out some of the subtle political gestures involved in the transition from poetry to prose, which include among other things the loss of ideals and convictions of youngsters during the second half of the twentieth century and the addressing of the violence as a way of life in contemporary Latin America. I begin by discussing some theoretical approaches related to the interaction of genres, the different conceptions of "prose writing" and "poetic writing," and the manner in which a "poetic novel" can be conceived. In the second and fourth chapters, I focus on finding the correspondence between Bolaño's early poetry and selected novels from his early and late production: <italic>Consejos de un Discípulo de Morrison a un Fanático de Joyce</italic>, <italic>Amberes</italic>, <italic>Los detectives salvajes</italic>, <italic>2666</italic>, and <italic>Los sinsabores del verdadero policía</italic>. In the third chapter, I study the novels <italic>La voz interior</italic> by Jaramillo, and <italic>Lo anterior</italic> and <italic>La muerte me da</italic> by Rivera Garza, always in relation with their early poetry. In my conclusion, after synthesizing the similarities and differences between the poetics of Bolaño, Jaramillo, and Rivera Garza, I propose how a poetic reading of the novels I address here can bring new light to interpretation and critical approaches to the analysis of these works.
