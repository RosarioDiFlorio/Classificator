Modeling tourism demand: A dynamic linear AIDS approach
<p>The linear almost ideal demand system (LAIDS), in both static and dynamic forms, is examined in the context of international tourism demand. The superiority of the dynamic error correction LAIDS compared to its static counterpart is demonstrated in terms of both the acceptability of theoretical restrictions and forecasting accuracy, using a data set on the expenditure of United Kingdom tourists in twenty-two Western European countries. Both long-run and short-run demand elasticites are calculated. The expenditure elasticities show that travelling to most major destinations in Western Europe appears to be a luxury for UK tourists in the long run. The demand for travel to these destinations by UK tourists is also likely to be more price elastic in the long run than in the short run. The calculated cross-price elasticites suggest that the substitution/complementarity effects vary from destination to destination.</p>

Investigation of the reaction of OH and CO to form H and CO₂ by photoelectron-photofragment coincidence spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion beam trap
The HOCO radical plays a crucial role in a wide variety of chemical processes, including atmospheric CO₂ regulation and combustion chemistry, as an intermediate in the elementary reaction OH + CO right arrow H + CO₂. However , scant information exists on this species due to the difficulties in studying it. Previous photoelectron- photofragment coincidence (PPC) studies performed in this laboratory have identified key processes occurring on the HOCO potential energy surface, but are complicated by the presence of internal excitation in the precursor anions, leading to uncertainties in product energies and dynamics. To address this, a new instrument has been constructed which incorporates a cryogenically cooled linear electrostatic storage device, providing a cold source of anions for dissociative photodetachment studies by PPC spectroscopy. The enhanced resolution and well- characterized energetics provided by this instrument have allowed the fundamental energetics and processes occurring on the HOCO potential energy surface to be studied in unprecedented detail. New data shows unambiguous confirmation of the presence of tunneling in the reaction HOCO right arrow H + CO₂. Careful study of this product channel has led to the generation a model one-dimensional potential barrier describing this process directly from experimental tunneling data, and tunneling lifetimes over a range of relevant internal energies to be predicted. High resolution photodetachment experiments provide a reassignment of the electron affinities of both cis- and trans-HOCO and the determination of several normal mode frequencies not previously measured in the gas phase, each with the support of high-level ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Further details on the previously-unknown isomer well depths and the process of isomerization have been extracted using this information. Finally, nonresonant two-photon photodetachment studies of NO₂⁻, a species with striking electronic structure similarities to HOCO⁻, reveal a highly asymmetric angular distribution of photoelectrons. A model for reconstructing these photoelectron angular distributions is proposed, showing that interference between atomic emissions in the linear combination of atomic orbitals - molecular orbital picture is sufficient to explain the asymmetry

Joe Turner's Come and Gone : the stage manager's binding song
The most significant and overarching goal of my graduate studies was to master the skill of managing people. While the art of stage management encompasses many disciplines, successful collaboration with fellow artists and craftspeople is the most challenging aspect. Throughout my time at UCSD, I have become aware of how I adjust my leadership style to fit the needs of each production. Every director, designer, and actor requires a nuanced variation of delivery, manner, and tone. A theme in Joe Turner's Come and Gone is the binding, or uniting, of people. In this production, I acted as a binding catalyst in artistic collaborations. Through careful observation, educated response, and thoughtful delivery, I was able to better aid the designers and director in reaching the production's collaborative goals. Throughout Joe Turner's Come and Gone, the director and I shared a succinct and jocular communication style. My rapport with the director allowed me the freedom to focus my energy on designers who required a more tailored approach. While my natural inclination tends toward direct problem-solving, I learned to lead the artists indirectly to solutions or actions. When creative relationships struggle, the stage manager must assess the situation and maneuver towards a unifying resolution. My thesis show was a fitting conclusion to my graduate studies. During this production, I anticipated contrasting creative methods between various parties, and I worked to unite any divergent communication styles. As a stage manager, I strive to bind my fellow artisans together in order to achieve a successful theatrical experience

Growth and Characterization of Semiconductor Nanostructures for Nanoelectronics
Recently, semiconductor nanostructures have generated a continuously growing interest owing to their intriguing physical properties and potential for future technology development. Quasi-one-dimensional nanowires (NWs), usually defined as round or polyhedral shaped cross-sectional structures with a high aspect ratio of 1000 or more, is one of the most active research areas for nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and sensors. Precise controlled growth of NWs, including dimensions, growth rate, morphology, growth direction, and composition, is essential from the viewpoints of fundamental materials fabrication and their performance in future applications. However, there are still many challenges in the fabrication of NWs with controlled dimensions and properties. This dissertation focuses on investigating the fundamental synthesis aspects of epitaxially grown III-V NWs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).First, gold (Au) catalyst - assisted growth of InSb NWs directly on lattice mismatched (~7%) InAs (100) substrates have been studied. The influences of NW diameter and growth temperature on the NW growth rate and morphology have been investigated. The results indicate that NW growth is limited by the growth species direct impingement and the diffusion of surface adatoms. Next, the dependence of morphology of epitaxial InSb NWs on CVD growth parameters over InSb (100) substrates has been investigated. NW length and tapering factors correlated to morphological variations are determined as a function of growth parameters including growth temperature (300°C-480°C), powder source, and duration of growth. Results showed that NW morphology is influenced by axial and radial growth modes, reflecting the competition of various growth mechanisms under different growth conditions. We discovered that Indium droplets may also promote the growth of NWs with a similar role to that of catalytic Au nanoparticles.  A potential growth model is accordingly described and discussed.An optimum growth condition for straight and minimally tapered InSb NWs has been established. The as-grown NWs are investigated using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), indicating a dominant <110> growth direction with the zincblende crystal structure. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements of single nanowire field effect transistors (NW-FET), suggest that NWs are of n-type. A study of the effect of growth temperature on the growth direction of InSb NWs has been studied. A uniform growth direction of InSb NWs is achieved by optimizing the growth temperature profile. Results demonstrate that growth temperature plays an important role when controlling the NW growth direction similar to research on other types of III-V semiconductor NWs. We also investigated the large assembly of NW arrays aligned on the substrate using both in-situ controlled growth method and ex-situ contact printing method.Finally, accurate electrical characterization of NWs and their ultimate implementation in electronics devices fabrication of metal contacts to semiconductor NWs with good ohmic behavior and low contact resistance has been studied. NW-FETs have been fabricated and I-V characteristic was measured to study the NW electrical properties and performance of devices. The improvements of the contact quality and other properties are discussed.Our findings provide an in-depth understanding of semiconductor NW growth via chemical vapor deposition, and the first basis for further investigations on how to achieve controlled growth of individual and arrayed NWs, and novel device applications for switching and computation based on future development of nanoscale specific integrated circuits - NASICs.

The chemistry and biology of zoanthamine alkaloids and Illicium sesquiterpenes
Natural products, or secondary metabolites, have proven significant to the existence of life. They have been used for countless reasons throughout history, including nonessential purposes such as dyes for textiles and paints. Less trivial uses, such as those related to health better demonstrate the importance of natural products. Toxic natural products had been used to bolster hunting efficiency and insect pheromones. Therapeutic natural products have long been used as dietary supplements and medicines. The ubiquitous nature of natural products and their derivatives in current medicinal validates continued investigations in all areas of natural product research. Our laboratory has a longstanding tradition in the synthesis and evaluation of biologically interesting natural products. We have viewed natural product synthesis as a tool to expand our understanding of organic chemistry. Of particular are natural products with novel architectures. The synthetic study of these natural products often inspires creativity to solve complicated synthetic challenges, and leads to the development of new methodologies. Novel structural characteristics and attractive bioactivities of two natural product families, zoanthamine alkaloids and Illicium sesquiterpenes, caught our interest for the stated reasons. Research herein describes work directed towards synthesis of the ABC ring system of norzoanthamine, total syntheses of Illicium sesquiterpenes jiadifenolide and jiadifenin. Chapters 1 and 2 narrate the background and research related to the norzoanthamine ABC ring motif. Chapters 3 and 4 report the total syntheses of jiadifenolide and jiadifenin, and their biological studies related to their neurotrophic activity

The Evaluation of Multimodal Transportation Systems for Economic Efficiency and Other Impacts
ISTEA requires consistent land use and transportation plans for metropolitan regions and the evaluation of economic efficiency for projects and plans. Policies being examined for reducing travel demand include land use policies. Major capacity increases with automated highway systems are also being examined and such systems will have major effects on land use patterns. The Clean Air Act regulations require the proper simulation of latent demand in travel modeling for conformity analysis. Current models in use by MPOs in the U.S. cannot represent the interactions of land use and transport systems in an economically rigorous way and cannot project changes in economic efficiency (locational and traveler surplus). Regional travel demand models in use in the U.S. can represent latent demand as it affects trip distribution, but cannot represent latent demand for auto ownership and for trip generation. The statewide Intermodal Transportation Management System models to be used in California do not represent latent demand at all. Integrated urban models do exist that can perform all of these functions, for regions and for states. We describe a modeling project that applies such a model to an urban region in California and also makes use of GIS to project environmental impacts of scenarios.

Impacts of Motor Vehicle Operation on Water Quality in the United States - Clean-up Costs and Policies
This paper investigates the costs of controlling some of the environmental impacts of motor vehicle transportation on groundwater and on surface waters. We estimate that annualized costs of cleaning-up leaking underground storage tanks range from $0.8 billion to $2.1 billion per year over ten years. Annualized costs of controlling highway runoff from principal arterials in the US are much larger: they range from $2.9 billion to $15.6 billion per year over 20 years (1.6% to 8.3% of annualized highway transportation expenditures.) Some causes of non-point source pollution were unintentionally created by regulations or could be addressed by simple design changes of motor vehicles. A review of applicable measures suggests that effective policies should combine economic incentives, information campaigns, and enforcement, coupled with preventive environmental measures. In general, preventing water pollution from motor vehicles would be much cheaper than cleaning it up.

Forecasting Electric Vehicle Costs with Experience Curves
The future costs of electric-drive vehicles, like those of any new technology, are uncertain. One method for forecasting cost reductions uses the concept of the ‘experience’ curve. Experience curves take into account sale economies, technological improvements in production processes, improvements in product design, and improved efficiency of workers and production management. Here we analyze the future manufacturing cost of a brushless permanent magnet electric vehicle drivetrain using experience curves and a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Our preliminary forecast is a drop in manufacturing cost from today’s $13,000 (with about 2,000 units of cumulative production) to a cost of about $1200 when full scale economies and ‘learning’ have been realized. In an ongoing study at the University of California, Davis, experience curves are being integrated with a detailed vehicle cost model to develop more sophisticated cost forecasts for complete electric vehicles.

Commercial Vehicle Value of Time and Perceived Benefit of Congestion Pricing
This study investigated the value of time for commercial vehicles in urban areas and its implications for perceived benefits created by congestion pricing projects. Central questions explored were (1) Do values of time differ among commercial vehicle operators? If so, what explains the differences? (2) Will congestion pricing make particular segments of the commercial vehicle industry better-off than others due to differences in values of time?
      In the first part of the study, stated preference data for measuring commercial vehicle value of time were collected by interviewing 70 truck operators in California. The value of time was estimated based on the point of diversion at which the switch of facility occurred in the stated preference questions, and also using a modified logit model in which the coefficients to be estimated were assumed to be distributed lognormally across the population. The former approach revealed that the value of time can be well replicated with a lognormal distribution. The latter approach, of the random coefficient logit model, indicated that the mean and standard deviation of the value of tie were $23.4/hr. and $32/hr., respectively. Comparisons between data sets that were segmented according to business type, shipment size, and the method of driver compensation indicated that for-hire trucks tend to have higher value of time than those who pay by commission or fixed salary.
      Using the SR91 congestion pricing project in Southern California as a case study, perceived benefits for commercial vehicles were calculated based on the value of time estimated by the logit model. The analyses revealed that trucks with high values of time receive a disproportional amount of benefit, especially if the toll is expensive. The comparison between for-hire and private trucks indicated that the former, due to their considerably higher mean value of time, tend to receive much greater benefit individually and collect slightly ore aggregate benefit than the latter despite smaller numbers. However, the share of the benefit received by each sector is relatively unaffected by the level of the toll charged.

The Determinants of Growth of Employment Subcenters
This paper presents an empirical analysis of subcenter growth. We develop a series of hypotheses based on the theoretical concepts that have been proposed as explanations for the emergence and growth of subcenters. We then conduct tests of these hypotheses using 1970-80 data from the Los Angeles region. We find that subcenters containing fast-growing industries tended to grow rapidly, and so did those close to airports. There is weak evidence that large subcenters and those located near downtown Los Angeles grew more slowly in proportional terms, possibly indicating diseconomies of scale due to congestion.

The differentially regulated genes TvQR1 and TvPirin of the parasitic plant Triphysaria exhibit distinctive natural allelic diversity
Abstract


Background
Plant parasitism represents an extraordinary interaction among flowering plants: parasitic plants use a specialized organ, the haustorium, to invade the host vascular system to deprive host plants of water and nutrients. Various compounds present in exudates of host plants trigger haustorium development. The two most effective haustorium inducing factors (HIFs) known for the parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor (T. versicolor) are peonidin, an antioxidant flavonoid, and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ), an oxidative stress agent. To date, two genes involved in haustorium initiation in T. versicolor have been identified: TvQR1, a quinone oxidoreductase that generates the active HIF from DMBQ, and TvPirin, a transcription co-factor that regulates several other DMBQ- responsive and &#8211;non-responsive genes. While the expression of these genes in response to DMBQ is well characterized, their expression in response to peonidin is not. In addition, the pattern of polymorphisms in these genes is unknown, even though nucleotide changes in TvQR1 and TvPirin may have contributed to the ability of T. versicolor to develop haustoria. To gain insights into these aspects, we investigated their transcriptional responses to HIFs and non-HIF and their natural nucleotide diversity.


Results
Here we show that TvQR1 and TvPirin are transcriptionally upregulated by both DMBQ and peonidin in T. versicolor roots. Yet, while TvQR1 also responded to juglone, a non-HIF quinone with toxicity comparable to that of DMBQ, TvPirin did not. We further demonstrate that TvPirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported. In the T. versicolor natural population of Northern California, TvQR1 exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein.


Conclusion
Our results suggest that TvQR1 and TvPirin have most likely evolved highly distinct roles for haustorium formation. Unlike TvPirin, TvQR1 might have been under diversifying selection to maintain a diverse collection of polymorphisms, which might be related to the recognition of an assortment of HIF and non-HIF quinones as substrates for successful haustorial establishment in a wide range of host plants.

Tourism Demand Forecasting: A Time Varying Parameter Error Correction Model
<p>The advantages of error correction models (ECMs) and time varying parameter (TVP) models have been discussed in the tourism forecasting literature. These models are now combined to give a new single-equation model, the time varying parameter error correction model (TVP-ECM), which is applied for the first time in the context of tourism demand forecasting. The empirical study focuses on tourism demand, measured by tourism spending per capita, by UK residents for 5 key Western European destinations. Based on the discussion of how the series considered related to most, the empirical results show that the TVP-ECM can be expected to outperform a number of alternative econometric and time series models in forecasting the demand for tourism. By measuring performance in terms of the accuracy of the forecasts of growth (rates of change) and showing that TVP-ECM performs very well for this as well as conventional assessment of the level of demand in this study, it is suggested that forecasters of tourism demand levels and growth rates can feel comfortable using TVP-ECM given that it is expected to perform well.</p>

High-Technology Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley1
The economic expansion of the late 1990s created many opportunities for business creation inSilicon Valley, but the opportunity cost of starting a business was also high during this periodbecause of the exceptionally tight labor market. A new measure of entrepreneurship derivedfrom matching files from the Current Population Survey (CPS) is used to provide the first test ofthe hypothesis that business creation rates were high in Silicon Valley during the "Roaring 90s."Unlike previous measures of firm births based on large, nationally representative datasets, thenew measure captures business creation at the individual-owner level, includes both employerand non-employer business starts, and focuses on only hi-tech industries. Estimates indicate thathi-tech entrepreneurship rates were lower in Silicon Valley than the rest of the United Statesduring the period from January 1996 to February 2000. Examining the post-boom period, wefind that entrepreneurship rates in Silicon Valley increased from the late 1990s to the early2000s. Although Silicon Valley may be an entrepreneurial location overall, we provide the firstevidence that the extremely tight labor market of the late 1990s, especially in hi-tech industries,may have suppressed business creation during this period.

Apolonia Dangzalan: Filipina Businesswoman, Watsonville, California
Apolonia Dangzalan, a Filipino resident of Watsonville, California, was interviewed on April 27, 1977 by Meri Knaster, an editor at the Regional History Project, as part of a series of oral histories documenting local agricultural and ethnic history. Dangzalan was born in February 1896 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Sur, northwest of Manila, on the largest of the Philippine islands. Her family owned some land on which rice and corn was cultivated by sharecroppers. Her uncle was the president of San Nicholas. Dangzalan attended school for five years but was unable to continue due to illness. Her father died when she was five years old and her mother died when she was seventeen. In 1923, at age 27, she married. A year later she and her husband immigrated to Oahu, Hawaii. Her husband worked in the sugar cane fields and Dangzalan began a small business in her house sewing clothes for the Filipino community. This was the first of many small businesses she would run throughout her long life. In 1925 she and her husband moved to San Francisco, and then to Stockton, California, where her husband worked as a laborer in the asparagus fields.
      Dissatisfied with her marriage, in 1926 Dangzalan divorced her husband and moved to Marysville, California, where she bought and managed a pool hall and restaurant frequented by Filipinos, Mexicans and Anglo Americans. Although she enjoyed this work, business was not too good. She heard that Watsonville and Salinas were much better places to be in business because they attracted a large Filipino community that came to work in the fruit orchards. So after five months in Marysville, Dangzalan joined her nephew, Frank Barba, in Watsonville, California. (Frank Barba is also the subject of an oral history published by the Regional History Project.) Dangzalan opened a boarding house for Filipino agricultural workers on Bridge Street in Watsonville, California, where she became known as "Mama" Dangzalan. After a few years, her nephew, Frank Barba, took over the Watsonville boarding house and Dangzalan opened another boarding house on Salinas Road in 1930. Most of the workers she housed were working for the Gary Company, and Dangzalan also served as a labor contractor, hiring men to work in the company's fields. Dangzalan was one of very few women engaged in labor contracting.
      Dangzalan engaged in diverse business activities besides labor contracting. She also opened a liquor store, dancing club, and pool hall on Main Street in Watsonville in 1936. During World War II she owned a house of prostitution on Union Street in Watsonville. She hired an American woman to manage it for her.
      In 1950 Dangzalan stopped working as a labor contractor and went into business for herself as a farmer, primarily growing strawberries. After four years of this she was tired. In 1952 Dangzalan was operated on for kidney cancer. She withdrew from all of her businesses except for the International Groceries and Liquors store on lower Main Street, which she was still running at the time of this oral history interview in 1977. At age 81 Dangzalan was still working in the liquor store until 2:30 in the morning. In her field notes, interviewer Meri Knaster described Dangzalan as "a very spry and active eighty-one year old". Dangzalan continued to operate the liquor store until 1982. She died in 1992, at the age of 96.

Assessing urban and rural neighborhood characteristics using audit and GIS data:  derivation and reliability of constructs
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               Measures to assess neighborhood environments are needed to better understand the salient features that may enhance outdoor physical activities, such as walking and bicycling for transport or leisure. The purpose of this study was to derive constructs to describe neighborhoods using both primary (neighborhood audit) and secondary (geographic information systems) data.
            
            
               
                  Methods
               
               We collected detailed information on 10,770 road segments using an audit and secondary data. The road segment sample was randomly split into an exploratory (60%) and validation sample (40%) for cross-validation. Using the exploratory sample (n = 6,388), seven a priori constructs were assessed separately (functionality, safety, aesthetics, destinations, incivilities, territorality, social spaces) by urbanicity using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, new a posteriori constructs were derived using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). For cross-validation (n = 4,382), we tested factor loadings, thresholds, correlated errors, and correlations among a posteriori constructs between the two subsamples. Two-week test-retest reliability of the final constructs using a subsample of road segments (n = 464) was examined using Spearman correlation coefficients.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               CFA indicated the a priori constructs did not hold in this geographic area, with the exception of physical incivilities. Therefore, we used EFA to derive a four-factor solution on the exploratory sample: arterial or thoroughfare, walkable neighborhood, physical incivilities, and decoration. Using CFA on the validation sample, the internal validity for these a posteriori constructs was high (range 0.43 to 0.73) and the fit was acceptable. Spearman correlations indicated the arterial or thoroughfare factor displayed near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.96). Both the physical incivilities factor and the walkable neighborhood factor had substantial to near perfect reliability in both urban and rural segments (r = 0.77 to 0.78 and r = 0.79 to 0.82, respectively). The decoration factor displayed moderate reliability in urban segments (r = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38&#8211;0.60) and lower reliability in rural segments (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25&#8211;0.52).
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               The results of our analyses yielded four reliably and objectively measured constructs that will be used to explore associations with physical activity in urban and rural North Carolina. These constructs should be explored in other geographic areas to confirm their usefulness elsewhere.

Risk Management in Product Design: Current State, Conceptual Model and Future Research
Risk management is an important element of product design. It helps to minimize the project- and product-related risks such as project budget and schedule overrun, or missing product cost and quality targets. Risk management is especially important for complex, international product design projects that involve a high degree of novel technology. This paper reviews the literature on risk management in product design. It examines the newly released international standard ISO 31000 “Risk management — Principles and guidelines” and explores its applicability to product design. The new standard consists of the seven process steps communication and consultation; establishing the context; risk identification; risk analysis; risk evaluation; risk treatment; and monitoring and review. A literature review reveals, among other findings, that the general ISO 31000 process model seems applicable to risk management in product design; the literature addresses different process elements to varying degrees, but none fully according to ISO recommendations; and that the integration of product design risk management with risk management of other disciplines, or between project and portfolio level in product design, is not well developed.

All three panels are within the field of transportation but reflect widely differing policy and research objectives. The comments offered are based on personal experience and are hopefully useful but anecdotal in nature. They do not pretend to be in-depth considerations of the subjects treated. However, wherever possible reference has been made to literature which offers greater depth and guidance.

A BioBrick compatible strategy for genetic modification of plants
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Plant biotechnology can be leveraged to produce food, fuel, medicine, and materials. Standardized methods advocated by the synthetic biology community can accelerate the plant design cycle, ultimately making plant engineering more widely accessible to bioengineers who can contribute diverse creative input to the design process.
				
				
					
						Results
					This paper presents work done largely by undergraduate students participating in the 2010 International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition. Described here is a framework for engineering the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with standardized, BioBrick compatible vectors and parts available through the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://www.partsregistry.org). This system was used to engineer a proof-of-concept plant that exogenously expresses the taste-inverting protein miraculin.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our work is intended to encourage future iGEM teams and other synthetic biologists to use plants as a genetic chassis.

Essays on Expectations-Driven Business Cycles
The standard one-sector real business cycle (RBC, henceforth) model with a constant returns-to-scale technology and perfectly competitive markets and driven solely by news shocks about productivity cannot generate expectations-driven business cycles, i.e., a joint expansion in output, consumption, investment, and hours worked in response to good news about the future.Our objective is to find the most parsimonious departure from the standard one-sector RBC model able to generate qualitatively and quantitatively realistic business cycle fluctuations driven solely by news shocks about various fundamentals that have high potential in explaining the business cycle volatility.In chapter 2, we analyze news shocks about productivity. First, we address Eusepi's (2009) analytical finding that a one-sector RBC model may exhibit positive co-movement between consumption and investment when the equilibrium wage-hours locus is positively-sloped and steeper than the household's labor supply curve. First, we show (numerically) that this condition does not imply expectations-driven business cycles will emerge in Eusepi's model, as a positive news shock about future productivity improvement leads to an aggregate recession in which output, consumption, investment, and hours worked all fall in the announcement period. Further, we show that investment adjustment costs may be the element that a one-sector RBC model is missing in order to deliver both qualitatively and quantitatively realistic cyclical fluctuations.In Chapter 3, we address the importance of news shocks about aggregate demand, such as a preference shock, that may affect the household's marginal utility of consumption. We show that a one-sector RBC model with (i) mild increasing returns-to-scale and (ii) variable capital utilization driven solely by news about preferences can generate qualitatively and quantitatively realistic aggregate fluctuations. In our model economy output, consumption, investment, and hours worked co-move only if the equilibrium wage-hours locus is positively-sloped and its slope is steeper than the slope of the labor supply curve.In Chapter 4, we address news about income tax rates. We analyze an otherwise standard RBC model, enriched with (i) variable capital utilization and (ii) investment adjustment costs. This framework allows us to isolate the effects of news about labor and capital income tax rates. We find that good news about labor income tax rates cannot generate expectations-driven business cycles, while good news about capital income tax rates can. We calibrate the model to match the observed facts for the U.S economy and simulate a version driven solely by news about capital income tax rates. The model generates not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively realistic cyclical fluctuations..

Development of the BART System Expansion Criteria and Process
In 1999, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District Board, in California, adopted a policy creating a framework for BART system expansion that placed new emphasis on cost-effectiveness, ridership generation, multimodal access, transit-oriented development, local partnerships, and the use of appropriate transit technologies. The board directed staff to develop criteria and a detailed process for implementing these goals. The resulting expansion planning process and criteria for the BART system, adopted by the BART board in December 2002, are described along with the method used to develop the criteria and process. Some of the implementation issues that have arisen are assessed. The process uses a strategic opportunities assessment as an initial sketch-planning evaluation tool and then applies criteria and a rating system to evaluate preliminary proposals as well as project alternatives that proceed to environmental review and beyond. The rating system also indicates to local jurisdictions the kinds of access and land development that would support a BART investment. As part of the process, localities are encouraged to prepare a ridership development plan that puts in place transit-supportive plans, zoning, infrastructure, and services. Extensive consultation with the board and other stake holders helped build understanding of the issues and solid board support for the new planning process and criteria. Application of the new process has led to transit-supportive plans and zoning changes in several local jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions are not prepared to make the land use changes needed for a “high” project rating and are considering lower-cost transit alternatives.

General birth-death processes: probabilities, inference, and applications
A birth-death process is a continuous-time Markov chain that counts the number of particles in a system over time.  Each particle can give birth to another particle or die, and the rate of births and deaths at any given time depends on how many extant particles there are.  Birth-death processes are popular modeling tools in evolution, population biology, genetics, epidemiology, and ecology.  Despite the widespread interest in birth-death models, no efficient method exists to evaluate the finite-time transition probabilities in a process with arbitrary birth and death rates.  Statistical inference of the instantaneous particle birth and death rates also remains largely limited to continuously-observed processes in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant.  The lack of theoretical progress in developing statistical tools for dealing with data from birth-death processes has hindered their adoption by applied researchers, and represents a major research frontier in statistical inference for stochastic processes.  In this dissertation, I seek to fill this apparent void in three ways.  First, I develop mathematical theory and computational tools for computing transition probabilities for general birth-death processes.  Second, I develop algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation of rate parameters in discretely observed processes.  Third, I derive probability distributions for characteristics of certain birth-death models that are fundamental in macroevolutionary studies.  In each case, I give practical applications of the methodology, and show how unsolved problems can be attacked using these techniques.

[proposal, pricing, scheme, vmt, travel]

ACCESS Magazine, Spring 1994
It seems that transportation planners everywhere are looking for ways of reducing vehicle miles of travel (VMT) by automobile, even as citizens seem determined to drive more. The trend may be especially evident here in California where everyone seems to believe that use of cars is excessive, having conspired to foul the air, congest the highways, provoke traffic accidents, and erode the quality of people's lives. In response, a lot of creative remedies have been invented - schemes to entice travelers into carpools and public transit and schemes to induce them to stay home. 
      ACCESS has been reporting on several of these, including the economists' pet formula for reducing VMT by pricing travel at closer to its true cost. Congestion pricing and parking pricing have been gaining considerable attention of late. So have proposals for raising gas taxes to levels that Europeans find tolerable. So have proposals for telecommuting. So have proposals for inter- and intra-metropolitan rail lines.

Mid-level Providers Working in a Low-acuity Area are More Productive than in a High-acuity Area
Introduction: Mid-level providers (MLP) are extensively used in staffing emergency departments (ED). We sought to compare the productivity of MLPs staffing a low-acuity and high-acuity area of a community ED.Methods: This is a retrospective review of MLP productivity at a single center 42,000-volume community ED from July 2009 to September 2010. MLPs staffed day shifts (8AM-6PM or 10AM-10PM) in high- and low-acuity sections of the ED. We used two-tailed T-test to compare patients/hour, relative value units (RVUs)/hour, and RVUs/patient between the 2 MLP groups. Results: We included 49 low-acuity and 55 high-acuity shifts in this study. During the study period, MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts treated a mean of 2.7 patients/hour (confidence interval CI +/- 0.23), while those staffing high-acuity shifts treated a mean of 1.56 patients/hour (CI +/- 0.14, P < 0.0001). MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts generated a mean of 4.45 RVUs/hour (CI +/- 0.34) compared to 3.19 RVUs/hour (CI +/-0.29) for those staffing high-acuity shifts (P < 0.0001). MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts generated a mean of 1.68 RVUs/patient (CI +/- 0.06) while those staffing high-acuity shifts generated a mean RVUs/patient of 2.05 (CI +/- 0.09, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: MLPs staffing a low-acuity area treated more patients/hour and generated more RVUs/hour than when staffing a high-acuity area. West J Emerg Med.2013;14(6):598–601.

Hypercongestion
The standard economic model for analyzing traffic congestion, due to A.A. Walters, incorporates a relationship between speed and traffic flow.  Empirical measurements indicate a region, known as hypercongestion, in which speed increases with flow.  We argue that this relationship is unsuitable as a supply curve for equilibrium analysis because hypercongestion occurs as a response to transient demand fluctuations.  We then present tractable models for handling such fluctuations, both for a uniform expressway and for a dense street network such as in a central business district (CBD).  For the CBD model, we consider both exogenous and endogenous time patterns for demand, and we make use of an empirical speed-density relationship for Dallas, Texas to characterize both congested and hypercongested conditions.

Search Costs:  The Neglected Spread Component
Dealers need to search for quotes in many of the world's largest markets (such as spot foreign exchange, US government bonds, and the London Stock Exchange).  This search affects trading cost.  We estimate the share of total trading cost attributable to search.  Our experiments show that the share is large -- roughly one-third of the effective spread.  Past work on estimating spread components typically omits the search component.  Our estimates suggest this omission is important.

In this paper, the methods and frameworks of diverse disciplines are reviewed and compared with those of the manufacturing community. The results show significant differences between disciplines, including the level of urgency expressed. Synthesizing these divergent viewpoints, this paper makes suggestions for needed research on “sustainable manufacturing”. The main message is that manufacturing needs to significantly increase the boundaries of its analysis to be able to understand its effect at the global scale.

Essays on institutions and innovation in natural resource industries
Technological progress is associated with both excessive depletion and improved conservation of environmental resources. This dissertation explores the role of technological progress under different regulatory and producing institutions. The first chapter, "Firm Boundaries and Impure Public Goods'', establishes a relationship between property rights, firm structure, and productivity. I adapt the theory of the firm to show that reducing common-pool externalities can lead to mergers (distinct from permit consolidation among low cost firms) and greater human capital investments. These predictions are supported by data from the New England groundfish industry where some groups called "sectors'' were exempted from input controls and given a collective output quota. Sectors exhibited better managerial performance (i.e., higher productivity) relative to non-sector firms following the change, but the species composition of their harvest shifted considerably. The following two chapters investigate technology adoption and productivity in common -pool resource industries. The second chapter, "Technological Change and Managerial Ability : Evidence from a Malaysian Artisanal Fishery'', uses stochastic frontier analysis to compare the productivity of technology adopters in the gillnet fishery on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Technologies include cell phones, GPS, sonar, and mechanical winches for hauling nets. Electronics adopters were more productive than non- adopters on average but difficult to distinguish from efficient non-adopters, while adopters of mechanical net haulers had low technical efficiency, low labor productivity and high labor use. Our results suggest capital investments in new technology may tie the least successful participants to the fishery despite most respondents' self-reported desire to exit. The dynamic implications of these findings are explored in the third chapter, "Exogenous Productivity Shocks and Capital Investment in Common-pool Resources''. We develop a compound Poisson process to model rapid adoption of technologies in common-pool industries. Technology shocks lower the equilibrium resource stock while causing capital buildup based on transitory quasi-rents. The steady state changes from a stable node to a shifting focus with boom and bust cycles, even if only technology is uncertain

Size Dependence of a Temperature-Induced Solid-Solid Phase Transition in Copper(I) Sulfide
Determination of the phase diagrams for the nanocrystalline forms of materials is crucial for our understanding of nanostructures and the design of functional materials using nanoscale building blocks. The ability to study such transformations in nanomaterials with controlled shape offers further insight into transition mechanisms and the influence of particular facets. Here we present an investigation of the size-dependent, temperature-induced solid-solid phase transition in copper
sulfide nanorods from low- to high-chalcocite. We find the transition temperature to be substantially reduced, with the high chalcocite phase appearing in the smallest nanocrystals at temperatures so low that they are typical of photovoltaic operation. Size dependence in phase trans- formations suggests the possibility of accessing morphologies that are not found in bulk solids at ambient conditions. These other- wise-inaccessible crystal phases could enable higher-performing materials in a
range of applications, including sensing, switching, lighting, and photovoltaics.

CIRA and the H-2C : reviewing the potential for future comprehensive immigration reform
This thesis critically analyzes the H-2C temporary worker program (TWP) that was part of the 2006, Senate-approved Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act. Employer opinions and lessons from past U.S. TWPs are presented, resulting in recommendations for changing H-2C's design in order to maximize its potential as a core component of future immigration reform in the United States. The paper finds that small businesses, which comprise the majority of the businesses in the United States, and are among the heaviest users of foreign labor, consider the 2006 H-2C program to be unaffordable. Policy makers must redesign H- 2C to be affordable for small businesses while still offering an effective system for protecting domestic worker interests. The paper concludes that the best means to achieve both program affordability for small businesses and effectual domestic worker protections is likely a user -friendly, electronic program process

Oxidized organic functional groups in aerosol particles from forest emissions measured at mid-mountain and high- elevation mountain sites in Whistler, BC
Aerosols contribute to the largest uncertainty in climate prediction (IPCC, 2007) from both direct and indirect radiative forcing; these effects are influenced by particle size and chemistry. Although organic compounds constitute a large part of aerosols, this fraction is poorly characterized. In an effort to address the complexity of organic aerosols, aerosol particles were collected in Whistler, British Columbia, at a mid-mountain site in spring 2008 and a peak site in spring and summer 2009. The organic functional group composition of the collected aerosol was measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. At the mid-mountain site the organic mass (OM) project mean was 1.3 ± 1.0 mug m⁻³. On average, organic hydroxyl, alkane, and carboxylic acid groups represented 34%, 33%, and 23% of OM, respectively. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, which was employed with complementary elemental characterization, attributed 65% of the campaign OM to biogenic sources. The functional group composition of the biogenic factor was similar to that of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) reported from the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in laboratory chamber studies, providing evidence that the magnitude and chemical composition of biogenic SOA simulated in the laboratory is similar to that found in actual atmospheric conditions. At the mountain peak site the OM project mean for all samples was 3.2 ± 3.3 mug m⁻³ and reached a maximum of 13.6 mug m⁻³ during severe wildfires. Both burning and non-burning forest emissions contributed to the significant ketone groups measured

An Interrupted Fischer Indolization Approach Toward the Akuammiline Alkaloids
Chapter one provides an overview of the history of the akuammiline alkaloids, includingtheir isolation, structural features, biological activity, and biosynthesis. This chapter provides adiscussion of synthetic efforts toward these intriguing alkaloids, in addition to detaileddescriptions of several recently completed total syntheses. Chapter two discusses an efficientmethod to access the fused indoline ring system present in a multitude of bioactive molecules.The strategy involves the condensation of hydrazines with latent aldehydes to ultimately deliverindoline-containing products by way of an interrupted Fischer indolization sequence. Themethod is convergent, mild, operationally simple, broad in scope, and can be used to accessenantioenriched products. In addition, the synthesis of furoindoline and pyrrolidinoindolinenatural products is demonstrated by the concise formal total syntheses of physovenine andii idebromoflustramine B. Chapter three explores the mechanisms of the Fischer indole synthesisand competing cleavage pathways with SCS-MP2/6-31G(d) and aqueous solvation calculations.Electron-donating substituents divert the reaction pathway to heterolytic N-N bond cleavage andpreclude the acid-promoted 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement. Chapters four reports the totalsynthesis of (±)-aspidophylline A, one of many complex furoindoline-containing alkaloids thathas not been synthesized previously. Our route features a number of key transformations,including a Heck cyclization to assemble the 3.3.1-bicyclic scaffold, as well as a late-stageinterrupted Fischer indolization to install the furoindoline and construct the natural product'spentacyclic framework.

Prices, capacities and service quality in a congestible Bertrand duopoly
We study the duopolistic interaction between congestible facilities that supply perfect substitutes. Firms are assumed to make sequential decisions on capacities and prices. Since the outcomes directly affect consumers’ time cost of accessing or using a facility, the capacity sharing rule is endogenous. We study this two-stage game for different firm objectives and compare the duopoly outcomes with those under monopoly and at the social optimum. Our findings include the following. First, for profit maximizing firms both capacity provision and service quality, defined as the inverse of time costs of using the facility, are distorted under duopoly: they are below the socially optimal levels. This contrasts with the monopoly outcome, where pricing and capacity provision are such that the monopolist does provide the socially optimal level of service quality. Second, duopoly prices are lower than monopoly prices, but higher than in the social optimum. Hence, while price competition between duopolists yields benefits for consumer, capacity competition is harmful. Third, price-capacity competition implies that higher capacity costs may lead to higher profits for both facilities. Finally, if firms also care about output, this mainly affects pricing behavior; strategic interaction in capacities are much less affected. If duopolists attach a higher weight to output and a correspondingly lower weight to profits, this leads to a deterioration of the quality of service.

Using data from a 2001 survey of managers of 700 trucking companies operating in California, we tested competing hypotheses about the relationship between managers' perceptions of the impact of traffic congestion on their operations and their companies' adoption of routing and scheduling software. Demand for automated routing and scheduling was found to be influenced directly by the need to re-route drivers, and indirectly by the need, generated by customers' schedules, to operate during congested periods. We were also able to identify which types of trucking companies are most affected by congestion and which types are more likely to adopt such software.

Essays on Efficiency Measurement with Environmental Applications
This study contributes to three branches of literature:  index number theory, the modeling of environmental production technologies, and index decomposition analysis.  The first part of the study begins by analyzing a previous adjustment made to a popular graph space index, which is used to compute input-output efficiency scores, and shows that this adjustment fails to correct two serious flaws it was intended to rectify - satisfaction of an indication and weak monotonicity condition.  The failure arises at the boundary of output space when zeros arise frequently in the data.  We propose an alternative formulation to correct for these deficiencies and implement the proposed modification in two different empirical applications.Next, we identify a conceptual flaw regarding tradeoffs between inputs, outputs, and pollutants when one production relation is used to model the joint production of pollution-generating technologies.  We propose a superior modeling tactic to correct for the tradeoff implications when using only one implicit production relation.  Using multiple production relations to capture intended and unintended production, and defining the reduced form technology as the intersection between these two production sets, we introduce the "by-production" technology.  This novel formulation has direct implications on DEA estimation, which we derive and utilize in an application of efficiency measurement. Moreover, we show that constructing efficiency scores for "by-production" technologies isn't straight forward.  We distinguish between efficiency in intended and unintended production, show that some traditional indexes are not appropriate for applications involving "by-production" technologies, and propose a modification of a previous index that has superior properties and decomposes into productive and environmental efficiency.Lastly, this study applies the by-production modeling tactic developed earlier to reconsider index decomposition results previously derived under different assumptions regarding the nature of pollution-generating technologies.  The application examines factors related to variations in electric power plant emissions through an index decomposition analysis and shows, in general, that previous results derived using the more primitive technological assumption of weak disposability and null-jointness are incongruent with the results derived under by-production.  We conclude the final portion of the study by analyzing energy firm responses to the 1990 Amendment to the Clean Air Act Amendment.

Adaptive Optimization of Infrastructure Maintenance and Inspection Decisions under Performance Model Uncertainty
Infrastructure management systems assist agencies in making decisions regarding maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of the facilities under their jurisdiction. The objective in these decision-making tools is to minimize the total expected cost of managing a system of facilities over a given planning horizon. Recent optimization models account for the uncertainty in the selection of facility performance models through an adaptive control approach.
      In this paper, we extend the methodology to jointly determine when to inspect and what maintenance activity to perform, while taking into account uncertainty in measuring facility condition. A parametric study is performed to analyze the effect of the initial performance model uncertainty and bias on the expected total cost of managing a facility over a finite horizon. The parametric study shows that reducing model uncertainty leads, as expected, to lower costs. The results also indicate that reducing the initial variance in model uncertainty is more important than reducing the initial bias. In addition, our study shows that cost savings can result from relaxing the constraint of a fixed inspection schedule.

Factors predicting doctors' reporting of performance change in response to multisource feedback
AbstractBackgroundMulti-source feedback (MSF) offers doctors feedback on their performance from peers (medical colleagues), coworkers and patients. Researchers increasingly point to the fact that only a small majority of doctors (60&#8211;70 percent) benefit from MSF. Building on medical education and social psychology literature, the authors identified several factors that may influence change in response to MSF. Subsequently, they quantitatively studied the factors that advance the use of MSF for practice change.MethodsThis observational study was set in 26 non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. In total, 458 specialists participated in the MSF program. Besides the collation of questionnaires, the Dutch MSF program is composed of a reflective portfolio and a facilitative interview aimed at increasing the acceptance and use of MSF. All specialists who finished a MSF procedure between May 2008 and September 2010 were invited to complete an evaluation form. The dependent variable was self-reported change. Three categories of independent variables (personal characteristics, experiences with the assessments and mean MSF ratings) were included in the analysis. Multivariate regression analysis techniques were used to identify the relation between the independent variables and specialists&#8217; reported change in actual practice.ResultsIn total, 238 medical specialists (response rate 52 percent) returned an evaluation form and participated in the study. A small majority (55 percent) of specialists reported to have changed their professional performance in one or more aspects in response to MSF. Regression analyses revealed that two variables had the most effect on reported change. Perceived quality of mentoring positively influenced reported change (regression coefficient beta&#8201;=&#8201;0.527, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) as did negative scores offered by colleagues. (regression coefficient beta&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;0.157, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). The explained variance of these two variables combined was 34 percent.ConclusionsPerceived quality of mentoring and MSF ratings from colleagues seem to be the main motivators for the self-reported change in response to MSF by specialists. These insights could leverage in increasing the use of MSF for practice change by investing in the quality of mentors.

Essays on international trade agreements and contracts under renegotiation
The first chapter of the dissertation addresses general issues in contracting with external enforcement. We study a contracting environment with specific investments in which renegotiation, and therefore hold-up, is possible. We show that taking account of the precise nature of trading and investment technologies is important for accurately determining the trading relationships in which efficient investment and trade will occur and that careful modeling of institutional detail and the information available to private parties and the external enforcement body (e.g. a court) are key. The second chapter presents a model of international trade agreements in which domestic policy-making power is shared between executive and legislative branches of government. Acknowledging the complexity of the legislative process as well as its susceptibility to lobbying reveals a political commitment role for trade agreements in that executives can use them to reduce incentives for lobbying so that the legislatures can better withstand political pressure. This helps explain the result from tests of the Grossman and Helpman (1994) model that there is too much protection relative to contributions given estimates of governments' social- welfare weights : I predict that contribution levels may in fact be low because tariffs have been raised to prevent political pressure and the increased risk of a trade disruption it engenders. The third chapter extends this model to a repeated-game framework, replacing the assumption of external enforcement with self-enforcing promises of future cooperation. Here, the inability of actors to make commitments affects the design of trade agreements in two ways: executives must not only take into account the legislatures' lobbying-driven propensity to revoke delegation and break the agreement, but also be robust to the executives' own incentives to renegotiate out of any punishment scheme. The design of the dispute resolution mechanism that makes the optimal punishment incentive compatible must balance two, often-conflicting, objectives: longer punishment periods help to enforce cooperation by increasing the costs of defecting from the agreement, but because the lobbies prefer the punishment outcome, this also incentivizes lobbying effort and with it the political pressure to break the agreement.

Cars and the City: An Investigation of Transportation and Residential Location Choices in New York City
This dissertation is an exploration of the relationship between the transportation-land use system in New York City and the transportation and residential location choices made by New Yorkers. The focus is on understanding these location and travel choices made by urbanites. Specifically, this research uses discrete choice models to identify and quantify the effects of the variables that factor into New Yorkers' decisions about where to live, whether to own a car, and how to get around in their daily lives. These models, along with GIS technology, are used to answer the following questions:
      1. How far off are the results of models that do not take all three of these decisions as endogenous?
      2. In a densely populated urban environment, what are the policy-sensitive factors that determine whether households own cars and how often walking is the mode of choice?
      3. How does the relative importance of these factors change across different neighborhoods within the city?
      4. How much of the relationship between land use patterns and travel behavior is due to the indirect effects of neighborhood and car ownership choice, and how large is the direct effect of land use patterns on travel behavior?
      Results indicate that the choices of residential location and commute mode are closely related; models of only commute mode choice produce biased results. Models that do not take the choice of car ownership as endogenous in New York do not appear to be severely biased.
      Full models of the three choices indicate that the most important policy- sensitive factors influencing car ownership and mode choice are commute cost, commute time, and population density. A set of spatial scenario analyses illustrate that the importance of these factors does indeed vary across neighborhoods within the city.
      Finally, a methodology is developed to separate the direct effect of land use patterns on travel behavior from the indirect effects. The example used here identifies the direct and indirect effects of population density on the propensity to walk, finding that approximately half of the total effect is direct.

What Impedes Efficient Product Adoption? Evidence from Randomized Variation in Sales Offers for Improved Cookstoves in Uganda
Many people do not purchase products that appear beneficial. For example, the price of an efficient cookstove can be less than a few months’ savings on fuel. If liquidity constraints, present bias, and poor information on fuel savings and stove durability are barriers, then a novel sales offer combining a free trial, time payments, and the right to return the stove at any time should increase sales. In a randomized trial, this sales offer increases sales of an efficient charcoal-burning stove in Kampala, Uganda, from 5% to 45%. We provide additional evidence that both liquidity constraints and imperfect information were important barriers.

Spatial-Temporal Branching Point Process Models in the Study of Invasive Species
Earthquake occurrences are often described using a class of branching models called Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models. The name derives from the fact that the model allows earthquakes to cause aftershocks, and then those aftershocks may induce subsequent aftershocks, and so on. Despite their value in seismology, such models have not previously been used in studying the incidence of invasive plant and animal species. Here, we apply a modified version of the space-time ETAS model to study the spread of an invasive species red banana trees (Musa velutina) in a Costa Rican rainforest. One challenge in this ecological application is that fitting the model requires the originations of the plants, which are not observed but may be estimated using filed data on the heights of the plants on a given date and their empirical growth rates. The formulation of the triggering density function, which describes the way events cause future occurrences of events is based on plots of inter-event times and distances for the red banana plants. We characterize the estimated spatial-temporal rate of spread of red banana plants using a space-time ETAS model. We then assess the triggering density more carefully using a non-parametric stochastic declustering method based on Marsan and Lengline (2008). When the algorithm is applied to the red banana data, the results indicate similar temporal and spatial structure, compared to previous estimates, as well as triggering of offspring running primarily to the northwest and the southeast from each parent. Non-parametric results are also used to obtain estimates of the most likely targets where immigration of red banana plants may be occurring.

Forecasting the Impact of Sociodemographic Changes On Travel Demand: Experiments With a Dynamic Microsimulation Model System
Travel demand analysis and forecasting have developed rapidly over the past decade and are now entering a new "dynamic era" characterized by the recognition that time is an indispensable dimension of travel demand models (for overviews on the subject see Kitamura, 1990, and Pas, 1990). This paper addresses the development of new forecasting methods that explicitly account for this dynamic character of travel demand. The new approach, Microanalytic Integrated Demographic Accounting System (MIDAS), attempts to combine dynamic models of travel behavior with sociodemographic and economic microanalytic simulation. The strengths of this model system are: 1) the internal, to the model system, production of sociodemographic and economic forecasts, and 2) the flexibility of the new forecasting tool. In this paper the method is briefly described and major emphasis is given to experiments on the impact of sociodemographic changes on travel demand.

Structural and electronic studies of complexes relevant to the electrocatalyic reduction of carbon dioxide
Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of transition metal complexes with modified 2,2'-bipyridines. Bipyridines with different substitutions at the 4,4' and 6, 6' position were synthesized and their complexes with several transition metals were investigated to elucidate the electronics and steric requirements for the electrochemical reduction of CO₂ to CO. The synthesis of tripbipy (6,6'-(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine), a new substituted bipyridine ligand, and the syntheses, structures, and magnetic properties of the first coordination compounds based on this ligand are described. Reported here are the tripbipy complexes of five late first row transition metal chlorides (MCl₂; M = Fe, Co, Ni , Cu, Zn). All MCl₂tripbipy complexes are four coordinate and contain a distorted tetrahedral metal center. The synthesis and X-ray crystallographic characterization of several reduced complexes from the chemical reduction of Re(tripbipy)(CO)₃Cl are reported. The one-electron reduction of this complex results in the loss of the halide to form the neutral 5-coordinate complex. The two- electron reduction of the starting material with KC₈ results in the loss of the halide, and reduction of the bipyridine ligand. Bond alternation can be seen in the XRD as well as the DFT calculations using ADF 2007.1. We report a series of complexes synthesized from the chemical reduction of the fac-tricarbonyl complex Re(bpy)(CO)₃Cl. Reduction of the parent complex with one equivalent of KC₈ results in the formation of the dimer Re(bpy)(CO)₃₂. The one-electron reduction of this dimer does not result in cleavage of the metal-metal bond, but leads to the formation of the anionic dimer Re(bpy)(CO₃₂⁻. The reduction of the parent compound with 2.1 equivalents of KC₈ results in the formation of the anionic species Re(bpy)(CO)₃⁻, which has long been postulated as the active species that reacts with carbon dioxide in the electrochemical reduction of CO₂ to CO. Modification of the 6,6' position of 2,2'-bipyridine for the addition of proton relays to the electrocatalyst Re(bipy)(CO)₃Cl is reported. Synthesis and electrochemistry of Re(bipy- CH₂OH)(CO)₃Cl and Re(6,6'-dmb)(CO₃Cl (6,6'-dmb = 6,6'- dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine) are reported. Addition of substituents at the 6,6' position inhibits catalysis when compared to the complexes with the functional groups at the 4,4' position

[contract, driver, problem, cost, agency]

Driver-Shift Design for Single-Hub Transit Systems under Uncertainty
Drivers account for up to 80% of the operational cost of transit agencies. This dissertation provides a method for improving the productivity of this workforce by introducing flexible contracts. Under these contracts drivers do not work the same number of hours every day. However, the number days and hours worked every week are kept constant. These contracts allow the agency to find a better match between the number of drivers needed and hired. Since people's preferences vary, introducing this flexibility should benefit both the agency and the drivers.
      Driver contracts are offered simultaneously to all drivers. Because drivers may be absent to work unexpectedly, these contracts must be designed to overstaff the system. However, current methodologies to determine these contracts fail to incorporate this uncertainty. There is also a lack of understanding as to how parameters of the problem such as driver wage, and the likelihood of absenteeism will impact the total cost. This dissertation aims to fill this gap. The methodology introduced here considers absenteeism, and provides cost sensitivities.
      Further cost savings can be achieved if these contracts are synchronized with the trips operated by the agency. To achieve this goal, this dissertation extends the contract scheduling work and investigates the opposite problem where contracts are given and timetables must be identified. Two different methodologies are used to study this timetable design problem: continuum approximation and numerical optimization. The continuum approximation work incorporates uncertainties and provides cost sensitivities. The numerical optimization approach is used to validate the approximated results. In the latter work cuts are designed to solve an otherwise intractable problem. These cuts are also valid for the production lot-sizing problem.

Multiply Imputed Sampling Weights for Consistent Inference with Panel Attrition
This chapter demonstrates a new methodology for correcting panel data models for attrition bias. The method combines Rubin's Multiple Imputations technique with Manski and Lerman's Weighted Exogenous Sample Maximum Likelihood Estimator (WESMLE). Simple Hausman tests for the presence of attrition bias are also derived. We demonstrate the technique using a dynamic commute mode choice model estimated from the University of California Transportation Center's Southern California Transportation Panel. The methodology is simpler to use than standard maximum likelihood-based procedures. It can be easily modified to use with many panel data estimation and forecasting procedures.

Three essays on international trade
This dissertation is composed by three chapters. In Chapter 1 I use detailed information on labor composition of Brazilian firms to show that even though exporting firms are similar in the workforce composition, it is non- observable worker characteristics that matter the most to determine whether an exporting firm will become a future successful exporter. I find that the prior working experience of workers is a key component in determining a firm's future export success. Results show that hiring away workers with previous experience in other exporting companies has a significant effect on a firm's future probability of becoming a successful exporter. Furthermore, hiring these key workers increases a firm's market penetration and a firm's number of exporting destinations. In Chapter 2 I use detailed firm level data on a firm's external sources of financing and I show that firms with higher debt balances export less and grow at lower rates, especially during periods of economic distress. I use this data to provide evidence that financing constraints affect firms' extensive and intensive margins of exports. However, only a subset of financing constraints are related to exports. I show that short-term debt with domestic banking institutions is negatively related to a firm's extensive and intensive margins of trade, while supplier trade debt has a positive effect on a firm's intensive margin of exports. I show that firms located in sectors with higher dependence on external financing exhibit higher growth in their intensive margins of exports. In Chapter 3 I focus my attention a transport costs. In this chapter, I focus my attention on air cargo shipping and I extend the Melitz (2003) firm heterogenous model of trade by including a cargo shipping sector characterized by a oligopolistic competition structure with fixed entry costs. The market competition in air cargo shipping enables me to derive endogenous pricing rules that vary with the number of cargo carriers per route. Empirical results with US cargo data confirm the importance of competition in air cargo shipping prices

eAirlines: strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry
<p>Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have revolutionised the entire business world. The airline industry in particular has fostered a dependency on technology for their operational and strategic management. Airlines were early adopters of ICTs and have a long history of technological innovation, in comparison to many other travel and tourism businesses. This paper discusses comprehensive research, including exploratory research with airline executives, using qualitative methods to examine the use of ICTs in the contemporary airline industry and to discuss recent developments in the industry. The work demonstrated that the airline industry was using the Internet to improve its distribution strategy and reduce costs; it also used intranets and internal systems to develop tactical and strategic management. In addition, extranets were being gradually used for communicating with partners and to support Business to Business (B2B) relationships. The effort demonstrated that ICTs will be critical for the strategic and operational management of airlines and will directly affect the future competitiveness of airlines.</p>

The Business Organization of the Bourbon Factories. Mastercraftsmen, Crafts and Families in the Capodimonte Porcelain Works and the Royal Factory at San Leucio
The case studies presented here, the porcelain factory at Capodimonte (1740-1759) and the textile factory at San Leucio (1789-1860), though relatively distant in time, and promoted by different governments, should be considered sequential, precisely because of their ability to impose systemic innovations. Both cases represent organizational structures using up-to-date production technologies and innovative management, with the work organized and divided according to a precise apportionment of roles, dominated by a top-down hierarchy of the different production units with a high level of interaction between the different workshops, coordinated by a director for each sector. The two royal companies had a carefully designed layout with distribution facilities positioned near the production areas. Anticipating the utopias of the Enlightenment, the two factories were equipped with buildings capable of allowing workers to live with their families in the same place as the factory by adopting a small-scale phalanstery-style solution at Capodimonte (73 units) and a larger one in San Leucio (a thousand workers at the beginning of the nineteenth century with a total of about 200 families by the mid nineteenth century). The Royal Silk Factory of San Leucio diversified its production over seventy years through the development of new technologies and new materials, extending centers to locations close to the village of San Leucio, Vaccheria, Briano, and Puccianello, thus creating a real textile production district.

Relations Between Transportation and Production
This paper investigates the ways in which transportation improvements enhance production. The production of residential housing is used as a case at point. Several approaches to analysis are proposed, and an approach is adopted emphasizing productivity improvements from technological change.
      After considering several ways that transportation services may relate to technological change, the authors provide an analysis of the diffusion of wallboard construction.
      Overall, the study concentrates on methodology and magnitudes. It provides a way of thinking about transportation and production relations, and it indicates that service improvements may yield social savings of large magnitude.

[process, behavior, demand, people, final]

Spatial Behavior in Transportation Modeling and Planning
The demand for transportation services is a derived demand based on the needs of people to perform daily and other episodic activities. There have been two dominant approaches to investigating this derived demand: (a) studies focused on the spatial behavior of people, that is, the recorded behavior of people as they move between origins and destinations (e.g., Hanson & Schwab, 1995), and (b) an examination of the decision-making and choice processes that result in spatially manifest behaviors (e.g. Ben-Akiva & Lerman, 1985: Ortuzar & Willumsen, 1994). The former approach has been typified by the development of methods for describing and analyzing activity/travel patterns. The latter is typified both by the development of methods for describing and modeling the final outcomes of decision processes but paying little attention to the cognitive processes involved in determining the final decision concerning movement in space, and behavioral process models paying particular attention to the cognitive factors involved in decision-making as well as to the final choice act (Golledge & Stimson, 1997).

Modeling Almost Periodicity in Point Processes
We propose a model for the analysis of non-stationary point processes with almost periodic rate of occurrence. The model deals with the arrivals of events which are unequally spaced and show a pattern of periodicity or almost periodicity, such as the rate of financial transactions or customer/phone calls arrivals. The concept of almost periodicity is described and the purely periodic process is just a special case of the almost periodic process. We consider a non-homogeneous Poisson process and model its rate of occurrence as the sum of sinusoidal functions plus a base line. Given the number of sinusoidal functions which is denoted as <italic>K</italic>, a set of simple and consistent estimates of frequencies, phases and amplitudes which form the sinusoidal functions are constructed mainly by the Bartlett periodogram. The estimates are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. Computational issues are discussed and it is shown that the frequency estimates have to be resolved with order <italic>o(T<super>-1</super>)</italic>  to guarantee the asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the estimates of phases and amplitudes, where <italic>T</italic> is the length of the observation period. The prediction of the next occurrence is also discussed. The proposed model is a finite approximation of the almost periodic process in terms of a finite value of <italic>K</italic>. In practice, the value of <italic>K</italic> is usually unknown, and we suggest to use the model selection criteria to determine <italic>K</italic>. Two criteria AIC and BIC are reviewed and discussed in the frame work of our model. Simulation and real data examples are used to illustrate the theoretical results and the utility of the model.

Life Cycle Analysis of the Production of Aviation Fuels  Using the CE-CERT Process
The global concern of the depletion of fossil fuels and the threat of global climate change has spawned efforts in the development of sustainable fuels. The production of aviation fuels need to have a low overall CO<sub>2</sub> life cycle emission profile (a 20% reduction from the petroleum-based fuel baseline), and, most importantly, meet the demanding fuel specifications required for aviation fuels. Synthetic fuels have been produced commercially via the Fischer-Tropsch process for several years using fossil based feedstock (e.g., coal, lignite). The products, as either blended drop-in or totally synthetic fuel, have been tested and shown to have properties meeting oil specifications when used as an aviation fuel for both civil and military aircraft. The goal for this research was to assess the technical viability of producing drop-in aviation biofuels from co-mingled fossil and carbonaceous feedstock using the CE-CERT process. The CE-CERT process has been shown to have higher efficiency than conventional gasification technologies when used with non-sustainable feedstock. A model of the whole production process has been built using the Aspen Plus process modeling software. Life cycle analyses (LCA) using a modified GREET model were then conducted based on the results of the process modeling. It is found that using biosolid as the sustainable portion of the feedstock, with additional carbon capture and storage (CCS), the CE-CERT process combined with synthetic aviation fuel production processes results in high fuel conversion efficiencies and very low GHG emissions. Biosolid mass percentage in feedstock should be higher than 17% to meet the GHG reduction goal. To have zero emission in the well-to-tank (WTT) process, biosolid mass percentage should be no higher than 23%. High biosolid mass percentage is not suggested for the process. A feedstock mass ratio of 75%coal/25%biosolid is quite ideal for the process.

Comprehensive Transit Performance Indicators
Transit properties increasingly provide multiple modes of transit service, creating a need for intermodal transit performance indicators. Transit performance indicators currently in use do not have the capability of comparing the performance of different modes. In addition, most indicators in current use incorporate only operating costs, while for many transit modes capital costs constitute a significant proportion of total costs. The research conducted reviewed the use of performance indicators by urban transit properties in California, and found that the most common measures in use are operating cost per revenue vehicle hour, operating cost per passenger boarding, farebox revenue per operating cost, passenger boardings per revenue vehicle mile, and passenger boardings per revenue vehicle hour. Three critical limitations to commonly used performance indicators are identified, and new intermodal performance indicators are proposed which overcome the limitations of current single mode indicators by incorporating mechanisms for comparisons of one mode to another, for rating the performance of systems which include multiple nodes, and by incorporating both capital and operating costs. The proposed comprehensive transit performance indicators are total cost per revenue capacity kilometer, total cost per revenue capacity hour, total cost per passenger kilometer, passenger revenue per total cost, passenger kilometers per revenue capacity kilometer, and passenger kilometer per revenue capacity hour.

The ability of plug-in hybrids to deliver environmental benefits will rely heavily on initiatives that reduce charging times and provide wider opportunities for charging outside the home. in this regard, we recommend enacting policies that 1) encourage affordable conversion from 120-volt to 240-volt charging at home and 2) provide for installation of 240-volt charging facilities at public and private parking facilities adjacent to major activity centers, like shopping malls and rail transit stations.

An Exploration of Activity Scheduling and Rescheduling Processes
The objective of this research is to examine processes of activity scheduling and rescheduling by experiments. Activity scheduling processes were examined by using a combination of mail surveys and telephone interviews. It was found that individuals’ schedules are hardly complete. Scheduled activities take place less than 50% of all executed activities. The incompleteness suggests that activity scheduling and execution are a concurrent process and the distiction between is vague. Activities with relatively high level of fixity (e.g., work activity, educational and organizational activities) are more likely to be executed than other activities. Routine activities are no more or less likely to be scheduled than non-routine activities. Attributes of activities differ substantially between scheduling and execution. In particular, the deviation between scheduling and execution in starting time appears to be smaller than that in duration. Two suggestions may be offered: individuals may be able to schedule starting time more precisely than duration or individuals may respond to unexpected events by adjusting activity duration first.
      Activity rescheduling processes were examined by asking subjects to talk aloud while completing controlled in-lab scenarios. It was found that the actual rescheduling processes deviate greatly from the ideal utility maximization framework. More specifically, it was found that subjects rarely assess the overall situation before rescheduling operations; rarely evaluate multiple alternatives that are available before rescheduling operations; rarely revise previously rescheduled activities; the search for rescheduling is multi-directional, but most forward-moving; and subjects are quite efficient in the process of arriving their final revised schedules.
      Based on findings on activity rescheduling processes, a structure of activity rescheduling was proposed. The proposed structure adopts Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth’s model structure of errand planning in that it consists of several independent cognitive specialists and the flow of operation is not pre-fixed. The theory of active choice set was also proposed, asserting that subjects select which activity to be rescheduled next based upon how recently this activity is assessed.

Identification and Functional Analysis of Bacterial-responsive Small RNAs and Their Targets in Plant Immunity
Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are geared to respond to the complexity of developmental and physiological processes and negatively regulated gene expression by guiding chromatin modification mRNA degradation, and translational repression of their targets. Increasing evidence indicates that host small RNAs play a crucial role during the plant-pathogen interactions. In the first chapter of this thesis, we reviewed pathogen-responsive endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs in plants. In addition, we discussed the important components involved in the canonical RNA silencing pathways, including dsRNA-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) Dicer-like proteins (DCLs), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) and Argonaute (AGO) Proteins. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules with 21-24 nucleotides and are found in most eukaryotic cells. In the second chapter of this thesis, we globally profiled plant miRNAs in response to infection of bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) in Arabidopsis and found 19 miRNA precursors that can yield multiple distinct miRNA-like RNAs in addition to miRNAs and miRNA*s. These miRNA precursor-derived miRNA-like RNAs are often arranged in phase and form duplexes with approximately 2 nucleotides 3'-end overhang. These miRNA-like RNAs are potentially functional at least under certain conditions.In the third chapter of this thesis, we identified 15, 27 and 20 miRNA families being differentially regulated after Pst DC3000 hrcC, Pst DC3000 EV and Pst DC3000 avrRpt2 infections, respectively, through the deep sequencing results from 13 small-RNA libraries. Some bacteria-regulated miRNAs targets have been annotated and believed to be involved in plant hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, including auxin, abscisic acid, and jasmonic acid pathways, which suggests the regulation of plant innate immunity through fine-tuning of multiple plant hormone pathways. Moreover, we discussed the procedural differences between sequencing-based profiling and small RNA Northern blot and stated the possibilities that cause the inconsistency.AtlsiRNA-1, as the first example of the long siRNAs identified in Arabidopsis, contributes to resistance against Pseudomonas syringae infection by degrading the negative regulator of disease resistance, AtRAP. How does AtRAP regulate defense response became the major focus of my study to elucidate the mechanisms of plant innate immunity. In the fourth chapter of this thesis, I further investigated the molecular mechanism of AtRAP by characterizing the subcellular localization of AtRAP and determining the function of C-terminal RAP domain in disease resistance.

Things Won't Get a Lot Worse: The Future of U.S. Traffic Congestion
Our current alarm about traffic congestion stems in large part from perception of trends: thirty years ago traffic flowed smoothly; today it crawls. If this trend continues, congestion will become gridlock. These perceptions lead to statements such as: "There is no point to building highways, new lanes fill up as soon as they are opened."
      I present evidence to show that such trend-based thinking is wrong because it ignores structural shifts in the demographics of auto ownership and use. At this time, auto ownership is effectively saturated: we are very close to the point where all the potential drivers have auto access. The ratio of autos per driver can continue to grow, but since it is only possible to drive one vehicle at a time, the growth rate of auto-use must decline to about the rate of population growth -- a rate which is 2.9 times lower than the rate we have experienced in the period since 1960.
      Thus, fatalistic prophesies about future gridlock have overstated the potential growth of demand for auto travel. That growth has already declined and it should level off to a rate which is only one-third as large as we are used to. This is a manageable rate, planning is possible.

Invasive Plants, Fire Succession, and Restoration of Creosote Bush Scrub in Southern California
Exotic annual plant species have invaded large regions of southern California deserts.  Certain areas have been especially impacted, such as the western edge of the Colorado Desert adjacent to Mt. San Gorgonio, Banning Pass, and Mt. San Jacinto.  This landscape is highly invaded due to relatively high winter rainfall compared to interior desert locales and elevated anthropogenic nitrogen deposition from urban areas to the west.  Invasive annual grasses, in particular, are abundant here and have fueled disastrous wildfires in creosote bush scrub (CBS) since the 1970s.  Invasive annual plants and fire pose major threats to the sustainability of CBS.  The purpose of this dissertation was to document the impact of fire on CBS perennial and annual plant components.  The ability of various restoration treatments to remove invasive annual plants and to promote native species in both burned and unburned contexts was also tested.  Fire disturbance was shown to dramatically reduce shrub species richness and diversity.  Fire also altered the vertical and horizontal vegetation structure of CBS.  Total shrub density returned to unburned levels within a decade or two after fire due to recruitment by Encelia farinosa, a relatively small, short-lived shrub.  Fire also increased the abundance of invasive annual plants.  These changes may result in a vegetation type that is more fire prone than unburned CBS.  Post-fire increases in invasive annual plants were also shown to decrease native annual plant cover and species richness.  However, if invasive annuals were removed after fire, then native annual plant abundance and richness increased greatly, resembling unburned, pristine stands.  Positive responses to invasive plant removal were also documented by native annual plant assemblages in unburned CBS.  Clearly, the combination of invasive annual plants and fire has a large negative impact on native plant components of CBS.  Fortunately, there is great potential to reestablish native annuals if invasives can be controlled.

Traffic-related air pollution exposures and changes in heart rate variability in Mexico City: A panel study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					While air pollution exposures have been linked to cardiovascular outcomes, the contribution from acute gas and particle traffic-related pollutants remains unclear. Using a panel study design with repeated measures, we examined associations between personal exposures to traffic-related air pollutants in Mexico City and changes in heart rate variability (HRV) in a population of researchers aged 22 to 56 years.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Participants were monitored for approximately 9.5 hours for eight days while operating a mobile laboratory van designed to characterize traffic pollutants while driving in traffic and &#8220;chasing&#8221; diesel buses. We examined the association between HRV parameters (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), power in high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF), and the LF/HF ratio) and the 5-minute maximum (or average in the case of PM2.5) and 30-, 60-, and 90-minute moving averages of air pollutants (PM2.5, O3, CO, CO2, NO2, NOx, and formaldehyde) using single- and two-pollutant linear mixed-effects models.
				
				
					
						Results
					Short-term exposure to traffic-related emissions was associated with statistically significant acute changes in HRV. Gaseous pollutants &#8211; particularly ozone &#8211; were associated with reductions in time and frequency domain components (&#945; = 0.05), while significant positive associations were observed between PM2.5 and SDNN, HF, and LF. For ozone and formaldehyde, negative associations typically increased in magnitude and significance with increasing averaging periods. The associations for CO, CO2, NO2, and NOx were similar with statistically significant associations observed for SDNN, but not HF or LF. In contrast, PM2.5 increased these HRV parameters.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Results revealed an association between traffic-related PM exposures and acute changes in HRV in a middle-aged population when PM exposures were relatively low (14 &#956;g/m3) and demonstrate heterogeneity in the effects of different pollutants, with declines in HRV &#8211; especially HF &#8211; with ozone and formaldehyde exposures, and increases in HRV with PM2.5 exposure. Given that exposure to traffic-related emissions is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, understanding the mechanisms by which traffic-related emissions can cause cardiovascular disease has significant public health relevance.

Essays on International Trade and Firm Business Strategies
Exposure to international trade has a significant influence on business strategies of firms. I focus on the relationship between the exporting activities and the importing of foreign inputs by firms, the influence of financial leverage of the firms on their decision to expand their international trading activities and whether pressure from foreign competition impacts the probability that firms will switch products in their product range. In the first chapter, I study the effect of the influence of the extensive margin of export status and the intensive margin of export sales on the extensive and intensive margins of imports of foreign inputs. Splitting the sample into EU member and non-EU countries, I find that the extensive margin of export status has a significant effect on the extensive margin of imports within both samples. However, it is only in the EU countries that I observe the intensive margin of export sales to have an influence on the extensive and the intensive margins of imports of foreign inputs. This may signify the existence of production networks between firms in the EU member countries. In the second chapter, I determine whether financial leverage influences firms to become two way traders rather than export only, import only and trade only within the national market. It is observed that the intensity of financial leverage is likely to inhibit expansion of trading activities of firms, particularly those that import only or trade only within the national market. Interestingly, firms that export only rather than trade two way are not significantly influenced by the intensity of the financial leverage. In the third chapter, I analyze the effect of the pressure from foreign competition on the decision of firms to introduce new products and on production costs as firms may add and drop products rather than add products only, drop products only and not undertake any product switching activities. I find that the effect of pressure from foreign competition is more likely to influence firms to add and drop products rather than add products only and not undertake any product switching activities.

Variability assessment and mitigation in advanced VLSI manufacturing through design-manufacturing co-optimization
Increasing variability in today's manufacturing processes causes parametric yield loss that increases manufacturing cost. In spite of the tremendous effort and enhancement from both manufacturing and design sides, problematic systematic variations still remain uncompensated. In addition, while new manufacturing techniques have been adopted to reduce variability by improving pattern fidelity in the subwavelength lithography regime, new techniques continually introduce new sources of variabilities. To mitigate any remaining or emerging variabilities, accurate modeling and assessment of the variabilities through detailed analyses of underlying physical mechanisms is essential. Appropriate optimizations in both design and manufacturing must be developed, based on comprehensive understanding of the benefits and costs of such new measures. This thesis first quantifies impact of guardband reduction on design outcomes, and resulting yield and cost, to objectively evaluate the true benefits of various guardband reduction techniques. Cost-effective guardband reduction techniques are then presented for both design and manufacturing. The proposed measures span multiple stages of design, manufacturing and implementation : (1) from basic circuit elements such as device, interconnect, logic gates and memory bitcells, to high-level design implementation phases such as logic synthesis, placement and routing, and (2) from mask generation and lithography, to post-silicon variation measurement. The innovative techniques proposed in this thesis can be grouped into three main thrusts : (1) variability modeling and mapping, (2) variation assessment, and (3) variability mitigation. In the variability modeling and mapping thrust, this thesis reviews various variation modeling techniques and proposes a novel variation mapping framework (based on compressed sensing theory) that reconstructs the details of multiple, simultaneously occurring systematic variation maps from measurements of a small number of naturally occurring timing paths within the design. In the variability assessment thrust, this thesis proposes techniques to quantify variability in advanced lithography techniques, such as double patterning lithography and interference- assisted lithography, and provides useful observations for designers and manufacturers to tradeoff quality of results versus design and manufacturing cost. In the variability mitigation thrust, this thesis presents three distinct approaches to explicitly mitigate variations and enable principled tradeoffs between design cost and yield. First, design-aware manufacturing process optimization provides optimal mask strategies considering parametric and defect yields, and optimal exposure dose maps considering design timing and leakage power. Second, manufacturing-aware design optimizations include a cell swapping-based placement optimization, timing yield-aware detailed placement optimization to mitigate impact of bimodal CD distribution in double patterning lithography, and development of a new 1-D regular pitch SRAM bitcell for interference-assisted lithography. Finally, design- manufacturing co-optimization includes a first-ever elucidation of the tradeoff between electrical performance and manufacturing cost for modern transistor fabrication

A BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR EXTREME VALUE ANALYSIS
Extreme value theory studies the tail behavior of a stochastic process, and plays a key role in a wide range of applications. Understanding and quantifying the behavior of rare events and the associated uncertainties is practically important for risk assessment, since such unexpected events can result in massive losses of wealth and high cost in human life. In this dissertation, we present a Bayesian nonparametric mixture modeling framework for the analysis of extremes with applications in financial industry and environmental sciences. In particular, the modeling is built from the point process approach to analysis of extremes, under which the pairwise observations, comprising the time of excesses and the exceedances over a high threshold, are assumed to arise from a non-homogeneous Poisson process. To relax the time homogeneity restriction, implicit in traditional parametric methods, a nonparametric Dirichlet process mixture model is presented to provide flexibility in estimation of the joint intensity of extremes, the marginal intensity over time, and different types of return level curves for one financial market. This class of models is then expanded to assess the effect of systemic risk in multiple financial markets. In this case, the process generating the extremes is modeled as a superposition of two Poisson process. This approach provides a decomposition of the risk associated with each individual market into two components: a systemic risk component and an idiosyncratic risk component. Finally, we extend the point process framework to model spatio-temporal extremes from environmental processes observed at multiple spatial locations over a certain time interval. Specifically, a spatially varying mixing distribution, assigned a spatial Dirichlet process prior, is incorporated into the model to develop inference for spatial interpolation of risk assessment quantities for high-level exceedances. The modeling approaches are illustrated with a number of simulated and real data examples.

Three Essays in Energy Economics
This thesis includes three chapters on electricity and natural gas prices. In the first chapter, we give a brief introduction to the characteristics of power prices and propose a mean reversion jump diffusion model, in which jump intensity depends on temperature data and overall system load, to model electricity prices. Compared to the models used in the literature, we find the model proposed in this chapter is better to capture the tail behavior in the electricity prices. 
In the second chapter, we use the model proposed in the first chapter to simulate the spark spread option and value the power generations. In order to simulate power generation, we first propose and estimate mean reversion jump diffusion model for natural gas prices, in which jump intensity is defined as a function of temperature and storage. Combing the model with the electricity models in chapter 1, we find that the value of power generation is closer to the real value of the power plants as reflected in the recent market transaction than one obtains from many other models used in literature. 
The third chapter investigates extremal dependence among the energy market. We find a tail dependence that exceeds the Pearson correlation ρ, which means the traditional Pearson correlation is not appropriate to model tail behavior of oil, natural gas and electricity prices. However, asymptotic dependence is rejected in all pairs except Henry Hub gas return and Houston Ship Channel gas return. We also find that extreme value dependence in energy market is stronger in bull market than that in bear market due to the special characteristics in energy market, which conflicts the accepted wisdom in equity market that tail correlation is much higher in periods of volatile markets from previous literature.

Genetic Dissection of the Ionome
Understanding how organisms control their ionome or mineral nutrient and trace element composition, could have a significant impact on both plant and human health.  Furthermore, associating the genetic determinants that underlie natural ionomics variation, with the landscape of the individuals that carry these genotypes, will provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation. We have employed high-throughput mineral nutrient and trace element profiling, using inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as a tool to determine the biological significance of connections between an organisms genome and its ionome. Our focus is on genes that control uptake and accumulation of mineral elements, including Ca, K, Mg, P (macronutrients in plant fertilizer), Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Zn, (micronutrients of significance to plant and human health) and As, Cd, Na and Pb (elements causing agricultural or environmental problems).  To date we have analyzed the ionome of over 120,000 Arabidopsis plants, 7,800 rice grains and 40,000 yeast samples. This includes several Arabidopsis forward genetic screens (Lahner et al., 2003 Nat. Biotechnol. 21:1215), a screen of 360 natural Arabidopsis accession, and a complete analysis of all the ~10,000 strains of the yeast full genome deletion and over expression collections (Danku et al., 2009 JAAS 24: 103-107). We have successfully used PCR-based positional cloning, DNA microarray based approaches, QTL and association mapping to identify numerous genes that control the ionome (for example Rus et al., 2006 PLoS Genetics  2(12): e210; Baxter et al., 2008 PLoS Genetics 4(2):e1000004; Baxter et al., 2009 5(5):e1000492). Association of variation in genes with the landscape in which these plants naturally grow is starting to reveal the genetic architecture underlying specific adaptations to the environment. We are also finding that specific ionomic “fingerprints” are associated with functionally related sets of genes, and also with the physiological status of the organism (Baxter et al., 2008 PNAS 105: 12081-12086). To maximize the value of this ionomics approach, we have developed a publicly searchable online database containing over 2,000,000 ionomic data elements from over 1500 different experiments (www.ionomicshub.org; Baxter et al., 2007 Plant Physiol 143: 600-611), and the database is being updated regularly.

<p>This study investigates the ethical climate types presented in the Korean tourism industry, the differences in the perceptions of ethical these climate types based on individual/organizational characteristics, and the influence of ethical climate types based on job satisfaction/ organizational commitment. Empirical findings of this study identify six ethical climate types and demonstrate significant difference and significant influence of the proposed relationships. This research contributes to the existing body of academic work by using empirical data collected from 820 respondents across 14 companies within the Korean tourism industry to demonstrate the relationship between actual ethical climate types and ethical climate related factors. The findings of this study identify the new factor ‘moral caring’, which describes an environment characterized by decisions that maximize collective interest but based on an individual employee’s personal values and ethics. Such a factor has important implications for the service industry, where face to face encounters typify the relationship between employee and consumer.</p>

Metabolic Engineering and Transhydrogenase Effects on NADPH Availability in Escherichia coli
The ultimate goal in the field of metabolic engineering is improving cellular processes in a rational manner using engineering design principles and molecular biology techniques.  The syntheses of several industrially useful compounds are cofactor-dependent.  The reducing equivalent NADPH is required in several enzymatic reactions leading up to the synthesis of high-value compounds like polymers, chiral alcohols, and antibiotics.  However, it’s a highly costly compound with limited intracellular availability.  This study focuses on the genetic manipulation of a whole-cell system using the two transhydrogenase isoforms pntAB and udhA.  Two model systems are used: 1) the production of (S)-2-chloropropionate and 2) the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate).  Results suggest that the presence of udhA increases product yield and NADPH availability while the presence of pntAB has the opposite effect.  A maximum product yield of 1.4 mole-product/mole-glucose was achieved aerobically in a pntAB-deletion strain with udhA overexpression, a 150% improvement over the wild-type control strain.

Toward Effective Transportation Policy
For those concerned about energy use and greenhouse gases in the transport sector, virtually all trends are in the wrong direction -- in the US as well as in most other countries of the world:
      •Transit market share continues to drop, now accounting for less than 2% of passenger travel in the US;
      •vehicle use and ownership continues to set new records every year, with each licensed driver in the US now owning 1.1 vehicles and driving over 14,000 miles per year on average;
      •vehicles are getting larger and heavier every year;
      •fuel economy of new vehicles is worsening and is now at its lowest level in the US since the early 1980s;
      •GHG emissions from transportation are increasing at 2% per year in the US and at similar or higher rates in virtually all countries with expanding economies;
      •transportation accounts for an increasing share of increasing CO2 emissions virtually everywhere (increasing from 16.9% of worldwide total in 1971 to over 20% today).
      These trends are disturbing, but not unchangeable. Indeed, the potential for energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction in transportation is huge. The many strategies for doing so may be clustered into three groups:
      •reduce vehicle travel;
      •improve conventional vehicle technology; and
      •introduce advanced technologies and low-carbon fuels.
      All three are important. The first, reductions in vehicle travel, are desirable for a variety of reasons, and certainly merit strong support. But in terms of GHG reductions, technology-based strategies (the 2nd and 3rd strategies) are likely to be far more effective, especially in the US and probably in all OECD countries. Very large reductions are possible with improvements in conventional vehicle technology, and even greater reductions are possible with emerging electric-drive technologies and low-carbon fuels.

Dynamic Container Leasing and  in Intermodal Freight Transportation
We study the multi-period container leasing and load acceptance problem in intermodal freight transportation, where the container capacity could be replenished before allocated to load orders with different profit levels. The container leasing decision is exogenously determined by the initial container inventory left unused from last period and the returned containers in the current period. The load acceptance decision involves trade-offs between accepting the order now or reserve the container for potential high profit level order in the future. Our objective is to characterize the optimal policies in order to maximize the total profit. The two-stage sequential decision problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming problem. We show the optimal leasing quantity follows a base-stock policy and the optimal allocation for different class of demand follows a rationing policy. We further study the impact of demand variability on the optimal policy. Given stochastically higher demand in the future, both total profit and marginal value increase. Such change in demand also results in a higher leasing threshold and a higher rationing level for each demand class.

This paper addresses the question of whether office buildings near BART stations command higher rents or achieve higher occupancy levels than their more distant competitors. Contemporary urban economics suggests that they should: that office buildings near transit stations should have a competitive advantage over more distant buildings, and that such advantages should translate into higher rents, higher occupancy rates, and ultimately higher building values. Contrasted with this view is that of the commercial real estate broker, that mass transit accessibility is one of many building features which, depending on current market conditions, may or may not be rewarded in the marketplace.

When I stage managed Sexual Selection, I stepped into the world of non-traditional theatre. With the trust of the two directors, I became an integral member of the collaborative team, developing a strong emotional connection to the work. That production was a transformative experience and I discovered a love for working in highly collaborative environments, allowing me to broaden the scope of my involvement as a stage manager. Over the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to work on dance and an international project. I deepened my understanding of the importance of communication, embracing the language of choreographers and connecting with dancers who did not speak English. I opened myself to new ways of creating theatre and expanded my collaborative vocabulary. With this new approach, I returned to the straight play for my thesis production. The skills I developed in my non-traditional theatre experiences translated into my work on Hedda Gabler. The strong role I assumed helped me to truly evolve my voice as a stage manager. I positioned myself at the center of the collaboration and was embraced by the company as a steady force throughout the process.

Isobutyraldehyde production from Escherichia coli by removing aldehyde reductase activity
AbstractBackgroundIncreasing global demand and reliance on petroleum-derived chemicals will necessitate alternative sources for chemical feedstocks. Currently, 99% of chemical feedstocks are derived from petroleum and natural gas. Renewable methods for producing important chemical feedstocks largely remain unaddressed. Synthetic biology enables the renewable production of various chemicals from microorganisms by constructing unique metabolic pathways. Here, we engineer Escherichia coli for the production of isobutyraldehyde, which can be readily converted to various hydrocarbons currently derived from petroleum such as isobutyric acid, acetal, oxime and imine using existing chemical catalysis. Isobutyraldehyde can be readily stripped from cultures during production, which reduces toxic effects of isobutyraldehyde.ResultsWe adopted the isobutanol pathway previously constructed in E. coli, neglecting the last step in the pathway where isobutyraldehyde is converted to isobutanol. However, this strain still overwhelmingly produced isobutanol (1.5&#8201;g/L/OD600 (isobutanol) vs 0.14&#8201;g/L/OD600 (isobutyraldehyde)). Next, we deleted yqhD which encodes a broad-substrate range aldehyde reductase known to be active toward isobutyraldehyde. This strain produced isobutanol and isobutyraldehyde at a near 1:1 ratio, indicating further native isobutyraldehyde reductase (IBR) activity in E. coli. To further eliminate isobutanol formation, we set out to identify and remove the remaining IBRs from the E. coli genome. We identified 7 annotated genes coding for IBRs that could be active toward isobutyraldehyde: adhP, eutG, yiaY, yjgB, betA, fucO, eutE. Individual deletions of the genes yielded only marginal improvements. Therefore, we sequentially deleted all seven of the genes and assessed production. The combined deletions greatly increased isobutyraldehyde production (1.5&#8201;g/L/OD600) and decreased isobutanol production (0.4&#8201;g/L/OD600). By assessing production by overexpression of each candidate IBR, we reveal that AdhP, EutG, YjgB, and FucO are active toward isobutyraldehyde. Finally, we assessed long-term isobutyraldehyde production of our best strain containing a total of 15 gene deletions using a gas stripping system with in situ product removal, resulting in a final titer of 35&#8201;g/L after 5&#8201;days.ConclusionsIn this work, we optimized E. coli for the production of the important chemical feedstock isobutyraldehyde by the removal of IBRs. Long-term production yielded industrially relevant titers of isobutyraldehyde with in situ product removal. The mutational load imparted on E. coli in this work demonstrates the versatility of metabolic engineering for strain improvements.

Bayesian Analysis of  Errors-in-Variables Growth Curve Models
We propose analyzing our data with a model that exhibits errors-in-variables (EIV) in auxiliary information and which has an autoregressive covariance structure using a Bayesian methodology. The incorporation of these components into a model is often necessary and realistic in the study of many statistical problems. However, such an analysis usually mandates many simplifying and restrictive assumptions, especially when using a traditional probabilistic approach. Much research has been accumulated in this area. We will show that by taking a Bayesian approach, we can effectively deal with the complexity of these types of models. Such an approach cannot be found in the literature. In fitting statistical models for the analysis of growth data, many curves and/or models have been proposed. We have collected an exhaustive list of the most important and frequently used growth curves, some of which are used in our model analysis. A motivating example is presented to show the applicability of our general approach. In addition, auxiliary covariates, both qualitative and quantitative, can be added into our model as an extension.  These EIV growth curves with auxiliary covariates provide a very general framework for practical application. We give several illustrative examples demonstrating how a Bayesian approach using MCMC (Metropolis Hastings in Gibbs sampler) techniques and goodness of fit statistics for model selections can be utilized in our analysis. Highest Density Regions (HDR's) are also used  to facilitate Bayesian estimation and inference in these examples. Multivariate growth curve models are presented and detailed to study the relationship of the variables in models.In the final chapter, we present growth curve models with auxiliary variables containing uncertain data distributions (i.e. mixtures of standard components, such as normal distributions) using Dirichlet Process Priors (DPP, which are composed of discrete and continuous components). We show that DPPs are appropriate in determining the number of components and in estimating the parameters simultaneously, and are especially useful and advantageous in the aforementioned multimodal scenario with respect to the goodness of fit of the model.

Introduction: Mid-level providers (MLP) are extensively used in staffing emergency departments (ED). We sought to compare the productivity of MLPs staffing a low-acuity and high-acuity area of a community ED.
      Methods: This is a retrospective review of MLP productivity at a single center 42,000-volume community ED from July 2009 to September 2010. MLPs staffed day shifts (8AM-6PM or 10AM-10PM) in high- and low-acuity sections of the ED. We used two-tailed T-test to compare patients/hour, relative value units (RVUs)/hour, and RVUs/patient between the 2 MLP groups.
      Results: We included 49 low-acuity and 55 high-acuity shifts in this study. During the study period, MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts treated a mean of 2.7 patients/hour (confidence interval CI +/- 0.23), while those staffing high-acuity shifts treated a mean of 1.56 patients/hour (CI +/- 0.14, P < 0.0001). MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts generated a mean of 4.45 RVUs/hour (CI +/- 0.34) compared to 3.19 RVUs/hour (CI +/-0.29) for those staffing high-acuity shifts (P < 0.0001). MLPs staffing low-acuity shifts generated a mean of 1.68 RVUs/patient (CI +/- 0.06) while those staffing high-acuity shifts generated a mean RVUs/patient of 2.05 (CI +/- 0.09, P < 0.0001).
      Conclusion: MLPs staffing a low-acuity area treated more patients/hour and generated more RVUs/hour than when staffing a high-acuity area. West J Emerg Med.

Compulsory Ridesharing in Los Angeles
Americans often look to Southern California as a place where lifestyle trends are born. Now, ironically, the land that has long glorified the car culture is galvanizing commuting behavior and encouraging abstinence from the once-respectable custom of solo driving. The catalyst for this behavioral change is Regulation XV, adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in 1987. Also known as "The Commuter Program," Regulation XV requires all public and private employers (firms, government agencies, schools, hospitals, etc.) with at least 100 employees at any work site to devise commute alternatives for employees and to reduce the number of people driving alone to work.

A Model of Household Demand for Activity Participation and Mobility
With modern multivariate statistical methods and activity-diary (time-use) data sets, it is possible to model household mobility decisions as being derived from decisions to participate in activities at various locations.  We show how this can be accomplished by specifying activity participation by activity type and location as endogenous variables, with a simple locational distinction of “at home” versus “out of home.”  The activity participation variables are then combined in a model system of simultaneous equations with variables that measure mobility demand:  travel times by mode, household vehicle ownership and household vehicle utilization.  We specify the model in terms of latent, multivariate normally distributed choice variables, and this treatment solves estimation problems associated with censored and ordinal observed endogenous variables.  The estimation method provides accurate goodness-of-fit model evaluation and hypothesis testing.  Results are shown from a model estimated using two-day activity diary data for male and female household heads and associated accessibility data collected in the Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. Metropolitan Area in 1994.  The model system can be used in conjunction with conventional travel demand models, to provide forecasts of the effects of factors such as accessibility and in-home work, on travel demand by mode, car ownership, and car vehicle miles of travel.  This type of model system has the potential of replacing some existing demand forecasting models.

Determinants of intertwining operators between genuine principal series representations of nonlinear real split groups
Classification of "small K-types" for the connected, simply connected split real form of simple Lie type other than type C_n is obtained via Clifford algebras which completes the list of all small K-types of dim > 1 for the connected, simply connected split real form of simple Lie types. An analog, P̂xi, of Kostant's P̂gamma matrix is defined for a K-type V_xi of principal series admitting a small K-type, and a product formula of the determinant of P̂xi over the rank one subgroups corresponding to the reduced restricted roots is proved. The product formula and the relationship between P̂xi and intertwining operator between the genuine principal series representations give a method to compute the shift factors of Vogan and Wallach's generalization of Leslie Cohn's determinant formula for the restriction of the intertwining operator to a K-isotypic component given in terms of ratios of classical gamma functions. The determinant of the intertwining operator between the genuine principal series representations of widetilde SL(n,R) (n >̲ 3) is obtained as a ratio of classical gamma functions

[firm, home, higher, effect, market, military, chapter, country, demand, spending]

Essays in international trade and entrepreneurship
This dissertation contains four chapters of my research. In chapter 1, I show that higher military spending leads to higher exports of weapons. This is a manifestation of the home market effect - the prediction that countries with higher demand for a differentiated good will be net exporters of that good. The home market effect is specific to monopolistic competition models of international trade, and serves to distinguish empirically between these and comparative advantage-based models. I construct a monopolistic competition model with a military sector and a continuum of civilian industries, and derive empirical implications of the home market effect for arms and ammunition. I then use military expenditure as a measure of demand for military weapons to show that, indeed, countries with higher military spending as a share of GDP export more arms and ammunition relative to homogeneous, cheap-to-ship civilian goods. In my setup, military spending serves to introduce variation in demand across countries. This is an innovation over the typical approach in the literature, whereby consumers in different countries are assumed to have identical preferences, and home market effects stem from differences in goods' characteristics and country size alone. Chapter 2 tests the existence of the home market effect for construction materials, by using public infrastructure spending as a measure of demand. I construct a theoretical model that suggests goods with high transport costs and high differentiation are most likely to display home market effects. I test this prediction empirically for a handful of construction materials that meet the necessary criteria. As expected, I find that the home market effect holds for alloy steel and construction machinery. However, cement and glass display the opposite trade pattern, whereby increased domestic demand leads to reduced exports. I discuss potential explanations for this result. In the next two chapters, I examine the determinants of firm success. In chapter 3 (co-authored with Sarada) we find that new firms with higher network concentration, i.e. wherein initial employees have worked together previously, are on average larger, have higher wages and survive longer. This association increases with the initial size of the newly founded firm. However, we find a negative relationship between network concentration and initial firm growth. Finally, chapter 4 (co-authored with Marc Muendler and James Rauch) gauges the prevalence and performance of firms founded as employee spinoffs relative to other entrants. We find that size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms

Family hotel businesses: Strategic planning and the need for education and training
<p>Small businesses dominate the tourism and hospitality industry worldwide and are of critical importance for the competitiveness of destinations. Small/family hotel businesses are characterised by a number of specific business processes which generate particular training and educational needs. It is increasingly clear that small businesses are not miniature versions of larger once, but they have different structures, priorities and strategic objectives. This paper investigates a number of management areas, such as: planning, strategy development and behaviour in these enterprises, to determine skill and competency gaps. A survey of small family hotel businesses in Austria was carried out in 2003. Performance, growth and internal management procedures were assessed to analyse problem areas and to identify the lacking skills in the tourism industry. The results demonstrate areas of tourism training and education for family hotel businesses.</p>

Development in Aulacopleura koninckii - Glimpses into the Evolution of Body Organization in an Early Arthropod Clade
A concentration of well preserved, articulated juvenile and mature exoskeletons of the Czech middle Silurian trilobite Aulacopleura koninckii provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore the nature of exoskeletal growth and morphological variation during trilobite development. A new dataset selected via a comprehensive survey of the highest quality specimens offers improved resolution of original morphology by all measures considered. It confirms that meraspid size increase was exponential and the meraspid growth rate per instar was strikingly constant. The degree of variation in both size and shape among later meraspid instars was remarkably constant, and suggests that an active process channeled the meraspid development of both these attributes. The degree of precision of the growth control is remarkable given this species' well-known variance in holaspid trunk segment number. Size-related changes in the shape of the dorsal exoskeleton and of the segment-invariant cephalon were detected in the meraspid stage, but in the holaspid phase marked allometry was detected only in the trunk region, with the pygidium showing notable expansion in relative size. Meraspid cranidial allometry was subtle, with significant changes in instar form detectable only after several molts. Analyses suggest that this synarthromeric trilobite developed progressively without sharp transition throughout meraspid and holaspid ontogeny, except for the synchronous cessation of trunk segment appearance and release at the onset of the holaspid phase. We suggest that the remarkably tight control of the development of sclerite size and shape, and the gradual, "track-like" ontogeny of A. koninckii may have resulted from development in conditions of reduced oxygen availability in which physiological viability operated within narrow morphological limits.

The Use of Symbionts Expressing Pear PGIP to Delay or Possibly Prevent Development of Pierce's Disease
Polygalacturonase (PG) is produced by endophytic bacteria to degrade the pit membranes of xylem vessels to facilitate movement between xylem channels. Pear polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (pPGIP) is produced by the pear plant to block the movement of pathogenic bacteria in the plant. pPGIP is an agent being examined to protect against the pathogen X. fastidiosa from causing PD in grapevine. In the present study, candidate symbiotic bacteria were genetically altered to express pPGIP to inhibit the movement of X. fastidiosa and prevent development of PD symptoms in grapevines. Here I report successful transformation of P. agglomerans and X. fastidiosa with pPGIP plasmids, pMCS5-PGIP and pXF20-PGIP respectively. Stability of plasmid pMCS5-PGIP and pXF20-PGIP was verified by PCR analysis and gel electrophoresis. Expression of pPGIP by both of these bacteria was verified by Western blot analysis. However P. agglomerans pMCS5-PGIP did not secrete pPGIP, but Xf did secrete a very small amount of the protein. Moreover, pPGIP extracted from cell lysate and obtained from supernatant of P. agglomerans pMCS5-PGIP did not show inhibition of PG in a bioassay. Whereas, pPGIP extracted from cell lysate and obtained from supernatant of X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP did show inhibition of PG in a bioassay. This shows that in principle the delivery bacteria can synthesize and secrete an agent that could be use to prevent PD. The growth of X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP in planta is significantly lower than X. fastidiosa. The presence of PGIP was detected in total plant extracts and in the xylem fluid of the plants inoculated with X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP using Western blot analysis. X. fastidiosa and X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP were inoculated in to grapevines. Ten weeks after inoculation, X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP at 45 cm above inoculation point (IP) (8.96 ±1.04253 pg/µl) were found significantly less than X. fastidiosa (54.60 ±12.01012 pg/µl) at the same distance. Bacteria in double inoculation plants, which were inoculated with X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP at day 0 and again with X. fastidiosa at week 4 at 45 cm above the first IP, were found significantly lower than bacteria in plants with only X. fastidiosa inoculation. The reduction of bacteria in plants with double inoculation may be due to the present of PGIP. Over time, the migration of X. fastidiosa was found in further distance in the double inoculation plants than the plant with only X. fastidiosa inoculation. In conclusion this X. fastidiosa pXF20-PGIP may contribute to inhibition of the growth and movement of X. fastidiosa, and possible delay development of Pierce's Disease.

[scale, economy, cost, function, case]

Economies of Scale and Self-Financing Rules with Noncompetitive Factor Markets
When a firm or public authority prices output at marginal cost, its profits are related to the degree of local economies of scale in its cost function.  As is well known, this result extends to the case where some congestion-prone inputs are supplied by users.  I show that contrary to common belief, the result holds even when scale economies are affected by a rising factor supply curve.  In that case, constant returns to scale in production produces diseconomies of scale in the cost function, making marginal-cost pricing profitable.  Examples are provided for a monopsonist both with and without price discrimination.  In the latter case, second-best pricing is also considered:  profits then are not governed in the usual way either by returns to scale in production or by scale economies in the cost function, but some useful bounds are provided.

Time Varying Parameter and Fixed Parameter Linear AIDS: An Application to Tourism Demand Forecasting
<p>This study develops time varying parameter (TVP) linear almost ideal demand system (LAIDS) models in both long-run (LR) static and short-run error correction (EC) forms. The superiority of TVP-LAIDS models over the original static version and the fixed-parameter EC counterparts is examined in an empirical study of modelling and forecasting the demand for tourism in Western European destinations by UK residents. Both the long-run static and the short-run EC-LAIDS models are estimated using the Kalman filter algorithm. The evolution of demand elasticities over time is illustrated using the Kalman filter estimation results. The remarkably improved forecasting performance of the TVP-LAIDS relative to the fixed-parameter LAIDS is illustrated by a one-year- to four-years-ahead forecasting performance assessment. Both the unrestricted TVP-LR-LAIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS outperform the fixed-parameter counterparts in the overall evaluation of demand level forecasts, and the TVP-EC-LAIDS is also ranked ahead of most other competitors when demand changes are concerned.</p>

Photodissociation Dynamics of Free Radicals Using High-n Rydberg Atom Time-of-Flight Technique
The photodissociation dynamics of several important free radicals were studied using High-n Rydberg H-atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique, including the SD and CH<sub>3</sub>S radicals which belong to the sulfur system, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub> radicals which are related to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).      The first chapter discusses the photodissociation dynamics as well as its experimental methodology. The experimental setup of the HRTOF technique is explained in detail.      The second chapter investigates the UV photodissociation dynamics of the SD radical in vibrationally ground and excited states in the photolysis wavelength region of 220 to 244 nm. The anisotropy parameter is <italic>&beta;</italic>~ -1 while the spin-orbit branching fractions of the S(<super>3</super>P<sub>J</sub>) products are essentially constant. The dissociation mechanism and the bond dissociation energy are also obtained.      The third chapter investigates the near-UV photodissociation of the thiomethoxy (CH<sub>3</sub>S) radical at 344-362 nm. Two vibronic levels of the thiomethoxy radical dissociate to H + H<sub>2</sub>CS, while the others in the vicinity dissociate to CH<sub>3</sub> + S(<super>3</super>P<sub>J</sub>). H-atom angular distribution is isotropic. The dissociation mechanism is consistent with internal conversion mechanism.      The fourth chapter investigates the UV photodissociation dynamics of the propargyl (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>) radical at 230-250 nm. The photofragment yield spectra of the H + C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub> product channel are in good agreement with previous UV absorption spectrum. The H + C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub> product translational energy distributions are obtained as well as the dissociation mechanism. The H-atom product angular distribution is isotropic.      Chapter 5 investigates the UV photodissociation dynamics of the benzyl (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub>) radical at 228-270 nm. The H-atom photofragment yield spectra are in a good agreement with the previous UV absorption spectra. The H + C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub> product translational energy distributions indicate the production of fulvenallene + H. The H/D product ratios from isotope labeling studies suggest that the H/D atoms are scrambled in the photodissociation of benzyl.      Chapter 6 investigates the UV photodissociation dynamics of the allyl (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) radical at 216-238 nm. H-atom photofragment yield spectra suggest another dissociation channel CH<sub>3</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> in this region. The C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + H product translational energy release indicate the production of allene + H or propyne + H. The product angular distribution and dissociation mechanism are also obtained.      Chapter 7 discusses the future work on several radicals: phenyl (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) radical, 1-propenyl (CHCHCH<sub>3</sub>) and 2-propenyl (CH<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>) radicals.

We utilize externalfinance dependence measures in a series of cross-sectional regressions of manufacturing industries’growth rates covering 17 years. Net portfolio debt inflows are negatively associated with growth duringthe mid 1990s. The magnitudes of the negative effect of surges in portfolio debt inflows on growth aresubstantial in the late 1990s for a number of countries. The effect of debt inflows on growth in the 2000sis rather muted. Surges in portfolio equity inflows also exhibit a negative association with aggregategrowth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, the inflow surge during the financial liberalizationperiod, 1993-1994, is associated with a sharp decline in aggregate manufacturing sector growth, but a risein the growth of relatively more financially constrained industries. Equity inflows exhibited economicallysignificant positive impact on the growth of financially constrained industries, unlike their negativeimpact on the average manufacturing growth rate. FDI inflows exhibit a positive association withaggregate manufacturing growth during most of the sample period, both at the aggregate level andspecifically for the industries in need of external financing.

Product Differentiation on Roads: Constrained Congestion Pricing with Heterogeneous Users
We explore the properties of various types of public and private pricing on a congested road network, with heterogeneous users and allowing for elastic demand. Heterogeneity is represented by a continuum of values of time. The network allows us to model certain features of real-world significance: pricing restrictions on either complementary or substitute links, as well as interactions between different user groups on shared links (e.g. in city centers). We find that revenue-maximizing pricing, whether restricted or unrestricted; but this difference is mitigated by the product differentiation made possible with heterogeneous users. Product differentiation also produces some unexpected distributional effects: those hurt most by pricing may be people with  moderate rather than low values of time, and first-best pricing can cause congestion levels to increase for some users compared to no pricing. Ignoring heterogeneity causes the welfare benefits of a policy close to one currently being used, namely second-best pricing of one of two parallel links, to be dramatically underestimated.  Unlike first-best policies, second-best policies are in danger of losing much of their potential effectiveness if heterogeneity is ignored when setting toll levels.

Automated Demand Response Technology Demonstration Project for Small and Medium Commercial Buildings
Small and medium commercial customers in California make up about 20-25percent of electric peak load in California. With the roll out of smart meters to this customer group, which enable granular measurement of electricity consumption, the investor-owned utilities will offer dynamic prices as default tariffs by the end of 2011. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which successfully deployed Automated Demand Response (AutoDR) Programs to its large commercial and industrial customers, started investigating the same infrastructures application to the small and medium commercial customers.  This project aims to identify available technologies suitable for automating demand response for small-medium commercial buildings; to validate the extent to which that technology does what it claims to be able to do; and determine the extent to which customers find the technology useful for DR purpose.
Ten sites, enabled by eight vendors, participated in at least four test AutoDR events per site in the summer of 2010. The results showed that while existing technology can reliably receive OpenADR signals and translate them into pre-programmed response strategies, it is likely that better levels of load sheds could be obtained than what is reported here if better understanding of the building systems were developed and the DR response strategies had been carefully designed and optimized for each site.

Promotion of Prescription Drugs to Consumers and Providers, 2001–2010
Background: Pharmaceutical firms heavily promote their products and may have changed marketing strategies in response to reductions in new product approvals, restrictions on some forms of promotion, and the expanding role of biologic therapies.
Methods: We used descriptive analyses of annual cross-sectional data from 2001 through 2010 to examine direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) (Kantar Media) and provider-targeted promotion (IMS Health and SDI), including: (1) inflation-adjusted total promotion spending ($ and percent of sales); (2) distribution by channel (consumer v. provider); and (3) provider specialty both for the industry as a whole and for top-selling biologic and small molecule therapies.
Results: Total promotion peaked in 2004 at US$36.1 billion (13.4% of sales). By 2010 it had declined to $27.7B (9.0% of sales). Between 2006 and 2010, similar declines were seen for promotion to providers and DTCA (both by 25%). DTCA’s share of total promotion increased from 12% in 2002 to 18% in 2006, but then declined to 16% and remains highly concentrated. Number of products promoted to providers peaked in 2004 at over 3000, and then declined 20% by 2010. In contrast to top-selling small molecule therapies having an average of $370 million (8.8% of sales) spent on promotion, top biologics were promoted less, with only $33 million (1.4% of sales) spent per product. Little change occurred in the composition of promotion between primary care physicians and specialists from 2001–2010. Conclusions: These findings suggest that pharmaceutical companies have reduced promotion following changes in the pharmaceutical pipeline and patent expiry for several blockbuster drugs. Promotional strategies for biologic drugs differ substantially from small molecule therapies.

Sustainable Production of Biofuels: Plant Optimization and Environmental Impact
Many recent studies on the relative costs and benefits of biofuels have raised the need for a detailed and rigorous analysis of the operations of a biorefinery that is focused on optimization. The current thesis concentrates on the design and optimization of plants for producing biodiesel and ethanol from cellulosic biomass. We have performed numerical simulations combined with systematic parametric analyses to investigate the effect of various parameters on the overall material and energy balances of each biorefinery. The efficiency of the simulated processes was investigated by introducing and/or estimating various metrics in order to select the more beneficial directions for process improvements. Particular emphasis has been paid on heat integration and the design of highly efficient combined heat and power (CHP) units that generate the steam and electricity needed for the purification of biofuels and their co-products. 

The first part of the thesis is focused on biodiesel production via transesterification of soybean oil with methanol, under alkali-catalyzed conditions. We have analyzed the performance of several reactor configurations in order to improve the conversion of the reversible transesterification reactions. The effect of the oil to alcohol ratio has also been extensively explored. Furthermore, the energy requirements of the simulated process have been rigorously calculated. Since biodiesel facilities can be used either for small-scale, distributed applications or for large-scale production, we have explored whether it is more energy efficient to burn the glycerol-rich stream in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, or purify the glycerol and use it a feedstock for producing higher-value chemicals with further biotechnological processes. 

The second part of the thesis focuses on the production of cellulosic ethanol. Having developed the process model, a detailed parametric analysis was carried out to determine how the energy balances and overall efficiency of the biorefinery were influenced by changes in (a) the composition of the biomass feedstock, and (b) the conversion levels of the hydrolysis and fermentation stages. Furthermore, the requirements of the utility section of the ethanol plant were calculated. The utility section included a combined heat and power unit where by-product streams of the production process were utilized for energy generation. The parametric analysis indicated that these streams were in most cases an insufficient fuel source for meeting the energy requirements of the plant and thus, additional fuel was required (biomass, coal, or natural gas). The calculations of this section indicated a significant trade-off between ethanol production and external energy inputs, thus casting some doubt on the ultimate effectiveness of efforts to develop genetically modified energy crops (with high carbohydrate content) in order to maximize fuel production.
