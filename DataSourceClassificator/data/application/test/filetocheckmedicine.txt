Re-Conceptualizing Social Medicine in Diego Rivera's History of Medicine in Mexico: The People's Demand for Better Health Mural, Mexico City, 1953.
Diego Rivera's History of Medicine in Mexico: The People's Demand for Better Health mural has been interpreted as a representation of the Social Security Institution in Mexico, ancient and modern medicine, or mythological indigenous iconography relative to fecundity.  Interestingly, the mural's descriptive title overshadows Rivera's gritty commentary embedded within the depiction of ancient and modern societies of Mexico, specifically Mexico City.  The overall narrative chronologically demonstrates a generational shift from the indigenous Nahuatl or Nahua medicine and myth, mainly reproductions of early colonial imagery, to the modern nineteen fifties urban landscape and hospital setting.  Highly regarded as a creative interpreter of Mexican tradition and culture, Diego Rivera was not necessarily focused on representing accurate depictions of the ancient societies of Central Mexico.  Scholars must reconsider how to approach Rivera's art representing indigenous communities, in this case Nahua mythology and the social need for social security, and analyze their relationship relative to the push for modernity throughout the industrial era.  Rivera's artistic vision, coupled with his polemic character, produced a final mural that strongly conveys a multilayered dialogue between the artist, the viewer, and the past.  The mural History of Medicine in Mexico: The People's Demand for Better Health actively engages with the viewer through the ongoing regeneration of thoughts, movements, and actions that channel the fluctuations of modernity itself by questioning the institutionalized system and the organic indigenous perspective.  Interaction with the mural is necessary to open one's comprehension of not only Rivera's own personal struggle and realizations, but a nations' choice to move forward towards modernization.  Ultimately, Rivera's visual articulation of ancient and modern medicine allows the viewer to interact with, exchange ideas and potentially manifest the dynamic yet fragmented essence of an ambiguous modernity.

Emotion-based decision-making in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
Neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure range from severe intellectual deficiency to subtle attention and motor deficits. Diagnosis of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) can be challenging especially when physical markers are absent or prenatal histories are unavailable. In addition, due to neurobehavioral similarities, individuals with FASD and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be confused clinically, making differential diagnosis difficult. Research has recommended that identification of FASD be based on a neurobehavioral profile. However, some neurocognitive domains, including decision-making, have received little attention. Emotion- based decision-making involves strategic adaptation of behavior based on uncertain information and is essential for everyday function. Deficits in decision-making in individuals with FASD are suggested by neuroanatomical abnormalities and difficulty with everyday function. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a widely used measure of decision-making, simulating unpredictable reward and loss contingencies of complex decision-making. The IGT, which has not been used in alcohol-exposed populations, was administered to children with FASD (n = 21), ADHD (n = 22), and typically developing controls (n = 21). Further, because working memory, the process of temporarily storing and manipulating information, may be related to decision- making, a measure of working memory was included in the test battery. A mixed-model ANOVA demonstrated that children with FASD chose significantly fewer advantageous cards than control children. In contrast, children with ADHD were distinguished from controls based on processing frequency of rewards/losses on the IGT. Group decision- making performance was not accounted for by working memory performance in either the FASD or ADHD group. Collectively, these results suggest that children with FASD and ADHD have aberrant decision-making processes, although their dysfunction may be due to distinguishable mechanisms. While children with FASD were deficient in making decisions based on learning from exposure to past contingencies, children with ADHD differed from controls in their ability to tolerate unpredictable reinforcement schedules. Decision-making was found to be independent of intellectual function and other high order cognitive abilities, including working memory, and therefore should be a consideration in further research and clinical assessment of children with FASD and ADHD

[catheter, surface, urinary]

Early development of bacterial community diversity in emergently placed urinary catheters
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients have a urinary catheter, and catheter associated urinary tract infection is the most common nosocomial infection in the US, causing &gt;1 million cases/year. However, the natural history of the biofilms that rapidly form on urinary catheters and lead to infection is not well described.
				
				
					
						Findings
					
					We characterized the dynamics of catheter colonization among catheters collected from 3 women and 5 men in a trauma burn unit with different indwelling times using TRFLP and culture. All patients received antibiotic therapy. Results: Colony-forming units increased along the extraluminal catheter surface from the catheter balloon to the urethra, but no trend was apparent for the intraluminal surface. This suggests extraluminal bacteria come from periurethral communities while intraluminal bacteria are introduced via the catheter or already inhabit the urine/bladder. Richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) increased over time on the intraluminal surface, but was constant extraluminally.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					OTU community composition was explained best by time rather than axial location or surface. Our results suggest that catheter colonization can be very dynamic, and possibly have a predictable succession.

The biomechanical demands of standing yoga poses in seniors: The Yoga empowers seniors study (YESS)
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The number of older adults participating in yoga has increased dramatically in recent years; yet, the physical demands associated with yoga performance have not been reported. The primary aim of the Yoga Empowers Seniors Study (YESS) was to use biomechanical methods to quantify the physical demands associated with the performance of 7 commonly-practiced standing yoga poses in older adults.
				
				
					
						Methods
					20 ambulatory older adults (70.7&#8201;+&#8201;&#8722; 3.8&#8201;yrs) attended 2 weekly 60-minute Hatha yoga classes for 32&#8201;weeks. The lower-extremity net joint moments of force (JMOFs), were obtained during the performance of the following poses: Chair, Wall Plank, Tree, Warrior II, Side Stretch, Crescent, and One-Legged Balance. Repeated-measure ANOVA and Tukey&#8217;s post-hoc tests were used to identify differences in JMOFs among the poses. Electromyographic analysis was used to support the JMOF findings.
				
				
					
						Results
					There was a significant main effect for pose, at the ankle, knee and hip, in the frontal and sagittal planes (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.00 &#8211; 0.03). The Crescent, Chair, Warrior II, and One-legged Balance poses generated the greatest average support moments. Side Stretch generated the greatest average hip extensor and knee flexor JMOFs. Crescent placed the highest demands on the hip flexors and knee extensors. All of the poses produced ankle plantar-flexor JMOFs. In the frontal plane, the Tree generated the greatest average hip and knee abductor JMOFs; whereas Warrior II generated the greatest average hip and knee adductor JMOFs. Warrior II and One-legged Balance induced the largest average ankle evertor and invertor JMOFs, respectively. The electromyographic findings were consistent with the JMOF results.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Musculoskeletal demand varied significantly across the different poses. These findings may be used to guide the design of evidence-based yoga interventions that address individual-specific training and rehabilitation goals in seniors.

Central Nervous System Injury, Neurocognitive and Quality of Life Outcomes in Children with Brain Tumors Treated with Chemotherapy
Two-thirds of children diagnosed with brain tumors achieve long-term survival, and increasingly, children younger than 5-6 years at diagnosis are treated with high-dose chemotherapy protocols, delaying or foregoing cranial radiation. Intrathecal chemotherapy is associated with white matter loss, with systemic administration of certain agents also damaging healthy brain tissue. However, effects of systemic chemotherapy on the brain in children with tumors are unclear. Our first objective was to compare structural neural integrity with magnetic resonance imaging procedures in children with brain tumors (n = 7, mean age 8.3 years), treated with chemotherapy a mean of 5.4 years earlier, to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9, mean age 9.3 years). We also sought to explore the relationship between tissue loss, memory and executive functioning and quality of life (QOL) effects. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected using a diffusion tensor imaging protocol to evaluate tissue integrity throughout the brain, and in specific regions of interest. Voxel-based morphometry was used to determine differences between groups. In addition, we used neurocognitive, behavioral and QOL assessments. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps were obtained from normalized, smoothed images, and the two groups were compared using analysis of covariance, with age and gender as covariates. Higher mean diffusivity values emerged in patients over controls (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons), and were especially apparent in the central thalamus, internal and external capsules, putamen, globus pallidus and pons. No significant differences emerged in fractional anisotropy values between groups. The patient group had lower brain-to-CSF ratio (p = .03), assessed with volumetric analyses. Overall QOL, school functioning, and psychosocial functioning were significantly lower in patients. The majority of patients scored within the average range on memory and executive functioning tests, and behavior assessment did not differ from controls. Significantly higher mean diffusivity, indicating long-term damage, appeared in multiple areas in patients 5 years after treatment with chemotherapy. Early intervention may provide neuroprotection or repair to alleviate the long-term consequences of the original trauma and chemotherapy-related damage.

High prevalence of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy: a cross-sectional study
Abstract
				
			
			
				
					Background
				Despite changes in WHO guidelines, stavudine is still used extensively for treatment of pediatric HIV in the developing world. Lipoatrophy in sub-Saharan African children can be stigmatizing and have far-reaching consequences. The severity and extent of lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal children living in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.
			
			
				
					Methods
				In this cross-sectional study, children who were 3-12 years old, on antiretroviral therapy and pre-pubertal were recruited from a Family HIV Clinic in South Africa. Lipoatrophy was identified and graded by consensus between two HIV pediatricians using a standardized grading scale. A professional dietician performed formal dietary assessment and anthropometric measurements of trunk and limb fat. Previous antiretroviral exposures were recorded. In a Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbtiometry (DXA) substudy body composition was determined in 42 participants.
			
			
				
					Results
				Among 100 recruits, the prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy was 36% (95% CI: 27%&#8211;45%). Anthropometry and DXA measurements corroborated the clinical diagnosis of lipoatrophy: Both confirmed significant, substantial extremity fat loss in children with visually obvious lipoatrophy, when adjusted for age and sex. Adjusted odds ratio for developing lipoatrophy was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3 - 2.9) for each additional year of accumulated exposure to standard dose stavudine. Cumulative time on standard dose stavudine was significantly associated with reductions in biceps and triceps skin-fold thickness (p=0.008).
			
			
				
					Conclusions
				The prevalence of visually obvious lipoatrophy in pre-pubertal South African children on antiretroviral therapy is high. The amount of stavudine that children are exposed to needs review. Resources are needed to enable low-and-middle-income countries to provide suitable pediatric-formulated alternatives to stavudine-based pediatric regimens. The standard stavudine dose for children may need to be reduced. Diagnosis of lipoatrophy at an early stage is important to allow timeous antiretroviral switching to arrest progression and avoid stigmatization. Diagnosis using visual grading requires training and experience, and DXA and comprehensive anthropometry are not commonly available. A simple objective screening tool is needed to identify early lipoatrophy in resource-limited settings where specialized skills and equipment are not available.

Correlates of HIV and malaria co-infection in
Southern India
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Malaria and HIV co-infection adversely impact the outcome of both diseases and previous studies have mostly focused on falciparum malaria. Plasmodium vivax contributes to almost half of the malaria cases in India, but the disease burden of HIV and P. vivax co-infection is unclear.
				
				
					
						Methods
					HIV-infected subjects (n=460) were randomly selected from the 4,611 individuals seen at a Voluntary Counseling and Testing Center in Chennai, India between Jan 2 to Dec 31 2008. Malaria testing was performed on stored plasma samples by nested PCR using both genus-specific and species-specific primers and immunochromatography-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax.
				
				
					
						Results
					Recent malaria co-infection, defined by the presence of antibodies, was detected in 9.8% (45/460) participants. Plasmodium vivax accounted for majority of the infections (60%) followed by P. falciparum (27%) and mixed infections (13%). Individuals with HIV and malaria co-infection were more likely to be men (p=0.01). Between those with and without malaria, there was no difference in age (p=0.14), CD4+ T-cell counts (p=0.19) or proportion CD4+ T-cell below 200/mL (p=0.51).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Retrospective testing of stored plasma samples for malaria antibodies can facilitate identification of populations with high rates of co-infection, and in this southern India HIV-infected cohort there was a considerable burden of malaria co-infection, predominantly due to P. vivax. However, the rate of P. falciparum infection was more than 6-fold higher among HIV-infected individuals than what would be expected in the general population in the region. Interestingly, individuals co-infected with malaria and HIV were not more likely to be immunosuppressed than individuals with HIV infection alone.

Uterine Arteriovenous Malformation Presentating as  Sudden Heavy Vaginal Hemmorhage
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a common presentation in the emergency department and has a wide differential. Most presentations of DUB are in hemodynamically stable patients and can be evaluated as an outpatient. Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is one presentation that can result in a life-threatening medical emergency with unexpected sudden and massive vaginal bleeding. We describe a case of a 24-year-old female with sudden heavy vaginal bleeding requiring a blood transfusion, ultrasound evidence of uterine AVM, and a treatment method of expectant management using an intrauterine device in an attempt to preserve fertility.West J Emerg Med.

Fool¿s gold, lost treasures, and the randomized clinical trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						
							Background
						
					Randomized controlled trials with a survival endpoint are the gold standard for clinical research, but have failed to achieve cures for most advanced malignancies. The high costs of randomized clinical trials slow progress (thereby causing avoidable loss of life) and increase health care costs.
				
				
					
						
							Discussion
						
					A malignancy may be caused by several different mutations. Therapies effective vs one mutation may be discarded due to lack of statistical significance across the entire population. Conversely, expensive large randomized trials may have sufficient statistical power to demonstrate benefit despite the therapy only working in subgroups. Non-cost-effective therapy is then applied to all patients (including subgroups it cannot help). Randomized trials comparing therapies with different mechanisms of action are misleading since they may conclude the therapies are &#8220;equivalent&#8221; despite benefitting different subpopulations, or may erroneously conclude that one therapy is superior simply because it targets a larger subpopulation. Furthermore, minor variances in patient selection may determine study outcome, a therapy may be discarded as ineffective despite substantial benefit in one subpopulation if harmful in another, randomized trials may more effectively detect therapies with minor benefit in most patients vs marked benefit in subpopulations, and randomized trials in unselected patients may erroneously conclude that &#8220;shot-gun&#8221; combinations are superior to single agents when sequential administration of personalized single agents might work better and spare patients treatment with drugs that cannot help them. We must identify predictive biomarkers early by comparing responding to progressing patients in phase I-II trials. Enriching randomized trials for biomarker-positive patients can markedly reduce required patient numbers and costs despite expensive screening for biomarker-positive patients. Available data support approval of new drugs without randomized trials if they yield single-agent sustained responses in patients refractory to standard therapies. Conversely, new approaches are needed to guide development of drug combinations since both standard phase II approaches and phase II-III randomized trials have a high risk of misleading.
				
				
					
						Summary
					Traditional randomized clinical trials approaches are often inefficient, wasteful, and unreliable. New clinical research paradigms are needed. The primary outcome of clinical research should be &#8220;Who (if anyone) benefits?&#8221; rather than &#8220;Does the overall group benefit?&#8221;

Nicotine patches and quitline counseling to help hospitalized smokers stay quit: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
AbstractBackgroundHospitalized smokers often quit smoking, voluntarily or involuntarily; most relapse soon after discharge. Extended follow-up counseling can help prevent relapse. However, it is difficult for hospitals to provide follow-up and smokers rarely leave the hospital with quitting aids (for example, nicotine patches). This study aims to test a practical model in which hospitals work with a state cessation quitline. Hospital staff briefly intervene with smokers at bedside and refer them to the quitline. Depending on assigned condition, smokers may receive nicotine patches at discharge or extended quitline telephone counseling post-discharge. This project establishes a practical model that lends itself to broader dissemination, while testing the effectiveness of the interventions in a rigorous randomized trial.Methods/designThis randomized clinical trial (N&#8201;=&#8201;1,640) tests the effect of two interventions on long-term quit rates of hospitalized smokers in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The interventions are (1) nicotine patches (eight-week, step down program) dispensed at discharge and (2) proactive telephone counseling provided by the state quitline after discharge. Subjects are randomly assigned into: usual care, nicotine patches, telephone counseling, or both patches and counseling. It is hypothesized that patches and counseling have independent effects and their combined effect is greater than either alone. The primary outcome measure is thirty-day abstinence at six months; a secondary outcome is biochemically validated smoking status. Cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted to compare each intervention condition (patch alone, counseling alone, and combined interventions) against the usual care condition. Further, this study examines whether smokers&#8217; medical diagnosis is a moderator of treatment effect. Generalized linear (binomial) mixed models will be used to study the effect of treatment on abstinence rates. Clustering is accounted for with hospital-specific random effects.DiscussionIf this model is effective, quitlines across the U.S. could work with interested hospitals to set up similar systems. Hospital accreditation standards related to tobacco cessation performance measures require follow-up after discharge and provide additional incentive for hospitals to work with quitlines. The ubiquity of quitlines, combined with the consistency of quitline counseling delivery as centralized state operations, make this partnership attractive.Trial registrationSmoking cessation in hospitalized smokers NCT01289275.

How Long Are Patients Willing to Wait in the Emergency Department Before Leaving Without Being Seen?
Introduction: Our goal was to evaluate patients’ threshold for waiting in an emergency department(ED) waiting room before leaving without being seen (LWBS). We analyzed whether willingness towait was influenced by perceived illness severity, age, race, triage acuity level, or insurance status.
      Methods: We conducted this survey-based study from March to July 2010 at an urban academicmedical center. After triage, patients were given a multiple-choice questionnaire, designed toascertain how long they would wait for medical care. We collected data including age, gender, race,insurance status, and triage acuity level. We looked at the association between willingness to waitand these variables, using stratified analysis and logistic regression.
      Results: Of the 375 patients who were approached, 340 (91%) participated. One hundred seventyone(51%) were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving, 58 (17%) would wait 2 to 8 hours, and110 (32%) would wait indefinitely. No association was found between willingness to wait and race,gender, insurance status, or perceived symptom severity. Patients willing to wait >2 hours tended tobe older than 25, have higher acuity, and prefer the study site ED.
      Conclusion: Many patients have a defined, limited period that they are willing to wait for emergencycare. In our study, 50% of patients were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving the ED withoutbeing seen. This result suggests that efforts to reduce the percentage of patients who LWBS mustfactor in time limits. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(6):463-467

Long-Term Outcomes in a Family with Nephrogenic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis
We report a familial case of the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD), including 30-year followup data on two patients. The proband and one maternal uncle presented in their infancy with severe recurrent hyponatremia, and clinical pictures consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in the absence of an elevated ADH level. They were both confirmed to be hemizygous for the R137C mutation on the V2R gene (AVPR2), the same locus of the gain of function mutation demonstrated in the original reports of this condition. The proband's mother was identified as an asymptomatic carrier of this X-linked condition. Our case describes a favourable long-term outcome for NSIAD, in particular, successful treatment with oral urea during the infancy period, and with self-regulated precautions on fluid intake into adult life.

Neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of combination of anti-inflammatory drugs in the immature brain
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Inflammatory signaling elicited by prolonged seizures can be contributory to neuronal injury as well as adverse plasticity leading to the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and associated co-morbidities. In this study, developing rat pups were subjected to lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) at 2 and 3 weeks of age to study the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs (AID) on SE-induced hippocampal injury and the development of spontaneous seizures.
				
				
					
						Findings
					We selected AIDs directed against interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1ra), a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (CAY 10404), and an antagonist of microglia activation of caspase-1 (minocycline). Acute injury after SE was studied in the 2-week-old rats 24 h after SE. Development of recurrent spontaneous seizures was studied in 3-week-old rats subjected to SE 4 months after the initial insult.None of those AIDs were effective in attenuating CA1 injury in the 2-week-old pups or in limiting the development of spontaneous seizures in 3-week-old pups when administered individually. When empiric binary combinations of these drugs were tried, the combined targeting of IL-1r and COX-2 resulted in attenuation of acute CA1 injury, as determined 24 h after SE, in those animals. The same combination administered for 10 days following SE in 3-week-old rats, reduced the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures and limited the extent of mossy fiber sprouting.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Deployment of an empirically designed &#8216;drug cocktail&#8217; targeting multiple inflammatory signaling pathways for a limited duration after an initial insult like SE may provide a practical approach to neuroprotection and anti-epileptogenic therapy.

An Efficient and General-Purpose Technique for Grouping Hand-Drawn Pen Strokes into Objects
Engineers use sketches in the early phases of design because their expressiveness and ease of creation facilitate creativity and efficient communication. Our goal is to build software that leverages these strengths and enables natural sketch-based human-computer interaction. Specifically, our work is focused on creating algorithms that group hand-drawn strokes into individual objects so that they can be recognized. Grouping strokes is a difficult problem; many previous approaches have required the user to manually group the strokes. Others have used a search process, resulting in a computational cost that rises exponentially with the number of strokes in the sketch. In this dissertation we present a novel method for grouping strokes into objects based on a two-step algorithm that has a polynomial computational cost. In the first step, strokes are classified according to the type of object to which they belong, thus helping to create artificial separation between objects. In the second step, strokes of the same class are grouped into individual objects. Both steps rely on general machine learning techniques which seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal information, and which can be extended to new domains with no hand-coding. The single-stroke classifier used to separate strokes is the first in literature to perform multi-way classification, and it performs as well as or better than previous classifiers on text vs. non-text classification. Our grouping algorithm correctly groups between 84% and 91% of the ink in diagrams from four different domains, with between 61% and 82% of shapes being perfectly clustered. Our method runs in <italic>O(n<super>2</super>)</italic> time, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of points in the sketch. Real-world performance is improved with a conservative filter to eliminate consideration of distant strokes, and computation occurs incrementally as the sketch is constructed. Even without the filter, the computation for a large sketch containing over 700 strokes took less than 12% of the time required to draw the sketch. Experimental evaluation of our technique has shown it to be accurate and effective in four domains.

Medical Migration: Strategies for Affordable Care in an Unaffordable System
Approximately 45.7 million people in the United States are uninsured and unknown numbers of this population are underinsured, severely limiting their access to medical care. To address this problem, people use innovative strategies to increase their access through cross-border care options. The U.S.-Mexico border provides unique challenges and opportunities for healthcare in this context. The lower cost of medical and dental procedures and medications in Mexico makes that country an attractive alternative for low-income populations in the United States. Thus segments of the U.S. population practice transnational medical consumerism in an attempt to optimize their health by using the resources available in both countries. This practice has economic benefits for the people who access healthcare at an affordable rate and for the medical markets of the country providing the care. Drawing on data collected in the field in 2002, 2004, and 2005, this dissertation presents some of the complexities and dynamics of medical pluralism occurring at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Delayed accumulation of intestinal coliform bacteria enhances life span and stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans fed respiratory deficient E. coli
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Studies with the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans have identified conserved biochemical pathways that act to modulate life span. Life span can also be influenced by the composition of the intestinal microbiome, and C. elegans life span can be dramatically influenced by its diet of Escherichia coli. Although C. elegans is typically fed the standard OP50 strain of E. coli, nematodes fed E. coli strains rendered respiratory deficient, either due to a lack coenzyme Q or the absence of ATP synthase, show significant life span extension. Here we explore the mechanisms accounting for the enhanced nematode life span in response to these diets.
				
				
					
						Results
					The intestinal load of E. coli was monitored by determination of worm-associated colony forming units (cfu/worm or coliform counts) as a function of age. The presence of GFP-expressing E. coli in the worm intestine was also monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Worms fed the standard OP50 E. coli strain have high cfu and GFP-labeled bacteria in their guts at the L4 larval stage, and show saturated coliform counts by day five of adulthood. In contrast, nematodes fed diets of respiratory deficient E. coli lacking coenzyme Q lived significantly longer and failed to accumulate bacteria within the lumen at early ages. Animals fed bacteria deficient in complex V showed intermediate coliform numbers and were not quite as long-lived. The results indicate that respiratory deficient Q-less E. coli are effectively degraded in the early adult worm, either at the pharynx or within the intestine, and do not accumulate in the intestinal tract until day ten of adulthood.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The findings of this study suggest that the nematodes fed the respiratory deficient E. coli diet live longer because the delay in bacterial colonization of the gut subjects the worms to less stress compared to worms fed the OP50 E. coli diet. This work suggests that bacterial respiration can act as a virulence factor, influencing the ability of bacteria to colonize and subsequently harm the animal host. Respiratory deficient bacteria may pose a useful model for probing probiotic relationships within the gut microbiome in higher organisms.

Grade III or Grade IV Hypertensive Retinopathy with Severely Elevated Blood Pressure
Introduction: Hypertensive retinopathy describes a spectrum of retinal changes in patients with elevated blood pressure (BP). It is unknown why some patients are more likely to develop acute ocular end-organ damage than others with similar BP. We examined risk factors for grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy among patients with hypertensive urgency in the emergency department (ED) and compared healthcare utilization and mortality between patients with and without grade III/IVhypertensive retinopathy.
      Methods: A preplanned subanalysis of patients who presented to a university hospital ED with diastolic BP  120 mmHg and who enrolled in the Fundus Photography versus Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the ED study was performed. Bilateral nonmydriatic ocular fundus photographs, vital signs, and demographics were obtained at presentation. Past medical history, laboratory values, healthcare utilization, and mortality were ascertained from medical record review at least 8 months after initial ED visit.
      Results: Twenty-one patients with diastolic BP  120 mmHg, 7 of whom (33%) had grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy, were included. Patients with retinopathy were significantly younger than those without (median 33 vs 50 years, P ¼ 0.02). Mean arterial pressure (165 vs 163 mmHg) was essentially equal in the 2 groups. Patients with retinopathy had substantially increased but nonsignificant rates of ED revisit (57% vs 29%, P ¼ 0.35) and hospital admission after ED discharge (43% vs 14%, P ¼ 0.28). One of the patients with retinopathy died, but none without.
      Conclusion: Younger patients may be at higher risk for grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy among patients with hypertensive urgency. Chronic compensatory mechanisms may have not yet developedin these younger patients. Alternatively, older patients with retinopathy may be underrepresented secondary to increased mortality among these patients at a younger age (survivorship bias). Further research is needed to validate these preliminary findings. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(6):529–534.

Financial Implications For Physicians Accepting Higher Level Of Care Transfers
Introduction: Higher-level-of-care (HLOC) transfers to tertiary care hospitals are common. While this has been shown profitable for hospitals, the impact on physicians has not been described. Community medical center call panels continue to erode, in part due to the perception that patients needing transfer are underinsured. Surveys show that the problematic specialties to maintain call panels in community hospitals are neurosurgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, orthopedics and ophthalmology. This places greater stress on tertiary care hospitals’ physicians. The objective of this study is to describe the financial consequences to physicians who care for HLOC transfers across specialties and compare these with all patients from each specialty and specialty-specific national reimbursement benchmarks.
      
         Methods: Financial data were obtained for all HLOC transfers to a single tertiary care center from January 2007 through March 2008. Work relative value unit (RVU) and reimbursement were taken from a centralized professional fee billing office. National benchmarks for reimbursement per RVU were calculated from the 2006 Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) Compensation and Production Survey.
      
         Results: In this period 570 patients were transferred, 319 (55.9%) through the emergency department (ED). Reimbursement per RVU varied from a high of $74.93 for neurosurgery to $25.91 for family medicine. Reimbursement to emergency medicine (EM) for HLOC patients was 16% above the average reimbursement per RVU for all ED patients ($50.5 vs. $43.7). Similarly, neurosurgery reimbursement per RVU was 22% above the reimbursement per RVU for all patients ($74.93 vs. $61.27). The remainder of specialties was reimbursed less ($25.91 vs $69.60) per RVU for HLOC patients than for all of their patients at this center. All specialties at this site were reimbursed less for each HLOC patient than national average reimbursement for all patients in each specialty.
      
         Conclusion: Average professional fee reimbursement for HLOC patients was higher for EM and neurosurgery than for all other patients in these specialties at this site, but lower for the rest of the specialties. Compared to the national benchmarks, this site had an overall lower reimbursement per RVU for all specialties, reflecting a poorer patient mix. At this site HLOC transfers patients are financially advantageous for EM and neurosurgery. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(3):227–232.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in locally advanced prostate cancer: secondary analysis of radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) 8610
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Angiogenesis is a key element in solid-tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. VEGF is among the most potent angiogenic factor thus far detected. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential of VEGF (also known as VEGF-A) as a prognostic and predictive biomarker among men with locally advanced prostate cancer.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					The analysis was performed using patients enrolled on RTOG 8610, a phase III randomized control trial of radiation therapy alone (Arm 1) versus short-term neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation and radiation therapy (Arm 2) in men with locally advanced prostate carcinoma. Tissue samples were obtained from the RTOG tissue repository. Hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed, and paraffin blocks were immunohistochemically stained for VEGF expression and graded by Intensity score (0&#8211;3). Cox or Fine and Gray&#8217;s proportional hazards models were used.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Sufficient pathologic material was available from 103 (23%) of the 456 analyzable patients enrolled in the RTOG 8610 study. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment characteristics between the patient groups with and without VEGF intensity data. Median follow-up for all surviving patients with VEGF intensity data is 12.2 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no statistically significant correlation between the intensity of VEGF expression and overall survival, distant metastasis, local progression, disease-free survival, or biochemical failure. VEGF expression was also not statistically significantly associated with any of the endpoints when analyzed by treatment arm.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This study revealed no statistically significant prognostic or predictive value of VEGF expression for locally advanced prostate cancer. This analysis is among one of the largest sample bases with long-term follow-up in a well-characterized patient population. There is an urgent need to establish multidisciplinary initiatives for coordinating further research in the area of human prostate cancer biomarkers.

Bladder Bulge: Unifying Old and New Sonographic Bladder Wall Abnormalities in Ureterolithiasis
As long as CT remains the first line imaging modality in suspected ureterolithiasis, emergency physicians will continue to perform the majority of renal colic ultrasound studies in a search for hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis, however, is not always present and emergency physicians may not find it as useful as would be expected. Through this case series of seven patients, we present what we believe to be commonly present and easily acquired sonographic bladder wall findings in ureterolithiasis. These abnormalities are not routinely taught in emergency ultrasound and have not been reported in the emergency medicine literature. One variant, in fact, may be a novel finding unto itself. Due to their similar appearance, we propose to unify these findings under the name “bladder bulge.” This sign can be seen on axial views as an inward bulging or focal thickening of the bladder wall on the affected side, at the uretovesical junction.

Development of a decision aid to inform patients¿ and families¿ renal replacement therapy selection decisions
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Few educational resources have been developed to inform patients&#8217; renal replacement therapy (RRT) selection decisions. Patients progressing toward end stage renal disease (ESRD) must decide among multiple treatment options with varying characteristics. Complex information about treatments must be adequately conveyed to patients with different educational backgrounds and informational needs. Decisions about treatment options also require family input, as families often participate in patients&#8217; treatment and support patients&#8217; decisions. We describe the development, design, and preliminary evaluation of an informational, evidence-based, and patient-and family-centered decision aid for patients with ESRD and varying levels of health literacy, health numeracy, and cognitive function.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We designed a decision aid comprising a complementary video and informational handbook. We based our development process on data previously obtained from qualitative focus groups and systematic literature reviews. We simultaneously developed the video and handbook in &#8220;stages.&#8221; For the video, stages included (1) directed interviews with culturally appropriate patients and families and preliminary script development, (2) video production, and (3) screening the video with patients and their families. For the handbook, stages comprised (1) preliminary content design, (2) a mixed-methods pilot study among diverse patients to assess comprehension of handbook material, and (3) screening the handbook with patients and their families.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The video and handbook both addressed potential benefits and trade-offs of treatment selections. The 50-minute video consisted of demographically diverse patients and their families describing their positive and negative experiences with selecting a treatment option. The video also incorporated health professionals&#8217; testimonials regarding various considerations that might influence patients&#8217; and families&#8217; treatment selections. The handbook was comprised of written words, pictures of patients and health care providers, and diagrams describing the findings and quality of scientific studies comparing treatments. The handbook text was written at a 4th to 6th grade reading level. Pilot study results demonstrated that a majority of patients could understand information presented in the handbook. Patient and families screening the nearly completed video and handbook reviewed the materials favorably.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This rigorously designed decision aid may help patients and families make informed decisions about their treatment options for RRT that are well aligned with their values.

Emergency Department Crowding is Associated with Reduced Satisfaction Scores in Patients Discharged from the Emergency Department
Introduction: Emergency department (ED) crowding has been shown to negatively impact patient outcomes. Few studies have addressed the effect of ED crowding on patient satisfaction. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of ED crowding on patient satisfaction in patients discharged from the ED. 
      Methods: We measured patient satisfaction using Press-Ganey surveys returned by patients that visited our ED between August 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008. We recorded all mean satisfaction scores and obtained mean ED occupancy rate, mean EDWIN score and hospital diversion status over each 8-hour shift from data archived in our electronic tracking board. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was calculated to determine the effect of ED crowding and hospital diversion status on the odds of achieving a mean satisfaction score ≥85, which was the patient satisfaction goal set forth by our ED administration. 
      Results: A total of 1591 surveys were returned over the study period. Mean satisfaction score was 77.6 (SD±16) and mean occupancy rate was 1.23 (SD±0.31). The likelihood of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals was associated with an increase in average ED occupancy rate (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.59, P<0.001) and an increase in EDWIN score (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.55, P=0.015). Hospital diversion resulted in lower mean satisfaction scores, but this was not statistically significant (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05). In multivariable analysis controlling for hospital diversion status and time of shift, ED occupancy rate remained a significant predictor of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66, P=0.001). 
      Conclusions: Increased crowding, as measured by ED occupancy rate and EDWIN score, was significantly associated with reduced patient satisfaction. Although causative attribution was limited, our study suggested yet another negative impact resulting from ED crowding. West J Emerg Med.2013;14(1):11-15.

Plasma levels of osteopontin identify patients at risk for organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Introduction
               
               Osteopontin (OPN) has been implicated as a mediator of Th17 regulation via type I interferon (IFN) receptor signaling and in macrophage activity at sites of tissue repair. This study assessed whether increased circulating plasma OPN (cOPN) precedes development of organ damage in pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) and compared it to circulating plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (cNGAL), a predictor of increased SLE disease activity.
            
            
               
                  Methods
               
               cOPN and cNGAL were measured in prospectively followed pSLE (n = 42) and adult SLE (aSLE; n = 23) patients and age-matched controls. Time-adjusted cumulative disease activity and disease damage were respectively assessed using adjusted-mean SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) (AMS) and SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI).
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Compared to controls, elevated cOPN and cNGAL were observed in pSLE and aSLE. cNGAL preceded worsening SLEDAI by 3-6 months (P = 0.04), but was not associated with increased 6-month AMS. High baseline cOPN, which was associated with high IFNalpha activity and expression of autoantibodies to nucleic acids, positively correlated with 6-month AMS (r = 0.51 and 0.52, P = 0.001 and 0.01 in pSLE and aSLE, respectively) and was associated with SDI increase at 12 months in pSLE (P = 0.001). Risk factors for change in SDI in pSLE were cOPN (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.9-20, P = 0.03), but not cNGAL, cumulative prednisone, disease duration, immunosuppression use, gender or ancestry using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The area under the curve (AUC) when generating the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) of baseline cOPN sensitivity and specificity for the indication of SLE patients with an increase of SDI over a 12 month period is 0.543 (95% CI 0.347-0.738; positive predictive value 95% and negative predictive value 38%).
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               High circulating OPN levels preceded increased cumulative disease activity and organ damage in SLE patients, especially in pSLE, and its value as a predictor of poor outcome should be further validated in large longitudinal cohorts.

Algorithm development for corticosteroid management in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial using consensus methodology
Abstract


Background
The management of background corticosteroid therapy in rheumatology clinical trials poses a major challenge. We describe the consensus methodology used to design an algorithm to standardize changes in corticosteroid dosing during the Randomized Placebo Phase Study of Rilonacept in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Trial (RAPPORT).


Methods
The 20 RAPPORT site principal investigators (PIs) and 4 topic specialists constituted an expert panel that participated in the consensus process. The panel used a modified Delphi Method consisting of an on-line questionnaire, followed by a one day face-to-face consensus conference. Consensus was defined as &#8805; 75% agreement. For items deemed essential but when consensus on critical values was not achieved, simple majority vote drove the final decision.


Results
The panel identified criteria for initiating or increasing corticosteroids. These included the presence or development of anemia, myocarditis, pericarditis, pleuritis, peritonitis, and either complete or incomplete macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The panel also identified criteria for tapering corticosteroids which included absence of fever for &#8805; 3&#8201;days in the previous week, absence of poor physical functioning, and seven laboratory criteria. A tapering schedule was also defined.


Conclusion
The expert panel established consensus regarding corticosteroid management and an algorithm for steroid dosing that was well accepted and used by RAPPORT investigators. Developed specifically for the RAPPORT trial, further study of the algorithm is needed before recommendation for more general clinical use.

Education On Prehospital Pain Management: A Follow-Up Study
Introduction: The most common reason patients seek medical attention is pain. However, there may be significant delays in initiating prehospital pain therapy. In a 2001 quality improvement (QI) study, we demonstrated improvement in paramedic knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain. This follow-up study examines the impact of this QI program, repeated educational intervention (EI), and effectiveness of a new pain management standard operating procedure.
      Methods: 176 paramedics from 10 urban and suburban fire departments and two private ambulance services participated in a 3-hour EI. A survey was performed prior to the EI and repeated one month after the EI. We reviewed emergency medical services (EMS) runs with pain complaints prior to the EI and one month after the EI. Follow-up results were compared to our prior study. We performed data analysis using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests.
      Results: The authors reviewed 352 surveys and 438 EMS runs with pain complaints. Using the same survey questions, even before the EI, 2007 paramedics demonstrated significant improvement in the knowledge (18.2%; 95% CI 8.9%, 27.9%), perceptions (9.2%; 95% CI 6.5%, 11.9%), and management of pain (13.8%; 95% CI 11.3%, 16.2%) compared to 2001. Following EI in 2007, there were no significant improvements in the baseline knowledge (0%; 95% CI 5.3%, 5.3%) but significant improvements in the perceptions of pain principles (6.4%; 95% CI 3.9%, 9.0%) and the management of pain (14.7%; 95% CI 11.4%, 18.0%).
      Conclusion: In this follow up study, paramedics’ baseline knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain have all improved from 6 years ago. Following a repeat educational intervention, paramedics further improved their field management of pain suggesting paramedics will still benefit from both initial and also ongoing continuing education on the topic of pain management.

Examining Issues of Cost, Target Populations, and Collaborative Implementation of Medication Therapy Management Services Interventions
ABSTRACTThis dissertation consists of three studies, each applying a different method, to evaluate the use of pharmacists on the primary care team for people with chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.  Pharmacist interventions, also called Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services, are the subject of considerable current debate in health reform policy.  Major associations representing pharmacists are advocating for legislation that will establish reimbursement for MTM services for a wide range of chronic conditions. The studies included in this report address unanswered research questions regarding 1) whether enough evidence exists to conclude that MTM services interventions will result in cost savings and significant return on investment, 2) which patient populations might benefit most from MTM services interventions, and 3) what are the challenges associated with the implementation of these types of MTM services in collaborative partnerships with public and private community health entities. The first paper in the trilogy examined the existent literature on the cost-benefits of MTM programs.  The findings suggest that existing economic studies of MTM services are lacking in quality and additional high-quality cost-effectiveness research work needs to be completed before there is enough evidence to support reimbursement and policy changes. The second study considered whether different populations of people who have commercial health insurance, Medicare insurance, or Medicaid insurance who take long-term medications were more or less likely to receive medication monitoring. Presumably, those who take long-term medications but may not be receiving proper monitoring could benefit from interventions such as MTM services. Through quantitative regression analysis, it was determined that for populations on widely prescribed medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics - those with commercial insurance were almost three times less likely to be monitored than those with Medicare insurance. Also, significant effects on medication monitoring were found for important patient characteristic covariates including gender - females less likely to be monitored, age - older age associated with lower likelihood of monitoring, and income - higher income associated with higher likelihood of monitoring. The final study examined the efforts of a multi-sector collaborative partnership implementing an MTM services intervention using community pharmacists to assist with treatment of a population of school district employees and their dependents who have diabetes in San Diego, California. Contextual, resource, leadership, and internal conflict factors were evaluated with qualitative analysis to determine their effect on the abilities of the partnership to complete its initiatives. New contributions as a result of this research include developing a cost model to provide MTM services, quantifying relationships between health insurance status and medication monitoring, and revealing practical lessons on implementation of MTM models. This work provides an objective view on these subjects while adding to the growing number of studies on incorporating pharmacists on the primary care team.

The Shock Index and Early Recognition of Sepsis in the Emergency Department - A Pilot Study
Introduction: Screening for severe sepsis in adult emergency department (ED) patients may involve potential delays while waiting for laboratory testing, leading to postponed identification or over-utilization of resources. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria are inaccurate at predicting clinical outcomes in sepsis.  Shock index (SI), defined as heart rate / systolic blood pressure, has previously been shown to identify high risk septic patients. Our objective was to compare the ability of SI, individual vital signs, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to predict the primary outcome of hyperlactatemia (serum lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/L) as a surrogate for disease severity, and the secondary outcome of 28-day mortality.
      Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of adult ED patients at an academic community trauma center with 95,000 annual visits, from February 1st, 2007 to May 28th, 2008. Adult patients presenting to the ED with a suspected infection were screened for severe sepsis using a standardized institutional electronic order set, which included triage vital signs, basic laboratory tests and an initial serum lactate level. Test characteristics were calculated for two outcomes: hyperlactatemia (marker for morbidity) and 28-day mortality. We considered the following covariates in our analysis: heart rate >90 beats/min; mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg; respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min; ≥ 2 SIRS with vital signs only; ≥2 SIRS including white blood cell count; SI ≥ 0.7; and SI ≥ 1.0. We report sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values for the primary and secondary outcomes.
      Results: 2524 patients (89.4%) had complete records and were included in the analysis. 290 (11.5%) patients presented with hyperlactatemia and 361 (14%) patients died within 28 days. Subjects with an abnormal SI of 0.7 or greater (15.8%) were three times more likely to present with hyperlactatemia than those with a normal SI (4.9%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of a SI ≥ 0.7 was 95%, identical to the NPV of SIRS.
      Conclusion: In this cohort, SI ≥ 0.7 performed as well as SIRS in NPV and was the most sensitive screening test for hyperlactatemia and 28-day mortality. SI ≥ 1.0 was the most specific predictor of both outcomes. Future research should focus on multi-site validation, with implications for early identification of at-risk patients and resource utilization. West J Emerg Med.

Theoretical and observational analysis of particle acceleration mechanisms at astrophysical shocks
We analytically and numerically investigate the viability of Shock Surfing as a pre-injection mechanism for Diffusive Shock Acceleration, believed to be responsible for the production of Cosmic Rays. We demonstrate mathematically and from computer simulations that four critical conditions must be satisfied for Shock Surfing to function; the shock ramp must be narrow, the shock front must be smooth, the magnetic field angle must be very nearly perpendicular and, finally, these conditions must persist without interruption over substantial time periods and spatial scales. We quantify these necessary conditions, exhibit predictive functions for velocity maxima and accelerated ion fluxes based on observable shock parameters, and show unequivocally from current observational evidence that all of these necessary conditions are violated at shocks within the heliosphere, at the heliospheric Termination Shock, and also at Supernovae

Riding The Escalator – How Dangerous is it Really?
Introduction: About 10,000 escalator-related injuries per year result in emergency department treatment in the United States. Since the 1990s, a steady increase has been reported, but few statistics on escalator-related injuries have been published worldwide. We have therefore analyzed escalator accident statistics in admissions to our hospital in Switzerland since 2000. 
      
         Methods: Using retrospective electronic patient chart analysis, we included in our study patients >16 years treated over an 11-year period. We categorized patients in terms of gender, age and associated risk factors, and classified accidents according to day, time, location and cause. Resulting trauma was categorized according to type and location. We divided post-admission treatment into surgical and conservative, and into treatment as an outpatient, in a short-stay unit, or as a hospital admission. Women and men were compared using Fisher’s exact test. 
      
          
       
      
         Results: We identified 173 patients with 285 discrete injuries. Of these, 87 patients (50%) were women. Fifty-three (61%) of the women and 38 (44%) of the men were >60 years old (P = 0.033). Fifty percent of the men (43/86)of the men, but only 7% (6/87) of the women showed signs of alcohol intoxication (P < 0.0001). Accidents in women occurred predominantly on Tuesdays (19/87; 22%) between 12PM and 6PM (35/87; 40%), and in men on Saturdays (16/86; 19%) between 6PM and 12AM (29/86; 34%; P = 0.0097). Sixty-two percent (44/71) of the accidents were in public transport facilities and 30% (21/71) in shopping centers. The majority of injuries in women were to the lower extremities (49/87; 56%), while most accidents in men were to the head and neck (51/86; 59%; P = 0.0052). About half (90; 52%) of the patients were treated conservatively. Almost half of all patients (76, 44%) required hospital admission. Of those, 45% left the hospital within 24 hours of admission (short stay unit) and 55% stayed longer than 24 hours. 
      
         Conclusion: Escalator accidents can result in severe trauma. Significant gender differences in escalator accidents have been observed. Alcohol intoxication and age are significant risk factors in escalator-related accidents and might be possible targets for preventive measures. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):141-145.

'Usual Care' psychotherapy outcomes associated with therapist use of case management in the treatment of youths who have disruptive behavior problems
Children with disruptive behavior problems (DBPs) represent the majority of youth patients in community- based, usual care (UC) psychotherapy, and are at high risk for maladaptive adolescent and adult outcomes (Copeland et al., 2007; Earls, 1994a). Improved knowledge about effective treatments for this population is essential. Although there is movement towards implementing evidence- based practices (EBPs) into UC, there are numerous barriers. Among these is a lack of knowledge regarding psychotherapeutic processes in usual care. Researchers and practitioners suggest that case management (CM) is a widely-used, essential, and effective component of treatment for this population (Burns et al., 1996; Hoagwood et al., 2001; Garland et al., 2010). CM includes coordinating care with psychiatrists and school professionals, child protective services, and referring families to community-based resources (Ziguras & Stewart, 2000). The current study examines the association between intensity of therapist use of CM and six outcomes : (1) youth symptom severity, (2 &3) family functioning (parent and youth reports), (4) attendance, and (5 & 6) satisfaction (parent and youth reports). This study also examines potential moderator effects of therapist discipline and therapist experience on the relationship between CM and outcomes. Analyses were conducted using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to account for the nested structure of the data. Results suggest that while there was no first-order effect of CM on outcomes, therapist (N=77) variables significantly moderated the relationships between CM and outcomes. For Social Workers and therapists with more experience, higher levels of CM intensity were associated with a greater decrease in youth symptomatology (N=165). For Psychologists, more intensive use of CM was associated with greater improved family functioning. This study suggests that CM can positively affect youth outcomes in the context of UC when utilized effectively. This study is a first step towards examining the role of CM in community-based psychotherapy, and its contribution to outcomes for youth with DBPs. Results also have implications for future efforts to implement EBPs in usual care psychotherapy

U.S. Government Stables
The first military occupation at Jeffersonville, Indiana during the Civil War was in 1862 when two area regiments established a camp on a farm owned by Blanton Duncan. Lovell Rousseau, the organizer of the regiments, christened the camp “Camp Joe Holt.” The name was retained when it ceased to be a camp and became a hospital, called “Joe Holt Hospital.” Jefferson General Hospital, built to replace the one at Camp Joe Holt, opened 21 February 1864 and closed in December 1866. Located near Jeffersonville on land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the acreage reached down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The health facility had 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide, and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. The third largest hospital in the country and a showpiece for the Union army, Jefferson General reputedly was one of the finest in the United States for the care of wounded and sick servicemen. During the almost three years that the hospital was in existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals. First person accounts of life at the Jefferson General Hospital can be found in two separate diaries at the Indiana Historical Society Library. One is the published book, Hospital Pencillings by Elvira J. Powers. A volunteer and employee at the hospital, she wrote of the conditions at the hospital and her experiences there. The second is the collection SC2742, Louis C. Webber’s Diary, 1864–1866, a soldier who was wounded three times and was a patient there for a while.

Development of the patient approach and views toward healthcare communication (PAV-COM) measure among older adults
AbstractBackgroundThis study examines the psychometric properties of 9 items on the Patient Activation component of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) that assess how patients approach and communicate with their physicians. The MCBS is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of Medicare beneficiaries.MethodsWe analyzed MCBS data collected in 2002 and 2005 from 15,165 adults aged 65 and older. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood to estimate a polychoric correlation matrix on the 2002 data, and confirmatory factor analysis was performed using the 2005 data.ResultsExploratory factor analysis of the 2002 data showed a 2-factor solution: approach to interactions (5 items) and views about physician&#8217;s healthcare communication (6 items). Findings were confirmed using the 2005 data. Items were combined to form the Patient Approach and Views toward Healthcare Communication (PAV-COM) scale (range 1 to 100; Cronbach&#8217;s alpha of 0.75, and item-rest correlations between 0.33 and 0.54). Higher PAV-COM scores were associated with greater fulfillment of preventive health behaviors such as vaccinations and cancer screenings.ConclusionsThe PAV-COM measure is a valid tool for assessing patient approaches and views toward communication with physicians. This measure can be used to evaluate interventions to improve patient participation during healthcare encounters.

Reducing patient mortality in hospitals : the role of human resource management
Developing effective health care organizations is increasingly complex as a result of demographic changes, globalization, and developments in medicine. This study examines the potential contribution of organizational behavior theory and research by investigating the relationship between systems of human resource management (HRM) practices and effectiveness of patient care in hospitals. Relatively little research has been conducted to explore these issues in health care settings. In a sample of 52 hospitals in England, we examine the relationship between the HRM system and health care outcome. Specifically, we study the association between high performance HRM policies and practices and standardized patient mortality rates. The research reveals that, after controlling for prior mortality and other potentially confounding factors such as the ratio of doctors to patients, greater use of a complementary set of HRM practices has a statistically and practically significant relationship with patient mortality. The findings suggest that managers and policy makers should focus sharply on improving the functioning of relevant HR management systems in health care organizations as one important means by which to improve patient care.

Notch activated protective signaling in damaged mammalian myocardium
Rebuilding the human myocardium following pathological injury remains a significant challenge both at the level of basic research and clinical application. In the last decade, cell based therapy has emerged as a promising option for repairing damaged heart tissue, but a universally available treatment still eludes the medical profession. The work presented here investigates the cardiac response to injury in the context of crosstalk between stem cell and survival kinase signaling. The hypothesis of this thesis is that activated Notch participates in a HGF/PI3K/Akt mediated survival signaling response to cardiac injury, and that Notch signaling drives cardiac differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). Notch, a critical cue in the developing heart, is activated in damaged myocardium. Likewise, following myocardial infarction, c-Met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), colocalizes with activated in nuclei of surviving cardiomyocytes. HGF stimulates Notch activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) when applied in vitro and when injected into the intact heart. Moreover, exogenous Notch increases levels of cardiac phospho-Akt both in vitro and in vivo. Genetic tools were developed to manipulate activated Notch signaling and investigate regenerative/survival signaling crosstalk in intact heart as well as cardiac progenitor cells. A regulatable, intracellular Notch (KNIC) fused to the mutated estrogen receptor (mER) was created and tested for induction by tamoxifen. KNICmER was engineered into adenovirus for transient expression and lentivirus for stable integration into cardiac progenitor cells. Likewise, cardiac specific transgenic mice were created expressing KNICmER, and this construct will be subcloned downstream of the c-kit promoter to create a transgenic line with regulatable Notch activity in the progenitor population. These reagents will be applied in future studies aimed at improving the inherent reparative capacity of the mammalian heart as well as enhancing the regenerative success of adoptive transfer of cardiac progenitor cells into the damaged myocardium. Overall, this study demonstrates that activated Notch participates in cardiac protection following pathologic injury, in part by activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, and that activated Notch also impacts cardiac progenitors by pushing them toward a cardiogenic lineage

To Feel What Others Feel: Social Sources of the Placebo Effect
How is it that people in search of healing were at one time able to experience the therapeutic effects of "animal magnetism"? The evidence suggests that those who went in for treatments we would now call placebos didn’t feign their sensations but felt what they supposed others felt; they reacted as social beings. In one way or another, so do we today. But while the feeling of membership buoys us and may contribute to health, that is not all it can do, medically speaking. In this study a humanist looks at the placebo effect, taking into account both its history and its ambiguity and bringing out the more questionable potential of some health fashions, trends, and movements of our own time.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections in a worldwide context: an observational prospective study (CIAOW Study)
Abstract
				
				Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, and antimicrobial therapy, mortality rates associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections remain exceedingly high. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) has designed the CIAOW study in order to describe the clinical, microbiological, and management-related profiles of both community- and healthcare-acquired complicated intra-abdominal infections in a worldwide context. The CIAOW study (Complicated Intra-Abdominal infection Observational Worldwide Study) is a multicenter observational study currently underway in 57 medical institutions worldwide. The study includes patients undergoing surgery or interventional drainage to address complicated intra-abdominal infections. This preliminary report includes all data from almost the first two months of the six-month study period. Patients who met inclusion criteria with either community-acquired or healthcare-associated complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) were included in the study. 702 patients with a mean age of 49.2 years (range 18&#8211;98) were enrolled in the study. 272 patients (38.7%) were women and 430 (62.3%) were men. Among these patients, 615 (87.6%) were affected by community-acquired IAIs while the remaining 87 (12.4%) suffered from healthcare-associated infections. Generalized peritonitis was observed in 304 patients (43.3%), whereas localized peritonitis or abscesses was registered in 398 (57.7%) patients.
				The overall mortality rate was 10.1% (71/702). The final results of the CIAOW Study will be published following the conclusion of the study period in March 2013.

Individual patient data meta-analysis for the clinical assessment of coronary computed tomography angiography: protocol of the Collaborative Meta-Analysis of Cardiac CT (CoMe-CCT)
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Coronary computed tomography angiography has become the foremost noninvasive imaging modality of the coronary arteries and is used as an alternative to the reference standard, conventional coronary angiography, for direct visualization and detection of coronary artery stenoses in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, there is considerable debate regarding the optimal target population to maximize clinical performance and patient benefit. The most obvious indication for noninvasive coronary computed tomography angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease would be to reliably exclude significant stenosis and, thus, avoid unnecessary invasive conventional coronary angiography. To do this, a test should have, at clinically appropriate pretest likelihoods, minimal false-negative outcomes resulting in a high negative predictive value. However, little is known about the influence of patient characteristics on the clinical predictive values of coronary computed tomography angiography. Previous regular systematic reviews and meta-analyses had to rely on limited summary patient cohort data offered by primary studies. Performing an individual patient data meta-analysis will enable a much more detailed and powerful analysis and thus increase representativeness and generalizability of the results. The individual patient data meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO database (CoMe-CCT, CRD42012002780).
				
				
					
						Methods/Design
					The analysis will include individual patient data from published and unpublished prospective diagnostic accuracy studies comparing coronary computed tomography angiography with conventional coronary angiography. These studies will be identified performing a systematic search in several electronic databases. Corresponding authors will be contacted and asked to provide obligatory and additional data. Risk factors, previous test results and symptoms of individual patients will be used to estimate the pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease. A bivariate random-effects model will be used to calculate pooled mean negative and positive predictive values as well as sensitivity and specificity. The primary outcome of interest will be positive and negative predictive values of coronary computed tomography angiography for the presence of coronary artery disease as a function of pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease, analyzed by meta-regression. As a secondary endpoint, factors that may influence the diagnostic performance and clinical value of computed tomography, such as heart rate and body mass index of patients, number of detector rows, and administration of beta blockade and nitroglycerin, will be investigated by integrating them as further covariates into the bivariate random-effects model.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					This collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis should provide answers to the pivotal question of which patients benefit most from noninvasive coronary computed tomography angiography and thus help to adequately select the right patients for this test.

Drug Court Effectiveness: A Review of California Evaluation Reports, 1995-1999
Over the past two decades, drug courts have emerged as a viable alternative for addressing drug cases within the criminal justice system. In California, the Drug Court Partnership Program (DCPP) was created in 1998 and has supported and funded the development of drug courts throughout the State. This article reports on a review of California drug court evaluations through January 2000 conducted as part of an evaluation of the California DCPP. A total of 23 evaluations were collected. Seventeen were reviewed in detail, and six were excluded because they were internal reports rather than evaluations. A standardized review process was initiated which led to a scored rating of the evaluation reports. Results of this review support previous findings that drug court participants may experience reduced rearrest rates by 11% to 14% compared to nonparticipants. The largest reduction in rearrest rates appears among graduates. The graduation rates were between 19% and 54%. Costs and savings associated with drug courts were discussed but no conclusions were possible based on the findings from these evaluations. The evaluation of the effectiveness of drug courts presents unique challenges. This review concludes with a discussion of evaluation methods (e.g. standardizing rate calculations, term definitions) that would strengthen drug court research.

Characterization of Dental-Pulp Derived Islet-like Cell Aggregates and the Role of GABA
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a growing health concern with 8.3% of Americans suffering from the effects of the disease.  The use of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, known as stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), to generate insulin-releasing islet-like cell aggregates (ICAs) is considered to be a potential treatment mode for Type-I DM.  &#612;-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has recently been shown to be a strong secretogogue of insulin and increases &#946;-cell mass, reversing DM in rats.  This investigation focused on the use of insulin-producing ICAs to examine the roles of GABA in an autocrine excitatory secretory mechanism in pancreatic &#946;-cells.  The aim of this study was to investigate the role of GABA on insulin secretion utilizing the in vitro system, insulin-secreting ICAs derived from SHED.SHED was propagated using a 10-day differentiation protocol to generate ICAs.  Day-10 ICAs were stained with dithizone (DTZ) to confirm zinc-positive &#946;-cell phenotype.  Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on Day-5 and Day-10 ICAs was used to confirm the presence of pancreatic markers PDX-1, NeuroD, Nkx6.1, Isl-1, Glut-2, insulin, and GABAA receptors, and to demonstrate temporal changes in expression levels.  Day-10 ICAs were challenged with glucose and GABA to demonstrate dose-dependent insulin secretion using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results demonstrate that SHED ICAs were able to differentiate toward the pancreatic lineage.  Day-10 ICAs demonstrated a weak positive DTZ staining.  A statistically significant temporal increase of the &#946;-cell markers was shown from Day-5 to Day-10 ICAs (p<0.05) using qRT-PCR; albeit, Day 10 ICAs did not reach pancreatic marker transcript levels previously reported.  Day-10 ICAs did secrete insulin in response to glucose, however, not in a dose-dependent manner, possibly due to insufficient storage of insulin because of immaturity of the aggregates or a lack of intracellular zinc concentration.  Day-10 ICAs demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the transcript levels of GABA receptors (i.e. GABA&#945;-1, GABA&#945;2, GABA&#945;3, and GABA&#945;6), indicating that the aggregates may respond to GABA during challenge (p<0.05).  Preliminary results utilizing GABA in addition to glucose challenge indicates that GABA may increase insulin secretion by the ICAs; however, further studies need to be done to confirm this finding.  We conclude that SHED is capable of differentiating toward the pancreatic lineage and producing insulin; therefore, these cells may be a possible source for &#946;-cell replacement therapy in Type-I DM patients.

Neurobiology of insomnia as measured with FMRI
Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder afflicting adults, is diagnostically characterized by a chronic complaint of difficulty sleeping at night and a report of consequent impairment in daytime functioning. Despite this diagnostic requirement and the relative prevalence of daytime distress in patients with insomnia, studies to date have shown only limited evidence of objective daytime impairment in this population. This investigation tested a neurobiological compensation model which attempted to explain how patients with insomnia overcome cognitive challenges resulting from chronic partial sleep loss (utilizing FMRI). The proposed model suggests that patients with insomnia might increase cortical activation during cognitive challenge (relative to good sleepers) to "compensate" for their sleep loss and that this compensation would lead to maintenance of performance. Furthermore, this study examined the relationship between brain activation and performance and brain activation and daytime complaint in patients with Primary Insomnia. 24 subjects, 13 with Primary Insomnia PI (7 female, 6 male) and 11 good sleeper controls GS (5 female, 6 male) were studied in this investigation. Patients and controls did not differ statistically in terms of age (PI: 39.8+/-8.0 yrs; GS: 37.1+/-7.7 yrs) or estimated IQ (PI: 116.3+/-8.0; GS: 115.8+/-8.5). Results from the study showed several statistically significant findings, including : a) Patients with insomnia have more disturbed sleep and greater complaints of impaired daytime functioning when compared to matched good sleeper controls b) Patients showed no evidence of cognitive impairment as a result of their sleep loss and despite their complaints of impaired daytime functioning c) Patients exhibit differential patterns of activation during the performance of cognitive tasks relative to controls d) Differences in activation between patients and controls depended to a large degree upon the type of task and level of task difficulty (patients had greater levels of activation on attention, working memory, and learning of easy words, but less activation on inhibition and learning of hard words) e) Within the insomnia sample, individuals who performed better had greater levels of activation (similar to controls) on each task f) Within the insomnia sample those individuals who had the greatest complaints of impaired daytime functioning showed less activation on each task. Overall, the results of this study provide some evidence for the effects of sleep loss on neurophysiologic activation in primary insomnia. However, these findings may suggest that the proposed "compensation" model may not adequately explain the complex interaction between sleep loss, daytime complaint, cognitive function, and activation for this population

Factors associated with malaria parasitaemia, malnutrition, and anaemia among HIV-exposed and unexposed Ugandan infants: a cross-sectional survey
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Malaria, malnutrition and anaemia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in African children. The interplay between these conditions is complex and limited data exist on factors associated with these conditions among infants born to HIV-uninfected and infected women.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Two hundred HIV-exposed (HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers) and 400 HIV-unexposed infants were recruited from an area of high malaria transmission in rural Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was performed at enrolment to measure the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia, measures of malnutrition (z-scores &lt;2 standard deviations below mean) and anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;8 gm/dL). Multivariate logistic regression was used to measure associations between these conditions and risk factors of interest including household demographics, malaria prevention practices, breastfeeding practices, household structure and wealth index.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 20%. Factors protective against parasitaemia included female gender (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.66, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.047), mother&#8217;s age (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.81 per five-year increase, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01), reported bed net use (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.63, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.03) and living in a well-constructed house (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.25, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01). Although HIV-unexposed infants had a higher risk of parasitaemia compared to HIV-exposed infants (24% vs 14%, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.004), there was no significant association between HIV-exposure status and parasitaemia after controlling for the use of malaria preventative measures including bed net use and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis. The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were 10%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. HIV-exposed infants had a higher odds of stunting (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.23, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.005), underweight (OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.73, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.09) and wasting (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.29, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.02). The prevalence of anaemia was 12%. Risk factors for anaemia included older infant age (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.05 per one month increase, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.003) and having malaria parasitaemia (OR&#8201;=&#8201;5.74, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Compared to HIV-unexposed infants, HIV-exposed infants had a higher use of malaria preventative measures and lower odds of malaria parasitaemia. Having a better constructed house was also protective against malaria parasitaemia. HIV-exposure was the primary risk factor for measures of malnutrition. The primary risk factor for anaemia was malaria parasitaemia. These findings suggest the need to better target existing interventions for malaria, malnutrition and anaemia as well as the need to explore further the mechanisms behind the observed associations.

Clinical, epidemiological, and spatial characteristics of Vibrio parahaemolyticus diarrhea and cholera in the urban slums of Kolkata, India
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					There is not much information on the differences in clinical, epidemiological and spatial characteristics of diarrhea due to V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus from non-coastal areas. We investigated the differences in clinical, epidemiological and spatial characteristics of the two Vibrio species in the urban slums of Kolkata, India.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					The data of a cluster randomized cholera vaccine trial were used. We restricted the analysis to clusters assigned to placebo. Survival analysis of the time to the first episode was used to analyze risk factors for V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea or cholera. A spatial scan test was used to identify high risk areas for cholera and for V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					In total, 54,519 people from the placebo clusters were assembled. The incidence of cholera (1.30/1000/year) was significantly higher than that of V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea (0.63/1000/year). Cholera incidence was inversely related to age, whereas the risk of V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea was age-independent. The seasonality of diarrhea due to the two Vibrio species was similar. Cholera was distinguished by a higher frequency of severe dehydration, and V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea was by abdominal pain. Hindus and those who live in household not using boiled or treated water were more likely to have V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea. Young age, low socioeconomic status, and living closer to a project healthcare facility were associated with an increased risk for cholera. The high risk area for cholera differed from the high risk area for V. parahaemolyticus diarrhea.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					We report coexistence of the two vibrios in the slums of Kolkata. The two etiologies of diarrhea had a similar seasonality but had distinguishing clinical features. The risk factors and the high risk areas for the two diseases differ from one another suggesting different modes of transmission of these two pathogens.

Introduction: This study examined acceptance by staff and patients of a therapy dog (TD) in the emergency department (ED).
      Methods: Immediately after TD visits to a University Hospital ED, all available ED staff, patients, and their visitors were invited to complete a survey.
      Results: Of 125 ‘‘patient’’ and 105 staff responses, most were favorable. Ninety-three percent of patients and 95% of staff agreed that TDs should visit EDs; 87.8% of patients and 92% of staff approved of TDs for both adult and pediatric patients. Fewer than 5% of either patients or staff were afraid of the TDs. Fewer than 10% of patients and staff thought the TDs posed a sanitary risk or interfered with staff work.
      Conclusion: Both patients and staff approve of TDs in an ED. The benefits of animal-assisted therapy should be further explored in the ED setting. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):363–365.

Safety profile and pharmacokinetic analyses of the anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab administered as a one hour infusion
Abstract


Background
CTLA4 blocking monoclonal antibodies provide a low frequency but durable tumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma, which led to the regulatory approval of ipilimumab based on two randomized clinical trials with overall survival advantage. The similarly fully human anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab had been developed in the clinic at a fixed rate infusion, resulting in very prolonged infusion times. A new formulation of tremelimumab allowed testing a shorter infusion time.


Methods
A phase 1 multi-center study to establish the safety and tolerability of administering tremelimumab as a 1-hour infusion to patients with metastatic melanoma. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic and clinical effects of tremelimumab.


Results
No grade 3 or greater infusion-related adverse events or other adverse events preventing the administration of the full tremelimumab dose were noted in 44 treated patients. The overall side effect profile was consistent with prior experiences with anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Objective tumor responses were noted in 11% of evaluable patients with metastatic melanoma, which is also consistent with the prior experience with CTLA4 antagonistic antibodies.


Conclusions
This study did not identify any safety concerns when tremelimumab was administered as a 1-hour infusion. These data support further clinical testing of the 1-hour infusion of tremelimumab. (Clinical trial registration number NCT00585000).

Numerical analysis of airflow alteration in central airways following tracheobronchial stent placement
Abstract
				The computational fluid dynamics method, which provides an estimation of the pressure drop in the airway before and after the stent implantation, is proposed in this study. This method is based on the finite volume model. The pressure field was solved by the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed methodology was evaluated in seven health people (control group) and in fourteen patients who were assigned in two groups, in which one was tracheal stenosis and the other was bronchial stenosis. The results showed that the pressure drop after tracheal stent implantation became significantly smaller. For bronchial stent implantation cases, the airway resistance improved insignificantly.

Dynamics of Early Afterdepolarization (EAD)-mediated Arrhythmias
This dissertation is dedicated to understanding the dynamical mechanisms underlying early afterdepolarization (EAD)-mediated arrhythmias. EADs are a richly mined area of research that has resulted in little therapeutic benefit at the bedside since their first description in the early 1980's. In an effort to provide a fresh perspective on EADs, I take an experimental and computational non-linear dynamics approach to studying these arrhythmias that plague millions worldwide and are associated with significant cost burden and high mortality. Here, I show that the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism for generating EADs may be responsible for EAD-mediated arrhythmias in cardiac disease, providing new therapeutic targets and expanding the current concept of reduced repolarization reserve. Also, I provide evidence that certain pathological cardiac tissue substrates may exhibit the unique dynamical property of bistability (ie. switch-like behavior) in the form of biexcitability, the ability to switch between INa- and ICa-mediated propagation. This unique property of biexcitability may provide significant mechanistic insight into the seemingly paradoxical properties of certain EAD-mediated arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes (TdP), that is uniquely characterized by a slow rate and undulating QRS complexes on ECG. Lastly, I show that activation of KATP channels (inward rectifying K channels that open when cellular ATP levels fall) "flips the switch" from ICa- to INa-mediated propagation. Consistent with clinical observations of TdP and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), the majority of ICa-dependent reentries spontaneously terminate following KATP channel activation, with a minority of ICa-dependent reentries converting to INa-dependent reentries. These results suggest that in the clinical setting, KATP channels may serve as an "emergency repolarization reserve" to spontaneously terminate most episodes of ICa-dependent arrhythmias such as PVT and TdP, but may also facilitate the occasional degeneration of these arrhythmias to INa-dependent VT/VF. These findings provide a fresh perspective on EAD-mediated arrhtyhmias that may lead to novel therapeutics at the bedside.

Multigenerational epigenetic effects of nicotine on lung function
Abstract
A recent preclinical study has shown that not only maternal smoking but also grandmaternal smoking is associated with elevated pediatric asthma risk. Using a well-established rat model of in utero nicotine exposure, Rehan et al. have now demonstrated multigenerational effects of nicotine that could explain this 'grandmother effect'. F1 offspring of nicotine-treated pregnant rats exhibited asthma-like changes to lung function and associated epigenetic changes to DNA and histones in both lungs and gonads. These alterations were blocked by co-administration of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#947; agonist, rosiglitazone, implicating downregulation of this receptor in the nicotine effects. F2 offspring of F1 mated animals exhibited similar changes in lung function to that of their parents, even though they had never been exposed to nicotine. Thus epigenetic mechanisms appear to underlie the multigenerational transmission of a nicotine-induced asthma-like phenotype. These findings emphasize the need for more effective smoking cessation strategies during pregnancy, and cast further doubt on the safety of using nicotine replacement therapy to reduce tobacco use in pregnant women.

Increasing incidence of malaria in children despite insecticide-treated bed nets and prompt anti-malarial therapy in Tororo, Uganda
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The burden of malaria has decreased in parts of Africa following the scaling up of control interventions. However, similar data are limited from high transmission settings.
				
				
					
						Methods
					A cohort of 100 children, aged six weeks to 10 months of age, were enrolled in an area of high malaria transmission intensity and followed through 48 months of age. Children were given a long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net (LLIN) at enrolment and received all care, including monthly blood smears and treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated malaria, at a dedicated clinic. The incidence of malaria was estimated by passive surveillance and associations between malaria incidence and age, calendar time and season were measured using generalized estimating equations.
				
				
					
						Results
					Reported compliance with LLINs was 98% based on monthly routine evaluations. A total of 1,633 episodes of malaria were observed, with a median incidence of 5.3 per person-year (PPY). There were only six cases of complicated malaria, all single convulsions. Malaria incidence peaked at 6.5 PPY at 23 months of age before declining to 3.5 PPY at 48 months. After adjusting for age and season, the risk of malaria increased by 52% from 2008 to 2011 (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10-2.09). Asymptomatic parasitaemia was uncommon (monthly prevalence &lt;10%) and rarely observed prior to 24 months of age.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					In Tororo, despite provision of LLINs and prompt treatment with ACT, the incidence of malaria is very high and appears to be rising. Additional malaria control interventions in high transmission settings are likely needed.

Ultrasound Guidance for Central Venous Access by Emergency Physicians in Colorado
Introduction: To survey emergency physicians (EP) regarding the frequency of use of ultrasound guidance for placement of central venous catheters (UGCVC) and to assess their perceptions regarding the technique and barriers to its implementation.
      Methods: A 25-question Web-based survey was e-mailed to all members of the Colorado chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians with a listed e-mail address. A total of 3 reminderswere sent to nonresponders.
      Results: Responses were received from 116 out of 330 invitations. Ninety-seven percent (n¼112) of respondents indicated they have an ultrasound machine available in their emergency department, and 78% indicated they use UGCVC. Seventy-seven percent (n ¼ 90) agreed with the statement, ‘‘Ultrasound guidance is the preferred method for central venous catheter placement in the emergencydepartment.’’ However, 23% of respondents stated they have received no specific training in UGCVC. Twenty-six percent (n ¼28) of respondents stated they felt ‘‘uncomfortable’’ or ‘‘very uncomfortable’’with UGCVC, and 47% cite lack of training in UGCVC as a barrier to performing the technique.
      Conclusion: Although the majority of surveyed EPs feel UGCVC is a valuable technique and do perform it, a significant percentage reported receiving no training in the procedure and also reported being uncomfortable performing it. Nearly half of those surveyed cited lack of training as a barrier to more widespread implementation of UGCVC. This suggests that there continues to be a need for education and training of EPs in UGCVC. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):320–325.

Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in Fatal Toxic Exposures: A Poison Center’s Review
Introduction: Self-exposure is a leading method for suicide both in the United States and worldwide and thus is a major preventable public health issue. Surrogate decision makers are tasked with making medical decisions for the patient while keeping the patient’s wishes in mind. Decisions related to code status become more complicated when the patient’s situation is the result of a suicidal act. The objectives were to 1) determine how frequently Do Not Resuscitate orders (DNR orders) are placed for the intentionally self-exposed (ISE) patient using the Regional Poison Control Center (RPCC) data, and 2) identify if DNR orders in intentionally self-exposed patients were placed before or afterdevelopment of poor prognostic signs.
      Methods: We analyzed all exposure-related deaths reported to the RPCC from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. We reviewed data for the following: exposure intent, exposure substance, outcome, age, code status, date of DNR/withdrawal of care order, previous suicide attempts, and poor prognostic signs.
      Results: Of the 476 total deaths, nearly half were the result of an intentional self-exposure (n= 235; 49.4%). Most deaths, when code status was reported, had advanced cardiac life support, or “fullcodes” (n=131; 55.6%). Of the total deaths with a DNR or withdrawal of care order (n=104), over half were from an ISE (n=55; 52.9%). A higher percentage of the ISEs had a DNR order/withdrawal of careorder; however, it was not a statistically significant difference OR 1.23 (95% CI 0.64, 2.37). Regardless of intent, patients treated as full codes were on average 19.5 years younger than the DNR orders group. Only 2 DNR orders were placed prior to development of poor prognostic signs. Unintentional self-exposures consumed a mean of 1.4 substances (range 1 to 4). ISEs consumed a mean of 2.3 substances (range 1 to 19).
      Conclusion: People are often asked to make life-and-death decisions for a loved one. The nature of the exposure can complicate the issue if the exposure has an antidote or is known to have a limited effect. Further study is needed to assess the extent of these cases and to identify optimal management guidelines or policy to aid both the medical teams caring for these patients and the surrogate decision makers.

Do cultural and linguistic competence matter in Latinos' completion of mandated substance abuse treatment?
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Increasing evidence suggests that culturally and linguistically responsive programs may improve substance abuse treatment outcomes among Latinos. However, little is known about whether individual practices or culturally and linguistically responsive contexts support efforts by first-time Latino clients to successfully complete mandated treatment.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We analyzed client and program data from publicly funded treatment programs contracted through the criminal justice system in California. A sample of 5,150 first-time Latino clients nested within 48 treatment programs was analyzed using multilevel logistic regressions.
				
				
					
						Results
					Outpatient treatment, homelessness, and a high frequency of drug use at intake were associated with decreased odds of treatment completion among Latinos. Programs that routinely offered a culturally and linguistically responsive practice&#8212;namely, Spanish-language translation&#8212;were associated with increased odds of completion of mandated treatment.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These preliminary findings suggest that concrete practices such as offering Spanish translation improve treatment adherence within a population that is at high risk of treatment dropout.

Predicting mortality with biomarkers: a population-based prospective cohort study for elderly Costa Ricans
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Little is known about adult health and mortality relationships outside high-income nations, partly because few datasets have contained biomarker data in representative populations. Our objective is to determine the prognostic value of biomarkers with respect to total and cardiovascular mortality in an elderly population of a middle-income country, as well as the extent to which they mediate the effects of age and sex on mortality.
				
				
					
						Methods
					This is a prospective population-based study in a nationally representative sample of elderly Costa Ricans. Baseline interviews occurred mostly in 2005 and mortality follow-up went through December 2010. Sample size after excluding observations with missing values: 2,313 individuals and 564 deaths. Main outcome: prospective death rate ratios for 22 baseline biomarkers, which were estimated with hazard regression models.
				
				
					
						Results
					Biomarkers significantly predict future death above and beyond demographic and self-reported health conditions. The studied biomarkers account for almost half of the effect of age on mortality. However, the sex gap in mortality became several times wider after controlling for biomarkers. The most powerful predictors were simple physical tests: handgrip strength, pulmonary peak flow, and walking speed. Three blood tests also predicted prospective mortality: C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Strikingly, high blood pressure (BP) and high total cholesterol showed little or no predictive power. Anthropometric measures also failed to show significant mortality effects.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This study adds to the growing evidence that blood markers for CRP, HbA1c, and DHEAS, along with organ-specific functional reserve indicators (handgrip, walking speed, and pulmonary peak flow), are valuable tools for identifying vulnerable elderly. The results also highlight the need to better understand an anomaly noted previously in other settings: despite the continued medical focus on drugs for BP and cholesterol, high levels of BP and cholesterol have little predictive value of mortality in this elderly population.

[prolactin, brca1, cancer, breast, tumor, cell]

Regulation of BRCA1/p21 Axis by Prolactin
Tumor formation/progression is determined by a wide array of factors including downregulation of tumor suppressors and upregulation of oncogenes. In breast cancers, mutation of the tumor suppressor, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), accounts for the majority of inherited cases, which themselves account for about 10% of the total. Given the importance of BRCA1 in the development of breast cancer and the fact that the majority of breast cancers have wild type BRCA1, the question posed in the current study was what happens to BRCA1 tumor suppressor activity during the development of most breast cancers. To examine this issue, we employed two forms of prolactin that work through the same receptors, differ from one another only by a single amino acid, and have antagonistic activity in terms of cell proliferation and survival. Also, since BRCA1 mutations have recently been shown to be important in ovarian and prostate cancer development, the study additionally included cell lines representative of these cancers. Results show that wild type BRCA1 could be functionally silenced by prolactin in terms of its ability to induce transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21, whereas the prolactin antagonist increased expression of p21 through BRCA1. The functional silencing in response to prolactin occurred as a result of an interaction with the signaling molecule, Stat5 and could be blocked by a dominant negative Stat5. In addition, we showed that prolactin also contributes to tumor progression by regulating p21 at post-transcriptional and post-translational stages. The post-transcriptional regulation was mediated by miRNA. One candidate for this activity is miR-106, a miRNA induced by PRL, likely through an estrogen receptor &#945; (ER&#945;) and c-myc pathway. Prolactin also induced phosphorylation of p21 on threonine 145, causing it to be retained in the cytosol under which circumstances it inhibits apoptosis. At present, the kinase responsible for prolactin-stimulated phosphorylation of p21 is unclear, but preliminary data suggest a possible role for pim-1. The prolactin antagonist employed in these studies is a molecular mimic of naturally phosphorylated prolactin. Given its ability to increase expression of p21 and antagonize the effects of unmodified prolactin, one would predict that the ratio of unmodified prolactin to phosphorylated prolactin may be important to the development/progression of cancer. To test this in a clinical setting, a serum-based assay capable of quantifying phosphorylated prolactin as a separate entity from unmodified prolactin is required. To develop such an assay, regions of the p21 promoter were deleted to determine a minimal promoter responsive to phosphorylated prolactin. A 143bp region containing only the BRCA1 response element and TATA box was determined to be sufficient and specific to the phosphorylated form of the hormone. Establishment of stable cell lines expressing this minimal promoter linked to luciferase has shown the resultant bioassay to be sensitive and consistent.

However, populating cancer registries with information from medical records can be a tedious and bottlenecking process. This thesis presents an annotator system that automatically extracts data elements from lung cancer radiology reports to populate a lung cancer registry. Annotators systems such as this utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to locate concepts from a text source. A web-based framework that wraps the annotator system into a graphical user interface for researchers and clinicians is also discussed.

mFit: A Novel Sensor Fusion Platform for the Promotion of Exercise
Proper fulfillment of prescribed exercise has shown to greatly reduce the rate of patient re-admission and speed recovery of patients experiencing an array of health conditions. Currently, technology that allows doctors to monitor the fulfillment of exercise regiments requires patients to submit to expensive physical therapy and long term monitoring. An urgent need exists for low cost, rapidly deployable, and networked systems that enable monitoring of exercise activity for patients both in the clinic and at home. The mFit exercise system utilizes modern sensor fusion techniques in conjunction with open source smartphone technologies to monitor: cadence, applied force, generated power, and dissipated energy while providing guidance and real time data to the user. The system also transmits patient data to a central server, which allows service providers to oversee patients, ensuring adherence to prescribed exercise regiments, and provide feedback as needed. To accommodate patients in different stages of recovery, two variants of the mFit exercise system have been developed. The mFit restorator outfits a standard restorator bike with polymer force and Hall Effect sensors, enabling direct measurement of a user's force and cadence. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a smartphone that displays the information in an intuitive graphical user interface. The smartphone further utilizes WiFi or a mobile telecommunication network to transmit data to a central server which can be accessed by the user or a third party.The mFit stationary cycle has been developed for patients that are prescribed more strenuous exercise routines. An inexpensive, mass market stationary cycle was modified and a strain gauge, common in most weight scales, and a photo-interrupter were added to enable force and cadence measurements. Similar to the mFit restorator, the data is transmitted to a smartphone that displays the results and simultaneously pushes the data to a central server.In this thesis, we present the novel mFit system concept, the hardware used to develop the mFit restorator and mFit stationary cycle, as well as the software architecture which presents the required metrics. We further describe applications which interface with the mFit systems to provide guidance and measure a user's fitness level.

Role of blood-brain barrier leakage during stroke
Stroke is the leading disease accounting for death and disability in the world. It is often caused by the occlusion of blood vessels supplying the brain. Stroke causes the opening of blood-brain barrier (BBB), the specific vascular structure that regulates delivery of substances to the brain. The integrity of the barrier structure depends on a dynamic interaction between endothelial cells, glial cells, and neurons, collectively called the neurovascular unit. BBB breakdown during stroke would allow plasma constituents to enter the brain and possibly damage cells. In this study, I sought to investigate if BBB leakage of plasma toxic factors might contribute to the pathology of ischemic injury. To address the above question, the first step was to establish the correlation between BBB leakage and tissue injury. Focal ischemia was produced in a rat model of the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). High molecular weight dextran- fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was employed to label vascular leakage. A consistent pattern of vascular labeling by dextran-FITC was observed within the ischemic core. Ultrastructural examination showed evidence of cytotoxic edema and severely disrupted vascular membrane associated with the presence of dextran-FITC. Histology revealed that the regional distribution of the severe vascular disruption correlated with the area of the ischemic infarction and neuronal injury. I concluded from these experiments that dextran-FITC can serve as a marker for severe vascular disruption and is useful in further studies of the patho-anatomic mechanisms of vascular- disruption mediated tissue injury. The next step was to identify the toxic factor that leaks into the parenchymal tissue. Among many candidates, thrombin is one of the earlier mediators responding to endothelial damage. In our stroke model, infusion of thrombin intra-arterially during ischemia greatly exacerbated blood-brain barrier breakdown and severe vascular disruption. Vascular disruption was blocked by intravenous infusion of the direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban. Greater numbers of dying cells were found in regions of severe vascular disruption, and interventions that reduced vascular leakage also reduced the numbers of dying cells, labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). These experiments suggested a key role for thrombin in mediating cell demise during ischemia. The next question was to ask how thrombin mediates cell death. Thrombin may contribute to ischemic injury by potentiating coagulation activity and/or acting on protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on brain cells. To test the specific cellular pathways activated by thrombin, PAR1 antagonist was infused via the jugular vein during ischemia and protected the brain from further vascular damage. Arterial infusion of PAR1 agonist peptide exacerbated the vascular disruption and tissue injury. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PAR1 was activated in regions with vascular leakage. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a downstream effector of PAR1, alleviated the ischemic injury. Infusion of an antagonist against platelet aggregation, however, did not affect the ischemic vascular injury and tissue injury. Together, these data suggested a critical role for PAR1/MAPK pathway in thrombin-mediated ischemic injury. Further, the anti- thrombotic function of thrombin antagonists seemed less beneficial, suggesting that thrombin mediated thrombosis during ischemia plays a less significant role than PAR-1 mediated thrombin toxicity

Native Americans and Type 2 Diabetes: The Discourse of Predisposition and its Politics
This research examines the discourse between geneticists, clinicians and their patients to elucidate the linkage of Type II diabetes in American Indian populations and larger social processes such as genetics, race, colonialism, and global capitalism.  The goal of this work is to understand the mechanisms that perpetuate the hegemony of scientific knowledge as it constructs the diabetic body as belonging to a specific category of "otherness."  As a result this work will contribute to a better understanding of how diabetes has become the newest epidemic in Native communities and constitutes contemporary racialized and politicized domains for the exercise of power.  Using historical and ethnographic methods, this research examines the construction, distribution and use of knowledge about Type II diabetes.  The main objective is to enhance understanding the influence of racial/ethnic discrimination in health care delivery and its association with disparities in disease incidence, treatment and outcomes among American Indians.  This objective will be achieved by examining current understandings of predisposition for diabetes.  When usual interpretations of causality fail to explain a disease, biomedicine often relies on such concepts of predisposition.  Yet, such interpretations fail to give meaning of such an affliction to the sufferer (Finkler 1994:14).  Type II diabetes needs to be situated within the historical context from which it arose and contextualized with current understandings of predisposition as they are used in the categorization and determination of diabetes treatment.  This project follows the work of anthropologists who examine the political economy of health and argue that poverty and stress directly impact health, a factor that while acknowledged is often obscured in the biological emphasis in medical discourse.

[stroke, cortex, contralateral, remapping, plasticity, mouse, imaging, dendritic, stimulation]

Chronic in vivo imaging of dendritic plasticity and functional remapping after cortical stroke
One of the most amazing aspects of stroke is how survivors often exhibit partial recovery from their deficits. This occurs presumably because of remapping of lost capabilities to functionally related brain areas in both hemispheres. Several functional imaging studies in humans and rats suggest that remapping in the contralateral (uninjured) cortex might represent a transient stage of compensatory plasticity, until more permanent forms of circuit rewiring in peri-infarct cortex can take over. Some postmortem studies in fixed tissue have suggested that cortical lesions (including stroke) trigger extensive dendritic plasticity in the contralateral hemisphere, but this remains controversial (as others could not replicate the results) and no mechanism has yet been established as to how this remapping might occur. I used longitudinal in vivo two-photon microscopy in the contralateral homotopic cortex to record changes in dendritic spines in apical tufts of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in adult thy1 GFP-M mice before and after stroke.  In addition, I used intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging to investigate whether sensory functions that were lost after stroke remapped to the contralateral homotopic cortex. Strokes were induced by either rose Bengal photothrombosis or unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion, both of which produced cortical infarcts that spanned the forelimb region of primary somatosensory cortex. For spine dynamics, mice were imaged longitudinally every 4 days for a baseline period before the stroke, and for up to one month thereafter.  For IOS imaging, I mapped the sensory responses to ipsi- and contralateral forelimb and hindlimb stimulation at baseline conditions and then again every few days at regular intervals for up to 28 days after stroke in both adult and juvenile mice.  The peri-infarct region showed significant remapping after stimulation of a whisker bundle after stroke, and stimulation of the contralateral forepaw always produced a strong intrinsic signal, but stimulation of the ipsilateral forepaw never resulted in a detectable signal in the spared homotopic cortex opposite to the side of the stroke.  Similarly, I could not detect de novo growth or branching of dendrites or any changes in the density or turnover of spines after stroke. Thus, the contralesional cortex does not show evidence of structural plasticity after stroke, at least at the level of apical dendritic tufts of L5 neurons, or of functional remapping as detectable with IOS. This suggests that, at least in mice, the peri-infarct cortex plays the dominant role in post-ischemic reparative plasticity.

Hepatic Abscess: Case Report And Review
Hepatic abscess is an uncommon occurrence in North America, but can be a diagnostic challenge for emergency department physicians. The clinical signs and symptoms may vary, leading to delays in diagnosis and higher morbidity. We present a case of a 35-year old male with a hepatic abscess initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia. On subsequent return to the ED for back pain complaints, a bedside ultrasound led to the appropriate diagnosis. This case report and discussion will attempt to review the literature on the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of hepatic abscess for the emergency physician. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):154-157.

Value of Mandatory Screening Studies in Emergency Department Patients Cleared for Physchiatric Admission
Introduction: Laboratory and radiographic studies are often required by psychiatric services prior to admitting emergency patients who are otherwise deemed medically stable. Such testing may represent an unnecessary expense that prolongs emergency department stays without significantly improving care. This study determines the prevalence of such testing and how often it leads to changes in care.
      Methods: We prospectively tracked laboratory testing among psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency departments of two academic tertiary care facilities. For each visit we determined whether laboratory or radiographic studies were ordered, and whether the examination was conducted at the request of the emergency physician as part of a medical screening examination or requested by the psychiatry service. We then determined if this testing changed patient disposition.
      Results: Our study enrolled 598 patients. Of these, emergency physicians ordered testing as a part of medical screening on 155 patients (25.9%). We found the psychiatry service ordered laboratory or radiographic studies for 191 of 434 patients (44.0%) who emergency physicians determined did not require ancillary testing for medical clearance. Of these 191 patients, only one (0.5%; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.01% - 2.9%) had an abnormal result that led to a change in disposition. Total Medicare reimbursement rates for the additional ancillary testing in this study was $37,682.
      Conclusion: Ancillary testing beyond what is required for medical clearance of psychiatric emergency patients rarely alters care. Policies that require panels of testing prior to psychiatric admission are costly and appear to be unnecessary. West J Emerg Med 2012;13(5):388-393.

Effects of hypertension, acute and long-term exercise on pseudopod formation on naïve neutrophils and plasma matrix metalloproteinase levels and activity
Leukocyte activation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with experimental forms of hypertension as a signature of inflammation. It is the objective of my thesis to investigate leukocyte activation and MMP activity in a cohort of patients newly diagnosed with hypertension that are not on any medication. My aims are to determine whether hypertensives exhibit signs of leukocyte activation on naïve neutrophils as determined by the formation of pseudopods and whether they exhibit elevated levels of MMPs in plasma. Pseudopod formation has been identified as a cause of increased hemodynamic resistance and is associated with other forms of activation. Exercise interventions have successfully reduced blood pressure as well as plasma levels of known inflammatory markers in hypertension. Subjects with normal or elevated blood pressure participated; hypertensives additionally partook in a 12-week exercise intervention. Naïve cells were stimulated by subject plasma, fixed, imaged, and analyzed. Significant correlations between pseudopod length and systolic (R = 0.415, p = 0.018), diastolic (R = 0.402, p = 0.023) blood pressure were identified. Pseudopod length post training was associated with a change in diastolic blood pressure. Matrix metalloproteinases, a family of endopeptidases involved in vascular remodeling, are role players in a number of cardiovascular diseases known as risk factors in hypertension. Subjects performed acute exercise tasks before and after a lifestyle intervention. Acute exercise increased plasma levels of MMP-8 and -9 (p < 0.001). Training did not alter MMP-levels, or the response to acute exercise. Correlations between MMPs and markers of inflammation were found

The organizational social context of mental health services and clinician attitudes toward evidence-based practice: A United States national study
AbstractBackgroundEvidence-based practices have not been routinely adopted in community mental health organizations despite the support of scientific evidence and in some cases even legislative or regulatory action. We examined the association of clinician attitudes toward evidence-based practice with organizational culture, climate, and other characteristics in a nationally representative sample of mental health organizations in the United States.MethodsIn-person, group-administered surveys were conducted with a sample of 1,112 mental health service providers in a nationwide sample of 100 mental health service institutions in 26 states in the United States. The study examines these associations with a two-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis of responses to the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) at the individual clinician level as a function of the Organizational Social Context (OSC) measure at the organizational level, controlling for other organization and clinician characteristics.ResultsWe found that more proficient organizational cultures and more engaged and less stressful organizational climates were associated with positive clinician attitudes toward adopting evidence-based practice.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that organizational intervention strategies for improving the organizational social context of mental health services may contribute to the success of evidence-based practice dissemination and implementation efforts by influencing clinician attitudes.

Novel simian foamy virus infections from multiple monkey species in women from the Democratic Republic of Congo
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Zoonotic transmission of simian retroviruses in Central Africa is ongoing and can result in pandemic human infection. While simian foamy virus (SFV) infection was reported in primate hunters in Cameroon and Gabon, little is known about the distribution of SFV in Africa and whether human-to-human transmission and disease occur. We screened 3,334 plasmas from persons living in rural villages in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using SFV-specific EIA and Western blot (WB) tests. PCR amplification of SFV polymerase sequences from DNA extracted from buffy coats was used to measure proviral loads. Phylogenetic analysis was used to define the NHP species origin of SFV. Participants completed questionnaires to capture NHP exposure information.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Sixteen (0.5%) samples were WB-positive; 12 of 16 were from women (75%, 95% confidence limits 47.6%, 92.7%). Sequence analysis detected SFV in three women originating from Angolan colobus or red-tailed monkeys; both monkeys are hunted frequently in DRC. NHP exposure varied and infected women lived in distant villages suggesting a wide and potentially diverse distribution of SFV infections across DRC. Plasmas from 22 contacts of 8 WB-positive participants were all WB negative suggesting no secondary viral transmission. Proviral loads in the three women ranged from 14 &#8211; 1,755 copies/105 cells.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our study documents SFV infection in rural DRC for the first time and identifies infections with novel SFV variants from Colobus and red-tailed monkeys. Unlike previous studies, women were not at lower risk for SFV infection in our population, providing opportunities for spread of SFV both horizontally and vertically. However, limited testing of close contacts of WB-positive persons did not identify human-to-human transmission. Combined with the broad behavioral risk and distribution of NHPs across DRC, our results suggest that SFV infection may have a wider geographic distribution within DRC. These results also reinforce the potential for an increased SFV prevalence throughout the forested regions of Africa where humans and simians co-exist. Our finding of endemic foci of SFV infection in DRC will facilitate longitudinal studies to determine the potential for person-to-person transmissibility and pathogenicity of these zoonotic retroviral infections.

Objectively Characterized Linear Model of Stroke Induced Joint Synergies in Relation to Clinical Measures
Subjective kinematic motion analysis done by a trained physical therapist using standard assessment such as the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM) and/or theWolf Motor Function test (Wolf), have a limited ability to objectively characterize post stroke movement of subjects with a hemiparetic limb or demonstrate fine change over time. The goal of the research was to take the characterized synergies linear matrix model and find an application with stroke survivors. Twenty-two participants were tested for motor impairment using a modified FM (MFM) assessment. Motion capture data was collected using the Vicon motion capture system. This data was processed using Vicon BodyBuilder and MATLAB to construct a stroke subject's Synergy Matrix (SM) from which was developed the Synergy Matrix Score (SMS). This score is compared with the MFM score in terms of efficacy of accepted assessment standards, precise quantitative data, sufficient sensitivity to characterize change over time, and usefulness for clinical reporting. The results show that the SMS provides comparable accurate assessment of the subjects post stroke motion with a high level of sensitivity and greater description of shoulder, elbow, and wrist information in the form of a seven by seven matrix. The SM scoring scale (0,inf) also has the ability to quantify change over time at a finer resolution than the MFM range of 0-2 (33% banding) or the Wolf range of 0-4 (25% banding). Results also show that the SMS objectively generates a relevant score comparable to the MFM while maintaining a greater resolution of detail and density of information allowing the physical therapist to better target therapies as well as spend more time working with patients and less time spent on documentation. Adding the SMS to a control system on a therapeutic robot will further automate the SMS into a realtime feedback loop as applied, for example, to stroke prognosis of the targeted therapy.

How Frequently are “Classic” Drug-Seeking Behaviors Used by Drug-Seeking Patients in the Emergency Department?
Introduction: Drug-seeking behavior (DSB) in the emergency department (ED) is a very common problem, yet there has been little quantitative study to date of such behavior.The goal of this study was to assess the frequency with which drug seeking patients in the ED use classic drug seeking behaviors to obtain prescription medication.
      Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients in an ED case management program for DSB. We reviewed all visits by patients in the program that occurred during a 1-year period, and recorded the frequency of the following behaviors: complaining of headache, complaining of back pain, complaining of dental pain, requesting medication by name, requesting a refill of medication, reporting medications as having been lost or stolen, reporting 10/10 pain, reporting greater than 10/10 pain, reporting being out of medication, and requesting medication parenterally. These behaviors were chosen because they are described as “classic” for DSB in the existing literature.
      Results: We studied 178 patients from the case management program, who made 2,486 visits in 1 year. The frequency of each behavior was: headache 21.7%, back pain 20.8%, dental pain 1.8%, medication by name 15.2%, requesting refill 7.0%, lost or stolen medication 0.6%, pain 10/10 29.1%, pain greater than 10/10 1.8%, out of medication 9.5%, and requesting parenteral medication 4.3%. Patients averaged 1.1 behaviors per visit.
       
      Conclusion: Drug-seeking patients appear to exhibit “classically” described drug-seeking behaviors with only low to moderate frequency. Reliance on historical features may be inadequate when trying to assess whether or not a patient is drug-seeking. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):416-421.

Control of Cyst Burden in the Brain During Chronic Toxoplasma Gondii Infection
As an immune-privileged site, the brain represents a particularly challenging area when it comes to controlling infection and inflammation.  Toxoplasma gondii provides us with a model of a chronic infection in the CNS that represents an efficient and balanced response from the healthy immune system.  The effector functions of immune cells coupled with the ability to effectively migrate to and within the brain to sites of infection is essential in controlling the replication of the parasite in the brain.  Impairment of this immune response results in parasite reactivation and fatal encephalitis, as seen in AIDS patients.  Immune-compromised patients are currently subject to lifelong drug therapies that do not result in cyst clearance, presenting a constant danger of reactivation.  Therefore, the identification of new mechanisms of cyst control is particularly important as it may lead to new and effective therapies.  This dissertation examines two novel mechanisms of parasite control in the CNS during chronic infection.  	Previously published data has shown that a reticular network of fibers is present in Toxoplasma infected brains and absent in naïve brains which T cells migrate along.  SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that has been shown to be involved in the production and maintenance of similar fiber networks.  Here, data will be presented demonstrating upregulation of SPARC in the brain following infection and association of this molecule with a seminal fibrous network in the CNS as well as with cysts and migrating cells.  Furthermore, a requirement for SPARC in protective immunity and matrix assembly will be demonstrated in vivo, using infection studies with SPARC-null mice and live imaging in the brain.	  	The exact mechanisms and cells involved in the clearance and control of cysts from the brain remain poorly defined.  Data presented here will demonstrate the presence of a population of alternatively activated macrophages (AAM&#981;) in the infected brain that maintain control of the cyst burden through the secretion of the chitolytic enzyme, acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase).  This mechanism is demonstrated in vitro by both chemical and genetic inhibition of the enzyme and the requirement for protective immunity is shown through infection of AMCase-null mice.	These mechanisms of parasite control during chronic T. gondii infection represent two novel areas of study that provide hopeful therapeutic targets in combating this chronic infection.

The providing resources to enhance African American patients' readiness to make decisions about kidney disease (PREPARED) study: protocol of a randomized controlled trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Living related kidney transplantation (LRT) is underutilized, particularly among African Americans. The effectiveness of informational and financial interventions to enhance informed decision-making among African Americans with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and improve rates of LRT is unknown.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					We report the protocol of the Providing Resources to Enhance African American Patients&#8217; Readiness to Make Decisions about Kidney Disease (PREPARED) Study, a two-phase study utilizing qualitative and quantitative research methods to design and test the effectiveness of informational (focused on shared decision-making) and financial interventions to overcome barriers to pursuit of LRT among African American patients and their families. Study Phase I involved the evidence-based development of informational materials as well as a financial intervention to enhance African American patients&#8217; and families&#8217; proficiency in shared decision-making regarding LRT. In Study Phase 2, we are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial in which patients with new-onset ESRD receive 1) usual dialysis care by their nephrologists, 2) the informational intervention (educational video and handbook), or 3) the informational intervention in addition to the option of participating in a live kidney donor financial assistance program. The primary outcome of the randomized controlled trial will include patients&#8217; self-reported rates of consideration of LRT (including family discussions of LRT, patient-physician discussions of LRT, and identification of a LRT donor).
				
				
					
						Discussion
					Results from the PREPARED study will provide needed evidence on ways to enhance the decision to pursue LRT among African American patients with ESRD.

Modalities of intersubjectivity in neo-shamanic ritual healing
The focus of the current ethnographic study is a neo- shamanic healing ritual, practiced by contemporary Euro- Americans in the west coast of the United States, called soul retrieval. Moving away from symbolic, interpretive or representational approaches to the study of ritual healing, this study offers an experientially specific account of neo-shamanic healing process that is grounded in embodiment. The ritual healing practice of soul retrieval is formulated here as a process of self-transformation and self-objectification, which is facilitated vis-à-vis a series of relationships that are created throughout the healing ritual and extend beyond it. The effort made in this paper is bifocal, in the sense that it attempts to elaborate on embodiment as a paradigm for anthropology by drawing on a particular ethnographic instance, while at the same time contribute to the anthropological literature on ritual healing and therapeutic process from an analytical perspective grounded in embodiment

Clinical presentations of substance abuse in bipolar heroin addicts at time of treatment entry
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Studies on the &#8216;self-medication hypothesis&#8217; have focused on substance abuse as an attempt to alleviate emotional suffering.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We have investigated concomitant substances of abuse in 150 bipolar heroin addicts clustered according to their clinical presentation at treatment entry (depressive episode, hypomanic episode, manic episode and mixed episode). Bipolar heroin addicted patients were chosen because they tend to have a concomitant poly-substance abuse and because, as compared with patients suffering for other mental illnesses, they more clearly reveal a variety of identifiable affective states.
				
				
					
						Results
					Patients with a depressive episode more frequently used non-prescribed anxiolytic-hypnotics. They were found to use cocaine-amphetamines more frequently during a hypomanic episode, whereas the use of cannabis and cocaine-amphetamines occurred more frequently during a manic episode. The associated use of alcohol, cocaine-amphetamines and cannabinoids was more frequently encountered during a mixed episode. Limitations: apart from the difficulty in determining whether the substance use modifies the mood or the mood state determines the substance used, this is a report on a retrospective analysis, rather than a study specifically designed to elucidate the issue; in addition, no information was available on the temperament of our subjects. Assessments of the same subject in various clinical presentations would have provided a better level of information.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Besides one expected result &#8211; the prominent use of CNS stimulants during a depressive phase of bipolar patients &#8211; this study supports the hypothesis that mood elation is a pleasurable, rewarding experience that, in bipolar patients, can be started or prolonged by means of CNS stimulant drugs. Stimulant use was, therefore, more prevalent during the &#8216;up&#8217; rather than the &#8216;down&#8217; phase of the illness.

Family History is a Predictor for Appendicitis in Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department
Introduction: A family history of appendicitis has been reported to increase the likelihood of thediagnosis in children and in a retrospective study of adults. We compare positive family history with thediagnosis of acute appendicitis in a prospective sample of adults.
      Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of a convenience sample of 428 patients.We compared patients with surgically proven appendicitis to a group without appendicitis. The latterwere further grouped by their presenting symptoms: those presenting with a chief complaint ofabdominal pain and those with other chief complaints. Participants answered questions regarding theirfamily history of appendicitis. Family history was then compared for the appendicitis group versus thenonappendicitis group as a whole, and then versus the subgroup of patients without appendicitis butwith abdominal pain. The primary analysis was a v2 test of proportions and the calculation of odds ratio(OR) for the relationship between final diagnosis of appendicitis and family history.
      Results: Of 428 patients enrolled, 116 had appendicitis. Of those with other diagnoses, 158 hadabdominal pain and 154 had other complaints. Of all patients with appendicitis, 37.9% (confidence interval CI=29.1–46.8) had positive family history. Of those without appendicitis, 23.7% (CI=19.0–28.4) had positive family history. In the subgroup without appendicitis but with abdominal pain, 25.9%(CI=19.1–32.8) had positive family history. Both comparisons were significant (P=0.003; OR=1.97;95% CI=1.2–3.1; and P=0.034; OR=1.74; 95% CI=1.04–2.9, respectively). By multivariate logisticregression analysis across the full sample, family history was a significant independent predictor (P=0.011; OR = 1.883) of appendicitis.
      Conclusion: Adults presenting to the emergency department with a known family history ofappendicitis are more likely to have this disease than those without. West J Emerg Med.2012;13(6):468–471.

Effect of arthroscopic cartilage defect repair with bone marrow derived cells on the lubricant properties of synovial fluid :
Articular cartilage is a connective tissue covering the ends of long bones in synovial joints that facilitates low -friction joint articulation. In the case of high loads and low sliding velocities, lubrication of synovial joints occurs in a boundary, surface-to-surface contact mode, which is governed by interactions of biomolecules, such as hyaluronan (HA) and proteoglycan-4 (PRG4), with cartilage. Injuries increase the risk of osteoarthritis (OA) at a later age, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. While the lubricating ability of synovial fluid in the boundary mode becomes abnormal following injury, the time-dependent changes in SF lubricating and biochemical properties following arthroscopic treatment of acute injury is unknown. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the changes in SF lubricating ability and biochemical composition, as joints transition from normal to injury and repair states, and whether restoration of deficient lubricant molecules can restore normal lubricating ability. Initially normal lubricating ability, indicated by a low steady-state friction coefficient, of SF became deficient shortly following injury, but returned to normal by a longer time post-surgery. These changes were correlated with a decrease in the concentration of HA and a shift in HA towards lower molecular weight (MW) forms. Furthermore, these changes were observed independent of the type of articular cartilage repair treatment applied. Supplementation of deficiently lubricating SF samples with high MW HA restored the boundary lubricating ability, indicating the importance of HA as a lubricant molecule and also suggesting its potential therapeutic ability

Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Abstract
				Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, with a substantial economic impact. Recent changes in the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance refined the classification of patients for treatment using a combination of spirometry, assessment of symptoms, and/or frequency of exacerbations. The aim of treatment remains to reduce existing symptoms while decreasing the risk of future adverse health events. Long-acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy due to their proven efficacy. GOLD guidelines recommend combining long-acting bronchodilators with differing mechanisms of action if the control of COPD is insufficient with monotherapy, and recent years have seen growing interest in the additional benefits that combination of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), typified by tiotropium, with long-acting &#946;2-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol. Most studies have examined free combinations of currently available LAMAs and LABAs, broadly showing a benefit in terms of lung function and other patient-reported outcomes, although evidence is limited at present. Several once- or twice-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations are under development, most involving newly developed monotherapy components. This review outlines the existing data for LAMA/LABA combinations in the treatment of COPD, summarizes the ongoing trials, and considers the evidence required to inform the role of LAMA/LABA combinations in treatment of this disease.

Liver Transplantation Outcome in Patients with Angiographically-Proven Coronary Artery Disease: A Multi-Institutional Study
The impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) on survival after liver transplantation (LT) is poorly defined. This retrospective cohort study identified adult LT recipients who underwent pre-LT coronary angiography at seven institutions over a 12-year period. Obstructive CAD (&#8805;50% stenosis) was present in 151 of 630 patients, the CAD(+) group. The remaining 479 patients comprised the CAD(-) group. Patient survival was similar for the CAD(+) group (adjusted HR 1.13, CI=0.79, 1.62, p=0.49) compared to the CAD(-) group after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. The CAD(+) patients were further stratified into severe (CADsev, >70% stenosis, n=96), and moderate CAD (CADmod, 50-70% stenosis, n=55) groups. Survival for the CADsev (adjusted HR=1.26, CI=0.83, 1.91, p=0.28) and CADmod (adjusted HR=0.93, CI=0.52, 1.66, p=0.80) groups were similar to the CAD(-) group. With current CAD treatment strategies, post-LT survival is not significantly different between patients with and without angiographic evidence of obstructive CAD.

Factors Associated with Mortality in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease During the First and Second Years After a Dialysis Initiation
Mortality is high among incident hemodialysis patients especially during the first several months after initiation of dialysis and can be influenced by many factors. Age, vascular access, co-morbid conditions, serum levels of albumin, and dialysis modality may affect survival. We attempted to identify factors that influence survival of incident hemodialysis patients and to determine if changes in clinical practices could improve survival. We hypothesized that patients surviving at least 24 months differ in their characteristics from those who died and so indentifying those differences and making changes may improve survival in all hemodilaysis patients.   Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for each of the first 24 months on dialysis to determine the temporal pattern of mortality. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to examine mortality at several a priory determined time periods for each predictor using case-mix adjustments. The associations between all-cause mortality and combined serum levels of albumin and nPCR were studied for each of first 8 quarters on dialysis.  Changes in serum albumin and nPCR levels from the prior quarter were examined separately. Finally, marginal structural models (MSM) were fitted to analyze the association between mortality and dialysis modality during 24 months of treatment. Inverse probability weights were created to account for time varying confounding of quarterly measured laboratory values and changes in dialysis modality over the first 8 quarters. SMRs were the highest during the 3-6 months after starting dialysis. Use of central venous catheters and low levels of serum albumin at the time of dialysis initiation were associated with all-cause and infection-related mortality during the first 24 months of treatment. Volume overload was associated with cardio-vascular mortality especially in non-hypoalbuminemic patients.  Decrease in albumin and nPCR was associated with mortality during 24 months on dialysis.  Patients on peritoneal dialysis showed better survival compared to hemodialysis patients after adjusting for modality changes by using MSMs. Patients who changed modalities at least once showed a survival advantage over those who remained on initial modality during 24 months of dialysis treatment.

Guidelines for the Development of Comprehensive Care Centers for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: Guidance from the CARES Foundation Initiative
Abstract
            
            Patients with rare and complex diseases such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) often receive fragmented and inadequate care unless efforts are coordinated among providers. Translating the concepts of the medical home and comprehensive health care for individuals with CAH offers many benefits for the affected individuals and their families. This manuscript represents the recommendations of a 1.5 day meeting held in September 2009 to discuss the ideal goals for comprehensive care centers for newborns, infants, children, adolescents, and adults with CAH. Participants included pediatric endocrinologists, internal medicine and reproductive endocrinologists, pediatric urologists, pediatric surgeons, psychologists, and pediatric endocrine nurse educators. One unique aspect of this meeting was the active participation of individuals personally affected by CAH as patients or parents of patients.

A cross-sectional study of the prevalence and risk factors for hypertension in rural Nepali women
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The prevalence of hypertension is increasing in much of the South Asian region, including Nepal. This paper reports the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension and pre-hypertension among adult women in a rural community of Nepal.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Cross-sectional data on socioeconomic status (SES), lifestyle factors and blood pressure (BP) were collected from a cohort of 15,934 women in rural Nepal in 2006&#8211;08. Among a subsample (n&#8201;=&#8201;1679), anthropometry and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk were measured.
				
				
					
						Results
					The mean age of women was 34.2 years (range 16.4-71.2 years). More than three percent (3.3%) had hypertension and 14.4% had pre-hypertension. In an adjusted analysis, lower SES, especially lower household farm assets and storage of food for long term consumption, was associated with increased odds of hypertension (OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.14 for mid-level SES and OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.40 for low SES; p for trend&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). Smoking, alcohol use and not working outside the home were also associated with higher risk. In a subsample, both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were positively associated with high triglycerides (SBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;4.1 mm Hg; DBP &#946; =3.6 mm Hg), high HbA1c (SBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;14.0; DBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;9.2), raised fasting glucose (SBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;10.0; DBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;6.9), high BMI (SBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;6.7; DBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;5.1) and high waist circumference (SBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;6.2; DBP &#946;&#8201;=&#8201;5.3) after adjusting for potential confounders (p for all &lt;0.01).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Although the prevalence of hypertension was low in this cohort, it was more prevalent among the poorer women and was strongly associated with other cardiovascular risks. These associations at a relatively young age may confer greater risk for cardiovascular disease among women in later life, indicating the need for interventions to reduce the progression from pre-hypertension to hypertension.

Development of a multi-electrode array for spinal cord epidural stimulation to facilitate stepping and standing after a complete spinal cord injury in adult rats
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Stimulation of the spinal cord has been shown to have great potential for improving function after motor deficits caused by injury or pathological conditions. Using a wide range of animal models, many studies have shown that stimulation applied to the neural networks intrinsic to the spinal cord can result in a dramatic improvement of motor ability, even allowing an animal to step and stand after a complete spinal cord transection. Clinical use of this technology, however, has been slow to develop due to the invasive nature of the implantation procedures, the lack of versatility in conventional stimulation technology, and the difficulty of ascertaining specific sites of stimulation that would provide optimal amelioration of the motor deficits. Moreover, the development of tools available to control precise stimulation chronically via biocompatible electrodes has been limited. In this paper, we outline the development of this technology and its use in the spinal rat model, demonstrating the ability to identify and stimulate specific sites of the spinal cord to produce discrete motor behaviors in spinal rats using this array.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We have designed a chronically implantable, rapidly switchable, high-density platinum based multi-electrode array that can be used to stimulate at 1&#8211;100&#160;Hz and 1&#8211;10&#160;V in both monopolar and bipolar configurations to examine the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of spinal cord epidural stimulation in complete spinal cord transected rats.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					In this paper, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of using high-resolution stimulation parameters in the context of improving motor recovery after a spinal cord injury. We observed that rats whose hindlimbs were paralyzed can stand and step when specific sets of electrodes of the array are stimulated tonically (40&#160;Hz). Distinct patterns of stepping and standing were produced by stimulation of different combinations of electrodes on the array located at specific spinal cord levels and by specific stimulation parameters, i.e., stimulation frequency and intensity, and cathode/anode orientation. The array also was used to assess functional connectivity between the cord dorsum to interneuronal circuits and specific motor pools via evoked potentials induced at 1&#160;Hz stimulation in the absence of any anesthesia.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Therefore the high density electrode array allows high spatial resolution and the ability to selectively activate different neural pathways within the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord to facilitate standing and stepping in adult spinal rats and provides the capability to evoke motor potentials and thus a means for assessing connectivity between sensory circuits and specific motor pools and muscles.

Changes in intraocular pressure after pharmacologic pupil dilation
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Intraocular pressure (IOP) may vary according to the change of ocular conditions. In this study, we want to assess the effect and mechanism of pupil dilation on IOP in normal subjects.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We prospectively evaluated 32 eyes of 32 patients (age; 61.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8.2&#8201;years) with normal open angles under diurnal IOP. IOP was measured every two hours from 9&#8201;AM to 11&#8201;PM for one day to establish baseline values and was measured again for one day to assess the differences after dilation. To induce dilation, we administered 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide every 5&#8201;minutes from 8:30&#8201;AM to 8:45&#8201;AM and for every two hours from 11&#8201;AM to 9&#8201;PM to keep the pupil dilated. Diurnal IOP, biometry, Visante OCT, and laser flare photometry were measured before and after dilation.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We observed a significant increase in IOP after dilation, 1.85&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.01&#8201;mmHg (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002). IOP elevation remained significant until about four hours after dilation. Thereafter, IOP decreased slowly and eventually reached pre-dilation level (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). Flare values decreased, and the anterior chamber angle became wider after mydriasis.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Dilation of the pupil significantly and incidentally elevated IOP in normal subjects. Further related studies are warranted to characterize the mechanism of the increased IOP after dilation.

[nurse, ed, patient, inpatient]

Comparison Between Emergency Department and Inpatient Nurses’ Perceptions of Boarding of Admitted Patients
Introduction: The boarding of admitted patients in the emergency department (ED) is a major cause of crowding and access block. One solution is boarding admitted patients in inpatient ward (W) hallways. This study queried and compared ED and W nurses’ opinions toward ED and W boarding. It also assessed their preferred boarding location if they were patients. 
      
         Methods: A survey administered to a convenience sample of ED and W nurses was performed in a 631-bed academic medical center (30,000 admissions/year) with a 68-bed ED (70,000 visits/ year). We identified nurses as ED or W, and if W, whether they had previously worked in the ED. The nurses were asked if there were any circumstances where admitted patients should be boarded in ED or W hallways. They were also asked their preferred location if they were admitted as a patient. Six clinical scenarios were then presented, and the nurses’ opinions on boarding based on each scenario were queried. 
      
         Results: Ninety nurses completed the survey, with a response rate of 60%; 35 (39%) were current ED nurses (cED), 40 (44%) had previously worked in the ED (pED). For all nurses surveyed 46 (52%) believed admitted patients should board in the ED. Overall, 52 (58%) were opposed to W boarding, with 20% of cED versus 83% of current W (cW) nurses (P < 0.0001), and 28% of pED versus 85% of nurses never having worked in the ED (nED) were opposed (P < 0.001). If admitted as patients themselves, 43 (54%) of all nurses preferred W boarding, with 82% of cED versus 33% of cW nurses (P < 0.0001) and 74% of pED versus 34% nED nurses (P = 0.0007). The most commonly cited reasons for opposition to hallway boarding were lack of monitoring and patient privacy. For the 6 clinical scenarios, significant differences in opinion regarding W boarding existed in all but 2 cases: a patient with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but requiring oxygen, and an intubated, unstable sepsis patient. 
      
         Conclusion: Inpatient nurses and those who have never worked in the ED are more opposed to inpatient boarding than ED nurses and nurses who have worked previously in the ED. Primary nursing concerns about boarding are lack of monitoring and privacy in hallway beds. Nurses admitted as patients seemed to prefer not being boarded where they work. ED and inpatient nurses seemed to agree that unstable or potentially unstable patients should remain in the ED but disagreed on where more stable patients should board.

Benefit of a Tiered-Trauma Activation System for Triaging Dead-on-Arrival Patients
Introduction: Although national guidelines have been published for the management of critically injured traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (TCPA) patients, many hospital systems have not implemented in-hospital triage guidelines. The objective of this study was to determine if hospital resources could be preserved by implementation of an in-hospital tiered triage system for patients in TCPA with prolonged resuscitation who would likely be declared dead on arrival (DOA).
      Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 4,618 severely injured patients, admitted to our Level I trauma center from December 2000 to December 2008 for evaluation. All of the identified patients had sustained life-threatening penetrating and blunt injuries with pre-hospital TCPA. Patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for 10 minutes were assessed for survival rate, neurologic outcome, and charge-for-activation (COA) for our hospital trauma system.
      Results: We evaluated 4,618 charts, which consisted of patients seen by the MSM trauma service from December 2001 through December 2008. We identified 140 patients with severe, life-threatening traumatic injuries,who sustained pre-hospitalTCPArequiring prolongedCPRin the field andwere brought to the emergency department (ED).Group I was comprised of 108 patients sustaining TCPA (53 blunt, 55penetrating), who died after receiving, 45 minutes of ACLS after arrival. Group II, which consisted of 32 patients (25 blunt, 7 penetrating), had resuscitative efforts in the EDlasting.45 minutes, but all ultimately died prior to discharge. Estimated hospital charge-for-activation for Group I was approximately $540,000, based on standard charges of $5000 per full-scale trauma system activation (TSA).
      Conclusion: Full-scale trauma system activation for patients sustaining greater than 10 minutes of prehospital TCPA in the field is futile and economically depleting. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(3):225–229.

A mutation in KIF7 is responsible for the autosomal recessive syndrome of macrocephaly, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and distinctive facial appearance
Abstract
					
				
				
					
						
							Background
						
					
					We previously reported the existence of a unique autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of macrocephaly, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia and distinctive facial appearance mapping to chromosome 15q26.
				
				
					
						
							Methods
						
					
					In this manuscript, we have used whole exome sequencing on two affected members of a consanguineous family with this condition and carried out detailed bioinformatics analysis to elucidate the causative mutation.
				
				
					
						
							Results
						
					
					Our analysis resulted in the identification of a homozygous p.N1060S missense mutation in a highly conserved residue in KIF7, a regulator of Hedgehog signaling that has been recently found to be causing Joubert syndrome, fetal hydrolethalus and acrocallosal syndromes. The phenotype in our patients partially overlaps with the phenotypes associated with those syndromes but they also exhibit some distinctive features including multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.
				
				
					
						
							Conclusions
						
					
					We report the first missense homozygous disease-causing mutation in KIF7 and expand the clinical spectrum associated with mutations in this gene to include multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The missense nature of the mutation might account for the unique presentation in our patients.

An Uncommon Case of Abdominal Pain: Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare cause of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that may be undiagnosed in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). We report a 54-year-old male presenting to a community ED with abdominal pain and the subsequent radiographic findings.The patient’s computed tomgraphy (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates many of the hallmark findings consistent with SMA syndrome, including; compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery resulting in intestinal obstruction, dilation of the left renal vein, and gastric distension. Patients diagnosed with SMA syndrome have a characteristically short distance between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta (usually 2–8 mm) in contrast to healthy patients (10–34 mm). Our patient’s aortomesenteric distance was measured to be approximately 4 mm. Furthermore, the measured angle between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta is reduced in patients withSMA syndrome from a normal range of 28°–65° to a measurement between 6°–22°. Our patient’s aortomesenteric angle was difficult to measure secondary to poor sagittal reconstructions, but appears to be approximately 30°. Following radiographic evidence suggesting SMA syndrome together with our patient’s constellation of presenting symptoms, a diagnosis of SMA syndrome was made and the patient was admitted to the general surgery service. However, our patient decided to leave against medical advice owing to improvement of his symptoms following the emptying of two liters of gastric contents via nasogastric tube evacuation.

Spinal glial regulation of nociceptive processing during inflammation
Chronic pain is a major health issue affecting 20% of the population and reducing quality of life measures and incurring a large health care related cost for society. In this thesis we investigate the role of non-neuronal cells of the spinal cord in regulating both the onset of acute inflammatory pain and the maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain. We demonstrate that a two-week peripheral inflammation as produced by the K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model results in chronic mechanical hypersensitivity as measured by von Frey hairs with changes in the ATF3 transcription factor of the dorsal root ganglia, a characteristic of neuropathic pain, in addition to spinal non-neuronal cell activation. The transition to a chronic mechanical hypersensitivity is further demonstrated by knockout and antagonist treatments to be spinal toll-like receptor 4 dependent. By LC/MS/MS lipid spinal cord analysis this is shown to be critical in production of the anti-inflammatory/ anti-nociceptive arachidonic acid metabolite 15d-PGJ₂ which is lost during K/BxN serum transfer arthritis. Additional studies utilizing the carrageenan model, wherein an inflammatory stimulant is injected into the hindpaw resulting in inflammation concurrent with thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia, were conducted to investigate endogenous compounds released from non-neuronal cells during initiation of pain-like behavior. Here we demonstrate that the catalytically active form of matrix metalloproteinase 3 is released spinally and will induce an enzymatically mediated, microglia specific, release of tumor necrosis factor. Intrathecal antagonist blockade of MMP activity attenuates the onset of thermal and tactile hypersensitivity suggesting a role for these enzymes in the initial stages of peripheral inflammation induced pain -like behavior. This thesis reveals the crucial role of non-neuronal cells related factors in mediating both acute peripheral inflammation and chronic inflammation induced pain-like behavior utilizing multiple animal inflammation models and converging biochemical and molecular biological techniques

Pneumothorax Ex-vacuo or ¿trapped lung¿ in the setting of hepatic hydrothorax
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Hepatic hydrothorax is a major pulmonary complication of liver disease occurring in up to 5-10% of patients with cirrhosis.
				
				
					
						Case presentation
					We report four observations of the development of pneumothorax ex-vacuo or trapped lung in the setting of hepatic hydrothorax. The diagnosis of trapped lung was made based on the presence of a hydropneumothorax after evacuation of a longstanding hepatic hydrothorax with failure of the lung to re-expand after chest tube placement in three of the four cases. Two patients underwent surgical decortication with one subsequent death from post-operative bleeding. The other two patients remarkably had spontaneous improvement of their &#8220;trapped lung&#8221; without surgical intervention.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					While pneumothorax ex-vacuo is a known phenomenon in malignant effusions, to our knowledge, it has never been described in association with hepatic hydrothoraces. The pathophysiology of this phenomenon remains unclear but could be related to chronic inflammation with development of a fibrous layer along the visceral pleura.

A survey of access to trial of labor in California hospitals in 2012
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					In 2010, the NIH and ACOG recommended increasing women&#8217;s access to trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). This study explored access to TOLAC in California, change in access since 2007 and 2010, and characteristics of TOLAC and non-TOLAC hospitals.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Between November 2011 and June 2012, charge nurses at all civilian California birth hospitals were surveyed about hospitals&#8217; TOLAC availability and requirements for providers. VBAC rates were obtained from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). Distance between hospitals was calculated using OSHPD geocoding.
				
				
					
						Results
					All 243 birth hospitals that were contacted participated. In 2010, among the 56% TOLAC hospitals, the median VBAC rate among TOLAC hospitals was 10.8% (range 0-37.3%). The most cited reason for low VBAC rates was physician unwillingness to perform them, especially due to the requirement to be continually present during labor. TOLAC hospitals were more likely to be larger hospitals in urban communities with obstetrical residency training. However, there were six (11.3%) residency programs in non-TOLAC hospitals and 5 (13.5%) rural hospitals offering TOLAC. The majority of TOLAC hospitals had 24/7 anesthesia coverage and required the obstetrician to be continually present if a TOLAC patient was admitted; 17 (12.2%) allowed personnel to be 15-30 minutes away. TOLAC eligibility criteria included one prior cesarean (32.4%), spontaneous labor (52.5%), continuous fetal monitoring and intravenous access (99.3%), and epidural analgesia (19.4%). The mean distance from a non-TOLAC to a TOLAC hospital was 37 mi. with 25% of non-TOLAC hospitals more than 51 mi. from the closest TOLAC hospital.In 2012, 139 hospitals (57.2%) offered TOLAC, 16.6% fewer than in 2007. Since 2010, five hospitals started and four stopped offering TOLAC, a net gain of one hospital offering TOLAC with three more considering it. Only two hospitals cited change in ACOG guidelines as a reason for the change.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Despite the 2010 NIH and ACOG recommendations encouraging greater access to TOLAC, 44% of California hospitals do not allow TOLAC. Of the 56% allowing TOLAC, 10.8% report fewer than 3% VBAC births. Thus, national recommendations encouraging greater access to TOLAC had a minor effect in California.

Keratinocyte growth factor in acute lung injury to reduce pulmonary dysfunction ¿ a randomised placebo-controlled trial (KARE): study protocol
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Acute lung injury is a common, devastating clinical syndrome associated with substantial mortality and morbidity with currently no proven therapeutic interventional strategy to improve patient outcomes. The objectives of this study are to test the potential therapeutic effects of keratinocyte growth factor for patients with acute lung injury on oxygenation and biological indicators of acute inflammation, lung epithelial and endothelial function, protease:antiprotease balance, and lung extracellular matrix degradation and turnover.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					This will be a prospective, randomised, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, phase 2, multicentre trial. Randomisation will be stratified by presence of severe sepsis requiring vasopressors. Patients in an ICU fulfilling the American&#8211;European Consensus Conference Definition of acute lung injury will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive an intravenous bolus of either keratinocyte growth factor (palifermin, 60 &#956;g/kg) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) daily for a maximum of 6 days. The primary endpoint of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of palifermin to improve the oxygenation index at day 7 or the last available oxygenation index prior to patient discontinuation from the study.A formal statistical analysis plan has been constructed. Analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. A single analysis is planned at the end of the trial. P = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant and all tests will be two-sided. For continuously distributed outcomes, differences between groups will be tested using independent-sample t tests, analysis of variance and analysis of covariance with transformation of variables to normality or nonparametric equivalents. The trial will be reported in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (Consort 2010 guidelines).

Paired inspiratory-expiratory chest CT scans to assess for small airways disease in COPD
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Gas trapping quantified on chest CT scans has been proposed as a surrogate for small airway disease in COPD. We sought to determine if measurements using paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans may be better able to separate gas trapping due to emphysema from gas trapping due to small airway disease.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Smokers with and without COPD from the COPDGene Study underwent inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans. Emphysema was quantified by the percent of lung with attenuation&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#8722;950HU on inspiratory CT. Four gas trapping measures were defined: (1) Exp&#8722;856, the percent of lung&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#8722;856HU on expiratory imaging; (2) E/I MLA, the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory mean lung attenuation; (3) RVC856-950, the difference between expiratory and inspiratory lung volumes with attenuation between &#8722;856 and &#8722;950 HU; and (4) Residuals from the regression of Exp&#8722;856 on percent emphysema.
				
				
					
						Results
					In 8517 subjects with complete data, Exp&#8722;856 was highly correlated with emphysema. The measures based on paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans were less strongly correlated with emphysema. Exp&#8722;856, E/I MLA and RVC856-950 were predictive of spirometry, exercise capacity and quality of life in all subjects and in subjects without emphysema. In subjects with severe emphysema, E/I MLA and RVC856-950 showed the highest correlations with clinical variables.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Quantitative measures based on paired inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans can be used as markers of small airway disease in smokers with and without COPD, but this will require that future studies acquire both inspiratory and expiratory CT scans.

Cardiac progenitor cells support optimal heart function and repair
Heart disease remains a serious and intractable disease resulting in decreased productivity and increased mortality throughout the world. Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) have been shown to be a potential cellular therapeutic approach to blunt tissue damage and facilitate reparative and regenerative processes after myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac progenitor cells are important for maintenance of myocardial structure and function, but molecular mechanisms governing CPCs remain obscure and require elucidation to enhance regenerative therapeutic approaches. Normal CPCs engineered with fluorescent reporter protein constructs under control of the alphaMHC promoter show transgene protein expression, confirming activity of the promoter in CPCs. Cultured CPCs from both non-transgenic and cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing survival kinases driven by the alphaMHC promoter were analyzed to characterize transgene expression following treatments to promote differentiation in culture. Green fluorescent protein under regulatory control of the endogenous Sca-1 promoter is present in vascular structures in mature mice. However, lack of Sca-1 does not result in a primary vascular defect. Instead, genetic deletion of Sca-1 results in early-onset cardiac contractile deficiency as determined by echocardiography and hemodynamics. ScaKI mice show compromised capacity to survive myocardial infarction relative to normal control subjects. Resident cardiac progenitor cells in ScaKI mice do not respond to pathological damage in vivo, consistent with observations of impaired growth and survival of ScaKI cardiac progenitor cells in vitro. Genetic deletion of Sca -1 causes primary cardiac defects in myocardial contractility and repair. These defects are likely due to impairment of resident cardiac progenitor cell proliferative capacity, possibly through altered Lef1 transcription factor expression. Thus, disruption of cardiac progenitor cells results in a heart that is slightly impaired in normal function with greatly reduced capacity to repair itself after injury. CPCs have also been shown to respond to aging or general cardiomyopathy as damage. CPCs can be isolated and cultured from middle- aged hearts but they exhibit slightly impaired growth kinetics. The CPCs used for autologous cardiac progenitor cell therapy purposes would most likely benefit more from genetic engineering to increase proliferation and survival but they are still capable of supporting cardiac function in the context of aging and disease

Rapid 13C Urea Breath Test to Identify Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Emergency Department Patients with Upper Abdominal Pain
Introduction: In emergency department (ED) patients with upper abdominal pain, management includes ruling out serious diseases and providing symptomatic relief. One of the major causes of upper abdominal pain is an ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which can be treated and cured with antibiotics. We sought to estimate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in symptomatic patients using a convenience sample at a single urban academic ED and demonstrate the feasibility of ED-based testing. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with a chief complaint of pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen for 1 year from February 2011 until February 2012 at a single academic urban ED. Enrolled subjects were tested for H. pylori using a rapid point of care 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT) Exalenz Bioscience. We compared patient characteristics between those who tested positive versus negative for the disease.Results: A total of 205 patients with upper abdominal pain were tested over 12 months, and 24% (95% confidence interval: 19% to 30%) tested positive for H. pylori.  Black subjects were more likely to test positive than white subjects (28% v. 6%, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as age and sex, were not different between the 2 groups.Conclusion: In our ED, H. pylori infection was present in 1 in 4 patients with epigastric pain, and testing with a UBT was feasible. Further study is needed to determine the risk factors associated with infection, the prevalence of H. pylori in other EDs, the effect of the test on ED length of stay and the cost-effectiveness of an ED-based test-and-treat strategy.

Electronic Prehospital Records are Often Unavailable for Emergency Department Medical Decision Making
Introduction: To determine emergency physician (EP) opinions of prehospital patient care reports (PCRs) and whether such reports are available at the time of emergency department (ED) medical decision-making.
      
         Methods: Prospective, cross-sectional, electronic web-based survey of EPs regarding preferences and availability of prehospital PCRs at the time of ED medical decision-making.
      
         Results: We sent the survey to 1,932 EPs via 4 American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) email lists. As a result, 228 (11.8%) of email list members from 31 states and the District of Columbia completed the survey. Most respondents preferred electronic prehospital PCRs as opposed to handwritten prehospital PCRs (52.2% 95% confidence interval (CI): 49.1, 55.3 vs. 17.1% 95%CI: 11.7, 22.5). The remaining respondents (30.5% 95%CI: 26.0, 35.0) had no preference or had seen only one type of PCR. Of the respondents, 45.6% 95%CI: 42.1, 48.7 stated PCRs were “very important” while 43.0% 95% CI: 39.3, 46.7 rated PCRs as “important” in their ED practice. Most respondents (79.6% 95%CI: 76.5, 82.7) reported electronic prehospital PCRs were available ≤50% of the time for medical decision-making while 20.4% 95%CI: 9.2, 31.6 reported that electronic prehospital PCRs were available > 50% of the time (P=0.00). A majority of participants (77.6% 95%CI: 74.5, 80.7) reported that handwritten prehospital PCRs were available ≥ 50% while 22.4% 95%CI: 11.8, 33.0 of the time for medical decision-making (P=0.00).
      
         Conclusion: EPs in this study felt that prehospital PCRs were important to their ED practice and preferred electronic prehospital PCRs over handwritten PCRs. However, most electronic prehospital PCRs were unavailable at the time of ED medical decision-making. Although handwritten prehospital PCRs were more readily available, legibility and accuracy were reported concerns. This study suggest that strategies should be devised to improve the overall accuracy of PCRs and assure that electronic prehospital PCRs are delivered to the receiving ED in time for consideration in ED medical decision-making.

Abnormal Arterial Blood Gas and Lactate Levels Do Not Alter Disposition in Adult Blunt Trauma Patients after Early Computed Tomography
Introduction: Arterial blood gas and serum lactate (ABG / SL) values have been shown to be markers for occult shock and poor outcome following blunt trauma. However, the utility of ABG / SL in blunt trauma patients who also receive computed tomographies (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT C&A) remains unknown. Methods: A chart review was performed of all adult blunt trauma patients who received both CT C&A and ABG / SL upon presentation to our emergency department (ED) between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007. These patients (n=360) were identified from our institutional trauma registry database. Patients were divided into subgroups based upon whether they had a positive or negative ED evaluation for traumatic injury requiring hospitalization or immediate operative management. The expected course for patients with negative ED evaluations regardless of ABG / SL was discharge home. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a negative ED evaluation and an abnormal ABG or SL that were admitted to the hospital. Results: 2.9% of patients with a negative ED evaluation and abnormal ABG or SL were admitted. Of these, none were found to have any post-traumatic sequalae. Conclusion: We found that abnormal ABG / SL results do not change management or discharge disposition in patients without clinical or radiographic evidence of traumatic injury on CT C&A. Among patients who receive CT C&A, the routine measurement of arterial blood gas and lactate may be an unnecessary source of additional cost, patient discomfort, and delay in care.

Effects of pacing site on global and regional left ventricular function in the setting of dyssynchronous heart failure
Regional estimates of left ventricular function are important for understanding normal cardiac function. In the presence of electrical dyssynchrony and heart failure, substantial remodeling of left ventricular geometry and cellular function occurs, resulting in discoordinate mechanical contraction. However, the determinants of regional left ventricular function during altered electrical activation in the failing heart are unclear. Thus, we sought to investigate the effects of ventricular activation on left ventricular function in dyssynchronously failing hearts. Regional mechanics were measured in the anterolateral left ventricle in open-chest canine hearts. We found that the transmural location of the left ventricular pacing lead and its position in relation to the baseline activation sequence were important determinants of cardiac function. Specifically, improvements in hemodynamic function increased with activation time at the pacing site during endocardial, but not epicardial, biventricular pacing. At the inner wall, radial strain was increased during local endocardial pacing compared with epicardial pacing. In paced failing ventricles, regional differences in myofiber shortening were observed. End-systolic strains were significantly correlated with peak fiber prestretch. Additionally, the onset of sub-endocardial fiber relengthening and fiber shortening duration increased with local activation time, which may be due differences in fiber length. In model simulations, the effects of fiber length and shortening velocity on differences in fiber shortening magnitude, relengthening onset, and shortening duration were investigated. Removing both length and velocity dependence from the active stress model attenuated these differences, compared to baseline. Finally, we studied the effects of sheet structure and transmural activation sequence on regional function. Sheet angle was less radially oriented in failing hearts, compared with control, resulting in a reduced contribution of sheet extension. In failing hearts, reversal of the transmural activation sequence reduced the absolute magnitudes of sheet thickening and shearing at the inner wall, and altered the relative contributions to end-systolic wall thickening compared with normal. Overall, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which the amount of electrical dyssynchrony determines left ventricular function in the failing heart

Comparison of prasugrel and clopidogrel reloading on high platelet reactivity in clopidogrel-loaded patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PRAISE-HPR): a study protocol for a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Patients with reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel often have diminished platelet inhibition, a factor associated with increased rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical trials that have focused on reducing high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) with an additional loading dose of clopidogrel have reported varying effects. Prasugrel, a newer thienopyridine, exhibits a more consistent antiplatelet effect and more rapid onset time when compared to clopidogrel. We hypothesize that prasugrel reloading would be more effective than clopidogrel reloading in patients with HPR after an initial loading dose of clopidogrel.
				
				
					
						Method/Design
					Comparison of Prasugrel and Clopidogrel Reloading on High Platelet Reactivity in Clopidogrel-loaded Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PRAISE-HPR) is a prospective, randomized, open-label, active controlled study. A total of 76 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with HPR after administration of a loading dose of clopidogrel will be randomly assigned to either prasugrel or clopidogrel groups, and patients in each group will be reloaded with 20 mg of prasugrel or 300 mg of clopidogrel. The primary endpoint will be HPR at 24 hours after PCI, as determined by the VerifyNow assay during the study period. The rate of sustained high platelet reactivity and 30-day clinical outcomes will also be measured.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					PRAISE-HPR is a randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of reloading prasugrel and clopidogrel in suppressing residual high platelet reactivity. The results will be made publicly available in the year 2013.

Mechanisms of Nodal Metastasis in Prostate Cancer
Prostate is cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide and the second biggest killer among cancer related deaths in men. Due to advances in both detection as well as treatment, the disease can often be caught early when it is still confined within the prostate gland. The prognosis of patients when the disease is still confined within the organ is generally good. However, the prognosis in patients when the disease has spread to regional lymph nodes is very poor. Metastatic prostate cancer accounts for nearly all the mortality associated with prostate cancer. Numerous clinical studies have documented the importance of lymph node involvement in predicting patient survival. These data suggest that not only is lymph node involvement an important indicator of systemic metastases, they may be an active participant in the process.  In the present report, we provide insight into mechanisms that are involved in prostate cancer metastasis to lymph nodes. First, we examine the relationship between the lymphangiogenic mechanisms and prostate dissemination to lymph nodes. Second we, offer insight into lymph node specific homing mechanisms used by prostate cancer cells. Finally, we describe a strategy to interrogate the significance of lymph nodes as a reservoir of malignant cells that can fuel future metastatic dissemination. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in lymph node metastasis will allow us to better treat the metastatic disease.

Whole-exome sequencing of a pedigree segregating asthma
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Despite the success of genome-wide association studies for asthma, few, if any, definitively causal variants have been identified and there is still a substantial portion of the heritability of the disease yet to be discovered. Some of this &#8220;missing heritability&#8221; may be accounted for by family-specific coding variants found to be segregating with asthma.
				
				
					
						Methods
					To identify family-specific variants segregating with asthma, we recruited one family from a previous study of asthma as reporting multiple asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. We performed whole-exome sequencing on all four children and both parents and identified coding variants segregating with asthma that were not found in other variant databases.
				
				
					
						Results
					Ten novel variants were identified that were found in the two affected offspring and affected mother, but absent in the unaffected father and two unaffected offspring. Of these ten, variants in three genes (PDE4DIP, CBLB, and KALRN) were deemed of particular interest based on their functional prediction scores and previously reported function or asthma association. We did not identify any common risk variants segregating with asthma, however, we did observe an increase in the number of novel, nonsynonymous variants in asthma candidate genes in the asthmatic children compared to the non-asthmatic children.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This is the first report applying exome sequencing to identify asthma susceptibility variants. Despite having sequenced only one family segregating asthma, we have identified several potentially functional variants in interesting asthma candidate genes. This will provide the basis for future work in which more families will be sequenced to identify variants across families that cluster within genes.

SOD mimetic improves the function, growth, and survival of small-size liver grafts after transplantation in rats.
Small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) may occur when graft volume is less than 45% of the standard liver volume, and it manifests as retarded growth and failure of the grafts and more mortality. However, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, and few effective interventions have been attempted.
      The present study aimed to delineate the critical role of oxidant stress in SFSS and protective effects of a superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP), on graft function, growth, and survival in the recipient rats.
      Small size graft liver transplantation (SSGLT) was performed to determine the survival, graft injury, and growth. MnTBAP was administered in SSGLT recipients (SSGLT+MnTBAP).
      Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were sustained higher in SSGLT recipients, which were correlated with an increased apoptotic cell count and hepatocellular necrosis in liver sections. Malondialdehyde content, gene expression of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β, and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-κB in the grafts were increased significantly in SSGLT recipients compared with sham-operated controls. Both phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear c-Jun were increased in SSGLT. All these changes were strikingly reversed by the administration of MnTBAP, with an increase in serum superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, in situ bromodeoxyuridine incorporation demonstrated that graft regeneration was much more profound in the SSGLT+MnTBAP group than in the SSGLT group. Finally, the survival of recipients with MnTBAP treatments was significantly improved.
      Enhanced oxidant stress with activation of the p38/c-Jun/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway contributes to SFSS-associated graft failure, retarded graft growth, and poor survival. MnTBAP effectively reversed the pathologic changes in SFSS-associated graft failure.

Necessity of Lumbar Puncture in Patients Presenting with New Onset Complex Febrile Seizures
Introduction: This study aims to characterize the population of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) for a first complex febrile seizure, and subsequently assess the rate of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) occurrence in this population. Furthermore, this study seeks to identify whether a specific subset of patients may be atlesser risk for ABM or other serious neurological disease.
      
         Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the charts of patients between the ages of 6 months to 5 years of age admitted to an ED between 2005 and 2010 for a first complex febrile seizure (CFS). The health information department generated a patient list based onadmission and discharge diagnoses, which was screened for patient eligibility. Exclusion criteria included history of a complex febrile seizure, history of an afebrile seizure, trauma, or severe underlying neurological disorder. Data extracted included age, gender, relevant medical history, descriptions of seizure, treatment received, and follow-up data. Patientspresenting with two short febrile seizures within 24 hours were then analyzed separately to assess health outcomes in this population.
      
         Results: There were 193 patients were eligible. Lumbar puncture was performed on 136 subjects; it was significantly more likely to be performed on patients that presented with seizure focality, status epilepticus, or a need for intubation. Fourteen patients were found tohave pleocytosis following white blood cell (WBC) count correction, and 1 was diagnosed with ABM (0.5% 95% confidence interval: 0.0–1.5, n = 193). Forty-three patients had 2 brief febrile seizures within 24 hours. Of the 43, 17 received lumbar puncture while in the ED. None of these patients were found to have ABM or other serious neurological disease.
      
         Conclusion: ABM is rare in patients presenting with a first complex febrile seizure. Patients presenting only with 2 short febrile seizures within 24 hours may be less likely to have ABM, and may not require lumbar puncture without other clinical symptoms of neurological disease.

Text-mining applied to autoimmune disease research: the Sjögren¿s syndrome knowledge base
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome is a tissue-specific autoimmune disease that affects exocrine tissues, especially salivary glands and lacrimal glands. Despite a large body of evidence gathered over the past 60 years, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome. The goal of this study was to develop a database that collects and organizes gene and protein expression data from the existing literature for comparative analysis with future gene expression and proteomic studies of Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome.
				
				
					
						Description
					
					To catalog the existing knowledge in the field, we used text mining to generate the Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s Syndrome Knowledge Base (SSKB) of published gene/protein data, which were extracted from PubMed using text mining of over 7,700 abstracts and listing approximately 500 potential genes/proteins. The raw data were manually evaluated to remove duplicates and false-positives and assign gene names. The data base was manually curated to 477 entries, including 377 potential functional genes, which were used for enrichment and pathway analysis using gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome knowledge base (
						http://sskb.umn.edu) can form the foundation for an informed search of existing knowledge in the field as new potential therapeutic targets are identified by conventional or high throughput experimental techniques.

The Supreme Triumph of the Surgeon's Art': Narrative History of Endocrine Surgery
Endocrine surgery – the subspecialty of general surgery involving diseases of the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands as well as the endocrine pancreas – is a rapidly growing field of medicine that has a rich and fascinating history. As recently as the mid-19th Century, surgery for thyroid goiter was described as “horrid butchery” and believed by many to be too dangerous for any surgeon to attempt. Through the ingenuity and tireless efforts of surgeons in Europe and the U.S., thyroidectomy became a safe and even elegant operation, one that renowned Johns Hopkins surgeon William Halsted would describe in 1926 as representing “the supreme triumph of the surgeon’s art.” In this unique and captivating book, these and other seminal stories from the history of endocrine surgery are vividly retold by the current leaders in the field.

Self monitoring of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes: longitudinal qualitative study of patients' perspectives
Objective To explore views of patients with type 2 diabetes about self monitoring of blood glucose over time. Design Longitudinal, qualitative study. Setting Primary and secondary care settings across Lothian, Scotland. Participants 18 patients with type 2 diabetes. Main outcome measures Results from repeat in-depth interviews with patients over four years after clinical diagnosis. Results Analysis revealed three main themes—the role of health professionals, interpreting readings and managing high values, and the ongoing role of blood glucose self monitoring. Self monitoring decreased over time, and health professionals' behaviour seemed crucial in this: participants interpreted doctors' focus on levels of haemoglobin A1c, and lack of perceived interest in meter readings, as indicating that self monitoring was not worth continuing. Some participants saw readings as a proxy measure of good and bad behaviour—with women especially, chastising themselves when readings were high. Some participants continued to find readings difficult to interpret, with uncertainty about how to respond to high readings. Reassurance and habit were key reasons for continuing. There was little indication that participants were using self monitoring to effect and maintain behaviour change. Conclusions Clinical uncertainty about the efficacy and role of blood glucose self monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes is mirrored in patients' own accounts. Patients tended not to act on their self monitoring results, in part because of a lack of education about the appropriate response to readings. Health professionals should be explicit about whether and when such patients should self monitor and how they should interpret and act upon the results, especially high readings

Perception of malaria risk in a setting of reduced malaria transmission: a qualitative study in Zanzibar
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Malaria transmission has declined dramatically in Zanzibar in recent years. Continuing use of preventive measures such as long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs), and use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are essential to prevent malaria resurgence. This study employed qualitative methods to explore community perceptions of malaria risk and adherence to prevention measures in two districts in Zanzibar.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Key informant interviews with 24 primary health care providers and 24 focus group discussions with local residents in Zanzibar districts Wete and Central were conducted during April and May 2012 focusing on perception of malaria risk, current preventive practices used, reasons for using preventive practices and effective strategies for malaria control.
				
				
					
						Results
					Health care providers and residents appear to be aware of the decreasing incidence of malaria. Both groups continue the use of malaria preventive practices in this low and seasonal transmission setting. The most important preventive measures identified were LLINs, indoor residual spraying (IRS), and education. Barriers to malaria prevention include: lack of staff at clinics, insufficient number of LLINs distributed, and inadequate malaria education. Reasons for continued use of preventive practices include: fear of malaria returning to high levels, presence of mosquitoes during rainy seasons, and concern about local cases from other villages or imported cases from mainland Tanzania. Mosques, clinics, schools and community meetings were listed as most important sources of education. However, residents express the desire for more education.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Health care providers and residents generally reported consistent use of malaria preventive measures. However, maintaining and continuing to reduce malaria transmission will require ongoing education for both health care providers and residents to reinforce the importance of using preventive measures. Successful efforts to reduce malaria in Zanzibar will be jeopardized if residents believe that they are no longer at risk for malaria. In future studies, a year-round evaluation of the perception of malaria risk and use of preventive measures will inform the timing of education and prevention strategies for sustained malaria control.

Empirically Guided Coordination of Multiple Evidence-Based Treatments: Relevance Mapping
Well-designed studies have produced over 300 effective treatments that have been summarized in numerous lists of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). At the same time, the field is making great gains in the understanding of how to implement those treatments, once chosen. However, there is no structured guidance for how to select an optimal set of EBTs from those lists that is maximally relevant and minimally redundant with respect to its fit for a targeted service sample. This dissertation introduces relevance mapping, a methodology that addresses this problem. This dissertation consists of three studies that respectively describe the methodology, and use it to evaluate two open questions regarding treatment coordination. Relevance mapping uses automated comparison of the characteristics of each child in a targeted service sample to the participant characteristics from every study of every successful treatment. Relevance mapping addresses who is and is not coverable by any EBT in the literature, under configurable assumptions about which features must match between study participants and children in the service sample. Relevance mapping can then identify the minimum set of treatments needed to serve the maximum number of children in the service sample, based on those same user-defined matching features. The first study describes this methodology in detail along with the context of the problem it addresses within the framework of knowledge management in mental health. The second study compares the efficiency of relevance mapping results when treatments are defined as intact programs or as collections of their constituent procedures. Finally, the third study applies relevance mapping to a large mental health service agency sample to assess the degree to which EBTs fit the problems, demographics, and treatment settings of youths served using wraparound process. Wraparound is a widely implemented and highly popular model for organizing individualized treatments and supports for children with complex needs. However its effectiveness has long been in question, making the combination of wraparound and EBTs and intriguing possibility. The dissertation's overarching goal is to illustrate a methodology for better application of the evidence base to applied settings, under a variety of different definitions and assumptions.

Late pharmacologic conditioning with volatile anesthetics after cardiac surgery
Abstract
Introduction
The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate whether volatile anesthetics used for postoperative sedation have any beneficial effects on myocardial injury in cardiac surgery patients after on-pump valve replacement.

Methods
Anesthesia was performed with propofol. After arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU), 117 patients were randomized to be sedated for at least 4 hours with either propofol or sevoflurane. Sevoflurane was administered by using the anesthetic-conserving device. Troponin T, creatine kinase, creatine kinase from heart muscle tissue, myoglobin, and oxygenation index were determined on arrival at the ICU, 4 hours after sedation, and in the morning of the first postoperative day (POD1). Primary end points were cardiac injury markers on POD1. As secondary end points oxygenation, postoperative pulmonary complications, and ICU and hospital stay were documented.

Results
Fifty-six patients were analyzed in the propofol arm, and 46 patients in the sevoflurane arm. Treatment groups were comparable with regard to patient demographics and intraoperative characteristics. Concentration of troponin T as the most sensitive marker for myocardial injury at POD1 was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group compared with the propofol group (unadjusted difference, -0.4; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1; P &lt; 0.01; adjusted difference, -0.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to -0.02; P = 0.03, respectively).

Conclusions
The data presented in this investigation indicate that late postconditioning with the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane might mediate cardiac protection, even with a late, brief, and low-dose application.

The efficacy of vigorous-intensity exercise as an aid to smoking cessation in adults with elevated anxiety sensitivity: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Although cigarette smoking is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States (US), over 40 million adults in the US currently smoke. Quitting smoking is particularly difficult for smokers with certain types of psychological vulnerability. Researchers have frequently called attention to the relation between smoking and anxiety-related states and disorders, and evidence suggests that panic and related anxiety vulnerability factors, specifically anxiety sensitivity (AS or fear of somatic arousal), negatively impact cessation. Accordingly, there is merit to targeting AS among smokers to improve cessation outcome. Aerobic exercise has emerged as a promising aid for smoking cessation for this high-risk (for relapse) group because exercise can effectively reduce AS and other factors predicting smoking relapse (for example, withdrawal, depressed mood, anxiety), and it has shown initial efficacy for smoking cessation. The current manuscript presents the rationale, study design and procedures, 
and design considerations of the Smoking Termination Enhancement Project (STEP).
				
				
					
						Methods
					STEP is a randomized clinical trial that compares a vigorous-intensity exercise intervention to a health and wellness education intervention as an aid for smoking cessation in adults with elevated AS. One hundred and fifty eligible participants will receive standard treatment (ST) for smoking cessation that includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In addition, participants will be randomly assigned to either an exercise intervention (ST+EX) or a health and wellness education intervention (ST+CTRL). Participants in both arms will meet 3 times a week for 15 weeks, receiving CBT once a week for the first 7 weeks, and 3 supervised exercise or health and wellness education sessions (depending on randomization) per week for the full 15-week intervention. Participants will be asked to set a quit date for 6 weeks after the baseline visit, and smoking cessation outcomes as well as putative mediator variables will be measured up to 6 months following the quit date.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					The primary objective of STEP is to evaluate whether vigorous-intensity exercise can aid smoking cessation in anxiety vulnerable adults. If effective, the use of vigorous-intensity exercise as a component of smoking cessation interventions would have a significant public health impact. Specifically, in addition to improving smoking cessation treatment outcome, exercise is expected to offer benefits to overall health, which may be particularly important for smokers. The study is also designed to test putative mediators of the intervention effects and therefore has the potential to advance the understanding of exercise-anxiety-smoking relations and guide future research on this topic.

[depression, model, principal-agent, fitness, outcome, adaptive]

Evolution and Depression
The standard evolutionary explanation for depression is that being emotionally depressed is adaptive. We argue that being depressed is not adaptive (indeed, quite the opposite), but that the threat of depression for bad outcomes and the promise of pleasure for good outcomes are adaptive because they motivate people toward undertaking effort that increases fitness. We first model the optimal emotional incentive structure. We employ a principal-agent model, where the principal is the gene and the agent is the individual. The principal-agent model is a useful construct to characterize the long run tendency of evolutionary forces to reward those characteristics that increase fitness and survival of the gene. A key difference between our setup and the standard principal-agent model is that both punishment (depression) and reward (elation) have a fitness cost to the principal. We then discuss suboptimal outcomes, including bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, and lack of motivation.

Dietary Factors, Biomarkers and Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Postmenopausal Women: An Investigation of the Biologic Pathway for Reduced Diabetes Risk by Diet
Oxidative stress and chronic subclinical inflammation are implicated in the pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Consumption of vitamins and nutrients may dampen the harmful oxidative stress, which normally perpetuates inflammation. Reduction of inflammation may delay or reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However current research has not been able to confirm the nutrient-inflammation inverse association. Further, postmenopausal women have a different T2D risk and average C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations than premenopausal women or men of a similar age.     Moderate alcohol consumption is another dietary factor which has been associated with a reduced type 2 diabetes risk. Limited evidence also suggests alcohol consumption maybe associated with some sex hormones. Additionally, sex hormones have been associated with type 2 diabetes risk. However, sex hormones as mediators of the alcohol-type 2 diabetes association have not been established.     The overall objectives of this dissertation were to examine the role of certain dietary factors (vitamins, nutrients, and alcohol) and inflammation or sex hormones in the pathology of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women.      Three separate study designs, using 3 distinct datasets, were selected to evaluate the objectives of this dissertation. A cross-sectional study was employed to assess vitamins, nutrients, inflammation and T2D risk with data from the NHANES survey, a stratified, multistage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population in 2003-2006. Cross-sectional data from a nested, matched case-control study within the Women's Health Initiative-Observational Study (WHI-OS) were used to examine the separate relations of dietary or supplemental nutrients to biomarkers of inflammation. Prospective data from a matched, nested case-control study within the Women's Health Study (WHS) were used to examine whether circulating concentrations of sex hormones were associated with alcohol intake or mediated the alcohol-T2D association.     Nutrient concentrations measured in NHANES were different in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women, but were similar to men. The nutrients were not associated with reduced inflammation and T2D risk in postmenopausal women. WHI-OS data results indicate that dietary vitamin C, beta-carotene, and alpha-carotene as well as supplemental vitamin E and beta-carotene are modestly inversely associated with concentrations of systemic inflammatory biomarkers among postmenopausal women. The WHS cross-sectional analysis showed positive associations between alcohol intake and endogenous estradiol concentrations. Prospective WHS data suggested that baseline concentrations of estradiol and SHBG might influence the alcohol-T2D association in postmenopausal women.

Clinician-performed Beside Ultrasound for the  Diagnosis of Traumatic Pneumothorax
Introduction: Prior studies have reported conflicting results regarding the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax (PTX) because they have used sonologists with extensive experience. This study evaluates the characteristics of ultrasound for PTX for a large cohort of trauma and emergency physicians.
      Methods: This was a prospective, observational study on a convenience sample of patients presenting to a trauma center who had a thoracic ultrasound (TUS) evaluation for PTX performed after the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma exam. Sonologists recorded their findings prior to any other diagnostic studies. The results of TUS were compared to one or more of the following: chest computed tomography, escape of air on chest tube insertion, or supine chest radiography followed by clinical observation.
       Results: There were 549 patients enrolled. The median injury severity score of the patients was 5 (inter-quartile range IQR 1-14); 36 different sonologists performed TUS. Forty-seven of the 549 patients had traumatic PTX, for an incidence of 9%. TUS correctly identified 27/47 patients with PTX for a sensitivity of 57% (confidence interval CI 42-72%). There were 3 false positive cases of TUS for a specificity of 99% (CI 98%-100%). A “wet” chest radiograph reading done in the trauma bay showed a sensitivity of 40% (CI 23-59) and a specificity of 100% (99-100).
      Conclusion: In a large heterogenous group of clinicians who typically care for trauma patients, the sonographic evaluation for pneumothorax was as accurate as supine chest radiography. Thoracic ultrasound may be helpful in the initial evaluation of patients with truncal trauma. West J Emerg Med.

Does Limiting Oral Contrast Decrease Emergency Department Length of Stay ?
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact on emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) of a new protocol for intravenous (IV)-contrast only abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (ABCT) compared to historical controls.
      Methods: This was a retrospective case-controlled study performed at a single academic medical center. Patients ≥ 18 undergoing ABCT imaging for non-traumatic abdominal pain were included in the study. We compared ED LOS between historical controls undergoing ABCT imaging with PO/IV contrast and study patients undergoing an IV-contrast-only protocol. Imaging indications were the same for both groups and included patients with clinical suspicion for appendicitis, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, or perforation. We identified all patients from the hospital’s electronic storehouse (imaging code, ordering department, imaging times), and we abstracted ED LOS and disposition from electronic medical records.
      Results: Two hundred and eleven patients who underwent PO/IV ABCT prep were compared to 184 patients undergoing IV-contrast only ABCT prep. ED LOS was shorter for patients imaged with the IV-contrast only protocol (4:35 hrs vs. 6:39 hrs, p < 0.0001).
      Conclusion: Implementation of an IV-contrast only ABCT prep for select ED patients presenting for evaluation of acute abdominal pain significantly decreased ED LOS. West J Emerg Med 2012;13(5):383-387.

Effects of alterations in sarcomere structure and prestretch timing on cardiac muscle mechanics
Changes in mechanical function in the heart have been shown to be associated with different mechanisms of heart failure. Mechanical function is disrupted in dyssynchronous heart failure, as the timing of contraction in altered in different regions of the heart, preventing a uniform contraction. This dyssynchrony can be simulated using regional ventricular pacing, which also alters mechanical function. One purpose of the work presented here was to determine the effects of the altered cardiac muscle mechanics that arise due to regional ventricular pacing. It was found that a prestretch associated with dyssynchronous contraction can affect tension and work production in isolated cardiac muscle. The timing and magnitude of this stretch was also found to be of importance. Ultimately, the results could mostly be explained by a few well known muscle mechanics mechanisms: time-varying stiffness, the force-velocity relation, and shortening deactivation. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is another cause of heart failure, which can be brought about by mechanical dysfunction. The work presented here proposes a novel mechanism for contractile dysfunction associated with cardiac vinculin deletion, which is a precursor to dilated cardiomyopathy. It was shown that an increase in lattice spacing due to vinculin deletion increased transverse systolic stiffness and explains the altered systolic wall strains associated with vinculin deficiency. A combination of experiments, model development, and model simulation was used to uncover how changes in mechanical function associated with heart failure can alter cardiac muscle mechanics

Trust, confidentiality, and the acceptability of
sharing HIV-related patient data: lessons learned
from a mixed methods study about Health
Information Exchanges
AbstractBackgroundConcerns about the confidentiality of personal health information have been identified as a potential obstacle to implementation of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). Considering the stigma and confidentiality issues historically associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we examine how trust&#8212;in technology, processes, and people&#8212;influenced the acceptability of data sharing among stakeholders prior to implementation of six HIEs intended to improve HIV care in parts of the United States. Our analyses identify the kinds of concerns expressed by stakeholders about electronic data sharing and focus on the factors that ultimately facilitated acceptability of the new exchanges.MethodsWe conducted 549 surveys with patients and 66 semi-structured interviews with providers and other stakeholders prior to implementation of the HIEs to assess concerns about confidentiality in the electronic sharing of patient data. The patient quantitative data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 to yield sample descriptive statistics. The analysis of the qualitative interviews with providers and other stakeholders followed an open-coding process, and convergent and divergent perspectives emerging from those data were examined within and across the HIEs.ResultsWe found widespread acceptability for electronic sharing of HIV-related patient data through HIEs. This acceptability appeared to be driven by growing comfort with information technologies, confidence in the security protocols utilized to protect data, trust in the providers and institutions who use the technologies, belief in the benefits to the patients, and awareness that electronic exchange represents an enhancement of data sharing already taking place by other means. HIE acceptability depended both on preexisting trust among patients, providers, and institutions and on building consensus and trust in the HIEs as part of preparation for implementation. The process of HIE development also resulted in forging shared vision among institutions.ConclusionsPatients and providers are willing to accept the electronic sharing of HIV patient data to improve care for a disease historically seen as highly stigmatized. Acceptability depends on the effort expended to understand and address potential concerns related to data sharing and confidentiality, and on the trust established among stakeholders in terms of the nature of the systems and how they will be used.

ART adherence changes among patients in community substance use treatment: a preliminary analysis from MACH14
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Opiate substitution treatment has been associated with better adherence to lifesaving antiretroviral medications, but the impact of other substance abuse treatment on adherence is unknown.
				
				
					
						Findings
					
					In this study, 215 patients who had been in adherence-focused research studies provided electronically-measured adherence data and a measure of whether the patient had recently been in substance abuse treatment. Recent engagement in substance abuse treatment was independently associated with significantly higher adherence, after covarying for recent substance use and other factors potentially affecting adherence.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The findings suggest that substance abuse treatment is associated with better adherence. Potential mechanisms by which substance abuse treatment improves adherence, such as more stability or more future-orientation, require further study.

Chronic inflammatory injury results in increased coupling of delta opioid receptors to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Opioid receptors regulate a diverse array of physiological functions. Mu opioid receptor agonists are well-known analgesics for treating acute pain. In contrast, animal models suggest that chronic pain is more effectively relieved by delta opioid receptor agonists. A number of studies have shown that chronic pain results in increased function of delta opioid receptors. This is proposed to result from enhanced trafficking of the delta opioid receptor to the cell membrane induced by persistent tissue injury. However, recent studies have questioned this mechanism, which has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether delta opioid receptors are indeed upregulated in chronic pain states. To clarify this question, we have examined the effect of chronic inflammatory pain over time using both an ex vivo measure of delta function: receptor-Ca2+ channel coupling, and an in vivo measure; the relief of chronic pain by a delta opioid receptor agonist. In addition, as beta-arrestin 2 can regulate delta opioid receptor trafficking and signaling, we have further examined whether deleting this scaffolding and signal transduction molecule alters delta opioid receptor function.
				
				
					
						Results
					We used the Complete Freund&#8217;s Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, and examined the effectiveness of the delta agonist, SNC80, to both inhibit Ca2+ channels in primary afferent neurons and to attenuate mechanical allodynia. In na&#239;ve beta-arrestin 2 wildtype and knockout mice, SNC80 neither significantly inhibited voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents nor produced antinociception. However, following inflammatory pain, both measures showed a significant and long-lasting enhancement of delta opioid receptor function that persisted for up to 14&#160;days post-injury regardless of genotype. Furthermore, although this pain model did not alter Ca2+ current density, the contribution of N-type Ca2+ channels to the total current appeared to be regulated by the presence of beta-arrestin 2.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our results indicate that there is an upregulation of delta opioid receptor function following chronic pain. This gain of function is reflected in the increased efficacy of a delta agonist in both behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Overall, this work confirms that delta opioid receptors can be enhanced following tissue injury associated with chronic pain.

Bedside Teaching on Time to Disposition Improves Length of Stay for Critically-ill Emergency Departments Patients
Introduction: We tested the effect of a brief disposition process intervention on residents’ time to disposition and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) in high acuity ED patients. 
      
         Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study design in a single teaching hospital where ED residents are responsible for administrative bed requests for patients. Enrollment was performed for intervention and control groups on an even-odd day schedule. Inclusion criteria were ED patients triaged as Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 1 and 2. In the intervention group, the attending physician prompted the resident to make the disposition immediately after the evaluation of resuscitation patients. In the control group, the attending physicians did not intervene in the disposition process unless more than 2 hours passed without a disposition. Main outcomes were time to disposition and total ED LOS. 
      
         Results: A total of 104 patients were enrolled; 53 (51%) in the intervention group and 51 (49%) in the control group. After controlling for ESI and resident training year, mean disposition time was significantly shorter in the intervention group by 41.4 minutes (95% CI: 32.6-50.1). LOS was also shorter in the intervention group by 93.3 minutes (95% CI: 41.9-144.6). 
      
         Conclusion: Prompting residents to enter administrative disposition orders in high acuity patients is associated with significant reduction in both time to disposition and ED LOS. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):137-140.

Impact of hormone receptor status on patterns of recurrence and clinical outcomes among
patients with human epidermal growth factor-2-positive breast cancer  in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network: a prospective cohort study
Abstract
Introduction
In gene expression experiments, hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2)-positive tumors generally cluster within the luminal B subset; whereas HR-negative/HER2-positive tumors reside in the HER2-enriched subset. We investigated whether the clinical behavior of HER2-positive tumors differs by HR status.

Methods
We evaluated 3,394 patients who presented to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) centers with stage I to III HER2-positive breast cancer between 2000 and 2007. Tumors were grouped as HR-positive/HER2-positive (HR+/HER2+) or HR-negative/HER2-positive (HR-/HER2+). Chi-square, logistic regression and Cox hazard proportional regression were used to compare groups.

Results
Median follow-up was four years. Patients with HR-/HER2+ tumors (n = 1,379, 41% of total) were more likely than those with HR+/HER-2+ disease (n = 2,015, 59% of total) to present with high histologic grade and higher stages (P &lt;0.001). Recurrences were recorded for 458 patients. HR-/HER2+ patients were less likely to experience first recurrence in bone (univariate Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.34 to 0.82, P = 0.005) and more likely to recur in brain (univariate OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.93, P = 0.033). A lower risk of recurrence in bone persisted after adjusting for age, stage and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.83, P = 0.005) and when first and subsequent sites of recurrence were both considered (multivariable OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.80, P = 0.002).
As compared with patients with HR+/HER2+ disease, those with HR-/HER2+ disease had significantly increased hazard of early, but not late, death (hazard ratio of death zero to two years after diagnosis = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.86, P = 0.002, hazard ratio of death two to five years after diagnosis = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.00, P = 0.001; hazard ratio of death more than five years after diagnosis = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.19, P = 0.285, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, stage at diagnosis, grade and year of diagnosis).

Conclusions
Presenting features, patterns of recurrence and survival of HER2-positive breast cancer differed by HR status. These differences should be further explored and integrated in the design of clinical trials.

Discussions of Adherence in Medical Interactions: Communication Between Physicians and Older Patients
Developing health-promoting habits and adhering to prescribed treatments are critical components in the management of one's health.  However, patient adherence is a challenging process that is affected by a variety of factors, including communication between the healthcare provider and patient.  The objective of this study was to develop a reliable and valid rating scale, called the Discussions of Adherence in Medical Interactions Scale (DAMIS), to assess physician-patient communication regarding adherence.  Four judges used the DAMIS to rate 135 audiotaped primary care interactions between 73 physicians and their 135 patients aged 60 and older. The DAMIS was shown to have adequate interrater reliability, and the DAMIS composites (physician communication, patient involvement, facilitators of adherence, and barriers to adherence) demonstrated good internal consistency reliability.  The DAMIS was also shown to have excellent convergent validity due to its large correlations with another observer-rated measure of physician-patient communication, the Bayer Global Rating Scale (Haskard et al., 2008). Further evidence of validity was provided by the correlations between the DAMIS composites and patient satisfaction with decision-making and choice in the medical visits. As expected, when patients were more involved in the interaction, physicians reported being more satisfied with the patient and with their relationship. More discussion about facilitators of adherence was associated with greater physician satisfaction, whereas more discussion about barriers to adherence was associated with less physician satisfaction.  Although the DAMIS composites were not significantly correlated with self-report measures of patient adherence, a regression analysis revealed that more patient involvement was associated with greater medication adherence over the past week, controlling for the other DAMIS composites and patient demographics. Physician-level analyses revealed that female physicians were more likely than male physicians to discuss barriers to adherence with their patients, and near-significant correlations suggest that older and more experienced physicians may be relatively less effective at communicating with patients. However, DAMIS scores did not differ based on physician attitudes (i.e., satisfaction with practice, quality of life, and stress), physician ethnicity, or aspects of their professional training. Strengths and limitations of the study, as well as clinical implications, are discussed.

The Impact of Emergency Physician Turnover on Planning for Prospective Clinical Trials
Introduction: Emergency physician (EP) turnover is a significant issue that can have strong economic impact on hospital systems, as well as implications on research efforts to test and improve clinical practice. This work is particularly important to researchers planning randomized trials directed toward EPs because a large degree of turnover within a physician group would attenuate the effectiveness of the desired intervention. We sought to determine the incidence and factors associated with EP workforce changes.
      Methods: In an attempt to determine EP turnover and workforce change, data from the INSTINCT (INcreasing Stroke Treatment through INterventional behavior Change Tactics) trial were used. The INSTINCT trial is a prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial evaluating a targeted behavioral intervention to increase appropriate use of tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke. Individual EPs staffing each of the study hospitals were identified at baseline and 18 months. Surveys were sent to EPs at both intervals. Models were constructed to investigate relationships between physician/hospital characteristics and workforce change.
      Results: A total of 278 EPs were identified at baseline. Surveys were sent to all EPs at baseline and 18 months with a response rate of 72% and 74%, respectively. At 18 months, 37 (15.8%) had left their baseline hospital and 66 (26.3%) new EPs were working. Seven EPs switched hospitals within the sample. The total number of EPs at 18 months was 307, a 10.8% overall increase. Among the 24 hospitals, 6 had no EP departures and 5 had no new arrivals. The median proportion of EP workforce departing by hospital was 16% (interquartile range IQR ¼ 4%–25%; range ¼ 0%–73%), and the median proportion added was 21% (IQR ¼ 7%–41%; range ¼ 0%–120%). None of the evaluatedcovariates investigating relationships between physician/hospital characteristics and workforce change were significant.
      Conclusion: EP workforce changes over an 18-month period were common. This has implications for emergency department directors, researchers, and individual EPs. Those planning research involvinginterventions upon EPs should account for turnover as it may have an impact when designing clinical trials to improve performance on healthcare delivery metrics for time-sensitive medical conditions suchas stroke, acute myocardial infarction, or trauma.

Recurrent/moderate hypoglycemia induces hippocampal dendritic injury, microglial activation, and cognitive impairment in diabetic rats
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Recurrent/moderate (R/M) hypoglycemia is common in type 1 diabetes. Although mild or moderate hypoglycemia is not life-threatening, if recurrent, it may cause cognitive impairment. In the present study, we sought to determine whether R/M hypoglycemia leads to neuronal death, dendritic injury, or cognitive impairment.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The experiments were conducted in normal and in diabetic rats. Rats were subjected to moderate hypoglycemia by insulin without anesthesia. Oxidative stress was evaluated by 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal immunostaining and neuronal death was determined by Fluoro-Jade B staining 7&#8201;days after R/M hypoglycemia. To test whether oxidative injury caused by NADPH oxidase activation, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, was used. Cognitive function was assessed by Barnes maze and open field tests at 6&#8201;weeks after R/M hypoglycemia.
				
				
					
						Results
					The present study found that oxidative injury was detected in the dendritic area of the hippocampus after R/M hypoglycemia. Sparse neuronal death was found in the cortex, but no neuronal death was detected in the hippocampus. Significant cognitive impairment and thinning of the CA1 dendritic region was detected 6&#8201;weeks after hypoglycemia. Oxidative injury, cognitive impairment, and hippocampal thinning after R/M hypoglycemia were more severe in diabetic rats than in non-diabetic rats. Oxidative damage in the hippocampal CA1 dendritic area and microglial activation were reduced by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					The present study suggests that oxidative injury of the hippocampal CA1 dendritic region by R/M hypoglycemia is associated with chronic cognitive impairment in diabetic patients. The present study further suggests that NADPH oxidase inhibition may prevent R/M hypoglycemia-induced hippocampal dendritic injury.

Emergency Physician Estimation of Blood Loss
Introduction: Emergency physicians (EP) frequently estimate blood loss, which can have implications for clinical care. The objectives of this study were to examine EP accuracy in estimating blood loss on different surfaces and compare attending physician and resident performance.
      Methods: A sample of 56 emergency department (ED) physicians (30 attending physicians and 26 residents) were asked to estimate the amount of moulage blood present in 4 scenarios: 500 mL spilled onto an ED cot; 25 mL spilled onto a 10-pack of 434-inch gauze; 100 mL on a T-shirt; and 150 mL in a commode filled with water. Standard estimate error (the absolute value of (estimated volume actual volume)/actual volume3100) was calculated for each estimate.
      Results: The mean standard error for all estimates was 116% with a range of 0% to 1233%. Only 8% of estimates were within 20% of the true value. Estimates were most accurate for the sheet scenario andworst for the commode scenario. Residents and attending physicians did not perform significantly differently (P . 0.05).
      Conclusion: Emergency department physicians do not estimate blood loss well in a variety of scenarios. Such estimates could potentially be misleading if used in clinical decision making. Clinical experience does not appear to improve estimation ability in this limited study. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):376–379.

Variation in Specialists’ Reported Hospitalization Practices of Children Sustaining Blunt Abdominal Trauma
Introduction: Children with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) are often hospitalized despite no intervention. We identified factors associated with emergency department (ED) disposition of children with BAT and differing computed tomography (CT) findings.
      Methods: We surveyed pediatric and general emergency physicians (EPs), pediatric and trauma surgeons regarding care of two hypothetical asymptomatic patients: a 9-year-old struck by a slow-moving car (Case 1) and an 11-month-old who fell 10 feet (Case 2). We presented various abdominal CT findings and asked physicians about disposition preferences. We evaluated predictors of patient discharge using multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for hospital and ED characteristics, and clinician experience. Pediatric EPs served as the reference group.
      Results: Of 2,003 eligible surveyed, 636 (32%) responded. For normal CTs, 99% would discharge in Case 1 and 88% in Case 2. Prominent specialty differences included: for trace intraperitoneal fluid (TIF), 68% would discharge in Case 1 and 57% in Case 2. Patients with TIF were less likely to be discharged by pediatric surgeons (Case 1: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32, 0.82; Case 2: OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30, 0.79). Patients with renal contusions were less likely to be discharged by pediatric surgeons (Case 1: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.95) and more likely by general EPs (Case 1: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.25, 2.69; Case 2: OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.14, 4.89).
      Conclusion: Substantial variation exists between specialties in reported hospitalization practices of asymptomatic children after abdominal trauma with minor CT findings. Better evidence is needed to guide disposition decisions. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(1):37-46.

The present dissertation empirically examines the impact of death thoughts on intergroup relations; the findings are explained using Terror Management Theory (TMT). TMT   proposes that when mortality is made salient (Mortality Salience Hypothesis, MSH) people are more likely to exhibit greater positive evaluations of their in-group; greater adherence to the values of their in-group. People have a tendency to do this because culture tends to confer self-esteem (i.e., immortality), which allegedly mitigates death anxiety. Therefore, while there is a general tendency for people to exhibit greater positive evaluations of their in-group in the face of death, people who are high in tolerance are hypothesized to show out-group favoritism or, at least, no bias; while people who are intolerant should show in-group favoritism. Three studies investigated these hypotheses. In Study 1, participants were asked to evaluate presidential candidates Obama and McCain after answering questions regarding their own death (i.e., mortality condition) or answering question about a university exam (i.e., control condition). Although the expected main effect of mortality salience on in-group favoritism was not significant, participants high in openness exhibited out-group favoritism. Study 2 examined these processes by having participants evaluate a pro and an anti-gay marriage author following a reminder of their own mortality or an exam. Beyond a significant main effect for in-group favoritism, participants low in openness exhibited the Terror Management effect. The third study examined the MSH after participants watched a movie entitled The Final Destination (i.e., "mortality condition") or another movie (i.e., "control condition"). They then evaluated a pro and an anti-gay marriage author. Beyond an expected significant relationship between the type of movie watched and positive evaluations, participants high in similarity to the author who supported their view exhibited what the MSH would predict - greater positive in-group evaluations. Those low in similarity exhibited the reverse of this effect. Assuming that one's similarity rating for a culture is based on the extent the culture either upholds or challenges one's identity, it would make sense - according to the MSH - for these effects to manifest.  Limitations of these studies and their relevance to Terror Management Theory are discussed.

Human cytomegalovirus subverts and utilizes components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in facilitating a productive infection
This dissertation further explores some of the many facets by which human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) subverts and utilizes components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in facilitating a productive infection. HCMV infection causes severe cell cycle deregulation and arrest, mediated in part by the deactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), one of the main E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in cell cycle regulation. By characterizing the effects on the APC subunits and its co-activator Cdh1 during the infection, I have further delineated the mechanism(s) by which APC Cdh1 is disabled during the infection. Cdh1 becomes abnormally phosphorylated early in the infection in a Cdk-independent manner, which may inhibit its ability to bind and activate the APC. UL97 is identified as the viral protein kinase involved in mediating Cdh1 phosphorylation. Analysis of the APC core subunits reveals that the complex dissociates during the infection with the TPR subunits relocalizing to the cytoplasm while APC1 remains nuclear, which is caused by the proteasome- mediated degradation of APC5 and APC4. Studies utilizing a UL97-deletion virus indicate that Cdh1 phosphorylation and APC dissociation occur independently despite similar kinetics. The possible redundancy of these mechanisms underlies the importance of deactivating the APC during the infection. The targeting of an intermediate component in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is necessary as inhibition of the proteasome is also found to be detrimental to viral replication. Proteasome inhibition assays show that proteasome activity is required at all stages of the infection. Moreover, proteasome activity increases as the infection progresses, and proteasome subunits relocalize in and around viral replication centers. Characterization of the peri-replication center region shows it to be proteolytically and transcriptionally active. Taken together, these results suggest that proteasomes (or specific subunits) may play a direct role in facilitating viral DNA replication and transcription

Hepatic Abscess: Case Report And Review
Hepatic abscess is an uncommon occurrence in North America, but can be a diagnostic challenge for ED physicians. The clinical signs and symptoms may vary, leading to delays in diagnosis and higher morbidity. We present a case of a 35-year old male with a hepatic abscess initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia. On subsequent return to the ED for back pain complaints, a bedside ultrasound led to the appropriate diagnosis. This case report and discussion will attempt to review the literature on the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of hepatic abscess for the emergency physician. West J Emerg Med.

Photodynamic and Antibiotic Therapy Impair the Pathogenesis of Enterococcus faecium in a Whole Animal Insect Model
Enterococcus faecium has emerged as one of the most important pathogens in healthcare-associated infections worldwide due to its intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics, including vancomycin. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is an alternative therapeutic platform that is currently under investigation for the control and treatment of infections. PDT is based on the use of photoactive dye molecules, widely known as photosensitizer (PS). PS, upon irradiation with visible light, produces reactive oxygen species that can destroy lipids and proteins causing cell death. We employed Galleria mellonella (the greater wax moth) caterpillar fatally infected with E. faecium to develop an invertebrate host model system that can be used to study the antimicrobial PDT (alone or combined with antibiotics). In the establishment of infection by E. faecium in G. mellonella, we found that the G. mellonella death rate was dependent on the number of bacterial cells injected into the insect hemocoel and all E. faecium strains tested were capable of infecting and killing G. mellonella. Antibiotic treatment with ampicillin, gentamicin or the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin prolonged caterpillar survival infected by E. faecium (P = 0.0003, P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). In the study of antimicrobial PDT, we verified that methylene blue (MB) injected into the insect followed by whole body illumination prolonged the caterpillar survival (P = 0.0192). Interestingly, combination therapy of larvae infected with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, with antimicrobial PDT followed by vancomycin, significantly prolonged the survival of the caterpillars when compared to either antimicrobial PDT (P = 0.0095) or vancomycin treatment alone (P = 0.0025), suggesting that the aPDT made the vancomycin resistant E. faecium strain more susceptible to vancomycin action. In summary, G. mellonella provides an invertebrate model host to study the antimicrobial PDT and to explore combinatorial aPDT-based treatments.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and dermatomyositis: an analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample survey
Abstract
Introduction
Increased rates of cardiovascular disease are implicated in several rheumatologic diseases. Our aim was to characterize dermatomyositis hospitalizations and evaluate cardiovascular-associated mortality in this patient population.

Methods
We examined the frequency and mortality rates of several atherosclerotic cardiovascular diagnoses and procedures among hospitalized adult patients with dermatomyositis using data from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 1993 to 2007. We compared the odds of death among hospitalized dermatomyositis patients with each cardiovascular diagnosis or procedure to those without, as well as to controls with cardiovascular diagnoses, using logistic regression.

Results
A total of 50,322 hospitalizations of dermatomyositis patients occurred between 1993 and 2007 (mean age 58 years, and 73% female). Of all dermatomyositis hospitalizations, 20% were associated with a concurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular diagnosis or procedure. The overall in-hospital mortality was 5.7%. Dermatomyositis patients with any associated atherosclerotic cardiovascular diagnosis or procedure were twice as likely to die during the inpatient stay compared to dermatomyositis patients who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.0 95% CI 1.7-2.5, p &lt; 0.0001). The odds ratio for death in patients with both dermatomyositis and cardiovascular disease compared to controls with cardiovascular disease alone was 1.98 (95% CI 1.57-2.48) in multivariate adjusted models.

Conclusions
Approximately one fifth of dermatomyositis hospitalizations in the US were associated with an atherosclerotic cardiovascular diagnosis or procedure. These patients have double the risk of in-hospital death in comparison with controls and dermatomyositis patients without a cardiovascular diagnosis, making identification of these groups important for both prognostic purposes and clinical care.

Bedside Teaching on Time to Disposition Improves Length of Stay for Critically-Ill Emergency Departments Patients
Introduction:We tested the effect of a brief disposition process intervention on residents’ time to disposition and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) in high acuity ED patients.
       
      Methods:This was a quasi-experimental study design in a single teaching hospital where ED residents are responsible for administrative bed requests for patients. Enrollment was performed for intervention and control groups on an even-odd day schedule. Inclusion criteria were ED patients triaged as Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 1 and 2. In the intervention group, the attending physician prompted the resident to make the disposition immediately after the evaluation of resuscitation patients. In the control group, the attending physicians did not intervene in the disposition process unless more than 2 hours passed without a disposition. Main outcomes were time to disposition and total ED LOS.
       
      Results:A total of 104 patients were enrolled; 53 (51%) in the intervention group and 51 (49%) in the control group. After controlling for ESI and resident training year, mean disposition time was significantly shorter in the intervention group by 41.4 minutes (95% CI: 32.6-50.1). LOS was also shorter in the intervention group by 93.3 minutes (95% CI: 41.9-144.6).
       
      Conclusion:Prompting residents to enter administrative disposition orders in high acuity patients is associated with significant reduction in both time to disposition and ED LOS. West J Emerg Med.

Coxsackievirus pathogenesis in the neonatal central nervous system : virus dissemination, the host response to infection, and the autophagic process during viral replication
Coxsackievirus is a common viral pathogen in newborn infants that is capable of causing pancreatitis, myocarditis, and meningitis in the acute stages of infection. Due to the ability of the virus to target the brain, a neonatal mouse model was developed in order to study the effects of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in the central nervous system (CNS). A novel population of myeloid cells was observed that rapidly entered the neonatal CNS through the choroid plexus, which mediates the blood-cerebral spinal fluid barrier, specifically after CVB3 infection. These myeloid cells were highly susceptible to infection, based on the expression of eGFP from recombinant eGFP expressing coxsackievirus (eGFP- CVB3). They were also found to express nestin, a neural stem cell marker, and move from the choroid plexus into the parenchyma of the brain, as observed by serial immunofluorescence images. Therefore, these cells may provide an innovative method of viral dissemination in the neonatal CNS. In addition, a unique chemokine induction profile was detected in the choroid plexus following CVB3 infection which may contribute to myeloid cell infiltration and subsequent choroid plexus damage. These results with CVB3 were then compared to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a contrasting neurotropic RNA virus in the neonatal CNS, and several differences in stem cell tropism, the immune response and pathology were found. The neonatal mouse model also revealed that neural progenitor and stem cells (NPSCs) are highly susceptible to CVB3 infection. Since several picornaviruses have recently been shown to induce autophagy in order to aid viral replication, we investigated the role of autophagy during acute CVB3 infection in NPSCs. We revealed that CVB3 infection in NPSCs does not induce autophagy, in contrast to cardiomyocytes. Thus, we hypothesize that the role of autophagy during CVB3 infection is cell-type specific. Taken together, these results show that acute CVB3 infection in the neonatal CNS elicits a unique and multifaceted response from the host

Misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage prevention at home birth: an integrative review of global implementation experience to date
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Hemorrhage continues to be a leading cause of maternal death in developing countries. The 2012 World Health Organization guidelines for the prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) recommend oral administration of misoprostol by community health workers (CHWs). However, there are several outstanding questions about distribution of misoprostol for PPH prevention at home births.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We conducted an integrative review of published research studies and evaluation reports from programs that distributed misoprostol at the community level for prevention of PPH at home births. We reviewed methods and cadres involved in education of end-users, drug administration, distribution, and coverage, correct and incorrect usage, and serious adverse events.
				
				
					
						Results
					Eighteen programs were identified; only seven reported all data of interest. Programs utilized a range of strategies and timings for distributing misoprostol. Distribution rates were higher when misoprostol was distributed at a home visit during late pregnancy (54.5-96.9%) or at birth (22.5-83.6%), compared to antenatal care (ANC) distribution at any ANC visit (22.5-49.1%) or late ANC visit (21.0-26.7%). Coverage rates were highest when CHWs and traditional birth attendants distributed misoprostol and lower when health workers/ANC providers distributed the medication. The highest distribution and coverage rates were achieved by programs that allowed self-administration. Seven women took misoprostol prior to delivery out of more than 12,000 women who were followed-up. Facility birth rates increased in the three programs for which this information was available. Fifty-one (51) maternal deaths were reported among 86,732 women taking misoprostol: 24 were attributed to perceived PPH; none were directly attributed to use of misoprostol. Even if all deaths were attributable to PPH, the equivalent ratio (59 maternal deaths/100,000 live births) is substantially lower than the reported maternal mortality ratio in any of these countries.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Community-based programs for prevention of PPH at home birth using misoprostol can achieve high distribution and use of the medication, using diverse program strategies. Coverage was greatest when misoprostol was distributed by community health agents at home visits. Programs appear to be safe, with an extremely low rate of ante- or intrapartum administration of the medication.

Automatic sensory discrimination impairment in prodromal and recent-onset schizophrenia
Deficits in automatic sensory discrimination, as indexed by mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a, are well documented in schizophrenia patients and could underlie deficits in more complex cognitive operations, as well as clinical symptoms and real-life functioning. Although there is ample evidence to suggest that MMN is impaired in chronic schizophrenia, its reduction has not been as robust in the early stages of the disease. Moreover, MMN has not been sufficiently researched in subjects at risk for schizophrenia. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the early stages of auditory information processing in recent-onset schizophrenia and the putative prodrome by examining the amplitude and topography of MMN and P3a. The secondary aim was to explore the relationships of MMN and P3a deficits to the severity of clinical symptoms and social functioning impairment. We assessed 26 at-risk individuals, 28 recent-onset schizophrenia patients, and 31 age-matched healthy comparison subjects on a duration-deviant MMN paradigm as well as a battery of clinical and social functioning measures. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed large effect size MMN amplitude reductions in recent-onset patients and modest effect size MMN reductions in at-risk individuals. Additionally, both patient groups had significant P3a amplitude reductions relative to the healthy comparison group. As expected, there were no significant group differences in MMN and P3a topographic distributions. MMN was found to be independent of clinical symptomatology, whereas reduced P3a correlated with more severe negative symptoms in the at-risk group. Contrary to predictions, smaller MMN and P3a activity was associated with better social and family functioning within the patient groups, unlike the inverse association in chronic schizophrenia patients. In summary, our findings point to deviance detection abnormalities in subjects identified as putatively prodromal for schizophrenia as well as those with manifest schizophrenia. Those persons may incorrectly process auditory input or underdetect changes in their acoustic environment, failing to notice stimuli that are usually salient to most people. MMN and P3a exhibit promise as trait markers for schizophrenia as they appear to be deficient before the onset of full-blown psychosis as well as during the first two years of the illness

Shock Index and Early Recognition of Sepsis in the Emergency Department: Pilot Study
Introduction: Screening for severe sepsis in adult emergency department (ED) patients may involve potential delays while waiting for laboratory testing, leading to postponed identification or over-utilization of resources. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria are in­accurate at predicting clinical outcomes in sepsis. Shock index (SI), defined as heart rate / systolic blood pressure, has previously been shown to identify high risk septic patients. Our objective was to compare the ability of SI, individual vital signs, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria to predict the primary outcome of hyperlactatemia (serum lactate ≥ 4.0 mmol/L) as a surrogate for disease severity, and the secondary outcome of 28-day mortality. 
      
         Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of adult ED patients at an academic community trauma center with 95,000 annual visits, from February 1st, 2007 to May 28th, 2008. Adult patients presenting to the ED with a suspected infection were screened for severe sepsis using a standardized institutional electronic order set, which included triage vital signs, basic labora­tory tests and an initial serum lactate level. Test characteristics were calculated for two outcomes: hyperlactatemia (marker for morbidity) and 28-day mortality. We considered the following covariates in our analysis: heart rate >90 beats/min; mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg; respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min; ≥ 2 SIRS with vital signs only; ≥2 SIRS including white blood cell count; SI ≥ 0.7; and SI ≥ 1.0. We report sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values for the primary and secondary outcomes. 
      
         Results: 2524 patients (89.4%) had complete records and were included in the analysis. 290 (11.5%) patients presented with hyperlactatemia and 361 (14%) patients died within 28 days. Subjects with an abnormal SI of 0.7 or greater (15.8%) were three times more likely to present with hyperlactatemia than those with a normal SI (4.9%). The negative predictive value (NPV) of a SI ≥ 0.7 was 95%, identical to the NPV of SIRS. 
      
          
       
      
         Conclusion: In this cohort, SI ≥ 0.7 performed as well as SIRS in NPV and was the most sensitive screening test for hyperlactatemia and 28-day mortality. SI ≥ 1.0 was the most specific predictor of both outcomes. Future research should focus on multi-site validation, with implications for early identification of at-risk patients and resource utilization. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):168-174.

Quantitative detection of PfHRP2 in saliva of malaria patients in the Philippines
AbstractBackgroundMalaria is a global health priority with a heavy burden of fatality and morbidity. Improvements in field diagnostics are needed to support the agenda for malaria elimination. Saliva has shown significant potential for use in non-invasive diagnostics, but the development of off-the-shelf saliva diagnostic kits requires best practices for sample preparation and quantitative insight on the availability of biomarkers and the dynamics of immunoassay in saliva. This pilot study measured the levels of the PfHRP2 in patient saliva to inform the development of salivary diagnostic tests for malaria.MethodsMatched samples of blood and saliva were collected between January and May, 2011 from eight patients at Palawan Baptist Hospital in Roxas, Palawan, Philippines. Parasite density was determined from thick-film blood smears. Concentrations of PfHRP2 in saliva of malaria-positive patients were measured using a custom chemiluminescent ELISA in microtitre plates. Sixteen negative-control patients were enrolled at UCLA. A substantive difference between this protocol and previous related studies was that saliva samples were stabilized with protease inhibitors.ResultsOf the eight patients with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria, seven tested positive for PfHRP2 in the blood using rapid diagnostic test kits, and all tested positive for PfHRP2 in saliva. All negative-control samples tested negative for salivary PfHRP2. On a binary-decision basis, the ELISA agreed with microscopy with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Salivary levels of PfHRP2 ranged from 17 to 1,167 pg/mL in the malaria-positive group.ConclusionSaliva is a promising diagnostic fluid for malaria when protein degradation and matrix effects are mitigated. Systematic quantitation of other malaria biomarkers in saliva would identify those with the best clinical relevance and suitability for off-the-shelf diagnostic kits.

Tank House Just Above the Jefferson General  Hospital with the Band House to the Left
The first military occupation at Jeffersonville, Indiana during the Civil War was in 1862 when two area regiments established a camp on a farm owned by Blanton Duncan. Lovell Rousseau, the organizer of the regiments, christened the camp “Camp Joe Holt.” The name was retained when it ceased to be a camp and became a hospital, called “Joe Holt Hospital.” Jefferson General Hospital, built to replace the one at Camp Joe Holt, opened 21 February 1864 and closed in December 1866. Located near Jeffersonville on land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the acreage reached down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The health facility had 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide, and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. The third largest hospital in the country and a showpiece for the Union army, Jefferson General reputedly was one of the finest in the United States for the care of wounded and sick servicemen. During the almost three years that the hospital was in existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals. First person accounts of life at the Jefferson General Hospital can be found in two separate diaries at the Indiana Historical Society Library. One is the published book, Hospital Pencillings by Elvira J. Powers. A volunteer and employee at the hospital, she wrote of the conditions at the hospital and her experiences there. The second is the collection SC2742, Louis C. Webber’s Diary, 1864–1866, a soldier who was wounded three times and was a patient there for a while.

Emergency Physicians’ Adherence to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Guidance During the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 Pandemic
Introduction: Little is known regarding compliance with management guidelines for epidemic influenza in adult emergency department (ED) settings during the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, especially in relation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance.
      Methods: We investigated all patients with a clinical diagnosis of influenza at an inner-city tertiary academic adult ED with an annual census of approximately 60,000 visits from May 2008 to December 2009. We aimed to determine patterns of presentation and management for adult patients with an ED diagnosis of influenza during the H1N1 pandemic, using seasonal influenza (pre-H1N1) as reference and to determine the ED provider’s adherence to American College of Emergency Physicians and CDC guidance during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Adherence to key elements of CDC 2009 H1N1 guidance was defined as (1) the proportion of admitted patients who were recommended to receive testing or treatment who actually received testing for influenza or treatment with antivirals; and (2) the proportion of high-risk patients who were supposed to be treated who actually were treated with antivirals.
      Results: Among 339 patients with clinically diagnosed influenza, 88% occurred during the H1N1 pandemic. Patients were similarly managed during both phases. Median length of visit (pre-H1N1: 385 min, H1N1: 355 min, P > 0.05) and admission rates (pre-H1N1: 8%, H1N1: 11%, P > 0.05) were similar between the 2 groups. 28% of patients in the pre-H1N1 group and 16% of patients in the H1N1 group were prescribed antibiotics during their ED visits (P > 0.05). There were 34 admitted patients during the pandemic;, 30 (88%) of them received influenza testing in the ED, and 22 (65%) were prescribed antivirals in the ED. Noticeably, 19 (56%) of the 34 admitted patients, including 6 with a positive influenza test, received antibiotic treatment during their ED stay.
      Conclusion: During the recent H1N1 pandemic, most admitted patients received ED diagnostic testing corresponding to the current recommended guidance. Antibiotic treatment for ED patients admitted with suspected influenza is not uncommon. However, less than 70% of admitted patients and less than 50% of high-risk patients were treated with antivirals during their ED visit, indicating a specific call for closer adherence to guidelines in future influenza pandemics.

Differences in the symptom experience of older versus younger oncology outpatients: a cross-sectional study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Mortality rates for cancer are decreasing in patients under 60 and increasing in those over 60 years of age. The reasons for these differences in mortality rates remain poorly understood. One explanation may be that older patients received substandard treatment because of concerns about adverse effects. Given the paucity of research on the multiple dimensions of the symptom experience in older oncology patients, the purpose of this study was to evaluate for differences in ratings of symptom occurrence, severity, frequency, and distress between younger (&lt; 60 years) and older ( &#8805; 60 years) adults undergoing cancer treatment. We hypothesized that older patients would have significantly lower ratings on four symptom dimensions.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Data from two studies in the United States and one study in Australia were combined to conduct this analysis. All three studies used the MSAS to evaluate the occurrence, severity, frequency, and distress of 32 symptoms.
				
				
					
						Results
					Data from 593 oncology outpatients receiving active treatment for their cancer (i.e., 44.4% were&#8201;&lt;&#8201;60 years and 55.6% were&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;60 years of age) were evaluated. Of the 32 MSAS symptoms, after controlling for significant covariates, older patients reported significantly lower occurrence rates for 15 (46.9%) symptoms, lower severity ratings for 6 (18.9%) symptoms, lower frequency ratings for 4 (12.5%) symptoms, and lower distress ratings for 14 (43.8%) symptoms.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This study is the first to evaluate for differences in multiple dimensions of symptom experience in older oncology patients. For almost 50% of the MSAS symptoms, older patients reported significantly lower occurrence rates. While fewer age-related differences were found in ratings of symptom severity, frequency, and distress, a similar pattern was found across all three dimensions. Future research needs to focus on a detailed evaluation of patient and clinical characteristics (i.e., type and dose of treatment) that explain the differences in symptom experience identified in this study.

Introduction: There is limited literature on the effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) on mortality. The objective of our study was to determine if there was a change in mortality among critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after the implementation of a CPOE system.
      Methods: This was a retrospective study of all critically ill patients in the ED during the year before and the year after CPOE implementation. The primary outcome measures were mortality in the ED, after admission, and overall. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay in the resuscitation area of the ED, length of hospital stay, and disposition following hospitalization. Patient disposition was used as a marker for neurologic function, and patients were grouped as either being discharged to home vs. nursing home, rehabilitation center, or a long-term healthcare facility. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics, chi- square, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
      Results: There were 2,974 critically ill patients in the year preceding CPOE and 2,969 patients in the year following CPOE implementation. There were no differences in mortality between the two groups in the ED, after admission, or overall. The pre- and post-CPOE mortality rate for the ED, hospital, or overall was 2.52% vs. 2.02% (P = 0.19, 95% confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.3), 7.8% versus 8.29% (P = 0.61, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.9), and 10.32% vs. 10.31% (P = .60, 95% CI -1.5 to 1.6), respectively. There was no difference in hospital length of stay between pre- and post-CPOE patients (3 days versus 3 days), a difference of 0.05 days (95% CI -0.47 to 0.57).  Length of stay in the ED resuscitation area was longer in the post-CPOE group (31 versus 32 minutes), a difference of -1.96 minutes (95% CI -3.4 to -0.53). More patients were discharged to home in the pre-CPOE group (66.8% versus 64.3%), a difference of 2.54% (95% CI 0.13% to 4.96%).
      Conclusion: The implementation of CPOE was not associated with a change in mortality of critically ill ED patients, but was associated with a decrease in proportion of patients discharged to home after hospitalization. West J Emerg Med.

Labor Market Returns to Early Childhood Stimulation: a 20-year Followup to an Experimental Intervention in Jamaica
We find large effects on the earnings of participants from a randomized intervention that gave psychosocial stimulation to stunted Jamaican toddlers living in poverty. The intervention consisted of one-hour weekly visits from community Jamaican health workers over a 2-year period that taught parenting skills and encouraged mothers to interact and play with their children in ways that would develop their children's cognitive and personality skills. We reinterviewed the study participants 20 years after the intervention. Stimulation increased the average earnings of participants by 42 percent. Treatment group earnings caught up to the earnings of a matched non-stunted comparison group. These findings show that psychosocial stimulation early in childhood in disadvantaged settings can have substantial effects on labor market outcomes and reduce later life inequality.

Vital Signs: Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and Other Interventions to Combat Prescription Opioid Abuse
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published significant data and trends related to opioid prescription pain relievers (OPR). In 2008, 20,044 deaths were attributed to prescription drug overdose of which 14,800 (73.8%) were due to OPR, an amount greater than the number of overdose deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. The majority of these deaths were unintentional. Between 1999-2008, overdose deaths from OPR increased almost four-fold. Correspondingly, sales of OPR were four times greater in 2010 than in 1999. Most significant to emergency physicians is the estimate that 39% of all opioids prescribed, administered or continued come from the emergency department (ED).  We present findings from the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) with commentary on current recommendations and policies for curtailing the OPR epidemic.1  West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):422-425.

13-year mortality trends among hospitalized
patients with inflammatory bowel disease
AbstractBackgroundStudies document increasing rates of hospitalization among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but temporal trends for in-hospital mortality among patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not characterized. We sought to determine whether in-hospital mortality changed over a 13-year period among nationwide hospitalizations associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We additionally sought to identify factors correlated with mortality.MethodsWe used the National Hospital Discharge Survey, a large nationally representative database, for the years 1994 through 2006. Age- and mortality-adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality and standardized mortality ratios were calculated for four time periods. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between advancing time and mortality in adjusted analyses.Results150 (0.9%) of 17,393 hospitalizations for patients with inflammatory bowel disease ended in death. Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality decreased from 3.6 deaths per 1,000 hospital days in 1994&#8211;96 to 2.4 per 1,000 in 2003&#8211;06; standardized mortality ratio decreased from 0.33 to 0.27. Similar trends were seen for patients with ulcerative colitis, but mortality did not change over time among patients with Crohn&#8217;s disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of these changes in mortality, with 17% decreased odds of in-hospital death per three-year period (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.012). Subject age (OR 1.06 per year, P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.29 per 1-point increase, P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001), and diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (versus Crohn&#8217;s disease, OR 1.41, P&#8201;=&#8201;.042) were also associated with in-hospital mortality.ConclusionsThe odds of in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease decreased by 17% per 3-year period from 1994 to 2006 in analysis adjusted for age and comorbidity status, in this large, nationally representative database. Multiple factors likely contribute to these trends.

Cervical human papillomavirus infection among
young women engaged in sex work in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia: prevalence, genotypes, risk factors and
association with HIV infection
AbstractBackgroundAlthough cervical cancer is the leading cancer in Cambodia, most women receive no routine screening for cervical cancer and few treatment options exist. Moreover, nothing is known regarding the prevalence of cervical HPV or the genotypes present among women in the country. Young sexually active women, especially those with multiple sex partners are at highest risk of HPV infection. We examine the prevalence and genotypes of cervical HPV, as well as the associated risk factors among young women engaged in sex work in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 220 young women (15&#8211;29&#8201;years) engaged in sex work in different venues including brothels or entertainment establishments, and on a freelance basis in streets, parks and private apartments. Cervical specimens were collected using standard cytobrush technique. HPV DNA was tested for by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping using type-specific probes for 29 individual HPV types, as well as for a mixture of 10 less common HPV types. All participants were also screened for HIV status using blood samples. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess risk factors for any or multiple HPV infection.ResultsThe prevalence of cervical HPV 41.1%. HPV 51 and 70 were the most common (5.0%), followed by 16 (4.6%), 71 (4.1%) and 81 (3.7%). Thirty-six women (16.4%) were infected with multiple genotypes and 23.3% were infected with at least one oncogenic HPV type. In multivariate analyses, having HIV infection and a higher number of sexual partners were associated with cervical HPV infection. Risk factors for infection with multiple genotypes included working as freelance female sex workers (FSW) or in brothels, recent binge use of drugs, high number of sexual partners, and HIV infection.ConclusionsThis is the first Cambodian study on cervical HPV prevalence and genotypes. We found that HPV infection was common among young FSW, especially among women infected with HIV. These results underscore the urgent need for accessible cervical cancer screening and treatment, as well as for a prophylactic vaccine that covers the HPV subtypes present in Cambodia.

Weight loss reduces breast ductal fluid estrogens in obese postmenopausal women: a single arm intervention pilot study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Accumulation of excess body fat increases breast cancer risk after menopause. Whether the localized breast is differently influenced by adipose tissue compared to the rest of the body, has not been well studied. Our purpose was to demonstrate feasibility and preliminarily evaluate serum-based and localized breast biomarker changes resulting from a weight loss intervention among obese postmenopausal women.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We conducted a 12-week pilot controlled dietary and exercise intervention among healthy obese postmenopausal women, collected serum and breast ductal fluid before and after the intervention, and estimated the association with systemic and localized biomarker changes. We recruited 7 obese (mean body mass index&#8201;=&#8201;33.6 kg/m2) postmenopausal women. We collected samples at baseline and the 12th week for: anthropometry; phlebotomy; dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (lean and fat mass); exercise fitness (maximum oxygen consumption (VO2Max); 1-repetition strength maximum); and breast ductal lavage.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Changes from baseline occurred in body composition and exercise performance including fat mass loss (14% average drop), VO2Max (+36% increase) and strength improvement (+26%). Breast ductal fluid markers declined from baseline with estradiol showing a 24% reduction and IL-6 a 20% reduction. We also observed serum biomarker reductions from baseline including leptin (36% decline), estrone sulfate (&#8722;10%), estradiol (&#8722;25%), and Il-6 (&#8722;33%).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Conduct of the diet and exercise intervention, collection of ductal fluid, and measurement of hormones and cytokines contained in the ductal fluid were all feasible. We preliminarily demonstrated estradiol and IL-6 reductions from baseline in both serum and breast ductal fluid among obese postmenopausal women who participated in the 12-week weight loss diet and exercise intervention.

Fabrication procedure effects on fatigue resistance of rib -to-deck welded joints of steel orthotropic bridge decks
Orthotropic steel bridge decks have been widely used for long- and medium-span bridges due to excellent structural characteristics. However, orthotropic decks have experienced various fatigue problems, resulting from high cyclic stresses in conjunction with inadequate welding details. In particular, crack at rib-to-deck welded joints due to wheel load is a concern because inspection and repair of the back side of this weld for closed ribs is not practical due to lack of access. Fatigue resistance of rib-to-deck joints can be significantly influenced by fabrication effects including weld melt-through and distortion control measures (for example, precambering and heat-straightening). Current design practice is to use empirical approach for fatigue safety assessments by conforming to the detailing requirements for example, at least 80% partial-joint-penetration (PJP) weld at the rib- to-deck joint. However, little experimental and analytical research has been done as to the code-specified requirements and fabrication procedure effects on the fatigue resistance of the PJP joint. Six 2-span, full- scale orthotropic steel deck specimens (10 m long by 3 m wide) were fabricated and subjected to 8 million loading cycles to study the effects of both weld melt-through and distortion control measures on the fatigue resistance of the PJP joint. Test results showed that six cracks initiated from the weld toe outside the closed rib. Only one crack developed at the weld root inside the rib; this crack initiated from a location transitioning from the 80% PJP to 100% penetration. Weld melt-through appeared to be detrimental in fatigue resistance. Precambering was beneficial as two effectively precambered specimens did not experience cracking in the PJP welds. Finite element analysis using effective notch stress method showed a good correlation with the observed crack pattern in testing. Bending stresses were dominant at the PJP joint ; shear and membrane stresses were very small. Parametric study showed that the fatigue resistance of the PJP joint can be significantly influenced by transverse loading location, deck plate thickness, and weld penetration ratio. Increasing the deck plate thickness was efficient in reducing the stresses, while the rib plate thickness had a little effect. Shallower weld penetration at the PJP joint appeared to have a positive effect in enhancing the fatigue resistance

Cognitive performance of pregnant and postpartum women with and without major depression
Keenan and colleagues (1998) have demonstrated that episodic memory is diminished during pregnancy and returns to baseline in the postpartum period. Given that memory deficits may occur in major depression, possible memory deficits during pregnancy could be exacerbated by major depression. The present study examined memory performance in 37 pregnant women, 14 of whom met clinical criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and 23 normal control (NC) pregnant women who had no current or prior history of depression. Additionally, postpartum groups consisted of 21 postpartum women, 11 of whom met clinical criteria for a MDE, and 10 NC postpartum women. The study utilized a 2 x 2 Multivariate Analysis of Variance design to compare memory performance and sleep of pregnant and postpartum women with and without major depression. The study demonstrated that pregnancy and major depression were both associated with poorer performance in a task involving verbal learning and memory. Specifically, on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), pregnant women learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five; recalled significantly fewer words on trial one, short delay free and cued recall, and long delay free and cued recall; and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than postpartum women. Depressed patients learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five, recalled significantly fewer words on CVLT long delay free recall, and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than NC women. No alterations in outcomes of the above analyses were found when age, education, weeks pregnant/postpartum, or circadian preference were applied as covariates. The present results are consistent with previous investigations of memory functioning of major depressive disorder and healthy pregnant and postpartum women. That is, pregnant and depressed women exhited poorer performance in tasks involving verbal learning and memory compared with postpartum and NC women

Dietary intervention with DHA and curcumin enhance spinal cord sensory motor learning
Given that the spinal cord is capable of learning sensorimotor tasks and that dietary interventions can influence learning involving supraspinal centers, we asked whether the presence of omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the curry spice curcumin (Cur) could affect spinal cord learning in adult spinal mice. Using Paw Withdrawal instrumental learning paradigm (PaWL) to assess spinal learning we observed that mice fed a diet containing DHA/Cur performed better in the spinal learning paradigm than mice fed a diet deficient in DHA/Cur.  Previous studies in the cortex have demonstrated that both DHA and curcumin elevate the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plays a major role in learning and neural plasticity. Here we examined the effect of DHA and curcumin on the Paw Withdrawal learning. The enhanced performance was accompanied by increases in mRNA of molecular markers of learning, i.e., BDNF, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), Calcium/Calmodulin Kinase II (CaMKII), and syntaxin 3.  Sequestering BDNF with TrkB IgG in the lumbar spinal cord of DHA/Cur fed mice showed significant decrease in spinal learning, and levels of mRNA of BDNF, CaMKII, CREB and syntaxin 3. These results emphasize the capacity of select dietary factors to foster spinal cord learning and suggest the BDNF pathway may be a key mediator of spinal plasticity. Given the non-invasiveness and safety of the modulation of diet, this intervention should be considered in light of their potential to enhance relearning of sensorimotor tasks during rehabilitative training paradigms after spinal cord injury.

[explanation, condition, incompatibilist, displacement, principle, action, leeway, explanatory]

Freedom & Explanation
In this dissertation I will explicate the sourcehood and leeway conditions, primarily by way of the concept of explanation. This yields three significant results. First, in clarifying the leeway condition, we find that it has two distinct ideas packed into it--one modal, one explanatory. These two ideas in fact correspond to two quite different versions of the control condition. Second, it turns out that the connection between the leeway condition and the sourcehood condition is far tighter than heretofore supposed. Though these are usually treated as clearly distinct and perhaps competing versions of the control condition,&#8288; it turns out that they share a common core. Specifically, both involve what I call the explanatory condition, according to which you are only responsible for what you do if you are the explanation of it. That is, if you are the explanation in an unqualified sense. 	The most exciting result, though, is that incompatibilists of either stripe are committed to a contentious claim about explanation: the displacement principle. According to the displacement principle, earlier `links' in explanatory chains displace later ones. That is, in a case where A explains B, and B explains C, A would displace B, meaning that the explanation of C is A and not B. So, for instance, if the past and the laws of nature explain my character and motivational profile, and these, at least apparently, explain my actions, then in fact it is the past and the laws that explain my action. My character and motivational profile are merely an apparent explanation of my actions. This is, I argue the central point of dispute between compatibilists and incompatibilists. If the displacement principle is true, it is hard to see how the incompatibilist can fail. If, on the other hand, it is false, it is hard to see how the incompatibilist could succeed. Defending the displacement principle will not be a simple task. The incompatibilist faces an uphill battle.

The association between nurse staffing and hospital outcomes in injured patients
AbstractBackgroundThe enormous fiscal pressures facing trauma centers may lead trauma centers to reduce nurse staffing and to make increased use of less expensive and less skilled personnel. The impact of nurse staffing and skill mix on trauma outcomes has not been previously reported. The goal of this study was to examine whether nurse staffing levels and nursing skill mix are associated with trauma patient outcomes.MethodsWe used data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample to perform a cross-sectional study of 70,142 patients admitted to 77 Level I and Level II centers. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between nurse staffing measures and (1) mortality, (2) healthcare associated infections (HAI), and (3) failure-to-rescue. We controlled for patient risk factors (age, gender, injury severity, mechanism of injury, comorbidities) and hospital structural characteristics (trauma center status - Level I versus Level II, hospital size, ownership, teaching status, technology level, and geographic region).ResultsA 1% increase in the ratio of licensed practical nurse (LPN) to total nursing time was associated with a 4% increase in the odds of mortality (adj OR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.06; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) and a 6% increase in the odds of sepsis (adj OR 1.06: 1.03-1.10; p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Hospitals in the highest quartile of LPN staffing had 3 excess deaths (95% CI: 1.2, 5.1) and 5 more episodes of sepsis (95% CI: 2.3, 7.6) per 1000 patients compared to hospitals in the lower quartile of LPN staffing.ConclusionsHigher hospital LPN staffing levels are independently associated with slightly higher rates of mortality and sepsis in trauma patients admitted to Level I or Level II trauma centers.

A family study of PTSD : occurrence and correlates of internalizing disorders in children of OIF/OEF soldiers with combat posttraumatic stress disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among U.S. combatants who are deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom conflicts (OIF/OEF). Combat PTSD has been shown to be associated with impaired social, occupational, and physical functioning. An understudied area of research is how PTSD from combat affects interpersonal functioning at the family level. Of particular vulnerability to disruption in relational systems is the parent-child dyad. The present study focused on parental PTSD, child environment, and child psychological symptoms in order to begin delineating pathways connecting parent trauma to child psychopathology. The sample consisted of 21 dyads : Adult participants with and without combat-related PTSD and biological child participants (aged 6 - 17). Parents and children were administered structured diagnostic interviews and dimensional measures of anxiety, depression, and PTSD and home environment. Simple linear regression was used to test a predictive model between fathers' level of PTSD symptoms and child clinical symptoms. Multiple regression was used to test the mediation model of child home environment on the relationship between parent and child symptomatology. Results from descriptive analyses showed that level of fathers' combat exposure was a significant predictor at the alpha = 0.05 level for child anxiety, PTSD symptoms, oppositional, and conduct problems. However, level of fathers' combat exposure did not predict child depression, somatization, or withdrawn symptoms. Results showed no interaction effects. This pilot study demonstrates that the experiences of OIF/OEF combatants such as the nature of their combat exposure during deployment may be important in impacting the psychological outcomes of their offspring. Furthermore, the warzone experiences of OIF/OEF combatants during deployment appear to predict child anxiety, PTSD, and externalizing symptoms, but not child depression, withdrawn symptoms, or somatization. Results of this pilot study should be considered preliminary and the design should be replicated with a larger sample of OIF/OEF combatants. The current findings may be relevant in advancing our knowledge of etiological models of psychiatric illness in youths, identifying at-risk individuals during early life stages, and advancing mental health interventions for military families

Which doctors and with what problems contact a specialist service for doctors?  A cross sectional investigation
Background

In the United Kingdom, specialist treatment and intervention services for doctors are underdeveloped. The MedNet programme, created in 1997 and funded by the London Deanery, aims to fill this gap by providing a self-referral, face-to-face, psychotherapeutic assessment service for doctors in London and South-East England. MedNet was designed to be a low-threshold service, targeting doctors without formal psychiatric problems. The aim of this study was to delineate the characteristics of doctors utilising the service, to describe their psychological morbidity, and to determine if early intervention is achieved.

Methods

A cross-sectional study including all consecutive self-referred doctors (n = 121, 50% male) presenting in 2002–2004 was conducted. Measures included standardised and bespoke questionnaires both self-report and clinician completed. The multi-dimensional evaluation included: demographics, CORE (CORE-OM, CORE-Workplace and CORE-A) an instrument designed to evaluate the psychological difficulties of patients referred to outpatient services, Brief Symptom Inventory to quantify caseness and formal psychiatric illness, and Maslach Burnout Inventory.

Results

The most prevalent presenting problems included depression, anxiety, interpersonal, self-esteem and work-related issues. However, only 9% of the cohort were identified as severely distressed psychiatrically using this measure. In approximately 50% of the sample, problems first presented in the preceding year. About 25% were on sick leave at the time of consultation, while 50% took little or no leave in the prior 12 months. A total of 42% were considered to be at some risk of suicide, with more than 25% considered to have a moderate to severe risk. There were no significant gender differences in type of morbidity, severity or days off sick.

Conclusion

Doctors displayed high levels of distress as reflected in the significant proportion of those who were at some risk of suicide; however, low rates of severe psychiatric illness were detected. These findings suggest that MedNet clients represent both ends of the spectrum of severity, enabling early clinical engagement for a significant proportion of cases that is of importance both in terms of personal health and protecting patient care, and providing a timely intervention for those who are at risk, a group for whom rapid intervention services are in need and an area that requires further investigation in the UK.

Sutures versus staples for wound closure in orthopaedic surgery: a pilot randomized controlled trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					In the spectrum of surgical decision-making, wound closure material is often an afterthought. However, the findings of a recent meta-analysis suggest that the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) is increased by using staples to close surgical wounds. Less clear is the effect of closure material on the incidence of non-infectious wound complications.
					The aim of this study was to compare sutures and staples in terms of: incidence of wound complications to determine the sample size for a definitive trial comparing wound closure methods.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Eligible adult orthopaedic patients were randomized to have wounds closed with sutures or staples. Time for skin closure was recorded. Wounds were assessed for complications for six weeks. The incidence of complications was compared using Fisher&#8217;s exact test. Time to close and pain with removal of closure material were compared using a Student&#8217;s t-test.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The total number of patients reporting a wound complication was 59 of 148 patients completing six-week followup (41%), with no differennce between sutures and staples (RR = 0.77, CI = 0.52&#8211;1.14). The time to close wounds was shorter in the staple group (mean=4.8 min, CI = 2.6&#8211;7.1) than the suture group (mean=12 min, CI = 7.9&#8211;16). Patients in the staple group (mean=3.7, CI =2.8&#8211;4.6) reported more pain with removal than suture group (mean=2.5, CI =1.6&#8211;3.4).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This study suggests that 42% of patients report a wound complication with no difference between sutures and staples. It was demonstrated that suturing skin requires more time and staples are more painful to remove.

Peripheral neuropathy caused by DCA-induced oxidative stress
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is water chlorination by product. Initial toxicology studies suggested that DCA can be carcinogenic, but the dosage found in water is much lower than hazardous. DCA activates pyruvate dehydrogenase and facilitates pyruvate metabolism to acetyl-CoA. DCA's ability to activate mitochondria and lower lactic level has attracted attention and it has been proposed as a therapeutic agent to treat lactic acidosis, mitochondrial diseases and cancer. However, peripheral neuropathy has been reported in patients received DCA treatment. Peripheral neuropathy includes distal numbness, decreased nerve conduction velocity, thermal hypoalgesia, and allodynia. The underlying mechanism of DCA-induced peripheral neuropathy is unclear. We established animal models that mimic DCA-induced peripheral neuropathy to investigate the mechanism. Oxidative stress is observed in animals treated with DCA so we have examined the efficacy of known antioxidants. We found that ellagic acid can prevent DCA-induced peripheral neuropathy and that DHA has transient protective effects. In contrast, lipoic acid appeared to worsen DCA-induced peripheral neuropathy while fisetin appeared to have no effects. We have also begun to explore two pathways that may be involved in DCA-induced oxidative stress. Results from delta-ALA and 2-CP pathway are inconclusive and both studies are currently on -going. Oxidative stress in peripheral neurons from these animals will be measured. Finally, we investigated a potential cause of painful neuropathy in DCA treated rats. There was no difference in expression of spinal KCC2 transporters between control and DCA treated rats

Guidelines for Field Triage of Injuried Patients
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published significant data and trends related to the national public health burden associated with trauma and injury. In the United States (U.S.), injury is the leading cause of death for persons aged 1-44 years. In 2008, approximately 30 million injuries resulted in an emergency department (ED) evaluation; 5.4 million (18%) of these patients were transported by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).1 EMS providers determine the severity of injury and begin initial management at the scene. The decisions to transport injured patients to the appropriate hospital are made through a process known as “field triage.” Since 1986, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) has provided guidance for the field triage process though its “Field Triage Decision Scheme.” In 2005, the CDC, with financial support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), collaborated with ASC-COT to convene the initial meeting of the National Expert Panel on Field Triage (the Panel) to revise the decision scheme. This revised version was published in 2006 by ASC-COT, and in 2009 the CDC published a detailed description of the scientific rational for revising the field triage criteria entitled, “Guidelines for FieldTriage of Injured Patients.”2-3 In 2011, the CDC reconvened the Panel to review the 2006 Guidelines and recommend any needed changes. We present the methodology, findings and updated guidelines from the Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) from the 2011 Panel along with commentary on the burden of injury in the U.S., and the role emergency physicians have in impacting morbidity and mortality at the population level.

Subdural Empyema Presenting with Seizure, Confusion, and Focal Weakness
While sinusitis is a common ailment, intracranial suppurative complications of sinusitis are rare and difficult to diagnose and treat. The morbidity and mortality of intracranial complications of sinusitis have decreased significantly since the advent of antibiotics, but diseases such as subduralempyemas and intracranial abscesses still occur, and they require prompt diagnosis, treatment, and often surgical drainage to prevent death or long-term neurologic sequelae. We present a case of an immunocompetent adolescent male with a subdural empyema who presented with seizures,confusion, and focal arm weakness after a bout of sinusitis.

Impact of Emergency Department Management of Atrial Fibrillation on Hospital Charges
Introduction: Emergency Department (ED) cardioversion (EDCV) and discharge of patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF) has been shown to be a safe and effective management strategy. This study examines the impact of such aggressive ED management on hospital charges.Methods: A random sample of 300 AF patients were identified from an ED electronic data base and screened for timing of onset of their symptoms. Patients were considered eligible for EDCV if either nursing or physician notes documented an onset of symptoms less than 48 hours prior to ED presentation and the patient was less than 85 years of age. An explicit chart review was then performed to determine patient management and disposition. Cardioversion attempts were defined as ED administration of procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, ibutilide, amiodarone or direct current cardioversion (DCCV). Total hospital charges for each patient were obtained from the hospital billing office. Differences across medians were analyzed utilizing through Wilcoxon rank sum tests and chi square. Results: A total of 51 patients were included in the study. EDCV was attempted on 24 (47%) patients, 22 (92%) were successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). An additional 12 (23%) spontaneously converted to NSR. Twenty (91%) of those successfully cardioverted were discharged from the ED along with 4 (33%) of those spontaneously converting. Pharmacologic cardioverson was attempted in six patients and was successful in three (50%), one after failed DCCV attempt. Direct current cardioversion was attempted in 21 (88%) and was successful in 19 (90%), two after failed pharmacologic attempts. Median charges for patients cardioverted and discharged from the ED were $5,460 (IQR $4,677-$6,190). Median charges for admitted patients with no attempt at cardioversion were $23,202 (IQR $19,663-$46,877). Median charges for patients whose final ED rhythm was NSR were $5,641 (IQR $4,638-$12,339) while for those remaining in AF median charges were $30,299 (IQR $20,655 - $69,759).Conclusion: ED cardioversion of recent onset AF patients results in significant hospital savings.

Sutures versus staples for wound closure in orthopaedic surgery: a randomized controlled trial
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					A recently published meta-analysis comparing metallic staples to sutures in orthopaedic procedures revealed three fold increase in risk for infection in stapled wounds. The studies included in the meta-analysis are at risk of bias due to experimental design limitations. A large randomized controlled trial is proposed to direct orthopaedic surgeons in their choice of wound closure material.
				
				
					
						Methods/Design
					
					A parallel group randomized controlled trial with institutional review board approval will be conducted. Patients will be randomized intraoperatively to have skin wounds closed with sutures or staples. Dressings will be used to maintain blinding outcome assessors. The primary outcome measure will be a composite all-cause wound complication outcome measure composed of: infection, wound drainage, wound necrosis, blistering, dehiscence, suture abscess and material sensitivity reaction. An independent review board blinded to treatment assignment will adjudicate suspected complications based on clinical data. All deceased patients will also be reviewed. An interim analysis of complications will take place after half of the patients have been recruited. All data will be analyzed by a blinded statistician. Dichotomous primary and secondary outcome measures will be analyzed using the Chi-squared statistic. Continuous outcome measures will be analyzed using Student's&#8201;t-test. Subgroup analysis will compare infection rates using sutures versus staples in each anatomic area (upper extremity, pelvis/acetabulum, hip/femur, knee, ankle). A further subgroup analysis will be conducted comparing trauma patients to elective surgery patients. Non-infected revision surgery will also be compared to primary surgery.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					
					Wound closure material is an afterthought for many orthopaedic surgeons. The combined results of several comparative trials suggests that the choice of wound closure materials may have an impact on the rate of surgical site infections. However, the strength of the evidence is poor given the heterogeneity of the methods employed in previous studies. The following study protocol aims to guide surgeons in their choice of wound closure material by determining if there is a difference in complication rates in sutured and stapled wounds.

Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy improves cranial neuropathies in patients with skull base meningiomas: a retrospective cohort study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Skull base meningiomas commonly present with cranial neuropathies. Fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) has been used to treat these tumors with excellent local control, but rates of improvement in cranial neuropathies have not been well defined. We review the experience at Thomas Jefferson University using FSRT in the management of these patients with a focus on symptom outcomes.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We identified 225 cases of skull base meningiomas treated with FSRT at Thomas Jefferson University from 1994 through 2009. The target volume was the enhancing tumor, treated to a standard prescription dose of 54 Gy. Symptoms at the time of RT were classified based on the cranial nerve affected. Logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of symptom improvement after FSRT.
				
				
					
						Results
					The median follow-up time was 4.4 years. In 92% of cases, patients were symptomatic at the time of RT; the most common were impaired visual field/acuity (58%) or extraocular movements (34%). After FSRT, durable improvement of at least one symptom occurred in 57% of cases, including 40% of visual acuity/visual field deficits, and 40% of diplopia/ptosis deficits. Of all symptomatic patients, 27% experienced improvement of at least one symptom within 2 months of the end of RT.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					FSRT is very effective in achieving improvement of cranial neuropathies from skull base meningiomas, particularly visual symptoms. Over half of treated patients experience a durable improvement of at least one symptom, frequently within 2 months from the end of RT.

[bone, fracture, trauma, condition, type, surface, angle]

Determining the Timing and Mechanism of Bone Fracture in Bovine Bone
Trauma interpretation is one of the most essential and challenging areas offorensic anthropology. When examining bone fragments commonly encountered in real forensic anthropological casework, the ambiguity and difficulty assessing the trauma type and bone condition at the time of fracture is markedly more difficult. Traditional features used to distinguish bone condition and trauma type have included fracture surface texture and fracture angle, however, these features have not been explored in depth in terms their reliability and these observational categories remain poorly defined. In the current study, I examine fracture angles and surfaces produced from ballistic (115g 9mm FMJ and 147g HP ammunition) and blunt force trauma (10 lb. sledge hammer) on bovine long bones in different states of preservation (frozen, fresh, dry). Building on previous anthropological research and the mechanical literature, I attempt to refine the criteria of `smooth' and `rough / jagged' used to describe surface texture and attempt correlate the criteria to bone condition and trauma type. Using Microsil, a forensic casting material, I present a straightforward method for capturing and assessing surface information without the confounding features of color and moisture.  Seven sampling sites were selected from each bone, four from the entrance / point of impact side and three from the exit / posterior to impact side. All fractures cast and measured were longitudinal or radial fractures. Results of this study indicate that fracture angle does not demonstrate a statistically significant relationship with cortical bone thickness, nor does it correlate with type of trauma or bone condition. The only statistically significant relationship was between fracture angle and bone condition for fracture angles from the impact side of blunt force trauma specimens. Fracture surface characteristics do diverge among bone conditions, but not for trauma type. Qualitatively, for a single specimen, fracture angle and fracture surface characteristics appear to have limited value in the assessment of bone condition and / or trauma type. It is recommended for the determination of bone condition and trauma type that fracture angle and surface texture be not be used when analyzing single bones. Other observations, such as impact sites and projectile entries and exits, in combination with taphonomic indicators like color, staining, and context should be relied upon to describe and determine trauma type and bone condition.

Feeling labeled, judged, lectured, and rejected by family and friends over depression: Cautionary results for primary care clinicians from a multi-centered, qualitative study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Family and friends may help patients seek out and engage in depression care. However, patients&#8217; social networks can also undermine depression treatment and recovery. In an effort to improve depression care in primary care settings, we sought to identify, categorize, and alert primary care clinicians to depression-related messages that patients hear from friends and family that patients perceive as unhelpful or detrimental.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We conducted 15 focus groups in 3 cities. Participants (n&#8201;=&#8201;116) with a personal history or knowledge of depression responded to open-ended questions about depression, including self-perceived barriers to care-seeking. Focus group conversations were audio-recorded and analyzed using iterative qualitative analysis.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Four themes emerged related to negatively-received depression messages delivered by family and friends. Specifically, participants perceived these messages as making them feel labeled, judged, lectured to, and rejected by family and friends when discussing depression. Some participants also expressed their interpretation of their families&#8217; motivations for delivering the messages and described how hearing these messages affected depression care.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The richness of our results reflects the complexity of communication within depression sufferers&#8217; social networks around this stigmatized issue. To leverage patients&#8217; social support networks effectively in depression care, primary care clinicians should be aware of both the potentially beneficial and detrimental aspects of social support. Specifically, clinicians should consider using open-ended queries into patients&#8217; experiences with discussing depression with family and friends as an initial step in the process. An open-ended approach may avoid future emotional trauma or stigmatization and assist patients in overcoming self-imposed barriers to depression discussion, symptom disclosure, treatment adherence and follow-up care.

An Uncommon Case of Abdominal Pain: Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome
Introduction: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a rare cause of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that may be undiagnosed in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). We report a 54-year-old male presenting to a community ED with abdominal pain and the subsequent radiographic findings.
      Ojective: The patient’s computed tomgraphy (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrates many of the hallmark findings consistent with SMA syndrome, including; compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery resulting in intestinal obstruction, dilation of the left renal vein, and gastric distension. Patients diagnosed with SMA syndrome have a characteristically short distance between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta (usually 2–8 mm) in contrast to healthy patients (10–34 mm). Our patient’s aortomesenteric distance was measured to be approximately 4 mm. Furthermore, the measured angle between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta is reduced in patients with SMA syndrome from a normal range of 28°–65° to a measurement between 6°–22°. Our patient’s aortomesenteric angle was difficult to measure secondary to poor sagittal reconstructions, but appears to be approximately 30°.
      Conclusion: Following radiographic evidence suggesting SMA syndrome together with our patient’s constellation of presenting symptoms, a diagnosis of SMA syndrome was made and the patient was admitted to the general surgery service. However, our patient decided to leave against medical advice owing to improvement of his symptoms following the emptying of two liters of gastric contents via nasogastric tube evacuation.

Risk Stratification in Patients with Advanced Heart Failure Requiring Biventricular Assist Device Support as a Bridge to Cardiac Transplantation
Background: Prior studies have identified risk factors for survival in patients with end-stage heart failure (HF) requiring left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support.  However, patients with biventricular HF may represent a unique cohort.  Methods: We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive cohort of 113 adult, end-stage HF patients at UCLA Medical Center who required BIVAD support between 2000 and 2009.  Results: Survival to transplant was 66.4%, with 1-year actuarial survival of 62.8%.  All patients were INTERMACS level 1 or 2 and received Thoratec paracorporeal BIVAD as bridge-to-transplant.  We generated a scoring system for survival to transplant.  Our final model with age, gender, dialysis, cholesterol, ventilator, and albumin gave a c-statistic of 0.870.  A simplified system preserved a c-statistic of 0.844.  Patients were divided into normal or high risk groups (median survival of 367 and 17 days, respectively), with strong discrimination between groups for mortality.  In this study, we generate a scoring system that offers high prognostic ability for patients requiring BIVAD support, in hopes that it may assist in clinical decision making.  Further studies are needed to prospectively validate our scoring system.

Combat-related blast injuries : injury types and outcomes
Combat-related blasts have caused the majority of injuries in Operation Iraqi Freedom with traumatic brain injury (TBI) emerging as a preeminent injury. The purpose of this dissertation is to describe the scope of combat-related blast injuries and the career performance outcomes of service personnel injured in blasts. Factors associated with career performance outcomes in service personnel injured in blasts and specifically in those with mild TBI were also explored. The Combat Trauma Registry Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database (CTR-EMED) is a collection of datasets from frontline medical care in Iraq and subsequent hospital care. The CTR-EMED provided demographics of injured service personnel and injury episode information. Outcome variables were ascertained from the Career History Archival Medical and Personnel System, which is a database of career and medical information for service personnel. In the 4623 blast episodes examined, mild TBI was the most frequent single injury type (10.8%) and with extremity injuries combined, the extremities was the area most commonly injured. Surface wounds of the extremities comprised 27.6% of all injuries. When examining service discharge in 4255 personnel injured in combat-related blasts, 37.8% experienced normal attrition and 8.3% early attrition. In service personnel with a discharge code, 29.8% had a disability-related discharge. Both early attrition and disability discharge proportions were higher in those with PTSD. In those without PTSD, a dose response relationship existed between injury severity and both disability discharge and early attrition. In those with a PTSD diagnosis, injury severity was associated with these adverse outcomes but the relationship was more complex. In the 790 service personnel diagnosed with mild TBI after a combat-related blast, 24% experienced a disability discharge. The most common acute TBI symptoms documented were headache (63.0%), loss of consciousness (37.0%) and tinnitus (31.0%). In those without PTSD, disability discharge was associated with age, total injury severity, time to discharge and post-concussive syndrome, while disability discharge was only associated with post- concussive syndrome in those with PTSD. These results provide important information for acute and rehabilitative care providers. The impact of PTSD on recovery after combat-related blast injuries should be explored to maximize functional outcome in these service personnel

Riding the Escalator: How Dangerous is it Really?
Introduction: About 10,000 escalator-related injuries per year result in emergency department treatment in the United States. Since the 1990s, a steady increase has been reported, but few statistics on escalator-related injuries have been published worldwide. We have therefore analyzed escalator accident statistics in admissions to our hospital in Switzerland since 2000.
      Methods: Using retrospective electronic patient chart analysis, we included in our study patients >16 years treated over an 11-year period. We categorized patients in terms of gender, age and associated risk factors, and classified accidents according to day, time, location and cause. Resulting trauma was categorized according to type and location. We divided post-admission treatment into surgical and conservative, and into treatment as an outpatient, in a short-stay unit, or as a hospital admission. Women and men were compared using Fisher’s exact test.
      Results: We identified 173 patients with 285 discrete injuries. Of these, 87 patients (50%) were women. Fifty-three (61%) of the women and 38 (44%) of the men were >60 years old (P = 0.033). Fifty percent of the men (43/86)of the men, but only 7% (6/87) of the women showed signs of alcohol intoxication (P < 0.0001). Accidents in women occurred predominantly on Tuesdays (19/87; 22%) between 12PM and 6PM (35/87; 40%), and in men on Saturdays (16/86; 19%) between 6PM and 12AM (29/86; 34%; P = 0.0097). Sixty-two percent (44/71) of the accidents were in public transport facilities and 30% (21/71) in shopping centers. The majority of injuries in women were to the lower extremities (49/87; 56%), while most accidents in men were to the head and neck (51/86; 59%; P = 0.0052). About half (90; 52%) of the patients were treated conservatively. Almost half of all patients (76, 44%) required hospital admission. Of those, 45% left the hospital within 24 hours of admission (short stay unit) and 55% stayed longer than 24 hours.
      Conclusion: Escalator accidents can result in severe trauma. Significant gender differences in escalator accidents have been observed. Alcohol intoxication and age are significant risk factors in escalator-related accidents and might be possible targets for preventive measures. West J Emerg Med 2012

Markers of intestinal inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: a pilot study
Abstract
Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are similar chronic inflammatory diseases whose definitive etiology is unknown. Following recent clinical and genetic evidence supporting an intertwined pathogenic relationship, we conducted a pilot study to measure fecal calprotectin (fCAL) and IBD-related serologies in AS patients.

Methods
Consecutive AS patients were recruited from a long-term prospectively collected longitudinal AS cohort at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Controls were recruited from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center employees or spouses of patients with AS. Sera were tested by ELISA for IBD-associated serologies (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody IgG and IgA, anti-I2, anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index were completed for AS patients.

Results
A total of 81 subjects (39 AS patients and 42 controls) were included for analysis. The average age of AS patients was 47 years and the average disease duration was 22 years. AS patients were predominantly male; 76% were HLA-B27-positive. Median fCAL levels were 42 &#956;g/g and 17 &#956;g/g in the AS group and controls, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). When using the manufacturer's recommended cutoff value for positivity of 50 &#956;g/g, stool samples of 41% of AS patients and 10% of controls were positive for fCAL (P = 0.0016). With the exception of ANCA, there were no significant differences in antibody levels between patients and controls. Median ANCA was 6.9 ELISA units in AS patients and 4.3 ELISA units in the controls. Among AS patients stratified by fCAL level, there were statistically significant differences between patients and controls for multiple IBD-associated antibodies.

Conclusion
Calprotectin levels were elevated in 41% of patients with AS with a cutoff value for positivity of 50 &#956;g/g. fCAL-positive AS patients displayed higher medians of most IBD-specific antibodies when compared with healthy controls or fCAL-negative AS patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether fCAL can be used to identify and characterize a subgroup of AS patients whose disease might be driven by subclinical bowel inflammation.

Jeffersonville Jefferson General Hospital Looking West
The first military occupation at Jeffersonville, Indiana during the Civil War was in 1862 when two area regiments established a camp on a farm owned by Blanton Duncan. Lovell Rousseau, the organizer of the regiments, christened the camp “Camp Joe Holt.” The name was retained when it ceased to be a camp and became a hospital, called “Joe Holt Hospital.” Jefferson General Hospital, built to replace the one at Camp Joe Holt, opened 21 February 1864 and closed in December 1866. Located near Jeffersonville on land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the acreage reached down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The health facility had 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide, and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. The third largest hospital in the country and a showpiece for the Union army, Jefferson General reputedly was one of the finest in the United States for the care of wounded and sick servicemen. During the almost three years that the hospital was in existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals. First person accounts of life at the Jefferson General Hospital can be found in two separate diaries at the Indiana Historical Society Library. One is the published book, Hospital Pencillings by Elvira J. Powers. A volunteer and employee at the hospital, she wrote of the conditions at the hospital and her experiences there. The second is the collection SC2742, Louis C. Webber’s Diary, 1864–1866, a soldier who was wounded three times and was a patient there for a while.

Baroreflex Sensitivity during Positional Changes in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury
Background and Significance: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7 million Americans annually leading to significant morbidity and health care costs. An important cause of morbidity in TBI is secondary brain injury due to abnormal cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA).  Standard measures of CA are not amenable to use outside of the intensive care unit (ICU)  and patients continue to be at risk for secondary brain injury post- ICU. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is a non-invasive assessment of autonomic tone that may be useful in evaluating CA. Evaluation of BRS and its relation to CA has not been examined in patients with TBI and predictors of CA are unknown. Purpose:  The specific aims for this study were to 1) examine the association between BRS and CA in patients with TBI, 2) compare BRS and CA in TBI patients and age and gender matched healthy volunteers (HV) and 3) identify predictors of BRS and CA in TBI. Methods: This study used a two group comparative design with 52 subjects (26 with moderate to severe TBI; 26 HV). Measurement of variables: BRS was calculated as heart rate/mean arterial pressure; CA was calculated as cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler; and cognition was assessed using the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT). Results: There was no significant correlation between BRS and CA, however, BRS had high specificity (77%) for normal CA. BRS was not significantly different between TBI and HV subjects, those with normal or abnormal CA nor was BRS an independent predictor of CA. Forty six percent of TBI subjects had abnormal CA after their TBI (mean = 59.58 ± 36.54 days) and 34.6% of HV had abnormal CA. Predictors of abnormal CA were male gender, ACE-Inhibitors and GOAT. Implications: BRS can be used to identify normal CA.  The GOAT has potential for routine assessment of CA status in non-ICU areas.  Large proportions of TBI subjects long after a TBI event and HV had abnormal CA. Thus assessment of CA status is important in TBI subjects after ICU discharge and further research is needed on the impact of pre-existing CA abnormalities in HV.

HIV protease inhibitors cause apoptosis in intestinal epithelium via autophagy induction
HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs) are a major treatment option within highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV patients. Diarrhea is a common side effect found in 16-62% of patients using HPIs. Little is known about the mechanism that mediates the HPI-induced diarrhea. It has been suggested that intestinal barrier disruption is the cause of HPI-induced diarrhea. Recent studies have shown that HPIs disrupt intestinal barrier function via cell death in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Using an in-vitro human IEC line, HCA7, we show that the HPI, Ritonavir, induces apoptosis of IECs via an autophagic/ apoptotic pathway. Importantly, we also identify an alternative pathway for intestinal barrier disruption through a Ritonavir-induced downregulation of tight junction proteins. These findings implicate two independent pathways for HPI-induced intestinal barrier disruption. Future study may provide therapeutic solutions that exploit these pathways to reduce diarrhea in HAART patients and increase patient compliance to treatment

Evaluation of California’s Alcohol and  Drug Screening and Brief Intervention Project for  Emergency Department Patients
Introduction: Visits to settings such as emergency departments (EDs) may present a “teachable moment” in that a patient may be more open to feedback and suggestions regarding their risky alcohol and illicit drug-use behaviors. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an ’opportunistic’ public health approach that targets low-risk users, in addition to those already dependent on alcohol and/or drugs. SBIRT programs provide patients with comprehensive screening and assessments, and deliver interventions of appropriate intensity to reduce risks related to alcohol and drug use. Methods: This study used a single group pre-post test design to assess the effect of the California SBIRT service program (i.e., CASBIRT) on 6 substance-use outcomes (past-month prevalence and number of days of binge drinking, illegal drug use, and marijuana use). Trained bilingual/bicultural Health Educators attempted to screen all adult patients in 12 EDs/trauma centers (regardless of the reason for the patient’s visit) using a short instrument, and then delivered a brief motivational intervention matched to the patient’s risk level. A total of 2,436 randomly selected patients who screened positive for alcohol and/or drug use consented to be in a 6-month telephone follow-up interview. Because of the high loss to follow-up rate, we used an intention-to-treat approach for the data analysis. Results: Results of generalized linear mixed models showed modest reductions in all 6 drug- and alcohol-use outcomes. Men (versus women), those at relatively higher risk status (versus lower risk), and those with only one substance of misuse (versus both alcohol and illicit drug misuse) tended to show more positive change. Conclusion: These results suggest that SBIRT services provided in acute care settings are associated with modest changes in self-reported recent alcohol and illicit drug use.

Effects of proactive telephone counseling on cessation rates of smokers with major depression
Epidemiological studies have found that smokers with depression are less likely to quit smoking. Intervention studies for smoking cessation, however, have tended to exclude those with current depression, with the assumption that the smokers' acute mental health problems should be dealt with before quitting smoking. Only in the last five years has the cessation treatment field begun to address the need to work with smokers with current mental health conditions. For example, a recent study at the California Smokers' Helpline (a SAMHSA model program that serves over 30,000 smokers annually) assessed for current depression among its callers and found that 1 in 4 callers met criteria for current major depression. Furthermore, it found smokers with major depression were significantly more likely to relapse after a quit attempt when treated under the quitline's standard counseling protocol. This suggests a need to develop a specialized protocol to improve the quit rate of these depressed smokers. Previous studies have suggested that one way to increase the quit rate of smokers with greater relapse vulnerability is to increase the number of treatment session with added content that targets their particular vulnerability (e.g. depression). The success of such an approach, however, requires that clients be present and responsive to additional treatment sessions. This is no small requirement for those with current major depression, as they often have reduced motivation. The present study tested a proactive telephone counseling protocol in which counselors took the initiative to call the smokers for all the counseling sessions (including the additional ones). It has two aims: (1) To demonstrate that depressed smokers are responsive to the enhanced protocol in that they would participate in a significantly greater number of sessions (compared to the standard protocol) and that they have positive views of the enhanced counseling protocol, (2) There would be an increase in the quit rate associated with the enhanced protocol compared to the standard protocol. For the second aim, it was determined at the outset that a minimum of a 5 percentage point increase in quit rate was necessary for it to be clinically meaningful. It was hypothesized that the protocol would increase the quit rate by 10 percentage points, but the study was not powered at a sample size to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. total of 92 smokers with current major depression were randomized into two groups: 46 to the enhanced treatment and 46 to the standard treatment. The enhanced protocol, which was specifically developed for this study, includes the additional content on mood management and up to 15 counseling sessions over a 2 month period. The standard counseling protocol consists of up to 5 sessions over a 1 month period. Current depression was measured by Patient Health Questionnaire mood module (PHQ-8) at intake when smokers first contacted the California Smokers' Helpline. Participants were followed up for three months, at which point their quitting status as well as their mood were assessed. The results show the smokers in the enhanced protocol received on average 3 counseling sessions more than those in the standard protocol (6.8 vs. 3.6, p<0.01). The average number of sessions for the standard protocol is comparable to what was found in previous quitline studies, which demonstrated its efficacy. Most of the participants in the enhanced protocol condition responded positively to the increased counseling sessions: 84% reported they received just the right number of sessions and most of them were satisfied with the counseling and rated their counselors highly. The participants in the enhanced protocol condition also quit smoking at a higher rate than those in the standard protocol condition. At the three month follow up, the 7-day point prevalence (the most often used measure of quitting) was 29.4% vs. 17.5%, respectively. If measured by 30-day abstinence rate, they quit at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively. Moreover, fewer of those in the enhanced treatment met criteria for current major depression at follow-up compared to those in the standard protocol (14.7% vs. 28.2%). While none of these differences reached the conventional statistical significance level due to the small sample size, they have met all the goals set out for the study when it was designed. The results of the study show the promise of providing mood management counseling to smokers with current major depression in the context of a state quitline. The 50 U.S. state quitlines currently serve a large number of smokers (> 400,000 annually). The present study helps to further a larger research agenda to establish a tailored telephone counseling protocol to increase the quit rate of smokers with current major depression

The comadrona and response to obstetrical emergencies : maternal mortality in highland Guatemala
The comadrona, the traditional birth assistant (TBA), in Guatemala still delivers almost 80% of Guatemalan babies in rural areas with large indigenous populations. She is a community leader and is well-respected for her work. However, Guatemala has a very high maternal mortality rate. In some departments as many as 230/100K women die per year. The comadrona is often blamed for these deaths. In many Central American countries the TBA has been outlawed or forced out of her practice. By analyzing the reasons that women die in childbirth in rural Guatemala I show it is not necessarily the comadrona's fault, but rather the lack of a community's ability to respond in time to an obstetrical emergency. Based on 20 qualitative interviews with comadronas, medical personnel, community leaders, and medical administrators, I analyze the meaning of maternal mortality in rural Guatemala. I review the location of the comadrona in these narratives and the connection between competing health systems and maternal mortality statistics. I show one of the major causes of maternal death in rural Guatemala, postpartum hemorrhage, cannot be predicted and can be fatal in less than 2 hours. The comadrona and the small regional health posts that serve rural populations are not equipped to respond to obstetrical emergencies or to stabilize and transport the mother. Together these findings point to the need to plan for and resource community response to obstetrical emergencies, and the need for better communication between the client, her comadrona, and emergency responders

Oral and Intravenous Acetylcysteine for Treatment of Acetaminophen Toxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Introduction: There are few reports summarizing the effectiveness of oral and intravenous (IV) acetylcysteine. We determined the proportion of acetaminophen poisoned patients who develop hepatotoxicity (serum transaminase > 1000 IU/L) when treated with oral and IV acetylcysteine.
      
         Methods: Studies were double abstracted by trained researchers. We determined the proportions of patients who developed hepatotoxicity for each route using a random effects model. Studies were further stratified by early and late treatment.
      
         Results: We screened 4,416 abstracts; 16 articles, including 5,164 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of hepatotoxicity for the oral and IV routes were 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively. Treatment delays are associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity.
      
         Conclusion: Studies report similar rates of hepatotoxicity for oral and IV acetylcysteine, but direct comparisons are lacking. While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of dose and duration from route, our findings suggest that the rates of hepatotoxicity are similar for oral and IV administration.

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter phase 2 study of prasugrel versus placebo in adult patients with sickle cell disease
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Platelet activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease (SCD) suggesting antiplatelet agents may be therapeutic. To evaluate the safety of prasugrel, a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent, in adult patients with SCD, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The primary endpoint, safety, was measured by hemorrhagic events requiring medical intervention. Patients were randomized to prasugrel 5&#8201;mg daily (n&#8201;=&#8201;41) or placebo (n&#8201;=&#8201;21) for 30&#8201;days. Platelet function by VerifyNow&#174; P2Y12 and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein assays at days 10 and 30 were significantly inhibited in prasugrel- compared with placebo-treated SCD patients.
				
				
					
						Results
					There were no hemorrhagic events requiring medical intervention in either study arm. Mean pain rate (percentage of days with pain) and intensity in the prasugrel arm were decreased compared with placebo. However, these decreases did not reach statistical significance. Platelet surface P-selectin and plasma soluble P-selectin, biomarkers of in vivo platelet activation, were significantly reduced in SCD patients receiving prasugrel compared with placebo. In sum, prasugrel was well tolerated and not associated with serious hemorrhagic events.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Despite the small size and short duration of this study, there was a decrease in platelet activation biomarkers and a trend toward decreased pain.

Adaptive Regeneration of Ophiocoma Scolopendrina (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) Under Two Feeding Treatments in Moorea, French Polynesia
Regeneration is common amongst all classes of echinoderms and is easily studied in the laboratory with abundant and tractable ophiuroid specimens. However, ophiuroid regeneration rates, both between species and within the same species, can exhibit uncommonly high variation even under identical laboratory conditions. Eighty-four Ophiocoma scolopendrina (Lamarck 1816), a brittle star which extends its arms out into the water column to suspension feed, were collected from the upper-intertidal zone of rocky beaches on the island of Moorea, French Polynesia for laboratory regeneration experiments. To determine the effects of position of autotomy and feeding level on regenerated length and differentiation of new biomass, two treatments were performed: an amputation treatment either 5 mm from the central disk or 30 mm from the distal tip; and a feeding treatment of high-food or low-food. Additionally, a field survey was conducted to assess predation pressure and autotomy of O. scolopendrina in upper-intertidal zones. This study demonstrated that O. scolopendrina are well adapted to the high levels of sub-lethal predation at the arm tips by quickly resuming the ability to detect predators via photo and chemoreception. The results of this investigation can help to better inform calculations of energy cycling in ecosystems and has potential applications for further research on the connections between ophiuroid life-history and predation pressure on variable regeneration rates.

Need for Intervention in Families Presenting to the Emergency Department with Multiple Children as Patients
Introduction: To assess if families presenting to a pediatric emergency department (PED) with multiple children as patients require interventions at the same rate as families presenting with a single child.
      
         Methods: This is a retrospective chart review looking at PED encounters for families presenting with single children versus multiple children as patients. Patients presenting with siblings were retrospectively selected from the electronic tracking board, and we randomly selected age/gender matched single-patient controls from a comparable time period. The primary outcome was a comparison of visit acuity between families presenting with single versus multiple children, with the hypothesis that families presenting with multiple children as patients would require less utilization of services (as a surrogate for acuity). Admission, intravenous fluid administration (IVF), planned observation, subspecialty consultation, performance of procedures, laboratories and radiographs, administration of prescription medications, and prescription medications for home were all recorded and compared via chi-squared comparison. We considered 5 interventions (admission, subspecialty consultation, performance of procedures, IVF administration, and observation > 6 hours) “critical interventions” and compared them separately.
      
         Results: In our sample of 83 patients from 41 families registering multiple children and 248 singleton controls, we found a significant difference in the percentage of patients requiring critical interventions (4.8% versus 32.5%, P < 0.0001).
      
         Conclusion: Families presenting with multiple children concurrently to an ED require critical interventions at a much lower rate than children presenting as single patients. Many of these families could be well-served at an urgent care or primary care provider. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(5):525–528.

Values and options in cancer care (VOICE): study design and rationale for a patient-centered communication and decision-making intervention for physicians, patients with advanced cancer, and their caregivers
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Communication about prognosis and treatment choices is essential for informed decision making in advanced cancer. This article describes an investigation designed to facilitate communication and decision making among oncologists, patients with advanced cancer, and their caregivers.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					The Values and Options in Cancer Care (VOICE) Study is a National Cancer Institute sponsored randomized controlled trial conducted in the Rochester/Buffalo, NY and Sacramento, CA regions. A total of 40 oncologists, approximately 400 patients with advanced cancer, and their family/friend caregivers (one per patient, when available) are expected to enroll in the study. Drawing upon ecological theory, the intervention uses a two-pronged approach: oncologists complete a multifaceted tailored educational intervention involving standardized patient instructors (SPIs), and patients and caregivers complete a coaching intervention to facilitate prioritizing and discussing questions and concerns. Follow-up data will be collected approximately quarterly for up to three years.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					The intervention is hypothesized to enhance patient-centered communication, quality of care, and patient outcomes. Analyses will examine the effects of the intervention on key elements of physician-patient-caregiver communication (primary outcomes), the physician-patient relationship, shared understanding of prognosis, patient well-being, and health service utilization (secondary outcomes).

Partnership Status, Continued Drug Use and Treatment Adherence among Newly Enrolled Methadone Maintenance Therapy Patients in China
Background: Social support has been studied by a series of authors as a factor to improve treatment outcome of MMT. The influence of social support could be much more profound in a country like China which has a family-oriented culture. As partnership status (e.g. whether living with a regular partner and/or drug use status of the regular partner) are potentially strong predictors for treatment outcome of MMT, the impact of these factors remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that living with a drug-using regular sex partner was associated with higher odds to drop out of treatment and increased probability of ongoing substance use while maintained on treatment.  We also aimed to find out how actively the regular sex partners had been involved with the treatment support, and to identify the benefits brought by MMT to them and their relationship with the drug user and what the challenges remained for better support. Method: The study was conducted in two provinces in central China. The study was comprised of a qualitative section and a quantitative section. For the qualitative study, 20 patients were recruited from five participating clinics. As 5 of the 20 participants were single, we were able to recruit a total of 15 regular sex partners. The patients and their partners were in-depth interviewed separately. For the quantitative study, a survey was administrated using ACASI in a private room at each clinic with 500 patients recruited from 20 randomly selected clinics. Three and six months after the baseline survey, the treatment status, most recent urine test result for drug use and most recent HIV test result was collected.Results: Participants who had a drug-using regular sex partner were less likely to continue to use substance at 3-months and they were also were less likely to stay in treatment at 6 months after enrollment. Participants who received a higher dose of methadone were less likely to be retained at 3-months. All participating partners had a good experience with methadone by observing the improvement in both physical and psychological health of their partners who had enrolled. The financial burden brought by substance use was greatly relieved. The drug-using partners who had not yet enrolled for MMT themselves planned to enroll after seeing the improvement of their partners. Some partners had played their part in reducing the occurrences of continued drug uses. The overall acceptance of long-term adherence among new patients and their partners was low. Rumors about use of methadone would damage one's kidney and liver were commonly believed by both the patients and their partners. On the other hand, during their short course in treatment the patients and their partners showed high level of satisfaction towards the effectiveness of MMT and the quality of service received. A daily visit to the MMT clinic and cost of medication was logistically manageable for most patients.Conclusion: We urge the staff at MMT clinics to pay special attention on the concordant drug-using couples as they are at greater risk for relapse and drop out in the long run. Special counseling for couples would be helpful. The staff at MMT clinics should work closely with the partners for improved treatment outcomes. The partners are the key contact person to be reached in case a patient starts being absent from treatment. The partners should then be included in the educational programs held at the clinics. The programs also provide the partners an opportunity to meet one another and exchange ideas for better support. Training of the clinic staff is necessary for them to better understand the nature of methadone and how it works then they could better educate their patients. The popular opinion leader approach could be considered to counter the rumors of methadone's bad side effect. The first few months in treatment are vitally important for long-term adherence and therefore the best possible time to educate the patients and partners about the importance of the maintenance nature of MMT.

Effects of internalized homonegativity and gender of past sexual partners on the relationship between high-risk behaviors and HIV serostatus
Background : Internalized homonegativity (IH) has been associated with increased HIV risk-behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM). 'Invisibility' of sexual orientation, intentional 'concealment' of sexual preferences, and 'perceived discrimination' relate closely with factors of internalized homophobia or internalized homonegativity validated in previous literature. IH may operate differently for exclusive MSM than for men who have sex with men and women (MSMW). Differential effects of IH on MSM sub-groups may help explain observed inconsistencies between higher risk-behavior and lower HIV prevalence among MSMW. This dissertation explores the independent and joint effects of IH factors and gender of past sexual partners on the link between sexual risks and HIV status. Methods : A random sample of 1,111 MSM in four Mexican cities underwent HIV testing and answered a questionnaire on sexual practices and stigma against homosexuality. With these data, this study developed three scales to measure 'invisibility', 'concealment' and 'stigma/discrimination', as component factors of IH, defining the latter two scales jointly as 'internalized homonegative stigma' (IHS). Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 15.1. Results : 42.2% of participants reported sex with women at least once in their lifetime. Overall HIV prevalence was 10.4%, but it was significantly lower among MSMW (p=.007). Both sexual behavior and levels of IH differed between MSMW with recent women partners (MSMW-R) and those who reported past but no recent women partners (MSMW-E). MSMW of both groups reported more paid sex (p<0.001) and less receptive anal sex (p<0.001) than exclusive MSM. Adjusting for age and risk patterns, MSMW were less than half as likely to be HIV positive than other MSM; IHS influenced this relationship increasing the odds of being HIV positive across study groups, while gender of past sexual partners and 'invisibility' jointly interacted to lower the likelihood of HIV infection for MSMW-E. Conclusions : Factors of IH operate in antagonistic directions: our data suggest that HIV prevention could benefit directly from fighting stigmatizing and discriminating social attitudes, without focusing on increasing 'visibility' of MSM

Influence of Nonobvious Learning on the Development of the Approach Response in Chicks (Gallus gallus)
The role of prenatal auditory stimulations in the development of the postnatal approach response in young nidifugous birds is well known. However most of the studies in this area treat these stimulations as passive events. The purpose of this experimental series is to establish a link between prenatal stimulations and concomitant modifications of embryonic environment (warming and egg turning). Chicks were thus tested in a situation in which they could choose between two pure tones, one of which was or was not prenatally associated with these two stimuli. All chicks of the four groups used here were artificially incubated at the laboratory. After hatching, one-day-old subjects were placed three times a day for 3 days in a situation of choice between two pure tones (HFT = 1000 Hz or LFT = 500 Hz, of 200 ms duration played back every 3 seconds). The operant response (crossing over one of the two active zones  allows the subject to hear either HFT or LFT. Number and duration of passings over each active zone were recorded. Results of the first control experiment showed that from the first test day naive chicks displayed a spontaneous preference for the low frequency pure tone. Another group of chicks was prenatally stimulated with HFT. This did not significantly affect the initial preference. In a third group, prenatal stimulations were repeatedly associated with modifications of the embryo's environment, i.e., warming and egg rotation. Results showed that the expression of the spontaneous preference for LFT was significantly delayed.  The fourth group confirmed the specificity of this effect. The contribution of such nonobvious prenatal learning to the development of the approach response is discussed.

Neighborhood Conditions and Gender Differences in Depressive Symptoms
Depression is a major public health challenge affecting millions of people worldwide, particularly women.  Intra-individual explanations of gender differences in depression include biology (e.g., neurotransmitters, genes, hormones) and psychological factors (e.g., self-concept and esteem, mastery).  Social explanations focusing on exposure to stressors (e.g., low socioeconomic status) and social role occupancy (e.g., marital and employment status) also have been considered.  The recognition that environmental factors may influence mental health has given rise to studies examining the relationship between neighborhood conditions and risk for depression and psychological distress, but gender differences in neighborhood effects have yet to receive the needed research attention.  This dissertation sought an understanding of: (a) gender differences in neighborhood effects on depressive symptoms, and (b) neighborhood influences on variation in depressive symptoms among women.  The research is guided by the neighborhood stress process framework focusing on stressors and psychosocial resources as mediators and moderators of the relationships among neighborhood conditions and depressive symptoms.  Individual-level cross-sectional data come from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS: baseline, 2006/2008 interviews and psychosocial questionnaire supplement).  The HRS is a U.S. national probability sample of adults over the age of 50.  Analyses are performed within a multilevel framework and urban neighborhood data come from the 2000 U.S. Census.    Among eight indicators of neighborhood disadvantage, including neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage (NSD), and five measures of neighborhood advantage examined for gender differences in their effects on depressive symptoms, two were statistically significant but not in the expected direction.  Neighborhood proportion non-family households was associated with fewer depressive symptoms among women and it had no effect among men.  Neighborhood proportion married-couple households was not significantly related to depressive symptoms among women, but among men, living in a neighborhood with more married-couple households with children was associated with fewer symptoms.  Overall, the impact on depressive symptoms of neighborhood characteristics do not differ for men and women.   Gender differences in neighborhood effects on three individual-level stressors and three individual-level psychosocial resources also were examined.  Nine interactions were statistically significant.  Consistent with expectations, people who reside in neighborhoods with more vacant housing units perceived more disorder and less social cohesion in their neighborhoods, and the effects were larger for women than men.  Relative to men, women's perceptions of neighborhood social cohesion and social support are more sensitive to neighborhood economic conditions.  In general, with a few notable exceptions, neighborhood effects on stressors and psychosocial resources do not vary by gender.       In analyses that only included women, NSD was positive and significantly associated with depressive symptoms and neighborhood proportion adults aged 65 and older was negative and significantly associated with symptoms.  Perceived neighborhood social cohesion fully mediated the effect of NSD- and partially mediated the effect of neighborhood proportion older adults- on depressive symptoms.  The effect on depressive symptoms of neighborhood disadvantage did not vary significantly by levels of stressors and psychosocial resources except for three significant cross-level interactions.  Living in a neighborhood with more vacant housing units was associated with more depressive symptoms, and the effect was greater among women who perceived high levels of disorder in the neighborhood than those who perceived less disorder.  Also as hypothesized, NSD had the largest positive effect on depressive symptoms among women with less social support than women with more support.  However, mastery did not function as a stress-buffer.  The effect on depressive symptoms of neighborhood advantage varied significantly by psychosocial factors.  Living in a neighborhood with higher proportions of older adults was associated with fewer depressive symptoms more so for women who report low levels of perceived neighborhood physical disorder than women who report average levels of disorder.  Also consistent with expectations, higher neighborhood proportion of affluent households and owner-occupied housing units were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, and the effects were larger for women with high levels of mastery than women with low mastery.  However, these neighborhood characteristics were less beneficial to the mental health of women with high than low levels of social support.    The findings from this dissertation largely indicate that relationships among components of the neighborhood stress process model do not differ by gender or by levels of stressors and psychosocial resources.  However, the significant results that emerged make a valuable contribution to the research literature by identifying urban neighborhood conditions that are consequential to the mental health of middle-aged and older adults and that should be the target of interventions.

The effects of age and metabolic status on cognitive performance
Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of vascular and metabolic risk factors that frequently occur in combination, including obesity, raised triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, raised blood pressure, and raised fasting plasma glucose, with the presence of 3 out of 5 risk factors constituting a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased rates of mortality and increased risk for developing dementia. Changes in brain structure and cognitive functioning have been reported within the literature. However, research examining cognitive performance in individuals with metabolic syndrome is limited, inconclusive and focuses primarily on older cohorts. As such, the effect of metabolic syndrome on cognitive functioning earlier in the lifespan is unclear. This study aimed to investigate cognitive performance in young, middle-aged, and older adults with multiple metabolic and vascular risk factors in a sample of 91 community dwelling participants. The following tests were administered: Dementia Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Exam, reading subtest from the Wide Ranged Achievement Test-4, Digit Span from the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, Boston Naming Test-2 (BNT), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT -R), California Verbal Learning Test-II (CLVT-II), and several tests from the D-KEFS (Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency, Design Fluency, and Color-Word Interference Test). As expected, older adults performed more poorly than young and middle-aged adults on measures of information processing speed, attention, memory, and executive functioning. Individuals with metabolic syndrome self-report greater disinhibited eating relative to normal controls. Additionally, individuals with metabolic syndrome performed more poorly on figural memory and figural fluency. These findings suggest that aspects of higher-order, executive functions of visuospatial processing are impaired in metabolic syndrome. Given that individuals with metabolic syndrome had significantly greater self-reported disinihibited eating and performed more poorly on higher-order measures of visuospatial processing (e.g., memory, initiation, planning, multitasking, inhibition), future studies aimed at investigating potential causal relationships between metabolic syndrome, disinhibited eating, and executive dysfunction may provide insight into effective intervention targets to delay or prevent metabolic syndrome. Last, results indicated that incorporating measures of visuospatial abilities in future studies would improve the characterization of cognitive declines in individuals with metabolic syndrome

Uterine Arteriovenous Malformation with Sudden Heavy Vaginal Hemmorhage
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a common presentation in the emergency department and has a wide differential. Most presentations of DUB are in hemodynamically stable patients and can be evaluated as an outpatient. Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is one presentation that can result in a life-threatening medical emergency with unexpected sudden and massive vaginal bleeding. We describe a case of a 24-year-old female with sudden heavy vaginal bleeding requiring a blood transfusion, ultrasound evidence of uterine AVM, and a treatment method of expectant management using an intrauterine device in an attempt to preserve fertility.

Urine Collection in the Emergency Department: What Really Happens in There?
Introduction: In women with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), a non-contaminated voided specimen is considered important for valid urinalysis and culture results. We assess whether midstream parted-labia catch (MSPC) instructions were provided by nurses, understood, and performed correctly, according to the patient.
      Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of English- and Spanish-speaking female patients submitting voided urine samples for urinalysis for suspected UTI. The survey was conducted in a public teaching hospital emergency department (ED) from June to December 2010, beginning 2 months after development and dissemination of a nursing MSPC instructions protocol. Research assistants administered the survey within 2 hours of urine collection. Nurses were unaware of the study purpose.
      Results: Of 129 patients approached, 74 (57%) consented and were included in the analysis. Median age was 35; 44% were Latino. Regarding instructions from nurses, patients reported the following: 45 (61%; 95% CI 50-72%) received any instructions; of whom 37 (82%; 95% CI 71-93%) understood them completely. Sixteen (36%; 95% CI 22-51%) were instructed to collect midstream; and 7 (16%; 95% CI 6-29%) to part the labia. Regardless of receiving or understanding instructions, 33 (45%; 95% CI 33-57%) reported actually collecting midstream, and 11 (15%, 95% CI 8-25%) parting the labia.
      Conclusion: In this ED, instructions for MSPC urine collection frequently were not given, despite a nursing protocol, and patients rarely performed the essential steps. An evidence-based approach to urine testing in the ED that considers urine collection technique, is needed. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):401-405.

Integrating sepsis management recommendations into clinical care guidelines for district hospitals in resource-limited settings: the necessity to augment new guidelines with future research
Abstract
            
            Several factors contribute to the high mortality attributed to severe infections in resource-limited settings. While improvements in survival and processes of care have been made in high-income settings among patients with severe conditions, such as sepsis, guidelines necessary for achieving these improvements may lack applicability or have not been tested in resource-limited settings. The World Health Organization&#8217;s recent publication of the Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness District Clinician Manual provides details on how to optimize management of severely ill, hospitalized patients in such settings, including specific guidance on the management of patients with septic shock and respiratory failure without shock. This manuscript provides the context, process and underpinnings of these sepsis guidelines. In light of the current deficits in care and the limitations associated with these guidelines, the authors propose implementing these standardized best practice guidelines while using them as a foundation for sepsis research undertaken in, and directly relevant to, resource-limited settings.

Prescription History of Emergency Department Patients Prescribed Opioids
Introduction: To use Colorado’s prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) to describe the recent opioid prescription history of patients discharged from our emergency department (ED) with a prescription for opioid pain medications.
      
         Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 300 adult ED patients who received an opioid prescription. We abstracted prescription histories for the six months prior to the ED visit from the PDMP, and abstracted clinical and demographic variables from the chart.
      
         Results: There were 5,379 ED visits during the study month, 3,732 of which were discharged. Providers wrote 1,165 prescriptions for opioid analgesics to 1,124/3,732 (30%) of the patients. Median age was 36 years. Thirty-nine percent were male. Patients were 46% Caucasian, 26% African American, 22% Hispanic, 2% Asian and 4% other. These were similar to our overall ED population. There was substantial variability in the number of prescriptions, prescribers and total number of pills. A majority (205/296) of patients had zero or one prescription. The 90th percentile for number of prescriptions was seven, while the 10th percentile was zero. Patients in the highest decile tended to be older, with a higher proportion of Caucasians and females. Patients in the lowest decile resembled the general ED population. The most common diagnoses associated with opioid prescriptions were abdominal pain (11.5%), cold/flu symptoms (9.5%), back pain (5.4%), flank pain (5.0%) and motor vehicle crash (4.7%).
      
         Conclusion: Substantial variability exists in the opioid prescription histories of ED patients, but a majority received zero or one prescription in the preceding six months. The top decile of patients averaged more than two prescriptions per month over the six months prior to ED visit, written by more than 6 different prescribers. There was a trend toward these patients being older, Caucasian and female. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(3):247–252.

How Long Are Patients Willing to Wait in the Emergency Department Before Leaving Without Being Seen?
 Introduction:Our goal was to evaluate patients’ threshold for waiting in an emergency department (ED) waiting room before leaving without being seen (LWBS). We analyzed whether willingness to wait was influenced by perceived illness severity, age, race, triage acuity level, or insurance status.
      Methods:We conducted this survey-based study from March to July 2010 at an urban academic medical center. After triage, patients were given a multiple-choice questionnaire, designed to ascertain how long they would wait for medical care. We collected data including age, gender, race, insurance status, and triage acuity level. We looked at the association between willingness to wait and these variables, using stratified analysis and logistic regression.
      Results:Of the 375 patients who were approached, 340 (91%) participated. One hundred seventy-one (51%) were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving, 58 (17%) would wait 2 to 8 hours, and 110 (32%) would wait indefinitely. No association was found between willingness to wait and race, gender, insurance status, or perceived symptom severity. Patients willing to wait >2 hours tended to be older than 25, have higher acuity, and prefer the study site ED.
      Conclusion:Many patients have a defined, limited period that they are willing to wait for emergency care. In our study, 50% of patients were willing to wait up to 2 hours before leaving the ED without being seen. This result suggests that efforts to reduce the percentage of patients who LWBS must factor in time limits. West J Emerg Med.

The KH-Theory of Complete Simplicial Toric Varieties and the Algebraic K-Theory of Weighted Projective Spaces
We show that, for a complete simplicial toric variety X, we can determine its homotopy K-theory (denoted KH-theory) entirely in terms of the torus pieces of open sets forming an open cover of X.  We accomplish this by constructing a simplicial scheme BOT<sub>X</sub> and constructing a relationship between the spectrum KH(X) and a certain spectrum determined by BOT<sub>X</sub>. Using our construction of BOT<sub>X</sub>, we construct conditions under which, given two complete simplicial toric varieties with the same simplicial structure, we can induce a morphism from BOT<sub>X</sub> to BOT<sub>Y</sub> that is, in each degree, component-wise an isogeny.  This allows us to show that, under these conditions, the two spectra KH(X) &otimes; <bold>Q</bold> and KH(Y) &otimes; <bold>Q</bold> are weakly equivalent.  We then apply this result to determine the rational KH-theory of weighted projective spaces.  We next turn our attention to calculating the F<sub>K</sub> groups for complete toric surfaces and 2-dimensional weighted projective spaces.  This allows us to determine K<sub>n</sub>(P(a,b,c)) &otimes; <bold>Q</bold> for n &le; 0, and allows us to conclude that complete toric surfaces and 2-dimensional weighted projective spaces are K<sub>0</sub>-regular.  We conclude by determining conditions under which our approach for dimension 2 works in arbitrary dimensions.

Correlates of STI symptoms among female sex workers with truck driver clients in two Mexican border towns
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Female sex workers (FSW) are at increased risk for HIV and other STI due to occupation-related risks and exposures. Long-distance truck drivers have been implicated in the spread of HIV, but less is known about HIV/STI risks of FSW servicing truck drivers, especially in North America. As part of an international collaborative pilot study, we interviewed FSWs servicing truck driver clients along two major transportation corridors to explore factors associated with recent STI symptoms.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					A cross-sectional study of 200 FSW was conducted in Mexico: 100 from Nuevo Laredo (U.S. border); 100 from Ciudad Hidalgo (Guatemalan border). Eligibility criteria included age &#8805;18 years, speaking English or Spanish, and having &#8805;1 truck driver client in the past month. The main outcome was reporting any recent STI symptoms, defined as experiencing genital/anal warts, genital ulcers/sores, genital itching, or abnormal vaginal discharge in the past 6 months. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of recent STI symptoms.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Median age of FSW was 29 years, 74% were single, 87% had &lt;9th grade education, and median income was 4000 pesos/month ($300 USD). Sex work occurred at a bar/cantina for 70%. One-quarter had never been tested for HIV, 53% reported lifetime drug use, 22% reported drinking alcohol before/during transactional sex and 17% reported recent STI symptoms. After controlling for age and study site, factors associated with STI symptoms were lifetime drug use (AOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9), drug use before/during sex (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.1), alcohol use before/during sex (AOR 5.2, 95% CI 2.2, 12.6), forced sex ever (AOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.1), lifetime history of arrest (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.0), and being surveyed in Nuevo Laredo rather than Ciudad Hidalgo (AOR 4.8, 95% CI 2.0-10.0).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The associations we observed between recent STI symptoms and drug and alcohol use suggest that interventions are needed that promote consistent and effective safer sex practices, especially while under the influence of alcohol or other substances.

Rapid 13C Urea Breath Test to Identify  Helicobacter Pylori Infection in Emergency Department Patients with Upper Abdominal Pain
Introduction: In emergency department (ED) patients with upper abdominal pain, management includes ruling out serious diseases and providing symptomatic relief. One of the major causes of upper abdominal pain is an ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which can be treated and cured with antibiotics. We sought to estimate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in symptomatic patients using a convenience sample at a single urban academic ED and demonstrate the feasibility of ED-based testing.
      Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients with a chief complaint of pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen for 1 year from February 2011 until February 2012 at a single academic urban ED. Enrolled subjects were tested for H. pylori using a rapid point of care 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT) Exalenz Bioscience. We compared patient characteristics between those who tested positive versus negative for the disease.
      Results: A total of 205 patients with upper abdominal pain were tested over 12 months, and 24% (95% confidence interval: 19% to 30%) tested positive for H. pylori.  Black subjects were more likely to test positive than white subjects (28% v. 6%, P < 0.001). Other factors, such as age and sex, were not different between the 2 groups.
      Conclusion: In our ED, H. pylori infection was present in 1 in 4 patients with epigastric pain, and testing with a UBT was feasible. Further study is needed to determine the risk factors associated with infection, the prevalence of H. pylori in other EDs, the effect of the test on ED length of stay and the cost-effectiveness of an ED-based test-and-treat strategy.

SOD Mimetic Improves the Function, Growth, and Survival of Small-Size Liver Grafts After Transplantation in Rats.
BACKGROUND: Small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) may occur when graft volume is less than 45% of the standard liver volume, and it manifests as retarded growth and failure of the grafts and more mortality. However, its pathogenesis is poorly understood, and few effective interventions have been attempted. AIMS: The present study aimed to delineate the critical role of oxidant stress in SFSS and protective effects of a superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP), on graft function, growth, and survival in the recipient rats. METHODS: Small size graft liver transplantation (SSGLT) was performed to determine the survival, graft injury, and growth. MnTBAP was administered in SSGLT recipients (SSGLT+MnTBAP). RESULTS: Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were sustained higher in SSGLT recipients, which were correlated with an increased apoptotic cell count and hepatocellular necrosis in liver sections. Malondialdehyde content, gene expression of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β, and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-κB in the grafts were increased significantly in SSGLT recipients compared with sham-operated controls. Both phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear c-Jun were increased in SSGLT. All these changes were strikingly reversed by the administration of MnTBAP, with an increase in serum superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, in situ bromodeoxyuridine incorporation demonstrated that graft regeneration was much more profound in the SSGLT+MnTBAP group than in the SSGLT group. Finally, the survival of recipients with MnTBAP treatments was significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced oxidant stress with activation of the p38/c-Jun/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway contributes to SFSS-associated graft failure, retarded graft growth, and poor survival. MnTBAP effectively reversed the pathologic changes in SFSS-associated graft failure.

The effectiveness of medical assistant health coaching for low-income patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia: protocol for a randomized controlled trial and baseline characteristics of the study population
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Many patients with chronic disease do not reach goals for management of their conditions. Self-management support provided by medical assistant health coaches within the clinical setting may help to improve clinical outcomes, but most studies to date lack statistical power or methodological rigor. Barriers to large scale implementation of the medical assistant coach model include lack of clinician buy-in and the absence of a business model that will make medical assistant health coaching sustainable. This study will add to the evidence base by determining the effectiveness of health coaching by medical assistants on clinical outcomes and patient self-management, by assessing the impact of health coaching on the clinician experience, and by examining the costs and potential savings of health coaching.
				
				
					
						Methods/Design
					
					This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of clinic-based medical assistant health coaches to improve clinical outcomes and self-management skills among low-income patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. A total of 441 patients from two San Francisco primary care clinics have been enrolled and randomized to receive a health coach (n&#8201;=&#8201;224) or usual care (n&#8201;=&#8201;217). Patients participating in the health coaching group will receive coaching for 12&#160;months from medical assistants trained as health coaches. The primary outcome is a change in hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, or LDL cholesterol among patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Self-management behaviors, perceptions of the health care team and clinician, BMI, and chronic disease self-efficacy will be measured at baseline and after 12&#160;months. Clinician experience is being assessed through surveys and qualitative interviews. Cost and utilization data will be analyzed through cost-predictive models.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					
					Medical assistants are an untapped resource to provide self-management support for patients with uncontrolled chronic disease. Having successfully completed recruitment, this study is uniquely poised to assess the effectiveness of the medical assistant health coaching model, to describe barriers and facilitators to implementation, and to develop a business case for sustainability.

Integrating pathology and radiology disciplines: an emerging opportunity?
Abstract
            
            Pathology and radiology form the core of cancer diagnosis, yet the workflows of both specialties remain ad hoc and occur in separate "silos," with no direct linkage between their case accessioning and/or reporting systems, even when both departments belong to the same host institution. Because both radiologists' and pathologists' data are essential to making correct diagnoses and appropriate patient management and treatment decisions, this isolation of radiology and pathology workflows can be detrimental to the quality and outcomes of patient care. These detrimental effects underscore the need for pathology and radiology workflow integration and for systems that facilitate the synthesis of all data produced by both specialties. With the enormous technological advances currently occurring in both fields, the opportunity has emerged to develop an integrated diagnostic reporting system that supports both specialties and, therefore, improves the overall quality of patient care.

[hour, accident, risk, pattern, day, driver, trip]

Multiday Driving Patterns and Motor Carrier Accident Risk: A Disagregate Analysis
A method has been developed to estimate the relative accident risk posed by different patterns of driving over a multi-day period. The procedure explicitly considers whether a driver is on-duty of off-duty for each half hour of each day during the period of analysis.
      From a data set of over 1000 drivers, 9 distinct driving patterns are identified. Membership in the patterns is determined exclusively by the pattern of duty hours for seven consecutive days; for some drivers and accident occurred on the eighth day while others had no accident. Therefore each pattern can be associated with a relative accident risk. Additional statistical modeling allowed consideration, in addition to driving pattern, of driver age, experience with the firm, hours off-duty prior to the last trip and hours driving on the last trip (either until the accident or successful completion of the trip).
      The findings of the modeling are that driving patterns over the previous seven days significantly affect accident risk on the eighth day. In general, driving during afternoon and evening hours (e.g. noon to midnight) has the highest accident risk while driving during night and morning hours (e.g. midnight to noon) has lower risk. Consecutive hours driven also has a significant effect on accident risk: the first hour of driving and the ninth and tenth hour of driving have the highest risk. Hours 2 through 8 follow a flattened "u" shape. Driver age and hours off-duty immediately prior to a trip do not appear to affect accident risk significantly.
      These findings quantitatively assess the relative accident risk of multi-day driving patterns using data from actual truck operations. Further research is recommended in the areas of refining model structures, adding explanatory variables (such as highway type) and testing more complex models.

Essays on Health Care: The Impact of Insurance and Use of Medical Services on Health
The United States per capita health care spending is the highest in the world. This dissertation addresses the impact of additional health care spending/medical service usage on health status. First two chapters investigate the role of insurance on medical service use in understudied dental market. The third chapter examines the effectiveness of additional health care spending on infant health outcomes.The first chapter estimates the causal relationship between adult Medicaid dental benefits and dental service usage for low-income adults by using difference-in-differences technique exploiting the state-level variation in adult Medicaid dental benefit. The results suggest that adult Medicaid dental benefit increases the possibility of dental visit by 16.4 - 22 percent.  The evidence that the increased dental service use improves dental health among low-income people is also presented. The second chapter investigates the relationship between dental insurance and dental service use among older populations. Between ages of 61 and 68, 24 percent of people with at least high school diploma lose dental insurance. The decrease in dental coverage is primarily driven by the loss of employer provided dental benefit with retirement. Utilizing this rapid drop in the number of people with dental insurance at around age 65, I find that there is no evidence of a decrease in dental service usage among older populations.   The third chapter, which is co-authored with Marks, addresses the benefit of additional health care spending for newborns. We use the number of infants born on a given day in a given location as an identifying variable to generate exogenous variation in health care spending. Using detailed information on every hospital birth in California from 2002 to 2006, we find that hospital stays are less intensive when the hospitalization region is more crowded. The second stage analysis suggests that the additional health care spending on infants born on less crowded days does not improve infant health status measured by mortality rate and readmission rate.

The efficacy of ultrasound treatment as a reversible male contraceptive in the rhesus monkey
AbstractBackgroundThe use of therapeutic ultrasound as a contraceptive approach has involved nonhuman primates as well as rats and dogs. The current study was undertaken to determine whether this treatment could be a method for reversible contraception, using a model with testes size similar to adult humans.MethodsTwo methods of ultrasound exposure were used, either the transducer probe at the bottom of a cup filled with saline (Cup) or direct application to the surface of the scrotum (Direct). Four adult rhesus (Macaca mulatta) males with normal semen parameters were treated with therapeutic ultrasound at 2.5&#8201;W/cm(2) for 30&#8201;min. Treatment was given 3 times, one every other day on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. For each male, semen quality was evaluated a minimum of three times over several months prior to ultrasound exposure and weekly for two months following ultrasound treatment.ResultsSemen samples from all males, regardless of exposure method, exhibited a decrease in the percentage of motile sperm following ultrasound treatment. There was an average reduction in motility of 40% the week following treatment. Similarly, curvilinear velocity and the percentage of sperm with a normally shaped flagellum were also reduced in all males following ultrasound treatment. A significant reduction in the total number of sperm in an ejaculate (total sperm count) was only observed in males that received ultrasound via the cup method. Following treatment via the cup method, males exhibited up to a 91.7% decrease in average total sperm count (n&#8201;=&#8201;2). Sperm count did not approach pre-treatment levels until 8&#8201;weeks following ultrasound exposure.ConclusionsThe sustained reduction in sperm count, percent motility, normal morphology, and sperm vigor with the cup exposure method provides proof of principle that testicular treatment with ultrasound can be an effective contraceptive approach in humans.

High intratumoral metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression predicts poor outcomes of cryoablation therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Cryoablation is one of the local therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its safety and effect has not been studied in patients with Child class A or B and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis of HCC, but its predictive value to post-cryoablation outcomes remains unknown in patients with BCLC stage C HCC.
				
				
					
						Methods
					This study assessed the safety and outcomes of cryoablation measured by time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), and predictive value of MACC1 mRNA and protein overexpression in tumorous tissue to post-cryoablation outcomes in 120 advanced HCC patients with child-pugh class A or B by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. The potenial correlation of MACC1 and c-Met expression to tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis was also analyzed.
				
				
					
						Results
					The cryoablation in patients with advanced unresectable HCC resulted in a median TTP and OS of 5.5 (4.2- 6.7) months and 10.5 (9.0-12.0) months, respectively and no significant complications, comparable to the historical report for RFA therapy. The MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein expression was significantly increased in tumorous tissues in these patients than that in normal liver tissue controls. Higher expression of MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein in tumorous tissues in these patients was associated with shorter post cryoablation median TTP and OS than that with lower MACC1 expression.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Cryoablation is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced HCC and Child-pugh class A or B cirrhosis; and a higher intratumoral expression of MACC1 or nuclear translocation predicts poor outcomes of cryotherapy in these patients.

THE EFFECTS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND SEA SURFACE WARMING ON THE EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE OPISTHOBRANCH GASTROPOD STYLOCHEILUS STRIATUS
Anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 compound the rates of long-term changes in the abiotic conditions of the Earth’s oceans. Because many physiological processes, including calcification rate, depend on these physical factors, there is mounting concern over how changes in temperature (T) and the CaCO3 saturation of seawater will affect marine organisms.  These effects may be particularly relevant during development— many organisms produce protective calcified structures critical for pelagic dispersal and larval survivability.  I investigated how unmitigated increases in oceanic pCO2 and temperature consistent with climate change predictions affect the embryonic development rate, hatching success, and veliger morphology of the opisthobranch gastropod,Stylocheilus striatus. Embryos were reared in four seawater treatments: 1) control (pH=8.02, T=27°C), 2) high-temperature (pH=8.02, T=31°C), 3) acidified(pH=7.67, T=27°C), 4) acidified high-temperature (pH=7.67, T=31°C). Development times increased under reduced pH conditions, but substantially decreased under high-temperature and acidifiedhigh-temperature treatments, with significant interaction between temperature and pH. The percentage of embryos that hatched into veligers significantly decreased in all three treatments (<70%reductionsin acidified high-temperature conditions).Larval shell size decreased in all three treatments— effects of acidification and temperature were synergistic, causing greater decreases in shell size with significant interaction in acidified high-temperature treatments. Additionally, there were observable deformities in the shell morphology of hatchlings incubated in decreased pH treatments— these deformities were exacerbated by temperature increases. Thus, my results indicate that oceanic conditions congruent with climate change predictions ca. 2100 suppress successful development in encapsulating gastropod embryos, potentially reducing their viability as pelagic larvae.

Prevention of hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death by minocycline
Abstract
				Diabetic patients who attempt strict management of blood glucose levels frequently experience hypoglycemia. Severe and prolonged hypoglycemia causes neuronal death and cognitive impairment. There is no effective tool for prevention of these unwanted clinical sequelae. Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline derivative, has been recognized as an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent in several animal models such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we tested whether minocycline also has protective effects on hypoglycemia-induced neuronal death and cognitive impairment. To test our hypothesis we used an animal model of insulin-induced acute hypoglycemia. Minocycline was injected intraperitoneally at 6 hours after hypoglycemia/glucose reperfusion and injected once per day for the following 1 week. Histological evaluation for neuronal death and microglial activation was performed from 1 day to 1 week after hypoglycemia. Cognitive evaluation was conducted 6 weeks after hypoglycemia. Microglial activation began to be evident in the hippocampal area at 1 day after hypoglycemia and persisted for 1 week. Minocycline injection significantly reduced hypoglycemia-induced microglial activation and myeloperoxidase (MPO) immunoreactivity. Neuronal death was significantly reduced by minocycline treatment when evaluated at 1 week after hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia-induced cognitive impairment is also significantly prevented by the same minocycline regimen when subjects were evaluated at 6 weeks after hypoglycemia. Therefore, these results suggest that delayed treatment (6 hours post-insult) with minocycline protects against microglial activation, neuronal death and cognitive impairment caused by severe hypoglycemia. The present study suggests that minocycline has therapeutic potential to prevent hypoglycemia-induced brain injury in diabetic patients.

Sedation-assisted Orthopedic Reduction in Emergency Medicine: The Safety and Success of a One Physician/One Nurse Model
Introduction:Much of the emergency medical research on sedation-assisted orthopedic reductions has been undertaken with two physicians—one dedicated to the sedation and one to the procedure. Clinical practice in community emergency departments (EDs), however, often involves only one physician, who both performs the procedure and simultaneously oversees the crendentialed registered nurse who administers the sedation medication and monitors the patient. Although the dual-physician model is advocated by some, evidence in support of its superiority is lacking.
      Methods:In this electronic health records review we describe sedation-assisted closed reductions of major joints and forearm fractures in three suburban community EDs. The type of procedure and sedation medication, need for specialty assistance, success rates, and intervention-requiring adverse events are reported.
      Results:During the 18-month study period, procedural sedation was performed 457 times on 442 patients undergoing closed reduction for shoulder dislocations (n=111), elbow dislocations (n=29), hip dislocations (n=101), and forearm fractures (n=201). In the vast majority of this cohort (98.4% 435/442), a single emergency physician simultaneously managed both the procedural sedation and the initial orthopedic reduction without the assistance of a second physician. The reduction was successful or satisfactory in 96.6% (425/435; 95% confidence interval CI, 95.8-98.8%) of these cases, with a low incidence of intervention-requiring adverse events (2.8% 12/435; 95% CI, 1.5-4.8%).
      Conclusion:Sedation-assisted closed reduction of major joint dislocations and forearm fractures can be performed effectively and safely in the ED using a one physician/one nurse model. A policy that requires a separate physician (or nurse anesthetist) to administer medications for all sedation-assisted ED procedures appears unwarranted. Further research is needed to determine which specific clinical scenarios might benefit from a dual-physician approach. West J Emerg Med. 0000;00(0)000

Unique Mechanism of Chance Fracture in a Young Adult Male
Since the first description of the Chance fracture in 1948, there have been few case reports of unique mechanisms causing this classical flexion-extension injury to the spine in motor vehicle accidents, sports injury, and falls. To our knowledge, this injury has not been reported from a fall with the mechanistic forces acting laterally on the spine and with spinal support in place. We present a 21-year-old male who slid down a flight of stairs onto his side wearing a heavy mountaineering style backpack, subsequently sustaining a Chance fracture of his first lumbar vertebrae.

Effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma-releasate on intervertebral disc degeneration in the rabbit anular puncture model: a preclinical study
Abstract
Introduction
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma in which several growth factors are concentrated at high levels. The active soluble releasate isolated following platelet activation of PRP (PRP-releasate) has been demonstrated to stimulate the metabolism of IVD cells in vitro. The in vivo effect of PRP-releasate on degenerated IVD remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the reparative effects of autologous PRP-releasate on degenerated intervertebral discs (IVDs).

Methods
To induce disc degeneration, New Zealand white rabbits (n = 12) received anular puncture in two noncontiguous discs. Autologous PRP and PPP (platelet-poor plasma) were isolated from fresh blood using two centrifugation techniques. Four weeks after the initial puncture, releasate isolated from clotted PPP or PRP (PPP- or PRP-releasate), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control) was injected into the punctured discs. Disc height, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-mapping and histology were assessed.

Results
Anular puncture produced a consistent disc narrowing within four weeks. PRP-releasate induced a statistically significant restoration of disc height (PRP vs. PPP and PBS, P&lt;0.05). In T2-quantification, the mean T2-values of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and anulus fibrosus (AF) of the discs were not significantly different among the three treatment groups. Histologically, the number of chondrocyte-like cells was significantly higher in the discs injected with PRP-releasate compared to that with PBS.

Conclusions
The administration of active PRP-releasate induced a reparative effect on rabbit degenerated IVDs. The results of this study suggest that the use of autologous PRP-releasate is safe and can lead to a clinical application for IVD degeneration.

Equity and the Sun Quality Health Private Provider Social Franchise: comparative analysis of patient survey data and a nationally representative TB prevalence survey
Abstract
				
				
					
						Introduction
					Since 2004, the Sun Quality Health (SQH) franchise network has provided TB care in Myanmar through a network of established private medical clinics. This study compares the wealth distribution of the TB patients to non-TB patients to determine if TB is most common among the poor, and compares the wealth of all TB patients to SQH TB patients to assess whether the franchise achieves its goal of serving the poor.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The study uses data from two sources: 1) Myanmar&#8217;s first nationally representative TB prevalence study conducted in 2009, and 2) client exit interviews from TB patients from SQH clinics. In total, 1,114 TB-positive individuals were included in the study, including 739 from the national sample and 375 from the SQH sample.
				
				
					
						Results
					TB patients at SQH clinics were poorer than TB-positive individuals in the overall population, though not at a statistically significant level (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). After stratification we found that in urban areas, TB patients at SQH clinics were more likely to be in the poorest quartile compared to general TB positive population (16.8% vs. 8.6%, respectively; p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). In rural areas, there was no statistically significant difference between the wealth distribution of SQH clinic patients and general TB positive individuals (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05).
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Franchised clinics in Myanmar are reaching poor populations of TB patients in urban areas; more efforts are needed in order to reach the most vulnerable in rural areas.

Sex differences matter in the gut: effect on mucosal immune activation and inflammation
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Women and men have diverse responses to many infectious diseases. These differences are amplified following menopause. However, despite extensive information regarding the effects of sex hormones on immune cells, our knowledge is limited regarding the effects of sex and gender on the function of the mucosal immune system. Sex differences also manifest in the prevalence of gut associated inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including Crohn&#8217;s disease, ulcerative colitis and Celiac disease. It is thus hypothesized that a baseline sex-associated difference in immune activation may predispose women to inflammation-associated disease.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Peripheral blood samples and small intestinal biopsies were obtained from 34 healthy men and women. Immunophenotypic analysis of isolated lymphocytes was performed by flow cytometry. Oligonucleotide analysis was used to study the transcriptional profile in the gut mucosal microenvironment while real-time PCR analysis was utilized to identify differential gene expression in isolated CD4+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis was confirmed by protein expression levels for genes of interest using fluorescent immunohistochemistry. Data was analyzed using the GraphPad software package.
				
				
					
						Results
					Women had higher levels of immune activation and inflammation-associated gene expression in gut mucosal samples. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells had a significantly higher level of immune activation-associated phenotype in peripheral blood as well as in gut associated lymphoid tissue along with higher levels of proliferating T cells. CD4+ T cells that showed upregulation of IL1&#946; as well as the TH17 pathway-associated genes contributed a large part of the inflammatory profile.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					In this study, we demonstrated an upregulation in gene expression related to immune function in the gut microenvironment of women compared to men, in the absence of disease or pathology. Upon closer investigation, CD4+ T cell activation levels were higher in the LPLs in women than in men. Sex differences in the mucosal immune system may predispose women to inflammation-associated diseases that are exacerbated following menopause. Our study highlights the need for more detailed analysis of the effects of sex differences in immune responses at mucosal effector sites.

The enhancement and impairment of learning by stimulants
Stimulants are prescribed widely to treat a number of disorders, including narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These prescription stimulants are also commonly, illicitly used for studying and general cognitive enhancement, a trend referred to today as academic doping. Higher doses of stimulants may also be self-administered with a rapid route of administration (e.g., smoking, intravenous injection), leading instead to cognitive impairments and addiction. Few studies have examined the parameters outlining when stimulants switch from being nootropic to harmful. This dissertation proposes that, along with route of administration, dose is the critical component dictating the cognitive effects of stimulants. Chapter 1 describes our first study examining the dose-dependent effects of stimulants on fear conditioning, using cocaine. The lowest dose of cocaine enhanced learning, while the highest dose impaired it. Chapter 2 follows with a description of the dose-dependent effects of amphetamine on fear conditioning. Similarly, the lowest doses of amphetamine enhanced learning, while the highest doses led to impairment. Chapter 3 outlines our attempts to extrapolate the amphetamine results to a related form of learning, extinction. We utilized low dose amphetamine to increase extinction learning, but found that no dose facilitated extinction, compared to placebo. Chapter 4 looks further into the structure of fear conditioning, examining the relationships between the most commonly reported training and testing measures. Our analyses demonstrate that post-shock freezing is highly correlated with context fear, confirming that the post-shock measure is better described as a context measure rather than a conditioned response. Our analyses also indicate that tone baseline freezing is not independent from tone test freezing, confounding the most common ways of reporting tone fear. Chapter 5 concludes the dissertation with a broad overview of popular stimulants today, their mechanisms of action, and effects on cognition. A continuum of activation is proposed, in which low doses of stimulants lead to increased concentration and cognitive performance, while high doses lead to cognitive impairments and addiction

Rate of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during the care continuum in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the United States
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are frequent and life-threatening complications of ischemic stroke. We evaluated rates of symptomatic DVT/PE, and of in-hospital and post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
				
				
					
						Methods
					In a retrospective US database analysis, data were extracted from the Premier Perspective&#8482;-i3 Pharma Informatics linked database for patients aged &#8805;18 years who were hospitalized for ischemic stroke from January 2005 to November 2007, and who had &#8805;6 months&#8217; continuous plan enrollment prior to index hospitalization. Patients discharged to an acute-care facility or with atrial fibrillation were excluded. Prophylaxis was evaluated during index hospitalization and for 14 days&#8217; post-discharge. DVT/PE rates were calculated during index hospitalization and up to 30 days post-discharge.
				
				
					
						Results
					A total of 1524 patients were included; 46.1% received pharmacological and/or mechanical prophylaxis in-hospital (28.3%, 11.4% and 12.3% received unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin and mechanical prophylaxis, respectively). 6.4% of patients received outpatient pharmacological prophylaxis; warfarin was most frequently prescribed (5.9%). Total mean&#8201;&#177;&#8201;standard deviation length of index hospitalization was 3.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.5 days. Mean prophylaxis duration in all patients was 0.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.5 days in-hospital and 1.7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6.9 days post-discharge. Symptomatic DVT/PE occurred in 25 patients overall (1.64%), with an inpatient rate of 0.98% and an outpatient rate of 0.66%.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Approximately 1% of patients with AIS experienced symptomatic in-hospital and/or post-discharge DVT/PE. Although 46% received prophylaxis in-hospital, only 6% received prophylaxis in the outpatient setting. This highlights the need for sustained thromboprophylaxis prescribing across the continuum of care.

Evidence of an increased pathogenic footprint in the lingual microbiome of untreated HIV infected patients
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Opportunistic oral infections can be found in over 80% of HIV&#8201;+&#8201;patients, often causing debilitating lesions that also contribute to deterioration in nutritional health. Although appreciation for the role that the microbiota is likely to play in the initiation and/or enhancement of oral infections has grown considerably in recent years, little is known about the impact of HIV infection on host-microbe interactions within the oral cavity. In the current study, we characterize modulations in the bacterial composition of the lingual microbiome in patients with treated and untreated HIV infection. Bacterial species profiles were elucidated by microarray assay and compared between untreated HIV infected patients, HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, and healthy HIV negative controls. The relationship between clinical parameters (viral burden and CD4+ T cell depletion) and the loss or gain of bacterial species was evaluated in each HIV patient group.
				
				
					
						Results
					In untreated HIV infection, elevated viremia was associated with significantly higher proportions of potentially pathogenic Veillonella, Prevotella, Megasphaera, and Campylobacter species in the lingual microbiome than observed in healthy controls. The upsurge in the prevalence of potential pathogens was juxtaposed by diminished representation of commensal Streptococcus and Veillonella species. Colonization of Neisseria flavescens was lower in the lingual microbiome of HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy than in uninfected controls.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our findings provide novel insights into the potential impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on the community structure of the oral microbiome, and implicate potential mechanisms that may increase the capacity of non-commensal species to gain a stronger foothold.

Comparative effectiveness studies to improve clinical outcomes in end stage renal disease: the DEcIDE patient outcomes in end stage renal disease study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Evidence is lacking to inform providers&#8217; and patients&#8217; decisions about many common treatment strategies for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					The DEcIDE Patient Outcomes in ESRD Study is funded by the United States (US) Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to study the comparative effectiveness of: 1) antihypertensive therapies, 2) early versus later initiation of dialysis, and 3) intravenous iron therapies on clinical outcomes in patients with ESRD. Ongoing studies utilize four existing, nationally representative cohorts of patients with ESRD, including (1) the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD study (1041 incident dialysis patients recruited from October 1995 to June 1999 with complete outcome ascertainment through 2009), (2) the Dialysis Clinic Inc (45,124 incident dialysis patients initiating and receiving their care from 2003&#8211;2010 with complete outcome ascertainment through 2010), (3) the United States Renal Data System (333,308 incident dialysis patients from 2006&#8211;2009 with complete outcome ascertainment through 2010), and (4) the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease Registry (53,399 patients with chronic kidney disease with outcome ascertainment from 2005 through 2009). We ascertain patient reported outcomes (i.e., health-related quality of life), morbidity, and mortality using clinical and administrative data, and data obtained from national death indices. We use advanced statistical methods (e.g., propensity scoring and marginal structural modeling) to account for potential biases of our study designs. All data are de-identified for analyses. The conduct of studies and dissemination of findings are guided by input from Stakeholders in the ESRD community.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					The DEcIDE Patient Outcomes in ESRD Study will provide needed evidence regarding the effectiveness of common treatments employed for dialysis patients. Carefully planned dissemination strategies to the ESRD community will enhance studies&#8217; impact on clinical care and patients&#8217; outcomes.

World society of emergency surgery study group initiative on Timing of Acute Care Surgery classification (TACS)
Abstract
				Timing of surgical intervention is critical for outcomes of patients diagnosed with surgical emergencies. Facing the challenge of multiple patients requiring emergency surgery, or of limited resource availability, the acute care surgeon must triage patients according to their disease process and physiological state. Emergency operations from all surgical disciplines should be scheduled by an agreed time frame that is based on accumulated data of outcomes related to time elapsed from diagnosis to surgery. Although literature exists regarding the optimal timing of various surgical interventions, implementation of protocols for triage of surgical emergencies is lacking. For institutions of a repetitive triage mechanism, further discussion on optimal timing of surgery in diverse surgical emergencies should be encouraged. Standardizing timing of interventions in surgical emergencies will promote clinical investigation as well as a commitment by administrative authorities to proper operating theater provision for acute care surgery.

						Background
					Depression in primary care is common, yet this costly and disabling condition remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Persisting gaps in the primary care of depression are due in part to patients&#8217; reluctance to bring depressive symptoms to the attention of their primary care clinician and, when depression is diagnosed, to accept initial treatment for the condition. Both targeted and tailored communication strategies offer promise for fomenting discussion and reducing barriers to appropriate initial treatment of depression.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					The Activating Messages to Enhance Primary Care Practice (AMEP2) Study is a stratified randomized controlled trial comparing two computerized multimedia patient interventions --- one targeted (to patient gender and income level) and one tailored (to level of depressive symptoms, visit agenda, treatment preferences, depression causal attributions, communication self-efficacy and stigma)--- and an attention control. AMEP2 consists of two linked sub-studies, one focusing on patients with significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9 scores&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;5), the other on patients with few or no depressive symptoms (PHQ-9&#8201;&lt;&#8201;5). The first sub-study examined effectiveness of the interventions; key outcomes included delivery of components of initial depression care (antidepressant prescription or mental health referral). The second sub-study tracked potential hazards (clinical distraction and overtreatment). A telephone interview screening procedure assessed patients for eligibility and oversampled patients with significant depressive symptoms. Sampled, consenting patients used computers to answer survey questions, be randomized, and view assigned interventions just before scheduled primary care office visits. Patient surveys were also collected immediately post-visit and 12 weeks later. Physicians completed brief reporting forms after each patient&#8217;s index visit. Additional data were obtained from medical record abstraction and visit audio recordings. Of 6,191 patients assessed, 867 were randomized and included in analysis, with 559 in the first sub-study and 308 in the second.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					Based on formative research, we developed two novel multimedia programs for encouraging patients to discuss depressive symptoms with their primary care clinicians. Our computer-based enrollment and randomization procedures ensured that randomization was fully concealed and data missingness minimized. Analyses will focus on the interventions&#8217; potential benefits among depressed persons, and the potential hazards among the non-depressed.

The Ottawa Knee Rule: Examining Use in an Academic Emergency Department
Introduction: The Ottawa Knee Rule is a validated clinical decision rule for determining whether knee radiographs should be obtained in the setting of acute knee trauma. The objectives of this study were to assess physician knowledge of, barriers to implementation of, and compliance with the Ottawa Knee Rule in academic emergency departments (EDs), and evaluate whether patient characteristics predict guideline noncompliance.
      Methods: A 10 question online survey was distributed to all attending ED physicians working at three affiliated academic EDs to assess knowledge, attitudes and self-reported practice behaviors relatedto the Ottawa Knee Rule. We also performed a retrospective ED record review of patients 13 years of age and older who presented with acute knee trauma to the 3 study EDs during the 2009 calendar year, and we analyzed ED records for 19 variables.
      Results: ED physicians (n = 47) correctly answered 73.2% of questions assessing knowledge of the Ottawa Knee Rule. The most commonly cited barriers to implementation were “patient expectations” and system issues, such as “orthopedics referral requirement.” We retrospectively reviewed 838 records, with 260 eligible for study inclusion. The rate of Ottawa Knee Rule compliance was retrospectively determined to be 63.1%. We observed a statistically significant correlation betweenOttawa Knee Rule compliance and patient age, but not gender, insurance status, or provider type, among others.
      Conclusion: Compliance with the Ottawa Knee Rule among academic ED healthcare providers is poor, which was predicted by patient age and not other physician or patient variables. Improving compliance will require comprehensive educational and systemic interventions. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):366-373.

Remodeling of central metabolism in invasive breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue - a GC-TOFMS based metabolomics study
AbstractBackgroundChanges in energy metabolism of the cells are common to many kinds of tumors and are considered a hallmark of cancer. Gas chromatography followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) is a well-suited technique to investigate the small molecules in the central metabolic pathways. However, the metabolic changes between invasive carcinoma and normal breast tissues were not investigated in a large cohort of breast cancer samples so far.ResultsA cohort of 271 breast cancer and 98 normal tissue samples was investigated using GC-TOFMS-based metabolomics. A total number of 468 metabolite peaks could be detected; out of these 368 (79%) were significantly changed between cancer and normal tissues (p&lt;0.05 in training and validation set). Furthermore, 13 tumor and 7 normal tissue markers were identified that separated cancer from normal tissues with a sensitivity and a specificity of &gt;80%. Two-metabolite classifiers, constructed as ratios of the tumor and normal tissues markers, separated cancer from normal tissues with high sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, the cytidine-5-monophosphate / pentadecanoic acid metabolic ratio was the most significant discriminator between cancer and normal tissues and allowed detection of cancer with a sensitivity of 94.8% and a specificity of 93.9%.ConclusionsFor the first time, a comprehensive metabolic map of breast cancer was constructed by GC-TOF analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer and normal tissues. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that spectrometry-based approaches have the potential to contribute to the analysis of biopsies or clinical tissue samples complementary to histopathology.

TNF-alpha is associated with loss of lean body mass only
in already cachectic COPD patients
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Systemic inflammation may contribute to cachexia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this longitudinal study we assessed the association between circulating C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, interleukin (IL)-1&#223;, and IL-6 levels and subsequent loss of fat free mass and fat mass in more than 400 COPD patients over three years.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The patients, aged 40&#8211;76, GOLD stage II-IV, were enrolled in 2006/07, and followed annually. Fat free mass and fat mass indexes (FFMI &amp; FMI) were calculated using bioelectrical impedance, and CRP, TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#223;, and IL-6 were measured using enzyme immunoassays. Associations with mean change in FFMI and FMI of the four inflammatory plasma markers, sex, age, smoking, FEV1, inhaled steroids, arterial hypoxemia, and Charlson comorbidity score were analyzed with linear mixed models.
				
				
					
						Results
					At baseline, only CRP was significantly (but weakly) associated with FFMI (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.18, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01) and FMI (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.27, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). Univariately, higher age, lower FEV1, and use of beta2-agonists were the only significant predictors of decline in FFMI, whereas smoking, hypoxemia, Charlson score, and use of inhaled steroids predicted increased loss in FMI. Multivariately, high levels of TNF-&#945; (but not CRP, IL-1&#223; or IL-6) significantly predicted loss of FFMI, however only in patients with established cachexia at entry.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					This study does not support the hypothesis that systemic inflammation is the cause of accelerated loss of fat free mass in COPD patients, but suggests a role for TNF-&#945; in already cachectic COPD patients.

Light meditation of Circadian Predatory Behavior in the Young Alligator
Minnow predation by 10 young American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis)was systematically measured during four daily time periods under four different conditions of lighting in order to investigate a circadian rhythm of redatory behavior.The four daily time periods were night (1:00 a.m. -7.00  a.m.),morning (7.00 a.m.- 1:00 p.m.), afternoon (1:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m.), and evening (7:00p.m. -1:00 a.m.). Each of the following lighting conditions had a duration of 4 weeks:continuous complete darkness (DD); continuous artificial illumination (LL); naturally varying Ught-dark conditions (natural LD); and reversed light-dark conditions with artificial lights on at sunset and off at sunrise (reversed LD). Predatory behavior (i.e., the number of prey fish consumed wholly or partially during each test session) varied significantly as a function of the interaction between time period and lighting condition.Under natural LD, the mean number of prey killed during  night sessions was significantly higher than either morning or afternoon sessions. Under reversed LD,the pattern of predation reversed from that exhibited under normal Ughting, with both morning and afternoon predation significantly higher than either evening or night. Under conditions of continuous illumination (LL and DD) the natural LD circadian pattern persisted for over 1 week with significantly higher predation rates during the night periods as ompared to the morning and afternoon periods. The gradual transition of predation pattern in response to manipulations of the light-dark cycle suggests that the circadian rhythm of alligator predadon is dependent upon light-dark variation for entrainment.

Contributions of Emotional Intelligence, Mentoring and Self-Efficacy to Academic Success and Addictions Treatment
Success in any endeavor is dependent upon a combination of unique circumstances and personal factors.  Some people are able to rise to upcoming challenges and surpass expectations while others struggle, waver or simply give up.  The purpose of this dissertation is to examine factors that contribute to personal success within two contexts: academia and addictions treatment.  Specifically, this study investigates the contributions of mentors' emotional intelligence, and protégés' self-efficacy in determining positive protégé outcomes.  Within the context of academia, results showed slight support for the predictive relationship between mentoring support received and students' feelings of research self-efficacy. Results provided mixed support for the predictive relationship between students' self-efficacy and their academic outcomes such as final course grade, identity as a researcher and commitment to training in psychology. Within the context of addictions treatment, results failed to support the proposed model.  Limitations, applications and future directions are discussed.

The use of complementary and alternative medicine among breast cancer survivors : the women's healthy eating and living study perspective
The dissertation contains three research papers which examined the following issues in breast cancer survivors (a) the primary methodological issue among the studies addressing the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM),which has been to establish criteria for a meaningful definition of a CAM user, (b) the impact on breast cancer prognosis for those women who used CAM therapies as an alternative to undergoing conventional systemic treatments, which have been recommended to them and (c) the use of dietary supplements, which is the most commonly used form of CAM and potentially the most likely to interfere with cancer treatment. All three papers were secondary data analyses, using the dataset from the WHEL study, which assessed 3088 women at study enrollment. During the follow-up period, 2562 WHEL study participants completed a structured telephone interview that measured CAM use, including the modality, the purpose for the use, and the frequency. The CAM and dietary supplement use data were the focus of these research papers. The study findings have shown that (a) there are important distinctions to be made among the different classes of CAM users, (b) complementary and alternative therapies should not be used in place of standard treatment for breast cancer patients and (c) dietary supplements may improve overall micronutrient intakes but were not associated with all-cause mortality among this cohort of breast cancer survivors

Effectiveness of Patient Adherence Groups as a Model of Care for Stable Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa
Abstract: Background: Innovative models of care are required to cope with the ever-increasing number of patients on antiretroviral therapy in the most affected countries. This study, in Khayelitsha, South Africa, evaluates the effectiveness of a group-based model of care run predominantly by non-clinical staff in retaining patients in care and maintaining adherence.
Methods and Findings: Participation in ‘‘adherence clubs’’ was offered to adults who had been on ART for at least 18 months, had a current CD4 count .200 cells/ml and were virologically suppressed. Embedded in an ongoing cohort study, we compared loss to care and virologic rebound in patients receiving the intervention with patients attending routine nurse-led care from November 2007 to February 2011. We used inverse probability weighting to estimate the intention-totreat effect of adherence club participation, adjusted for measured baseline and time-varying confounders. The principal
outcome was the combination of death or loss to follow-up. The secondary outcome was virologic rebound in patients who were virologically suppressed at study entry. Of 2829 patients on ART for .18 months with a CD4 count above 200 cells/ml,
502 accepted club participation. At the end of the study, 97% of club patients remained in care compared with 85% of other patients. In adjusted analyses club participation reduced loss-to-care by 57% (hazard ratio HR 0.43, 95% CI = 0.21–0.91) and
virologic rebound in patients who were initially suppressed by 67% (HR 0.33, 95% CI = 0.16–0.67).
Discussion: Patient adherence groups were found to be an effective model for improving retention and documented virologic suppression for stable patients in long term ART care. Out-of-clinic group-based models facilitated by non-clinical staff are a promising approach to assist in the long-term management of people on ART in high burden low or middleincome settings.

Implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry for Critical Patients in an Academic Emergency Department is Not Associated with a Change in Mortality Rate
Introduction: There is limited literature on the effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) on mortality. The objective of our study was to determine if there was a change in mortality among critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after the implementation of a CPOE system. 
      
          
       
      
         Methods: This was a retrospective study of all critically ill patients in the ED during the year before and the year after CPOE implementation. The primary outcome measures were mortality in the ED, after admission, and overall. Secondary outcome measures included length of stay in the resuscitation area of the ED, length of hospital stay, and disposition following hospitalization. Patient disposition was used as a marker for neurologic function, and patients were grouped as either being discharged to home vs. nursing home, rehabilitation center, or a long-term healthcare facility. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics, chi- square, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. 
      
          
       
      
         Results: There were 2,974 critically ill patients in the year preceding CPOE and 2,969 patients in the year following CPOE implementation. There were no differences in mortality between the two groups in the ED, after admission, or overall. The pre- and post-CPOE mortality rate for the ED, hospital, or overall was 2.52% vs. 2.02% (P = 0.19, 95% confidence interval CI -0.3 to 1.3), 7.8% versus 8.29% (P = 0.61, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.9), and 10.32% vs. 10.31% (P = .60, 95% CI -1.5 to 1.6), respectively. There was no difference in hospital length of stay between pre- and post- CPOE patients (3 days versus 3 days), a difference of 0.05 days (95% CI -0.47 to 0.57). Length of stay in the ED resuscitation area was longer in the post-CPOE group (31 versus 32 minutes), a difference of -1.96 minutes (95% CI -3.4 to -0.53). More patients were discharged to home in the pre-CPOE group (66.8% versus 64.3%), a difference of 2.54% (95% CI 0.13% to 4.96%). 
      
          
       
      
         Conclusion: The implementation of CPOE was not associated with a change in mortality of critically ill ED patients, but was associated with a decrease in proportion of patients discharged to home after hospitalization. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):114-120.

Coordination of Care in Substance Abuse Treatment: An Interorganizational Perspective
The high cost of detoxification (detox) services and health risks associated with continued substance abuse make readmission to detox an important indicator of poor performance for substance abuse treatment systems. One major service gap in the continuum of care for substance use disorders associated with readmissions is not transitioning patients to rehabilitation after a detox service. This study examined the problem of detox readmissions from an interorganizational network perspective. There were four aims: 1) determine the extent to which detox patients transfer to rehabilitation within 14 days of discharge from a detox service, 2) map the linkages between treatment programs, 3) test the impact of detox programs' network ties on their patients' odds of readmission to a detox service within one year, and 4) evaluate the utility of patient transfer rates as a county-level performance measure for detox. Data are from the California Outcomes Measurement System. I used admission and discharge data for all patients treated in 2008-2009 in 32 counties to map linkages between treatment programs and measure structural features of detox programs' local networks using social network analysis. I used multi-level analysis to predict the odds of patient readmissions to detox. Contextual predictors included out-degree (number of out-going ties to other programs) and efficiency (proportion of direct ties within a network that are "non-redundant"). The total number of patients in the dataset was 150,955, including 25,423 detox patients. Approximately 28% of detox patients transferred to some form of rehabilitation care after detox. Transitioning from detox to rehabilitation within 14 days of discharge was associated with lower odds of readmissions (for residential detox: OR .48, 95% CI .40, .57; for narcotic treatment detox:       OR .25, 95% CI .19, .32). Network efficiency was associated with lower odds of readmission (for residential detox: OR .25, 95% CI .08, .83; for narcotic treatment detox: OR .34, 95% CI .14, .82). Detox programs with greater efficiency are able to access diverse referral resources. The findings from this study support the use of detox-to-treatment transfer rates as a performance measure for treatment systems.

Increasing Hepatitis C treatment uptake among HIV-infected patients using an HIV primary care model
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Access to Hepatitis C (HCV) care is low among HIV-infected individuals, highlighting the need for new models to deliver care for this population.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Retrospective cohort analysis that compared the number of HIV patients who initiated HCV therapy: hepatology (2005&#8211;2008) vs. HIV primary care model (2008&#8211;2011). Logistic-regression modeling was used to ascertain factors associated with HCV therapy initiation and achievement of sustained viral response (SVR).
				
				
					
						Results
					Of 196 and 163 patients that were enrolled in the HIV primary care and hepatology models, 48 and 26 were treated for HCV, respectively (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.043). The HIV/HCV-patient referral rate did not differ during the two study periods (0.10 vs. 0.12/patient-yr, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.18). In unadjusted analysis, predictors (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) of HCV treatment initiation included referral to the HIV primary care model (OR: 1.7), a CD4+ count &#8805;400/mm3 (OR: 1.8) and alanine aminotranferase level &#8805;63U/L (OR: 1.9). Prior psychiatric medication use correlated negatively with HCV treatment initiation (OR: 0.6, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.045). In adjusted analysis the strongest predictor of HCV treatment initiation was CD4+ count (&#8805;400/mm3, OR: 2.1, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01). There was no significant difference in either clinic model (primary care vs. hepatology) in the rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (29% vs. 16%), loss to follow-up (8 vs. 8%), or HCV SVR (44 vs. 35%).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Using a HIV primary care model increased the number of HIV patients who initiate HCV therapy with comparable outcomes to a hepatology model.

Toric degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds in Grassmannians
We describe methods for constructing toric degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds in Grassmannians. Toric degenerations were introduced by Gross and Siebert in their work on mirror symmetry, and consist of a one- parameter family of algebraic varieties with a certain type of singular fiber. Gross showed that toric degenerations give, in a certain sense, a complete description of Calabi-Yau manifolds that arise from the Batyrev-Borisov construction. This thesis focuses on Calabi-Yau complete intersections in Grassmannians, which in general cannot be obtained from the Batyrev-Borisov construction. We completely work out the details of the simplest example, that of a quartic hypersurface in G(2,4), and discuss how a similar strategy might be used in higher -dimensional cases

Magnetic Resonance - Ultrasound Fusion of the Prostate: Imaging for Cancer Diagnosis
Methods to diagnosis prostate cancer, a disease affecting approximately 240,000 men in the U.S. annually, have remained largely unchanged in the last several decades. An increased level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the usual initiating event followed by an ultrasound-guided biopsy. Such biopsies are performed in a systematic, but blind manner, and tumor discovery is often fortuitous. Furthermore, such biopsies often cannot differentiate between serious, potentially lethal forms of prostate cancer and insignificant, indolent forms. This inadequate method of diagnosis has led to over-treatment of indolent disease, a major concern due to the quality-of-life issues of impotence and incontinence associated with curative treatment.Targeted biopsy utilizing multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may comprise an important advance in prostate cancer diagnosis. MR-guided biopsies, while effective, suffer from high cost, limited availability, and long procedure times. MR-Ultrasound (MR-US) fusion, marrying the predictive accuracy of MR and the real-time capabilities of ultrasound, offers an alternative that can be performed in most outpatient settings, while potentially retaining the cancer detection accuracy of MR-guided biopsy. This thesis presents comprehensive research studies that validate targeted biopsy using MR-US fusion. We found that the use of image fusion in targeted prostate biopsy yielded an improved cancer detection rate in a low-risk population. Further, we discover that fusion is appropriate for men with prior negative biopsies and elevated levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), some of whom may be screened using MRI. In men undergoing repeat biopsy to rule out cancer, we observed a cancer detection rate of almost four times that usually reported (37% vs. 10%).We also discover that significant components to errors in targeting are volume accuracy and registration between MR and TRUS. To this end, this thesis presents a novel method of real-time 3D prostate imaging suitable for image fusion, transurethral ultrasound (TUUS). A number of engineering challenges have been addressed to bring this concept to realization: a catheter-based transducer theoretically capable of volumetric imaging of the prostate was fabricated and evaluated; reconfigurable hardware was designed to provide flexibility in imaging techniques; and image reconstruction techniques were developed and implemented for MR-US fusion.

Evaluation of California’s Alcohol and  Drug Screening and Brief Intervention Project for  Emergency Department Patients
Introduction: Visits to settings such as emergency departments (EDs) may present a “teachable moment” in that a patient may be more open to feedback and suggestions regarding their risky alcohol and illicit drug-use behaviors. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an ’opportunistic’ public health approach that targets low-risk users, in addition to those already dependent on alcohol and/or drugs. SBIRT programs provide patients with comprehensive screening and assessments, and deliver interventions of appropriate intensity to reduce risks related to alcohol and drug use.
      Methods: This study used a single group pre-post test design to assess the effect of the California SBIRT service program (i.e., CASBIRT) on 6 substance-use outcomes (past-month prevalence and number of days of binge drinking, illegal drug use, and marijuana use). Trained bilingual/bicultural Health Educators attempted to screen all adult patients in 12 EDs/trauma centers (regardless of the reason for the patient’s visit) using a short instrument, and then delivered a brief motivational intervention matched to the patient’s risk level. A total of 2,436 randomly selected patients who screened positive for alcohol and/or drug use consented to be in a 6-month telephone follow-up interview. Because of the high loss to follow-up rate, we used an intention-to-treat approach for the data analysis.
      Results: Results of generalized linear mixed models showed modest reductions in all 6 drug- and alcohol-use outcomes. Men (versus women), those at relatively higher risk status (versus lower risk), and those with only one substance of misuse (versus both alcohol and illicit drug misuse) tended to show more positive change.
      Conclusion: These results suggest that SBIRT services provided in acute care settings are associated with modest changes in self-reported recent alcohol and illicit drug use.West J Emerg Med.

Characterization of Beta-lactam Resistance in the Gastric Pathogen Helicobacter pylori
Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of peptic ulcer disease and potentially stomach cancer. Treatment of patients with gastritis is warranted and normally done with a combination of antibiotics (such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin or others) and a proton pump inhibitor. Resistance to most of these antibiotics in H. pylori has been seen worldwide and is constantly increasing.		The purpose of this thesis was to more systematically characterize the mechanisms of amoxicillin resistance in  H. pylori. We used both a clinical isolate strain B258, the first US amoxicillin resistant strain to be examined in this way, and in vitro selected amoxicillin resistant strains.  In strain B258 we determined that all of the amoxicillin resistance was due to the presence of 2 amino acid substitutions in Penicillin Binding Protein 1(PBP1).  To explain how these amino acids could increase amoxicillin resistance, we did homology modeling of PBP1 to map the location of these amino acids and their relation to the putative amoxicillin binding cleft.	To better appreciate the role of single amino acid substitutions in amoxicillin resistance, we made site-directed mutants of the most commonly found amino acids in PBP1 from amoxicillin-resistant strains. and transformed a sensitive strain with each to monitor its effect on amoxicillin resistance.  We also used homology modeling and affinity binding studies using biotinylated amoxicillin to examine the role of these PBP1 mutations in amoxicillin resistance.	Finally, we examined a series of 6 in vitro selected amoxicillin resistant strains each with slightly increased MICs to amoxicillin, in order to track both the evolution of resistance as well as identify other possible novel resistance mechanisms.  Whole genome sequencing of the most resistant isolate when compared to the parental sensitive strain, identified 12 genes as likely candidates affecting amoxicillin resistance.  Changes in PBP1, PBP 2 and various outer membrane proteins were identified and their role in amoxicillin resistance is being systematically examined in each of the 6 isolates.

Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts at Extreme Energies
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), thought to be produced by the core-collapse of massive stars or merging compact objects, are the most luminous events observed since the Big Bang. GRBs are intrinsically interesting as laboratories to study physical processes at energies much higher than can be produced in the largest particle accelerators on Earth. A better understanding of GRBs may also allow for their use as cosmological tools - backlights for the study of the evolution of the Universe back to the era of the first gravitationally-bound structures. In this work, results from observations of satellite-detected GRBs with the Milagro and VERITAS very high energy (VHE, >100 GeV) gamma-ray telescopes are presented. No significant flux of VHE gamma rays associated with any of the 144 GRBs observed was detected. The limits on VHE gamma-ray emission during the GRB early afterglow phase obtained from the VERITAS observations are among the most constraining to date and the interpretation of these non-detections in the context of GRB emission models is discussed. Results from observation of the "naked-eye burst" GRB 080319B with Milagro are shown to rule out the popular synchrotron self-Compton model of emission over a broad range of energy space. Finally, the prospects for GRB observations with both current and future-generation VHE observatories are examined.

Outcomes of a multilevel walking intervention for older adults living in retirement communities
Increased walking among facility-dwelling older adults, who are very old, frail, and have low physical activity, could have substantial health benefits. Multilevel approaches to improving physical activity, based on Ecological Models and Social Cognitive Theory, have not been tested in this population but hold promise for improved effects. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and outcomes of a 3-month enhanced, multilevel walking intervention, compared to a standard walking intervention, among older adults in retirement communities. Participants in the enhanced intervention group were hypothesized to have improved outcomes compared to those in the standard intervention. Data were collected at baseline (N = 87) and post-intervention (N = 67) from residents in 4 retirement facilities. Sites were quasi- randomized to condition (N = 2 sites per condition). Standard intervention components included pedometers, printed materials, and biweekly group sessions; those in the enhanced intervention also received individual biweekly phone counseling and environmental awareness components. Measures included activity related outcomes (pedometers, sedentary behavior, activities of daily living, on and off-site walking, satisfaction with walking opportunities, neighborhood barriers), physical function, mental health outcomes (quality of life, depression), study satisfaction, and adherence to study components. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for between group differences and repeated measures ANCOVA for pre-post test changes. None of the outcomes were significantly different between walking intervention conditions except for neighborhood barriers. Standard intervention participants had significantly fewer neighborhood barriers post-intervention compared to the enhanced intervention group. Significant improvements from baseline to post-intervention occurred among the total sample for step counts, neighborhood barriers, walking up stairs, walking off-site, and satisfaction with walking opportunities but significance disappeared after adjustment for covariates. Study satisfaction and adherence was high for both groups. The results of this study suggest that two different types of walking interventions are feasible to conduct and result in improved step counts among facility-dwelling older adults. The most change occurred for environment-related variables. Findings suggest that the context of walking is important for older adults residing in retirement facilities and should be targeted in future interventions. Future studies can build on this novel multilevel approach to improving walking among very old adults

Additive effects of aging and HIV infection on category verbal fluency : an analysis of component processes
Advances in the management of HIV infection have resulted in a growing population of older adults living with HIV. Both aging and HIV infection have been independently associated with central nervous system changes and corresponding declines in neurocognitive functioning. Poorer semantic verbal fluency output is also common in both HIV infection and healthy older adults, although, the possible additive effects of these risk factors are unknown. The present study aimed to examine the combined effects of aging and HIV on semantic verbal fluency and its component processes (i.e., clustering and switching), the neurocognitive correlates of clustering and switching in older HIV-infected adults, and the associations between clustering and switching and everyday functioning. Participants included 257 individuals across 4 demographically matched groups: Younger (i.e., <40 years) Healthy (n=93), Younger HIV-infected (n=50), Older (i.e., greater than or equal to50 years) Healthy (n=51), and Older HIV-infected (n=63) individuals. Participants were administered a standard semantic fluency protocol scored according to established clustering and switching guidelines (Troyer et al., 1997) and a selfreported assessment of everyday functioning as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological, medical, and psychological evaluation. Jonckheere-Terpstra tests revealed a significant stepwise additive effect between the groups for overall semantic fluency output (p = 0.004) and a trend for declining switching performance (p = 0.056), but not cluster size (p = 0.826), with greatest deficits evident in the Older HIV-infected participants. Results were not better explained by confounding psychiatric, medical, or HIV disease characteristics. Within the older HIV-infected adults, poorer switching was associated with deficits in learning and executive functioning and selfreported declines in everyday functioning. Results suggest that HIV infection and aging may confer adverse additive effects on the executive components of semantic fluency (i.e., switching), which was associated with poorer everyday functioning outcomes and may be driven by the combined frontostriatal neuropathological burden of these two conditions. This research provides preliminary insight into the cognitive architecture of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders among older adults, and may ultimately guide rehabilitation efforts aimed at improving overall quality of life for the growing population of older adults living with HIV infection

[hospital, camp, jefferson, patient, general]

Jefferson General Hospital Laundry and Engih sic House
The first military occupation at Jeffersonville, Indiana during the Civil War was in 1862 when two area regiments established a camp on a farm owned by Blanton Duncan. Lovell Rousseau, the organizer of the regiments, christened the camp “Camp Joe Holt.” The name was retained when it ceased to be a camp and became a hospital, called “Joe Holt Hospital.” Jefferson General Hospital, built to replace the one at Camp Joe Holt, opened 21 February 1864 and closed in December 1866. Located near Jeffersonville on land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the acreage reached down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The health facility had 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide, and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. The third largest hospital in the country and a showpiece for the Union army, Jefferson General reputedly was one of the finest in the United States for the care of wounded and sick servicemen. During the almost three years that the hospital was in existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals. First person accounts of life at the Jefferson General Hospital can be found in two separate diaries at the Indiana Historical Society Library. One is the published book, Hospital Pencillings by Elvira J. Powers. A volunteer and employee at the hospital, she wrote of the conditions at the hospital and her experiences there. The second is the collection SC2742, Louis C. Webber’s Diary, 1864–1866, a soldier who was wounded three times and was a patient there for a while.

Rationale for short course primaquine in Africa to interrupt malaria transmission
Abstract
				Following the recent successes of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa, the gametocytocidal drug primaquine needs evaluation as a tool to further reduce the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The drug has scarcely been used in Africa because of concerns about its safety in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The evidence base for the use of primaquine as a transmission blocker is limited by a lack of comparable clinical and parasitological endpoints between trials. In March 2012, a group of experts met in London to discuss the existing evidence on the ability of primaquine to block malaria transmission, to define the roadblocks to the use of primaquine in Africa and to develop a roadmap to enable its rapid, safe and effective deployment. The output of this meeting is a strategic plan to optimize trial design to reach desired goals efficiently. The roadmap includes suggestions for a series of phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 studies to address specific hurdles to primaquine&#8217;s deployment. These include ex-vivo studies on efficacy, primaquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and dose escalation studies for safety in high-risk groups. Phase 3 community trials are proposed, along with Phase 4 studies to evaluate safety, particularly in pregnancy, through pharmacovigilance in areas where primaquine is already deployed. In parallel, efforts need to be made to address issues in drug supply and regulation, to map G6PD deficiency and to support the evaluation of alternative gametocytocidal compounds.

The link between the management of employees and patient mortality in acute hospitals
The relationship between human resource management practices and organizational performance (including quality of care in health-care organizations) is an important topic in the organizational sciences but little research has been conducted examining this relationship in hospital settings. Human resource (HR) directors from sixty-one acute hospitals in England (Hospital Trusts) completed questionnaires or interviews exploring HR practices and procedures. The interviews probed for information about the extensiveness and sophistication of appraisal for employees, the extent and sophistication of training for employees and the percentage of staff working in teams. Data on patient mortality were also gathered. The findings revealed strong associations between HR practices and patient mortality generally. The extent and sophistication of appraisal in the hospitals was particularly strongly related, but there were links too with the sophistication of training for staff, and also with the percentages of staff working in teams

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of breast cancer
Globally, a wide range of epidemiological studies have linked low levels of sunlight, ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH), with increased risk of breast cancer. Three studies of different design were employed to assess the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk. The first study is an ecological analysis of the relationship between UVB irradiance and age-standardized breast cancer mortality rates worldwide. In the regression model, UVB irradiance was inversely associated with mortality rates (p = 0.04), after controlling for covariates. The overall model was statistically significant (R² = 0.34, p < 0.0001). The second study was a case-control analysis of 600 incident cases of female breast cancer and their matched controls that investigated the inverse association between pre-diagnostic serum levels of 25(OH)D and risk of breast cancer in active-duty U.S. military personnel. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk, while controlling for race and age. In this study, there was an inverse trend between serum 25(OH)D and odds of breast cancer that did not reach statistical significance. However, in 123 pairs for whom serum was collected 90 days or fewer before case diagnosis, women in the highest quintile of serum 25(OH)D had a 70% lower estimated risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.74, p <̲ 0.01) compared to those in the lowest quintile. The third study was a pooled analysis of published data from 11 ordinary and nested case-control studies. Data from all 11 studies were combined in order to calculate the pooled odds ratio of the highest vs lowest quintile of 25(OH)D. The pooled odds ratio summarizing the estimated risk in the highest compared to the lowest quintile across all studies was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47, 0.80). These three studies provide compelling evidence that supports a strong inverse relationship between vitamin D status and breast cancer risk. More studies, including randomized controlled trials of higher doses of vitamin D₃ (4,000 IU - 6,000 IU/ day), and serum levels of 25(OH)D (60-80 ng/ml), should be performed without delay

Pegfilgrastim prophylaxis is associated with a lower risk of hospitalization of cancer patients than filgrastim prophylaxis: a retrospective United States claims analysis of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF)
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Myelosuppressive chemotherapy can lead to dose-limiting febrile neutropenia. Prophylactic use of recombinant human G-CSF such as daily filgrastim and once-per-cycle pegfilgrastim may reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia. This comparative study examined the effect of pegfilgrastim versus daily filgrastim on the risk of hospitalization.
				
				
					
						Methods
					This retrospective United States claims analysis utilized 2004&#8211;2009 data for filgrastim- and pegfilgrastim-treated patients receiving chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL) or breast, lung, ovarian, or colorectal cancers. Cycles in which pegfilgrastim or filgrastim was administered within 5 days from initiation of chemotherapy (considered to represent prophylaxis) were pooled for analysis. Neutropenia-related hospitalization and other healthcare encounters were defined with a &#8220;narrow&#8221; criterion for claims with an ICD-9 code for neutropenia and with a &#8220;broad&#8221; criterion for claims with an ICD-9 code for neutropenia, fever, or infection. Odds ratios (OR) for hospitalization and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) models and adjusted for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics. Per-cycle healthcare utilization and costs were examined for cycles with pegfilgrastim or filgrastim prophylaxis.
				
				
					
						Results
					We identified 3,535 patients receiving G-CSF prophylaxis, representing 12,056 chemotherapy cycles (11,683 pegfilgrastim, 373 filgrastim). The mean duration of filgrastim prophylaxis in the sample was 4.8 days. The mean duration of pegfilgrastim prophylaxis in the sample was 1.0 day, consistent with the recommended dosage of pegfilgrastim - a single injection once per chemotherapy cycle. Cycles with prophylactic pegfilgrastim were associated with a decreased risk of neutropenia-related hospitalization (narrow definition: OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.43, 95% CI: 0.16&#8211;1.13; broad definition: OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.38, 95% CI: 0.24&#8211;0.59) and all-cause hospitalization (OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.50, 95% CI: 0.35&#8211;0.72) versus cycles with prophylactic filgrastim. For neutropenia-related utilization by setting of care, there were more ambulatory visits and hospitalizations per cycle associated with filgrastim prophylaxis than with pegfilgrastim prophylaxis. Mean per-cycle neutropenia-related costs were also higher with prophylactic filgrastim than with prophylactic pegfilgrastim.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					In this comparative effectiveness study, pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of neutropenia-related or all-cause hospitalization relative to filgrastim prophylaxis.

Sample-Specific Cancer Pathway Analysis Using PARADIGM
Identifying key somatic alterations in cancer is a critical step in understanding the mechanisms that ultimately determine a patient's treatment outcome. High-throughput data are providing a comprehensive view of these molecular changes for individual samples, and new technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of genome copy number variations, gene expression, DNA methylation, and epigenetics of patient tumor samples and established cancer cell lines. Analyses of current datasets find that genetic alterations between tumors can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. This work presents a novel method called PARADIGM for inferring tumor-specific genetic pathway activities incorporating curated gene-pathway interactions. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of itself and its upstream and downstream products, allowing the incorporation of many types of -omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a given pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions, or high-level outputs) are altered in the tumor sample using probabilistic inference. Compared to a competing pathway activity inference approaches, PARADIGM identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives, as shown in glioblastoma multiform (GBM), ovarian (OV) and breast cancer datasets. PARADIGM also identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the GBM and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Furthermore, grouping GBM and OV patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. Further analysis was done using an integrated pathway termed the SuperPathway that gives a more consistent global view of biology, illustrated through the analysis of ovarian, breast, and cross-cancer analysis. Finally, PARADIGM was used to simulated knockdowns in a pathway model as an approach to understand drug effects and provide a rational approach towards combination therapies. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be personalized and chosen to hit target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed cancer pathway(s) of specific patients using this model.

Evaluating the Predictive Validity of DIBELS Literacy Measures with Third Grade Spanish-Speaking English Language Learners
This study examines the predictive validity of literacy measures from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) for Spanish-speaking English language learners (ELs). Third grade EL students were screened three times during the year with DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency (DORF) and Daze. Predictive validity of the scores was examined in relation to the spring administration of the California Standards Test (CST). Data were analyzed for the entire sample as well as disaggregated by English language proficiency level. Overall results revealed that the DORF was a better predictor of CST performance than the Daze across fall, winter, and spring screenings. Although Daze was a significant predictor when examined individually, results of hierarchical regression models indicated that once DORF was accounted for, Daze did not explain significant additional variance. The contribution of each fluency measure over and above the predictability of the previous year's CST score was also examined. Results indicated that both DORF and Daze accounted for significant additional variance, however, the amount was minimal. When considering English language proficiency level, findings indicated there was not a statistically significant difference in the predictive validity of the DORF or the Daze administered in the fall to CST performance in the spring for students of varying EL level. Predictive accuracy of the DORF and Daze was also examined for each EL group, which indicated a need for additional examination of the current DIBELS cut scores when applied to this group of students. Results from this study contribute to the research suggesting that although there is potential for the use of DIBELS measures to screen Spanish-speaking ELs, further research should be conducted.

The Unwilling Orphan:  Trauma and the Decaying Bourgeoisie in Los soles truncos
In “The Unwilling Orphan:  Trauma and the Decaying Bourgeoisie in Los soles truncos,” I argue that traumatized orphans participate in their own alienation because they eschew societal transformations that weaken the colonial class status that they covet.  That is, they further fragment society since they elect precisely not to belong. René Marqués’s Los soles truncos (1958) utilizes traumatized orphans of the decaying bourgeoisie to criticize what the author perceives to be an oppressive U.S. regime in Puerto Rico.  Herein I question Valérie Loichot’s notion that orphans create their own narratives because of their lack of genealogical roots.  Because of trauma, the orphan protagonists in Los soles truncos adhere to a master narrative by favoring an outdated colonial mindset.  Afraid to relinquish their privilege, the criollo protagonists cannot promote racial equality and economic betterment for Afro-Puerto Ricans which exposes the folly of “oneness” in Puerto Rico.  In that vein, Marqués’s orphans function as metaphorical bridges between cultural and personal trauma to engage the reader on an empathetic individual level that expands to a societal level in which solely the bourgeoisie is victimized despite their history as aggressors.  By making the trauma exclusive to one class and race, hatred spreads towards other sectors which results in disjointed sectors sharing an island, but in isolation of one another.

Emergency Physicians’ Adherence to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Guidance During the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 Pandemic
Introduction: Little is known regarding compliance with management guidelines for epidemic influenza in adult emergency department (ED) settings during the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, especially in relation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance. 
      
         Methods: We investigated all patients with a clinical diagnosis of influenza at an inner-city tertiary academic adult ED with an annual census of approximately 60,000 visits from May 2008 to December 2009. We aimed to determine patterns of presentation and management for adult patients with an ED diagnosis of influenza during the H1N1 pandemic, using seasonal influenza (pre-H1N1) as reference and to determine the ED provider’s adherence to American College of Emergency Physicians and CDC guidance during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Adherence to key elements of CDC 2009 H1N1 guidance was defined as (1) the proportion of admitted patients who were recommended to receive testing or treatment who actually received testing for influenza or treatment with antivirals; and (2) the proportion of high-risk patients who were supposed to be treated who actually were treated with antivirals. 
      
         Results: Among 339 patients with clinically diagnosed influenza, 88% occurred during the H1N1 pandemic. Patients were similarly managed during both phases. Median length of visit (pre-H1N1: 385 min, H1N1: 355 min, P > 0.05) and admission rates (pre-H1N1: 8%, H1N1: 11%, P > 0.05) were similar between the 2 groups. 28% of patients in the pre-H1N1 group and 16% of patients in the H1N1 group were prescribed antibiotics during their ED visits (P > 0.05). There were 34 admitted patients during the pandemic;, 30 (88%) of them received influenza testing in the ED, and 22 (65%) were prescribed antivirals in the ED. Noticeably, 19 (56%) of the 34 admitted patients, including 6 with a positive influenza test, received antibiotic treatment during their ED stay. 
      
         Conclusion: During the recent H1N1 pandemic, most admitted patients received ED diagnostic testing corresponding to the current recommended guidance. Antibiotic treatment for ED patients admitted with suspected influenza is not uncommon. However, less than 70% of admitted patients and less than 50% of high-risk patients were treated with antivirals during their ED visit, indicating a specific call for closer adherence to guidelines in future influenza pandemics.

The Evaluation and Implications of the Diabetes Pilot Study in Los Angeles County Community Based Clinics Participating in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Program
This study seeks to evaluate which reimbursement methodologies (capitation vs. fee-for-service) promoted better care management and health outcomes, as well as more cost-effective resource utilization in the care of non-institutionalized, acutely ill, diabetic patients enrolled in 20 community health centers participating in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) program in Los Angeles County, California. 	Participating community health centers were randomly assigned to capitated intervention group (n = 10) or traditional FFS payment control group (n = 10).  The capitated and FFS groups received $470 per patient per quarter and $94 per visit, respectively. Patients were risk stratified and clinic visits were documented over 10 months. 	Patient health data was obtained by trained healthcare providers at each clinic through electronic data registries while billing data was acquired from email communication.  OSHPD 2006 annual utilization data was available online.  Chronic Care Model Assessment (CCMA) scores, which are structural measures of quality, were self-assessed and reported by the clinics using the CCMA tool.  Results from provider interviews and patient satisfaction and knowledge surveys were also described in this report.       Select health outcome measures (HbA1c, LDL, and blood pressure) were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 to assess improvements in patient care and health.  Evaluation of the equivalence between treatment groups utilized t-test to compare means and z-scores to compare proportions.        Study groups' median CCMA scores did not differ significantly although the intervention clinics reported better CCMA scores in October of 2007 and this difference approached statistical significance (p = 0.0562).  There was no evidence of harmful health effects to enrolling patients in capitated group clinics, at least under the conditions prevailing in this pilot study.       Patients in both groups appeared comparably satisfied with different dimensions of their care.  However, intervention group patients showed markedly higher level of satisfaction in the time clinics took to return their phone calls and in their ability to schedule medical appointments for their diabetes when they needed one.      In terms of knowledge, patients from both study groups did not show marked difference except that more patients in the intervention group knew what their HbA1c level should be.

[patient, satisfaction, provider]

How Accurately Can Emergency Department Providers Estimate Patient Satisfaction?
Introduction: Patient satisfaction is an important measure of emergency department (ED) quality of care. Little is known about providers’ ability to estimate patient satisfaction. We aimed to measure providers’ ability to assess patient satisfaction and hypothesized that providers could accurately estimate overall patient satisfaction.
      Methods: We surveyed ED patients regarding satisfaction with their care. Treating providers completed analogous surveys, estimating patients’ responses. Sexual assault victims and non-English-speaking or severely ill patients were excluded. Satisfaction responses were categorized as ‘‘satisfied’’ or ‘‘not satisfied.’’ Patient satisfaction scores were considered the ‘‘gold standard,’’ and providers’ perceptions of the patient satisfaction were considered tests. Measures of diagnosticaccuracy, such as positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity, were used to assess how accurately the provider could estimate his or her patient’s satisfaction.
      Results: Here, 242/457 eligible patients (53%) completed the survey; 227 providers (94%) completed a corresponding survey. Subject-reported overall satisfaction was 96.6%, compared with a provider estimated rate of 94.4%. The sensitivity and PPV of the provider’s estimate of the patient’s satisfaction were 95.2 (95% confidence interval CI 91.4, 97.7) and 97.5 (95% CI 94.4, 99.2), respectively, for overall patient satisfaction. The PPV was similar for clarity of communication. The PPV was 78.9 for perceived length of ED stay (99% CI 70.8, 85.6) and 82.6 for quality of pain control (95% CI 68.6, 92.2). Accuracy of attending and resident estimates of patient satisfaction did not differ significantly. The agreement between patient-reported and provider-estimated patient satisfaction was not associated with age, gender, patient disposition, or ED divert status.
      Conclusion: Providers are able to assess overall patient satisfaction and clarity of communication with a high accuracy. Physician estimates of pain control and perceived length of stay have a moderate accuracy. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):351–357.

Influence of HTLV-1 on the clinical, microbiologic and immunologic presentation of tuberculosis
AbstractBackgroundHTLV-1 is associated with increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and severity of tuberculosis. Although previous studies have shown that HTLV-1 infected individuals have a low frequency of positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and decreasing in lymphoproliferative responses compared to HTLV-1 uninfected persons, these studies were not performed in individuals with history of tuberculosis or evidence of M. tuberculosis infection. Therefore the reasons why HTLV-1 infection increases susceptibility to infection and severity of tuberculosis are not understood.The aim of this study was to evaluate how HTLV-1 may influence the clinical, bacteriologic and immunologic presentation of tuberculosis.MethodsThe study prospectively enrolled and followed 13 new cases of tuberculosis associated with HTLV-1 (cases) and 25 patients with tuberculosis without HTLV-1 infection (controls). Clinical findings, bacterial load in the sputum, x-rays, immunological response and death were compared in the two groups.ResultsThere were no differences in the demographic, clinical and TST response between the two study groups. IFN-&#947; and TNF-&#945; production was higher in unstimulated cultures of mononuclear cells of case than in control patients (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01). While there was no difference in IFN-&#947; production in PPD stimulated cultures, TNF-&#945; levels were lower in cases than in controls (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01). There was no difference in the bacterial load among the groups but sputum smear microscopy results became negative faster in cases than in controls. Death only occurred in two co-infected patients.ConclusionWhile the increased susceptibility for tuberculosis infection in HTLV-1 infected subjects may be related to impairment in TNF-&#945; production, the severity of tuberculosis in co-infected patients may be due to the enhancement of the Th1 inflammatory response, rather than in their decreased ability to control bacterial growth.

Current Trends in the Management of Difficult Urinary Catheterizations
Routine urinary catheter placement may cause trauma and poses a risk of infection. Male catheterization, in particular, can be difficult, especially in patients with enlarged prostate glands orother potentially obstructive conditions in the lower urinary tract. Solutions to problematic urinary catheterization are not well known and when difficult catheterization occurs, the risk of failedcatheterization and concomitant complications increase. Repeated and unsuccessful attempts aturinary catheterization induce stress and pain for the patient, injury to the urethra, potential urethralstricture requiring surgical reconstruction, and problematic subsequent catheterization. Improperinsertion of catheters also can significantly increase healthcare costs due to added days ofhospitalization, increased interventions, and increased complexity of follow-up evaluations. Improved techniques for catheter placement are essential for all healthcare personnel involved in themanagement of the patient with acute urinary retention, including attending emergency physicians whooften are the first physicians to encounter such patients. Best practice methods for blind catheter placement are summarized in this review. In addition, for progressive clinical practice, an algorithm forthe management of difficult urinary catheterizations that incorporates technology enabling directvisualization of the urethra during catheter insertion is presented. This algorithm will aid healthcare personnel in decision making and has the potential to improve quality of care of patients. West J EmergMed. 2012;13(6):472–478.

Selecting renal replacement therapies: what do African American and non-African American patients and their families think others should know? A mixed methods study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Little is known regarding the types of information African American and non-African American patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their families need to inform renal replacement therapy (RRT) decisions.
				
				
					
						Methods
					In 20 structured group interviews, we elicited views of African American and non-African American patients with CKD and their families about factors that should be addressed in educational materials informing patients&#8217; RRT selection decisions. We asked participants to select factors from a list and obtained their open-ended feedback.
				
				
					
						Results
					Ten groups of patients (5 African American, 5 non-African American; total 68 individuals) and ten groups of family members (5 African American, 5 non-African American; total 62 individuals) participated. Patients and families had a range (none to extensive) of experiences with various RRTs. Patients identified morbidity or mortality, autonomy, treatment delivery, and symptoms as important factors to address. Family members identified similar factors but also cited the effects of RRT decisions on patients&#8217; psychological well-being and finances. Views of African American and non-African American participants were largely similar.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Educational resources addressing the influence of RRT selection on patients&#8217; morbidity and mortality, autonomy, treatment delivery, and symptoms could help patients and their families select RRT options closely aligned with their values. Including information about the influence of RRT selection on patients&#8217; personal relationships and finances could enhance resources&#8217; cultural relevance for African Americans.

The urban neighborhood, depressive symptoms, and age: stress and psychosocial resources
Background: Existing research shows that residents exposed to neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage (NSD) have a relatively high risk of some types of mental illness. This study investigated whether this pattern is present for depressive symptoms among persons in late middle age to extreme old age, and if so why.  Investigated factors include: stressors (neighborhood physical disorder and financial strain) and psychosocial resources (mastery, social support, and religious service attendance). Age differences were examined.  Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from the 2006 and 2008 Health and Retirement Study Psychosocial Supplemental Assessment. The analytic sample included 8,623 adults aged 52 to 104, residing in 3216 urban neighborhoods (census tracts). NSD was operationalized with a principal component of Census tract indicators (education, poverty, public assistance, and unemployment). Depressive symptoms were measured by an 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Hierarchical linear regression estimated multilevel models. Results: NSD was positively associated with depressive symptoms, net of individual-level demographic characteristics used to control for selection. Exposure to stressors partially explained the association; while psychosocial resources suppressed it.  A significant, curvilinear cross-level interaction with age was found: NSD is positively associated with symptoms among those under 64, but has little effect among persons 65 to 74 year, and is negative at older ages.Conclusion:The mental health disparity for depressive symptoms in NSD is partially due to greater exposure to stressors and fewer resources to counteract this exposure.  The counter-intuitive inverse association among the oldest adults warrants further investigation.

FORGING PSYCHIATRIC CATEGORIES: A Philosophical Examination of the Creation and Stabilization of Diagnostic  Knowledge
This dissertation explores the entanglement of ethics and epistemology in the domain of psychiatric research, considering the ways that measurement practices and ethical values interrelate.  If psychiatric clinicians, researchers, and patients are not acutely aware of the relationship between experimental configurations and the meaning of scientific data, unhealthy realities that take psychiatric constructs as fixed parts of nature will persist.The core of this work consists of case studies on the emergence and stabilization of two psychiatric diagnostic categories, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).  Carefully examining the experimental configurations employed in the measurement of psychiatric disorders, this study shows how the neurobiological description of a psychiatric disorder is produced by employing a broad array of measurement techniques including psychopharmacological interventions, neuropsychological assessments, self-rating scales, historical studies, behavioral observations, psychophysical apparatuses, brain scanning devices, guided interviews etc.  The dependence of each of these techniques upon others demonstrates the highly contingent status of diagnostic categories.	The findings of this study include the claim that the current best-confirmed neurobiological description of ADHD, the catecholamine hypothesis, could not have been developed without the treatment and measurement of the disorder with psychostimulant medications.  This observation and others suggest that the knowledge produced regarding psychiatric diagnostic categories needs to be carefully examined to avoid treatment plans that implement research data that is not well understood.  I conclude that researchers, clinicians and patients are responsible for the data produced in scientific studies, and should therefore take a critical stance to conclusions drawn from scientific data when making decisions about treatment.

Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Migration to the Heart Diagnosed by Emergency Department Ultrasound
A 57-year-old man presented to our emergency department with altered mental status. He had a past medical history significant for cirrhosis and previous placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). On cardiac auscultation, a new heart murmur and an unexpected degree of cardiac ectopy were noted. On the 12-lead electrocardiogram, the patient was noted to have multiple premature atrial contractions, corroborating the irregular heart rhythm on physicalexam. A focused bedside emergency ultrasound of the heart was then performed. This exam revealed an apparent foreign body in the right atrium. It appeared as if the patient’s TIPS had migrated from the heart into the right atrium. This case, as well as the literature describing thisunusual complication of TIPS placement, is reviewed in this case report. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(6):525-526

Clinician-performed Beside Ultrasound for the Diagnosis of Traumatic Pneumothorax
Introduction: Prior studies have reported conflicting results regarding the utility of ultrasound in the diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax (PTX) because they have used sonologists with extensive experience. This study evaluates the characteristics of ultrasound for PTX for a large cohort of trauma and emergency physicians. 
      
          
       
      
         Methods: This was a prospective, observational study on a convenience sample of patients presenting to a trauma center who had a thoracic ultrasound (TUS) evaluation for PTX performed after the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma exam. Sonologists recorded their findings prior to any other diagnostic studies. The results of TUS were compared to one or more of the following: chest computed tomography, escape of air on chest tube insertion, or supine chest radiography followed by clinical observation. 
      
          
       
      
         Results: There were 549 patients enrolled. The median injury severity score of the patients was 5 (inter-quartile range IQR 1-14); 36 different sonologists performed TUS. Forty-seven of the 549 patients had traumatic PTX, for an incidence of 9%. TUS correctly identified 27/47 patients with PTX for a sensitivity of 57% (confidence interval CI 42-72%). There were 3 false positive cases of TUS for a specificity of 99% (CI 98%-100%). A “wet” chest radiograph reading done in the trauma bay showed a sensitivity of 40% (CI 23-59) and a specificity of 100% (99-100). 
      
          
       
      
         Conclusion: In a large heterogenous group of clinicians who typically care for trauma patients, the sonographic evaluation for pneumothorax was as accurate as supine chest radiography. Thoracic ultrasound may be helpful in the initial evaluation of patients with truncal trauma. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):103-108.

Legionella pneumophila infection presenting as headache, confusion and dysarthria in a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) positive patient: case report
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					
						Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Central nervous system dysfunction is common, and diagnosis in the absence of pulmonary symptoms can be challenging. Here we describe an atypical clinical presentation of Legionella infection in a patient with HIV who was found to have an unusual neuroradiologic lesion that further served to obscure the diagnosis. This is the first such description in a patient with Legionellosis and HIV coinfection.
				
				
					
						Case presentation
					
					A 43&#8201;year-old HIV positive man presented to our hospital with dysarthria, fevers, headache, and altered mental status. Initial work-up revealed pneumonia and a lesion of the splenium of the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging. He was subsequently diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia and treated with complete symptom resolution.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Neurologic abnormalities are frequent in Legionellosis, but the diagnosis may be difficult in the absence of overt respiratory symptoms and in the presence of HIV coinfection. A high index of suspicion and early initiation of empiric antibiotics is imperative since early treatment may help prevent long-term sequelae. Neuroimaging abnormalities, though rare, can help the physician narrow down the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary invasive testing. Future studies should aim to elucidate the as yet unknown role of neuroimaging in the diagnoses and prognostication of Legionellosis, as well as the interaction between Legionella infection and HIV.

The Contributions of Prior Trauma and Peritraumatic Dissociation to Predicting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Outcome in Individuals Assessed in the Immediate Aftermath of a Trauma
Objective: This study analyzed predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in civilian trauma victims to assess how peritraumatic dissociation (PD) relates to PTSD symptom development. We examined PD and PTSD symptoms from a prior trauma simultaneously to better understand the extent towhich past and current reactions to a trauma can predict the development of PTSD for a current trauma.
      Methods: Participants (N¼48) were recruited from the emergency department (ED) of a large, southeastern hospital and assessed immediately after a trauma and again at 4 weeks and 12 weekspost-trauma. We used both self-report and interviewer-based questionnaires to assess PD and PTSD symptoms for prior and current trauma.
      Results: A hierarchical linear regression revealed that at 4-week follow up, when controlling for several demographic variables and trauma type, a model including both PD and PTSD symptoms from a prior trauma significantly predicted PTSD outcome (F(47)¼3.70, p¼0.00), with PD and prior PTSD symptoms significantly contributing 17% and 9% of variance respectively. At 12 weeks, PTSD symptoms from prior trauma (b¼0.094, p¼0.538) and PD (b¼0.017, p¼0.909) did not account for a significant proportion of the variance in PTSD for the enrolling trauma.
      Conclusion: Prior and current reactions to trauma are both important factors in predicting the development of PTSD symptoms to a current trauma. The more immediate measurement of PD during presentation to the ED may explain the strength of its relationship to PTSD symptom development.Furthermore, our findings support the use of PTSD symptoms of a past trauma, as opposed to trauma frequency, as a predictor of PTSD from a subsequent trauma. Methodological limitations and future directions are discussed. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(3):220–224.

SnoN facilitates axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury
Functional recovery after spinal cord injury requires axons to overcome inhibitory factors, grow beyond the lesion site, and synapse on the appropriate target. We investigated whether developmental pathways necessary for axon differentiation and growth persist in the mature nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that manipulations of developmentally important neuronal TGF- beta signaling would affect adult axonal regeneration following injury. We found that, in contrast to development, TGF-beta inhibits growth of adult neurons and over-expression of SnoN, a developmentally regulated transcription factor that inhibits TGF-beta signaling, rescues adult neurons from TGF-beta induced inhibition. More importantly, SnoN over-expression in sensory neurons was sufficient to enhance axon regeneration into a cell graft placed in the lesion cavity in an in vivo model of spinal cord injury

A cross-sectional study of knowledge of sex partner serostatus among high-risk Peruvian men who have sex with men and transgender women: implications for HIV prevention
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Knowledge of a sex partner&#8217;s HIV serostatus can influence sexual behavior and inform harm-reduction strategies. We sought to determine how often Peruvian men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) knew the HIV serostatus of their sex partners, if this knowledge was associated with any predictive factors or unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), and if UAI was associated with partner serostatus.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We analyzed data from the 2008 Peruvian MSM Sentinel Surveillance Survey. Data were collected by CASI about each participant&#8217;s three most recent male sex partners. Primary outcome was knowledge of a partner's HIV test result. Multivariate analysis assessed the effect of age, education, sexual identity, number of male partners, alcohol use during intercourse, type of partnership and length of partnership using logistic regression.
				
				
					
						Results
					735 participants provided data on 1,643 of their most recent sex partners from the last 3 months. 179/735 (24.4%) of all participants knew HIV test results for at least one of their 3 most recent partners, corresponding to 230/1643 (14.0%) of all sexual partnerships in the last 3 months. In multivariate analysis, casual (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.42) and exchange sex (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.11-0.88) partners, compared to stable partners, were negatively associated with knowledge of partner serostatus, whereas relationships lasting longer than one night (&lt;3 months OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.39-3.51; 3 months to 1 year OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.80-5.01; &#8805; 1 year OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.40-7.10) were positively associated with knowledge of partner serostatus. Knowledge of partner serostatus was not associated with unprotected anal intercourse with that partner.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Few MSM and TW in Peru know their partners&#8217; HIV serostatus. Our findings suggest that the type and length of partnership influence the likelihood of knowing a partner&#8217;s serostatus. Further research should explore the contexts and practices of partner communication, their effect on sexual behavior, and interventions to promote discussion of HIV testing and serostatus as an HIV prevention strategy in this population.

Automated Detection and Differential Diagnosis of Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma Cell Types Using Label-free Molecular Vibrational Imaging
Lung carcinoma is the most prevalent type of cancer in the world, considered to be a relentlessly progressive disease, with dismal mortality rates to patients. Recent advances in targeted therapy hold the premise for the delivery of better, more effective treatments to lung cancer patients, that could significantly enhance their survival rates. Optimizing care delivery through targeted therapies requires the ability to effectively identify and diagnose lung cancer along with identifying the lung cancer cell type specific to each patient, \textit{small cell carcinoma}, \textit{adenocarcinoma}, or \textit{squamous cell carcinoma}.  Label free optical imaging techniques such as the \textit{Coherent anti-stokes Raman Scattering microscopy} have the potential to provide physicians with minimally invasive access to lung tumor sites, and thus allow for better cancer diagnosis and sub-typing. To maximize the benefits of such novel imaging techniques in enhancing cancer treatment, the development of new data analysis methods that can rapidly and accurately analyze the new types of data provided through them is essential. Recent studies have gone a long way to achieving those goals but still face some significant bottlenecks hindering the ability to fully exploit the diagnostic potential of CARS images, namely, the streamlining of the diagnosis process was hindered by the lack of ability to automatically detect cancer cells, and the inability to reliably classify them into their respective cell types. More specifically, data analysis methods have thus far been incapable of correctly identifying and differentiating the different non-small cel lung carcinoma cell types, a stringent requirement for optimal therapy delivery. In this study we have addressed the two bottlenecks named above, through designing an image processing framework that  is capable of, automatically and accuratly, detecting cancer cells in two and three dimensional CARS images. Moreover, we built upon this capability with a new approach at analyzing the segmented data, that provided significant information about the cancerous tissue and ultimately allowed for the automatic differential classification of non-small cell lung carcinoma cell types, with superb accuracies.

Education On Prehospital Pain Management: A Follow Up Study
Introduction: The most common reason patients seek medical attention is pain. However, there may be significant delays in initiating prehospital pain therapy. In a 2001 quality improvement (QI) study, we demonstrated improvement in paramedic knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain. This follow-up study examines the impact of this QI program, repeated educational intervention (EI), and effectiveness of a new pain management standard operating procedure. 
      
         Methods: 176 paramedics from 10 urban and suburban fire departments and two private ambulance services participated in a 3-hour EI. A survey was performed prior to the EI and repeated one month after the EI. We reviewed emergency medical services (EMS) runs with pain complaints prior to the EI and one month after the EI. Follow-up results were compared to our prior study. We performed data analysis using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests. 
      
         Results: The authors reviewed 352 surveys and 438 EMS runs with pain complaints. Using the same survey questions, even before the EI, 2007 paramedics demonstrated significant improvement in the knowledge (18.2%; 95% CI 8.9%, 27.9%), perceptions (9.2%; 95% CI 6.5%, 11.9%), and management of pain (13.8%; 95% CI 11.3%, 16.2%) compared to 2001. Following EI in 2007, there were no significant improvements in the baseline knowledge (0%; 95% CI 5.3%, 5.3%) but significant improvements in the perceptions of pain principles (6.4%; 95% CI 3.9%, 9.0%) and the management of pain (14.7%; 95% CI 11.4%, 18.0%). 
      
         Conclusion: In this follow up study, paramedics’ baseline knowledge, perceptions, and management of pain have all improved from 6 years ago. Following a repeat educational intervention, paramedics further improved their field management of pain suggesting paramedics will still benefit from both initial and also ongoing continuing education on the topic of pain management.

A Summary of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to Steroid 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency
Abstract
            
            Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for about 95% of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Newborns are currently being screened for the classical forms of this disease throughout the United States and in 12 other countries. As such, it seems important to develop the best practice guidelines for treating not only infants and children, but affected adults as well. This report gives a brief overview of the most recent expert opinion and clinical practice guidelines for CAH as formulated by The Endocrine Society Task Force.

Sedation-assisted Orthopedic Reduction in Emergency Medicine: The Safety and Success of a One Physician/One Nurse Model
Introduction: Much of the emergency medical research on sedation-assisted orthopedic reductions has been undertaken with two physicians—one dedicated to the sedation and one to the procedure. Clinical practice in community emergency departments (EDs), however, often involves only one physician, who both performs the procedure and simultaneously oversees the crendentialed registered nurse who administers the sedation medication and monitors the patient. Although the dual-physician model is advocated by some, evidence in support of its superiority is lacking. Methods: In this electronic health records review we describe sedation-assisted closed reductions of major joints and forearm fractures in three suburban community EDs. The type of procedure and sedation medication, need for specialty assistance, success rates, and intervention-requiring adverse events are reported. Results: During the 18-month study period, procedural sedation was performed 457 times on 442 patients undergoing closed reduction for shoulder dislocations (n=111), elbow dislocations (n=29), hip dislocations (n=101), and forearm fractures (n=201).  In the vast majority of this cohort (98.4% 435/442), a single emergency physician simultaneously managed both the procedural sedation and the initial orthopedic reduction without the assistance of a second physician. The reduction was successful or satisfactory in 96.6% (425/435; 95% confidence interval CI, 95.8-98.8%) of these cases, with a low incidence of intervention-requiring adverse events (2.8% 12/435; 95% CI, 1.5-4.8%).Conclusion: Sedation-assisted closed reduction of major joint dislocations and forearm fractures can be performed effectively and safely in the ED using a one physician/one nurse model. A policy that requires a separate physician (or nurse anesthetist) to administer medications for all sedation-assisted ED procedures appears unwarranted. Further research is needed to determine which specific clinical scenarios might benefit from a dual-physician approach. West J Emerg Med.2013;14(1):47-54.

Intramedullary Spinal Neurocysticercosis Presenting as Brown-Sequard Syndrome
Cysticercosis is an emerging disease in the United States. Neurocysticercosis may rarely cause disease within the spinal cord, but the occurrence of such pathology can produce debilitating symptoms for patients. We present the second report in the literature of intramedullary spinal neurocysticercosis presenting with a Brown-Sequard syndrome. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):434–436.

Financial Implications for Physicians Accepting  Higher Level of Care Transfers
Introduction: Higher-level-of-care (HLOC) transfers to tertiary care hospitals are common. While this has been shown profitable for hospitals, the impact on physicians has not been described. Community medical center call panels continue to erode, in part due to the perception that patients needing transfer are underinsured. Surveys show that the problematic specialties to maintain call panels in community hospitals are neurosurgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, orthopedics and ophthalmology. This places greater stress on tertiary care hospitals’ physicians. The objective of this study is to describe the financial consequences to physicians who care for HLOC transfers across specialties and compare these with all patients from each specialty and specialty-specific national reimbursement benchmarks.
      Methods: Financial data were obtained for all HLOC transfers to a single tertiary care center from January 2007 through March 2008. Work relative value unit (RVU) and reimbursement were taken from a centralized professional fee billing office. National benchmarks for reimbursement per RVU were calculated from the 2006 Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) Compensation and Production Survey.
      Results: In this period 570 patients were transferred, 319 (55.9%) through the emergency department (ED). Reimbursement per RVU varied from a high of $74.93 for neurosurgery to $25.91 for family medicine. Reimbursement to emergency medicine (EM) for HLOC patients was 16% above the average reimbursement per RVU for all ED patients ($50.5 vs. $43.7). Similarly, neurosurgery reimbursement per RVU was 22% above the reimbursement per RVU for all patients ($74.93 vs. $61.27). The remainder of specialties was reimbursed less ($25.91 vs $69.60) per RVU for HLOC patients than for all of their patients at this center. All specialties at this site were reimbursed less for each HLOC patient than national average reimbursement for all patients in each specialty.
      Conclusion: Average professional fee reimbursement for HLOC patients was higher for EM and neurosurgery than for all other patients in these specialties at this site, but lower for the rest of the specialties. Compared to the national benchmarks, this site had an overall lower reimbursement per RVU for all specialties, reflecting a poorer patient mix. At this site HLOC transfers patients are financially advantageous for EM and neurosurgery. West J Emerg Med.

The Health and Social Implications of Stigmatization for Individuals with Concealable Stigmas: Using Survey and Experimental Methods to Build Theory
Two distinct studies investigated the effects of stigmatization and coping on health and social outcomes for individuals with concealable stigmas. Study 1 investigated rape in South Africa. Specifically, it examined the effect of public stigma and self-stigma on PTSD and depressive symptoms, and the role of approach and avoidance coping as mediators of these relationships. A total of 173 women aged 17 to 50 who reported rape within the past 6 months were interviewed at two sites in the Limpopo and Northwest Province of South Africa. Results revealed that greater perceptions of self- and public stigma were related to higher levels of both PTSD and depressive symptoms. Greater coping through avoidance fully mediated the relationship between higher levels of public stigma and PTSD symptoms, and partially mediated the relationship between higher levels of self-stigma and PTSD symptoms. Approach coping was not significantly associated with either PTSD or depressive symptoms. These findings provide insight into the experiences and effects of stigma for this vulnerable population and have important implications for interventions aimed at improving post-assault recovery. Study 2 was a laboratory study on disclosing concealable stigmas. Disclosing a concealable stigma may benefit individuals by soliciting social support from others, but such disclosure may also engender prejudice and discrimination. One disclosure strategy that may increase the likelihood of receiving social support is the provision of emotional information. In the present study, participants heard a pre-recorded interview of a confederate disclosing either breast cancer or genital herpes and providing either (a) information about the stigmatized condition only, or (b) information about the stigmatized condition plus the associated emotional experience. Results revealed that in the information-only condition, disclosing genital herpes elicited greater rejection and less support compared to disclosing breast cancer. However, in the information plus emotion condition, disclosure of genital herpes received greater positivity, yielding no difference in support or rejection compared to disclosure of breast cancer. Analysis revealed that positive impressions of the target's personal characteristics (as more responsible, warm, etc.) mediated this effect for the genital herpes condition. In sum, emotional expression may decrease negative reactions to disclosure of stigmatized conditions.

Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of clinical practice guidelines: A cross-sectional survey among physicians in Estonia
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					In an era when an increasing amount of clinical information is available to health care professionals, the effective implementation of clinical practice guidelines requires the development of strategies to facilitate the use of these guidelines. The objective of this study was to assess attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines, as well as the barriers and facilitators to their use, among Estonian physicians. The study was conducted to inform the revision of the clinical practice guideline development process and can provide inspiration to other countries considering the increasing use of evidence-based medicine.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We conducted an online survey of physicians to assess resource, system, and attitudinal barriers. We also asked a set of questions related to improving the use of clinical practice guidelines and collected free-text comments. We hypothesized that attitudes concerning guidelines may differ by gender, years of experience and practice setting. The study population consisted of physicians from the database of the Department of Continuing Medical Education of the University of Tartu. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					41% (497/1212) of physicians in the database completed the questionnaire, comprising more than 10% of physicians in the country. Most respondents (79%) used treatment guidelines in their daily clinical practice. Lack of time was the barrier identified by the most physicians (42%), followed by lack of medical resources for implementation (32%). The majority of physicians disagreed with the statement that guidelines were not accessible (73%) or too complicated (70%). Physicians practicing in outpatient settings or for more than 25 years were the most likely to experience difficulties in guideline use. 95% of respondents agreed that an easy-to-find online database of guidelines would facilitate use.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Use of updated evidence-based guidelines is a prerequisite for the high-quality management of diseases, and recognizing the factors that affect guideline compliance makes it possible to work towards improving guideline adherence in clinical practice. In our study, physicians with long-term clinical experience and doctors in outpatient settings perceived more barriers, which should be taken into account when planning strategies in improving the use of guidelines. Informed by the results of the survey, leading health authorities are making an effort to develop specially designed interventions to implement clinical practice guidelines, including an easily accessible online database.

Punch Injuries: Insights into Intentional Closed Fist Injuries
Objectives: This study sought to investigate the patterns of injury resulting from a punch mechanism and to investigate the associated psychopathology present in patients with these injuries.
      Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with hand radiographs ordered from the emergency department allowed for identification of patients with a punch mechanism. We recorded injury patterns and queried patients’ medical records for associated psychopathology.
      Results: 1,292 patients underwent hand radiographs during a one-year time period; 172 patients (13%) were radiographed following an intentional punch injury, identifying 76 fractures in 70 patients. Males contributed a greater proportion of patients presenting with punch injury when compared to females (80% vs. 20%). Males were more likely to sustain fracture from a punch mechanism (48% vs. 11%, OR 7 95% CI 2.3-20.9), but were less likely to have preexisting documented psychiatric disease (23% vs. 49%, OR 3.1 95% CI 1.4-6.7). Of all fractures, 61% were to the fifth metacarpal, 21% were to the remainder of the metacarpals, and the remaining were fractures to phalanges and bones of the wrist.
      Conclusion: Women are less likely to presents with punch injury and are less likely to sustain a fracture when they do present but have more associated psychiatric disease. Both men and women presenting with punch injuries have a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease than the background incidence in the population as a whole. Although punch injuries result in a significant number of boxer fractures, a number of other injuries are associated with punch mechanisms. West J Emerg Med.

Imaging Structural Plasticity Of Synapses In The Brain
Synapses are the sites where neurons contact each other and exchange information in the brain.  Experience-dependent changes in synaptic connections are fundamental for numerous neurological processes, ranging from the development of neuronal circuitry to learning and memory.  Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites of the majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. The morphology and dynamics of dendritic spines change throughout the lifespan of animals, especially during early postnatal development and in response to novel experiences. Furthermore, abnormal spine morphology is a hallmark of various types of neuropathology.  For instance, Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by an abnormal increase in immature spines.  However, how learning behaviors affect neuronal connectivity and how the memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain, what molecular mechanisms regulate experience-dependent synaptic pruning during postnatal development, and how synaptic connections are altered during the progression of neuropathology remain unknown.  To investigate how long-lasting motor memory is structurally encoded in the intact brain, we train mice with novel motor skills and apply two-photon in vivo imaging to follow the dynamisms of dendritic spines in the corresponding motor cortex. We find that learning a new motor skill task leads to a rapid formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on the output pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex. Although selective elimination of spines that existed before training gradually returns the overall spine density back to the original level, the new spines induced during learning are preferentially stabilized during subsequent training and endure long after training stops.  Furthermore, we show that different motor skills are encoded by different sets of synapses.  Practice of novel, but not previously learned, tasks further promotes spinogenesis in adulthood.  Our findings, therefore, reveal rapid, but long-lasting, synaptic reorganization is closely associated with motor learning.  The data also suggest that stabilized neuronal connections are the foundation of durable motor memory.To explore molecular mechanisms underlying experience-dependent synaptic pruning during postnatal development, we investigate the elimination of dendritic spines in mice deficient of different cell adhesion molecules ephrin-As in vivo, and also examine the expression patterns of those molecules using array tomography. We find that elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines in various cortical regions is accelerated in ephrin-A2 knockout (KO) mice during adolescent development, resulting in fewer adolescent spines integrated into adult circuits. Sensory deprivation reduces spine elimination in the barrel cortex, and deprived wild-type and deprived KO mice exhibit comparable spine elimination. We also show that ephrin-A2 in the cortex colocalizes with glial glutamate transporters (GLAST and GLT-1), which are significantly down-regulated in ephrin-A2 KOs. Finally, we find that increased spine loss in ephrin-A2 KOs depends on activation of glutamate receptors, as blockade of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor by its antagonist MK801 eliminates the difference in spine loss between wild-type and ephrin-A2 KO mice. Together, our results suggest that ephrin-A2 signaling underlies experience-dependent, NMDA receptor-mediated synapse elimination during maturation of the mouse cortex.Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation.  This mental disorder is caused by transcriptional silence of a gene called fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1). It has been hypothesized that absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP, the protein product of FMR1) causes a defect in spine maturation and pruning, and such altered synaptic connectivity results in learning defects.  To test this hypothesis, we train both wild-type and FMR1 KO mice with motor learning tasks and follow the dynamics of dendritic spines at different age stages in vivo. We find that adult FMR1 KO mice fail to improve skilled motor performance, suggesting a defect in learning behaviors. We also show that layer V neurons do not prune dendritic spines during postnatal development in FMR1 KO mice, therefore, causing significantly higher spine density in adulthood. Moreover, while adult FMR1 KO mice have normal spine turnover, adolescent FMR1 KO mice exhibit elevated spine formation and stabilization, but normal spine removal. Additionally, abnormal spine dynamics in adolescent FMR1 KO mice are layer-specific, as dendritic spines on apical dendrites of layer II/III neurons display normal spine turnover. Finally, administration of mGluR antagonist MPEP rescues the defects of spine dynamics in adolescent FMR1 KO mice, providing a potential therapeutic target for FXS.

Physician job satisfaction as a public health issue
Abstract
				In Hirschman&#8217;s classic formulation, physicians can signal discontent with their conditions of work by &#8220;exiting&#8221; (leaving the profession or not entering it in the first place) or by giving &#8220;voice&#8221; to their concerns (e.g. complaining, protesting, bargaining collectively, or conducting work actions and strikes). This Commentary reviews the findings of a survey of Israeli neonatologists by Moshe et al. Survey respondents were satisfied with their careers but not with salary, patient care demands, and leisure time, a pattern that has been seen in other countries, particularly within &#8220;small, acute care specialties&#8221; (SACS). One question for policymakers is how to help physicians in SACS maintain work-life balance and avoid burnout while providing superb patient care. The Commentary considers several possible solutions while advocating for rigorous and comprehensive monitoring of physician satisfaction over time.

Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Migration to the Heart Diagnosed by Emergency Department Ultrasound
 A 57-year-old man presented to our emergency department with altered mental status. He had a past medical history significant for cirrhosis and previous placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). On cardiac auscultation, a new heart murmur and an unexpected degree of cardiac ectopy were noted. On the 12-lead electrocardiogram, the patient was noted to have multiple premature atrial contractions, corroborating the irregular heart rhythm on physical exam. A focused bedside emergency ultrasound of the heart was then performed. This exam revealed an apparent foreign body in the right atrium. It appeared as if the patient’s TIPS had migrated from the heart into the right atrium. This case, as well as the literature describing this unusual complication of TIPS placement, is reviewed in this case report. West J Emerg Med. 2012;00(0).

EphB2 signaling regulates lesion-induced axon sprouting but not critical period length in the postnatal auditory brainstem
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Studies of developmental plasticity may provide insight into plasticity during adulthood, when neural circuitry is less responsive to losses or changes in input. In the mammalian auditory brainstem, globular bushy cell axons of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) innervate the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) principal neurons. VCN axonal terminations in MNTB, known as calyces of Held, are very large and specialized for high-fidelity transmission of auditory information. Following unilateral deafferentation during postnatal development, VCN axons from the intact side form connections with novel targets, including the ipsilateral MNTB. EphB signaling has been shown to play a role in this process during the first postnatal week, but mechanisms involved in this reorganization during later developmental periods remain unknown.
				
				
					
						Results
					We found that EphB2 signaling reduces the number of induced ipsilateral projections to the MNTB after unilateral VCN removal at postnatal day seven (P7), but not after removal of the VCN on one side at P10, after the closure of the critical period for lesion-induced innervation of the ipsilateral MNTB.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Results from this study indicate that molecular mechanisms involved in the development of circuitry may also play a part in rewiring after deafferentation during development, but do not appear to regulate the length of critical periods for plasticity.

The Geographic Distribution, Genetic Structure and Cultural Management of <i>Waitea circinata</i> var. <i>circinata</i>, the Causal Agent of Brown Ring Patch
Waitea circinata var. circinata (Wcc), the causal agent of brown ring patch, is an emergent disease of turfgrass in the U. S. It causes serious problems on golf course putting greens by disrupting the uniformity and aesthetic value. Based on morphological and molecular data, we identified that Wcc has a broad host range and is present in multiple states across the U.S. Besides annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.), Wcc was also found as a pathogen on rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris). A new variety, W. circinata var. prodigus, was also reported in 2011 causing basal leaf blight of kikuyugrass in southern California. To demonstrate the distribution of Wcc in the U.S., ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer regions and 5.8S region (ITS) of 42 Wcc isolates collected from annual bluegrass obtained from nine States were sequenced. A total of 17 ITS haplotypes were observed and there was no obvious relationship between ITS haplotype and the geographic distribution of the isolates. This preliminary data showed that Wcc in the U.S. may be genetic diverse. To further demonstrate the genetic variation of Wcc and examine how Wcc exchange genes, a 3 year study was conducted at a golf course in San Diego, California. High genotypic diversity and few clonal genotypes were found among the 116 isolates collected from two putting greens. Results suggest that the pathogen may be sexually reproducing in the field and that inbreeding could account for the gametic disequilibrium detected. Before the above studies had been conducted, very little information about the epidemiology of brown ring patch was known.  The disease was confused with another turf disease called yellow patch that produced similar yellow rings on greens. Attempts to manage brown ring patch similar to yellow patch makes the disease more severe. There was also concern that using trinexapac-ethyl (TE), a commonly used plant growth regulator to control turfgrass height, might be increasing disease severity. Our study showed that three nitrogen sources (nitrate, ammonium and urea) decreased brown ring patch severity. No difference in disease severity was found between treatments containing TE and the control plots that received no treatment. Azoxystrobin plus nitrogen or azoxystrobin plus nitrogen plus TE showed significant effect in alleviating brown ring patch severity in this study. To accurately evaluate disease severity of brown ring patch, digital image analysis (DIA) was compared to visual rating. Linear regression analysis showed that a bias existed between different raters regardless of the rater experience. Overall DIA and visual rating showed similar disease trends and cameras from digital camera to digital single-lens reflex cameras yielded similar results. This study showed that Wcc is a pathogen with high genetic diversity and the sexual stage may play an important role in epidemiology. Brown ring patch could be detected without using expensive equipment and this technique could help to develop a model for predicting this important turfgrass disease. Although similar to other turf grass diseases, this disease needs to be managed differently.

Study of Sestrin in eye growth regulation, lipid physiology, heart function and domain study of dSesn and mSesn1
Sestrin is a family of proteins known to regulate cell growth by TOR signaling modulation. While overexpression of dSesn in the eye only caused a slight reduction in size, coexpression of dSesn with TOR activators caused a reduction in size compared to single expression of TOR activators in the eye. Immunoblots indicate that TOR signaling is reduced with the expression of dSesn, indicated by reduced phosphorylation of TOR targets, 4E-BP and S6K. The dSesn-/- organisms showed increased lipid accumulation compared to wildtype, which was suppressed by AICAR and rapamycin feeding or expression of wildtype dSesn. Immunoblots of larvae fat bodies indicate that dSesn-/- organisms have decreased AMPK phosphorylation and increased S6K and 4E-BP phosphorylation. Cardiac function of dSesn-/- organism shows reduced heart rate, increased arrhythmia and increased diameter, which were rescued by rapamycin and AICAR feeding. Administration of vitamin E, an antioxidant, only rescued arrhythmia. Hand-GAL4 driver was used to express TOR downstream components specifically at the heart. Overexpression of an active form of 4E-BP suppressed translation to decrease heart diameter and rescue dSesn-/- heart rate, while overexpression of Atg1 resulted in aggravating arrhythmicity. NOVA screening of dSesn and mSesn1 may provide insights into understanding the structural basis of Sestrins. NOVA screening on 50,000 (dSesn) and 35,000 (mSesn1) flies in eyes and wings was performed, however, failed to isolate novel mutations that affect Sestrin function. Alternative genetic strategies, such as suppression of synthetic lethality by strong expression of Sestrins, may be used to improve sensitivity of the NOVA screening

Emergency Physicians Research Common Problems in Proportion to their Frequency
Introduction: Emergency medicine (EM) organizations such as the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and the Institute of Medicine have called for more clinical research as a way of addressing thescarcity of research in EM. Previous investigations have examined funding and productivity in EM research, but whether EM researchers preferentially concentrate on certain patient-related topics is notknown. We hypothesized that at least part of the scarcity of EM research is from the tendency of EM researchers, like researchers in other fields, to focus on rarer conditions with higher morbidity or mortality instead of on more common conditions with less acuity. This study compared the frequency of specific medical conditions presenting to emergency departments nationwide with the frequency of emergency physician research on those same conditions.
      Methods: This study is a structured retrospective review and comparison of 2 databases during an 11-year span. Principal diagnoses made by emergency physicians as reported by the National HospitalAmbulatory Medical Care Survey were compared to all first-author publications by emergency physicians as reported in PubMed between 1996 and 2006. Statistics included correlations and linear regression with the number of emergency department (ED) visits per diagnosis as the independent variable and the number of articles published as the dependent variable.
      Results: During the study period, there was significant concordance between the frequency of presenting conditions in the emergency department and the frequency of research being performed onthose conditions, with a high correlation of 0.85 (P,0.01). More common ED diagnoses such as injury/poisoning, symptoms/ill-defined conditions, and diseases of the respiratory system accounted for 60.9% of ED principal diagnoses and 50.2% of the total research published in PubMed.
      Conclusion: Unlike researchers in other fields, emergency physicians investigate clinical problems in almost the exact proportion as those conditions are encountered in the emergency department. The scarcity of EM research does not have to do with a skewed focus toward less common patient problems.

Temporal Patterning of Oral Stereotypies in Restricted-fed Fowls: 1. Investigations with a Sibgle Daily Meal
Intwo experiments, 24 immature female broiler breeder fowls housed in two 12-cage battery units in identical rooms received a single daily ration which they ate in 10 min, according to a programme of food restriction. From regular 15-min videorecordings, measurements were made of times spent in mutually exclusive activities (sitting, standing, head out, pacing, preening, object pecking, drinker activity). In Experiment 1, feeding time was 09.00 h in one room and 13.00 h in the other, and all birds were videorecorded in every hour of the (14-h) photoperiod on two lternate days. Differences in behaviour before and after feeding were independent of feeding time. In both rooms, head out and pacing increased before feeding, and object pecking and drinker activity (oral stereotypies) commenced immediately afterwards and then declined. Individual variation in the oral stereotypies was significant, and individuals' mean levels of both stereotypies together were consistent on the two days, but their hourly patterns were less so. Experiment 2 tested the notion of homeostatic control of oral stereotypies, by feeding all birds at 09.00 h and measuring their responses to removal of drinkers and empty feeders (main targets of the stereotypies) for either 0, 1.5 or 3 h before 15.00 h. Each cage tier received each treatment once, over three alternate days when all birds were recorded on video between 12.00 and 18.00 h (lights ofQ. During removal of feeders and drinkers, partial suppression of object pecking and total suppression of drinker activity were balanced by corresponding increases in sitting, head out and preening. After the return of feeders and drinkers, preening declined and both stereotypies showed evidence of post-inhibitory rebound, but there was no difference between 1.5 and 3 h removal treatments. The results concur with earlier evidence  indicating that preening can substitute with oral stereotypies, and it is suggested they may demonstrate homeostasis in total (substitutable) oral activity over the whole test. Conceivably, homeostasis of arousal may underlie changes in broiler breeder behaviour before and after feeding time.

Molecular and cellular mechanisms of the age-dependency of opioid analgesia and tolerance
Abstract
				The age-dependency of opioid analgesia and tolerance has been noticed in both clinical observation and laboratory studies. Evidence shows that many molecular and cellular events that play essential roles in opioid analgesia and tolerance are actually age-dependent. For example, the expression and functions of endogenous opioid peptides, multiple types of opioid receptors, G protein subunits that couple to opioid receptors, and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) change with development and age. Other signaling systems that are critical to opioid tolerance development, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, also undergo age-related changes. It is plausible that the age-dependent expression and functions of molecules within and related to the opioid signaling pathways, as well as age-dependent cellular activity such as agonist-induced opioid receptor internalization and desensitization, eventually lead to significant age-dependent changes in opioid analgesia and tolerance development.

How Frequently are “Classic” Drug-Seeking Behaviors Used by Drug-Seeking Patients in the Emergency Department?
Introduction: Drug-seeking behavior (DSB) in the emergency department (ED) is a very common problem, yet there has been little quantitative study to date of such behavior.The goal of this study was to assess the frequency with which drug seeking patients in the ED use classic drug seeking behaviors to obtain prescription medication. 
      Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients in an ED case management program for DSB. We reviewed all visits by patients in the program that occurred during a 1-year period, and recorded the frequency of the following behaviors: complaining of headache, complaining of back pain, complaining of dental pain, requesting medication by name, requesting a refill of medication, reporting medications as having been lost or stolen, reporting 10/10 pain, reporting greater than 10/10 pain, reporting being out of medication, and requesting medication parenterally. These behaviors were chosen because they are described as “classic” for DSB in the existing literature.
      Results: We studied 178 patients from the case management program, who made 2,486 visits in 1 year. The frequency of each behavior was: headache 21.7%, back pain 20.8%, dental pain 1.8%, medication by name 15.2%, requesting refill 7.0%, lost or stolen medication 0.6%, pain 10/10 29.1%, pain greater than 10/10 1.8%, out of medication 9.5%, and requesting parenteral medication 4.3%. Patients averaged 1.1 behaviors per visit. 
      Conclusion: Drug-seeking patients appear to exhibit “classically” described drug-seeking behaviors with only low to moderate frequency. Reliance on historical features may be inadequate when trying to assess whether or not a patient is drug-seeking. West J Emerg Med.

The high skills and experience required to perform successful tail vein injections leave many preclinical imaging scientists ill-suited to perform this task. In a recent study, we found that trained routine injectors left on average 14% of the injected probe in the tail tissue. Improvements in injection accuracy, injection consistency, safety, and a reduction in time required to perform the task are needed in preclinical molecular imaging. To achieve these goals, we have devised a semi-automated vascular access system (VAS) to facilitate injections and eventually blood sampling from the mouse tail. We have eliminated much of the human error involved in the manual approach by using a computer-controlled mechanically moving micro-needle.To make use of the VAS, one places an anesthetized mouse onto the temperature controlled mouse bed and secures the tail on a heated tail holder. The VAS uses NIR light, cross-polarizers, and a basic CCD camera to image the tail. The reflection image is processed and the vein is located using edge detection methods. The vein location is plotted and over-laid onto the live video feed of the mouse tail. Using a custom designed user interface, the user properly aligns the needle to the tail vein by employing computer-controlled motors. Once the needle is properly aligned, it begins to penetrate the tail tissue and enter the vein. A pressure transducer attached to the needle detects when the needle has entered the vein, and automatically stops further progression of the needle. With the needle inside the vein, probes can be injected manually, with a liquid handling system, or via a syringe pump. The VAS was first validated using a mouse tail phantom. The phantom was a PDMS chip with channels equivalent to the dimensions of a mouse tail vein (300um). The channels were filled with water and pressurized to variable pressures. With the phantom, the ability for the VAS to align a needle according to an image, insert a needle into a desired location, and stop the progression of the needle based on a pressure signal were tested and verified. Mouse studies were also performed with the VAS. These studies showed that the accuracy of the device, as measured by the percentage of injected probe left in the tail, is 3.4% (+/- 4.5). The VAS reduces the operator skill requirements and training, has the potential to improve injection accuracy, reduces the time required to perform a tail vein injection, and is potentially safer for users and mice in comparison to current manual methods.

Barracks for Company of Infantry at Camp Joe Holt
The first military occupation at Jeffersonville, Indiana during the Civil War was in 1862 when two area regiments established a camp on a farm owned by Blanton Duncan. Lovell Rousseau, the organizer of the regiments, christened the camp “Camp Joe Holt.” The name was retained when it ceased to be a camp and became a hospital, called “Joe Holt Hospital.” Jefferson General Hospital, built to replace the one at Camp Joe Holt, opened 21 February 1864 and closed in

December 1866. Located near Jeffersonville on land obtained from U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the acreage reached down to the Ohio River, facilitating patient transfer from riverboats to the hospital. The health facility had 24 wards each radiating out like spokes on a wheel and all connected by a corridor one-half mile in circumference. Each ward was 150 feet long and 22 feet wide, and could accommodate 60 patients. Female nurses and matrons were quartered separately from the men. The third largest hospital in the country and a showpiece for the Union army, Jefferson General reputedly was one of the finest in the United States for the care of wounded and sick servicemen. During the almost three years that the hospital was in existence the institution cared for more than 16,000 patients and served more than 2,500,000 meals. First person accounts of life at the Jefferson General Hospital can be found in two separate diaries at the Indiana Historical Society Library. One is the published book, Hospital Pencillings by Elvira J. Powers. A volunteer and employee at the hospital, she wrote of the conditions at the hospital and her experiences there. The second is the collection SC2742, Louis C. Webber’s Diary, 1864–1866, a soldier who was wounded three times and was a patient there for a while.

Mujer Mas Segura (Safer Women): A combination prevention intervention to reduce sexual and injection risks among female sex workers who inject drugs
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Female sex workers who inject drugs (FSW-IDUs) are at risk of acquiring HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI) and blood-borne infections through unprotected sex and sharing injection equipment. We conducted a 2&#215;2 factorial randomized controlled trial to evaluate combination interventions to simultaneously reduce sexual and injection risks among FSW-IDUs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					
					FSW-IDUs &#8805;18 years reporting sharing injection equipment and unprotected sex with clients within the last month were randomized to one of four conditions based on an a priori randomization schedule, blinding interviewer/counselors to assignment. Due to the extreme vulnerability of this population, we did not include a control group that would deny some women access to preventive information. All women received similar information regardless of group allocation; the difference was in the way the information was delivered and the extent to which women had an interactive role. Each condition was a single 60-minute session, including either an interactive or didactic version of an injection risk intervention and sexual risk intervention. Women underwent interviewer-administered surveys and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Trichomonas at baseline and quarterly for 12 months. Combined HIV/STI incidence will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are proportionate reductions in sharing of injection equipment and unprotected sex with clients.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					
					Of 1,132 women, 548 (48.4%) were excluded (88.9% were ineligible; 11.1% refused to participate or did not return); 584 eligible women enrolled (284 in Tijuana; 300 in Ciudad Juarez). All 584 participants completed the baseline interview, provided biological samples and were randomized to one of the four groups. During follow-up, 17 participants (2.9%) were lost to follow-up, of whom 10 (58.8%) had died, leaving 567 participants for analysis. This study appears to be the first intervention to attempt to simultaneously reduce injection and sexual risk behaviors among FSW-IDUs. The factorial design will permit analysis to determine whether the combination of the two interactive interventions and/or its respective components are effective in reducing injection and/or sexual risks, which will have direct, tangible policy implications for Mexico and potentially other resource-poor countries.

Electrocardiogram changes in Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis
 
       Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) attacks are characterized as recurrent, transient episodes of muscle weakness that range from mild weakness to complete flaccid paralysis. Episodes of weakness are accompanied by hypokalemia, which left untreated can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (6). In this case study, we followed a patient’s potassium levels analyzing how they correlate with electrocardiogram changes seen while treating his hypokalemia and ultimately his paralysis.

Genomic profiling using array comparative genomic
hybridization define distinct subtypes of diffuse
large b-cell lymphoma: a review of the literature
Abstract
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma comprising of greater than 30% of adult non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. DLBCL represents a diverse set of lymphomas, defined as diffuse proliferation of large B lymphoid cells. Numerous cytogenetic studies including karyotypes and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), as well as morphological, biological, clinical, microarray and sequencing technologies have attempted to categorize DLBCL into morphological variants, molecular and immunophenotypic subgroups, as well as distinct disease entities. Despite such efforts, most lymphoma remains undistinguishable and falls into DLBCL, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS). The advent of microarray-based studies (chromosome, RNA, gene expression, etc) has provided a plethora of high-resolution data that could potentially facilitate the finer classification of DLBCL. This review covers the microarray data currently published for DLBCL. We will focus on these types of data; 1) array based CGH; 2) classical CGH; and 3) gene expression profiling studies. The aims of this review were three-fold: (1) to catalog chromosome loci that are present in at least 20% or more of distinct DLBCL subtypes; a detailed list of gains and losses for different subtypes was generated in a table form to illustrate specific chromosome loci affected in selected subtypes; (2) to determine common and distinct copy number alterations among the different subtypes and based on this information, characteristic and similar chromosome loci for the different subtypes were depicted in two separate chromosome ideograms; and, (3) to list re-classified subtypes and those that remained indistinguishable after review of the microarray data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to compile and review available literatures on microarray analysis data and their practical utility in classifying DLBCL subtypes.
Although conventional cytogenetic methods such as Karyotypes and FISH have played a major role in classification schemes of lymphomas, better classification models are clearly needed to further understanding the biology, disease outcome and therapeutic management of DLBCL. In summary, microarray data reviewed here can provide better subtype specific classifications models for DLBCL.

Diabetes and breast cancer : the women's healthy eating & living study
Diabetes and breast cancer are common diseases with a massive public health impact. With continual advancements in breast cancer detection and treatment diffusing into clinical practice, the population of breast cancer survivors is growing with a current estimate of 2.5 million women. Meanwhile the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase at alarming rates, largely attributed to the growing obesity epidemic. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to address current gaps in the scientific literature using data from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study- a randomized controlled trial designed to test whether a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat would reduce the risk of recurrence and all- cause mortality among women previously treated for early- stage breast cancer. The specific dissertation objectives were to : 1) assess the effects of prevalent diabetes on breast cancer disease-free survival and overall survival, 2) assess the effects of pre-cancer body mass index (BMI) and post-diagnosis weight change on the risk of incident diabetes and 3) assess the effects of physical inactivity, weight gain, and obesity on long-term worsening of glycemic control. Dissertation results showed that diabetes was independently associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality in breast cancer survivors. A significant contribution was made by providing evidence suggesting that the severity or duration of diabetes may affect the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. This dissertation also provides new evidence that women who experience major weight loss with subsequent regain after breast cancer are at twofold greater risk of becoming diabetic than women who maintain their pre-cancer weight. With the vast majority of breast cancer patients surviving more than 5 years beyond diagnosis, oncologists are challenged to expand their focus from acute care to managing the long-term health consequences of breast cancer. This dissertation provides compelling evidence that lifestyle changes may improve the length and quality of life of breast cancer survivors, and thus represents a significant contribution towards an issue of global public health concern

Clinical tolerability of artesunate-amodiaquine
versus comparator treatments for uncomplicated
falciparum malaria: an individual-patient analysis
of eight randomized controlled trials in sub-Saharan
Africa
Abstract


Background
The widespread use of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) for treating uncomplicated malaria makes it important to gather and analyse information on its tolerability.


Methods
An individual-patient tolerability analysis was conducted using data from eight randomized controlled clinical trials conducted at 17 sites in nine sub-Saharan countries comparing ASAQ to other anti-malarial treatments. All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in the analysis. Differences in adverse event (AE) and treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) were analysed by Day 28.


Results
Of the 6,179 patients enrolled (74% &lt;5&#8201;years of age), 50% (n&#8201;=&#8201;3,113) received ASAQ, 20% (n&#8201;=&#8201;1,217) another ACT, and 30% (n&#8201;=&#8201;1,849) a non-ACT (combination or single-agent) treatment. Overall, 8,542 AEs were recorded. The proportion of patients experiencing at least one gastro-intestinal AE on ASAQ was 43% (and higher than that with artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at two sites), and was 23% for any other AEs (not different from other treatments). Specifically, the risk of diarrhoea, vomiting, cough and weakness was lower with artemether-lumefantrine; artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine carried a higher risk of pruritus, chloroquine-SP had a higher risk of nausea. Parasitological recurrence increased the risk of occurrence of any AE. No other difference was detected. Comparing AE to TEAE in patients who had pre-treatment occurrence and grades of intensity recorded, AEs were significantly more related to the pre-treatment prevalence of the symptom (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001, Fisher test); AEs overestimated TEAEs by a factor ranging from none to five-fold. The overall incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) with ASAQ was nine per 1,000 (29/3,113) and mortality was one per 1,000 (three deaths, none drug-related); both were similar to other treatments.


Conclusion
ASAQ was comparatively well-tolerated. Safety information is important, and must be collected and analysed in a standardized way. TEAEs are a more objective measure of treatment-induced toxicity.

Exploring the interaction between SNP genotype and postmenopausal hormone therapy effects on stroke risk
Abstract
Background
Genome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with stroke risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial stroke aggregation. Genotype by environment interactions may contribute further to such an explanation. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial found increased stroke risk with postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and provides an efficient setting for evaluating genotype-HT interaction on stroke risk.

Methods
We examined HT by genotype interactions for 392 SNPs selected from candidate gene studies, and 2,371 SNPs associated with changes in blood protein concentrations after hormone therapy, in analyses that included 2,045 postmenopausal women who developed stroke during WHI clinical trial and observational study follow-up and one-to-one matched controls. A two-stage procedure was implemented where SNPs passing the first stage screening based on marginal association with stroke risk were tested in the second stage for interaction with HT using case-only analysis.

Results
The two-stage procedure identified two SNPs, rs2154299 and rs12194855, in the coagulation factor XIII subunit A (F13A1) region and two SNPs, rs630431 and rs560892, in the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) region, with an estimated false discovery rate &lt;0.05 based on interaction tests. Further analyses showed significant stroke risk interaction between these F13A1 SNPs and estrogen plus progestin (E+P) treatment for ischemic stroke and for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke combined, and suggested interactions between PCSK9 SNPs with either E+P or estrogen-alone treatment.

Conclusions
Genotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to stroke risk. Two-stage analysis among postmenopausal women generates novel hypotheses concerning the F13A1 and PCSK9 genomic regions and the effects of hormonal exposures on postmenopausal stroke risk for subsequent independent validation.

Dietary intervention with DHA and curcumin enhance spinal cord sensory motor learning
Given that the spinal cord is capable of learning sensorimotor tasks and that dietary interventions can influence learning involving supraspinal centers, we asked whether the presence of omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the curry spice curcumin (Cur) could affect spinal cord learning in adult spinal mice. Using Paw Withdrawal instrumental learning paradigm (PaWL) to assess spinal learning we observed that mice fed a diet containing DHA/Cur performed better in the spinal learning paradigm than mice fed a diet deficient in DHA/Cur.  Previous studies in the cortex have demonstrated that both DHA and curcumin elevate the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plays a major role in learning and neural plasticity. Here we examined the effect of DHA and curcumin on the Paw Withdrawal learning. The enhanced performance was accompanied by increases in mRNA of molecular markers of learning, i.e., BDNF, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), Calcium/Calmodulin Kinase II (CaMKII), and syntaxin 3.  Sequestering BDNF with TrkB IgG in the lumbar spinal cord of DHA/Cur fed mice showed significant decrease in spinal learning, and levels of mRNA of BDNF, CaMKII, CREB and syntaxin 3. These results emphasize the capacity of select dietary factors to foster spinal cord learning and suggest the BDNF pathway may be a key mediator of spinal plasticity. Given the non-invasiveness and safety of the modulation of diet, this intervention should be considered in light of their potential to enhance relearning of sensorimotor tasks during rehabilitative training paradigms after spinal cord injury.

Hereditary Angioedema Therapy: Kallikrein Inhibition and Bradykinin Receptor Antagonism
Abstract
Current strategies for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) include targeted inhibition or antagonism of the contact system, which is dysregulated in HAE patients by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Ecallantide, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, and icatibant, a selective bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist, have recently been evaluated in clinical studies for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. Both drugs have demonstrated evidence of efficacy and safety in treating acute HAE episodes, with ecallantide approved for use in the United States and icatibant approved for use in Europe. As therapeutic options for HAE expand for both for prophylactic and acute treatment strategies, a number of patient-specific and drug-specific factors have emerged as important considerations when developing individualized HAE management plans. Optimization of HAE therapy will require further integration of new therapies into the current treatment paradigm.

Rilonacept in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis: a randomized, controlled clinical trial using indomethacin as the active comparator
Abstract
Introduction
In phase-3 clinical trials, the interleukin (IL-1) blocker, rilonacept (IL-1 Trap), demonstrated efficacy for gout flare prevention during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. This trial evaluated rilonacept added to a standard-of-care, indomethacin, for treatment of acute gout flares.

Methods
Adults, aged 18-70 years, with gout presenting within 48 hours of flare onset and having at least moderate pain as well as swelling and tenderness in the index joint were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) rilonacept 320 mg at baseline plus oral indomethacin 50 mg TID for 3 days followed by 25 mg TID for up to 9 days (n = 74); SC placebo at baseline plus oral indomethacin as above (n = 76); or SC rilonacept 320 mg at baseline plus oral placebo (n = 75). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in pain in the index joint (patient-reported using a Likert scale (0 = none; 4 = extreme)) from baseline to the average of values at 24, 48 and 72 hours (composite time point) for rilonacept plus indomethacin versus indomethacin alone. Comparison of rilonacept monotherapy with indomethacin monotherapy was dependent on demonstration of significance for the primary endpoint. Safety evaluation included clinical laboratory and adverse event (AE) assessments.

Results
Patient characteristics were comparable among the groups; the population was predominantly male (94.1%), white (75.7%), with mean &#177; SD age of 50.3 &#177; 10.6 years. All treatment groups reported within-group pain reductions from baseline (P &lt; 0.0001). Although primary endpoint pain reduction was greater with rilonacept plus indomethacin (-1.55 &#177; 0.92) relative to indomethacin alone (-1.40 &#177; 0.96), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.33), so formal comparison between monotherapy groups was not performed. Pain reduction over the 72-hour period with rilonacept alone (-0.69 &#177; 0.97) was less than that in the other groups, but pain reduction was similar among groups at 72 hours. Treatment with rilonacept was well-tolerated with no reported serious AEs related to rilonacept. Across all groups, the most frequent AEs were headache and dizziness.

Conclusions
Although generally well-tolerated, rilonacept in combination with indomethacin and rilonacept alone did not provide additional pain relief over 72 hours relative to indomethacin alone in patients with acute gout flare.

Essays on Treatment Effects Evaluation
The first chapter uses the propensity score matching method to measure the average impact of insurance on health service utilization in terms of office-based physician visits, total number of reported visits to hospital outpatient departments, and emergency room visits. Four matching algorithms are employed to match propensity scores. The results show that insurance significantly increases office-based physician visits, and its impacts on reported visits to hospital outpatient departments and emergency room visits are positive, but not significant. This implies that physician offices will receive a substantial increase in demand if universal insurance is imposed. Government will need to allocate more resources to physician offices relative to outpatient or emergency room services in the case of universal insurance in order to accommodate the increased demand. 

The second chapter studies the sensitivity of propensity score matching methods to different estimation methods. Traditionally, parametric models, such as logit and probit, are used to estimate propensity score. Current technology allows us to use computationally intensive methods, either semiparametric or nonparametric, to estimate it. We use the Monte Carlo experimental method to investigate the sensitivity of the treatment effect to different propensity score estimation models under the unconfoundedness assumption.  The results show that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) estimates are insensitive to the estimation methods when index function for treatment is linear, but logit and probit model do better jobs when the index function is nonlinear.

The third chapter proposes a Cross-Sectionally Varying (CVC) Coefficient method to approximate individual treatment effects with nonexperimental data, the distribution of treatment effects, the average treatment effect on the treated and the average treatment effect. The CVC method reparameterizes the outcome of no treatment and the treatment effect in terms of observable variables, and uses these observables together with a Bayesian estimator of their coefficients to approximate individual treatment effects. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed estimator. This method is applied to two datasets: data from the U.S. Job Training Partnership ACT (JTPA) program and a dataset that contains firms’ seasoned equity offerings and operating performances.

Oral and Intravenous Acetylcysteine for Treatment of Acetaminophen Toxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Introduction: There are few reports summarizing the effectiveness of oral and intravenous (IV) acetylcysteine. We determined the proportion of acetaminophen poisoned patients who develop hepatotoxicity (serum transaminase > 1000 IU/L) when treated with oral and IV acetylcysteine.
      Methods: Studies were double abstracted by trained researchers. We determined the proportions of patients who developed hepatotoxicity for each route using a random effects model. Studies were further stratified by early and late treatment.
      Results: We screened 4,416 abstracts; 16 articles, including 5,164 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of hepatotoxicity for the oral and IV routes were 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively. Treatment delays are associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity.
      Conclusion: Studies report similar rates of hepatotoxicity for oral and IV acetylcysteine, but direct comparisons are lacking. While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of dose and duration from route, our findings suggest that the rates of hepatotoxicity are similar for oral and IV administration.

Neural correlates of cognitive and emotional processing in individuals at-risk for schizophrenia and first episode psychosis
Efforts to prevent or lessen the functional impact of the onset of schizophrenia can be informed by a better understanding of brain systems involved in cognitive and emotional processing at the earliest stages of the disorder. Yet, studies investigating these early stages of schizophrenia are rare. A fuller understanding of disruptions in the neural systems underlying cognitive and emotional processing at these earliest stages of psychosis will lead to more targeted efforts to prevent or minimize functional limitations among patients with psychosis. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study compared brain functioning associated with emotional as well as cognitive processes in groups of individuals who exhibited early and sub-threshold symptoms of psychosis to patients (P/AR) in their early phases of psychosis and/ or immediately after their first psychotic episode (FE) and to healthy individuals (HC). We also explored to what extent the engagement of neural systems during these challenges is related to or predicted by individual emotional and cognitive performance as well as global functioning along the psychosis spectrum. Contrary to our expectations, load-related brain activation during the working memory challenge was similar among all three groups in a region of DLPFC that was task-responsive across the groups, although whole-brain analysis revealed group differences in other regions. Amygdalar brain activation during the emotional challenge, in contrast to our hypothesis, was not different between the HC and P/AR groups and was increased in magnitude in the FE group. Neuropsychological performance was related to DLPFC brain activation in both FE and P/AR groups, but in opposite directions. We also found associations between global functioning and magnitude of brain response during the emotional and cognitive challenges. The present results suggest that both cognitive and emotional systems are implicated in the earliest stages of psychosis. Further analyses suggested that brain responses were associated with neuropsychological performance as well as overall global functioning scores. Our findings highlight that more basic neurobiological abnormalities likely account for overall global functioning early in the course of schizophrenia. Our results could be interpreted as supporting a dysregulation hypothesis of developing psychosis such that global functioning is compromised as a function of disruption in the regulatory mechanisms between cognitive and emotional systems

Willingness to provide behavioral health recommendations: a cross-sectional study of entering medical students
AbstractBackgroundBehavioral factors contribute importantly to morbidity and mortality, and physicians are trusted sources for information on reducing associated risks. Unfortunately, many clinical encounters do not include prevention counseling, and medical school curriculum plays an important role in training and promoting such counseling among medical students.MethodsWe surveyed all 93 freshman medical students at entry to the University of California, Davis School of Medicine in 2009 to evaluate baseline knowledge of population health principles and examine their approach to clinical situations involving four common behavioral risk factors illustrated in brief clinical vignettes: smoking, alcohol use in a patient with indications of alcoholism, diet and exercise in an overweight sedentary patient, and a 16-year-old contemplating initiation of sexual intercourse. Based on vignette responses, we assessed willingness to (1) provide information on risks, (2) recommend elimination of the behavior as the most efficacious means for reducing risk, (3) include strategies apart from elimination of the behavior for lowering risk (i.e., harm reduction), and (4) assure of their intention to continue care whether or not recommendations are accepted.ResultsStudents answered correctly 71.4&#8201;% (median; interquartile range 66.7&#8201;% - 85.7&#8201;%) of clinical prevention and population health knowledge questions; men scored higher than women (median 83.3&#8201;% vs. 66.7&#8201;%, p&lt;0.02). Students showed high willingness to provide information and strategies for harm reduction apart from risk elimination, while respecting patient autonomy. Willingness to recommend elimination of high-risk behaviors &#8220;always or nearly always&#8221; was high for smoking (78.5&#8201;%), alcohol consumption in a patient with indications of alcoholism (64.5&#8201;%), and diet and exercise in a sedentary and overweight individual (87.1&#8201;%), and low for the 16-year-old considering initiating sexual intercourse (28.0&#8201;%; Friedman test, p&lt;0.001). Willingness was not associated with the respondent&#8217;s background knowledge of population health principles or gender.ConclusionStudents showed high willingness to educate and respect patient autonomy. There was high willingness to recommend elimination of risk behaviors for smoking, alcohol, and poor diet/exercise, but not for sexual intercourse in an adolescent considering sexual debut. Further research should address promoting appropriate science-based preventive health messages, and curriculum should include explicit discussion of content of recommendations.

The goal of this experimental work was to investigate methods of measuring important fluidization properties in a vertical, cold-flow, gas-fluidized bed to gain an understanding of the fluidization characteristics of the bed materials used. Quantities such as pressure drop across the bed, mean bed height, and minimum fluidization velocity were determined using non-invasive methods and were compared to fundamental fluidized bed theories to verify proper performance of the experiment. Granular temperature near the wall, a quantity of great interest in this system, was also determined using a non-invasive technique. An Acoustic Shot Noise probe, developed by Cody et al. (1996), was used to correlate the vibrational energy at the fluidized bed wall to the average particle velocity normal to this surface. By determining the mechanical transfer function of the confining tube, it was possible to obtain an estimate for the granular temperature near the wall by performing a spectral analysis of the wall acceleration time signal. Experimentally-determined values of pressure drop, mean bed height, and minimum fluidization velocity agreed well with the values predicted from theory. Average granular temperature values also agreed well with those obtained through similar means (Cody et al., 1996). The mean bed expansion ratio and average granular temperature results were compared with those obtained from a Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation (Didwania et al., to appear). Good agreement was observed between experiment and simulation, and special attention was given to the effects of changing key parameters in the model

Emergency Department Crowding is Associated with Reduced Satisfaction Scores in Patients Discharged from the Emergency Department
Introduction: Emergency department (ED) crowding has been shown to negatively impact patient outcomes. Few studies have addressed the effect of ED crowding on patient satisfaction. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of ED crowding on patient satisfaction in patients discharged from the ED.
      Methods: We measured patient satisfaction using Press-Ganey surveys returned by patients that visited our ED between August 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008. We recorded all mean satisfaction scores and obtained mean ED occupancy rate, mean emergency department work index (EDWIN) score and hospital diversion status over each 8-hour shift from data archived in our electronic tracking board. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was calculated to determine the effect of ED crowding and hospital diversion status on the odds of achieving a mean satisfaction score ≥ 85, which was the patient satisfaction goal set forth by our ED administration.
      Results: A total of 1591 surveys were returned over the study period. Mean satisfaction score was 77.6 (standard deviation SD ±16) and mean occupancy rate was 1.23 (SD ± 0.31). The likelihood of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals was associated with an increase in average ED occupancy rate (odds ratio OR 0.32, 95% confidence interval CI 0.17 to 0.59, P < 0.001) and an increase in EDWIN score (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.55, P = 0.015). Hospital diversion resulted in lower mean satisfaction scores, but this was not statistically significant (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05). In multivariable analysis controlling for hospital diversion status and time of shift, ED occupancy rate remained a significant predictor of failure to meet patient satisfaction goals (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.66, P = 0.001).
      Conclusions: Increased crowding, as measured by ED occupancy rate and EDWIN score, was significantly associated with reduced patient satisfaction. Although causative attribution was limited, our study suggested yet another negative impact resulting from ED crowding. West J Emerg Med.

Sleep and markers of cardiovascular disease risk in elderly Alzheimer's caregivers
Background : Sleep has been shown to be shorter and more disturbed in Alzheimer's caregivers compared to non- caregivers, presumably due to challenges associated with caregiving. Caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease has also been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The increased risk of CVD may be due to the effect that insufficient sleep (disrupted sleep or inadequate sleep duration) has on numerous physiologic processes that can stress the cardiovascular system. Objectives : This dissertation aimed to (1) assess associations of both sleep duration and efficiency with prevalence of the traditional CVD risk factors of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension; (2) investigate whether both sleep duration and efficiency were associated with morning plasma catecholamine concentrations; and (3) determine the associations of both sleep duration and disturbance with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in a sample of community-dwelling elderly Alzheimer's caregivers. Methods : Participants were 126 caregivers for spouses with Alzheimer's disease who underwent sleep assessment by wrist actigraphy for 72 consecutive hours. Sleep data were averaged across the 3 days/nights; nighttime sleep and daytime napping were computed. Morning fasting blood samples were collected to determine measures of blood lipids, glucose, and catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine); the average of three resting blood pressure measurements was used to estimate mean resting blood pressure; and carotid artery ultrasound was used to measure CIMT. All collections, measurements and assessments were conducted in participants' homes. Results : Analyses indicate that in an elderly sample of Alzheimer's caregivers, sleep parameters were not significantly associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. However, greater nighttime sleep efficiency and duration were associated with increased morning plasma catecholamine concentrations in this sample of elderly Alzheimer's caregivers. In addition, shorter naps and more disturbed nighttime sleep were associated with increased CIMT. Conclusions : While findings presented suggest that sleep was not significantly associated with prevalent metabolic conditions, sufficient nighttime sleep and/or napping were associated with increased morning plasma catecholamine concentrations and reduced subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in a sample of elderly Alzheimer's caregivers. These analyses contribute to understanding associations between sleep and markers of cardiovascular disease risk in elderly caregivers. Further research on elderly adults with non-invasive, objective sleep measures is recommended

Particle embolization to control life-threatening
hemorrhage from a fungating locally advanced
breast carcinoma: a case report
AbstractIntroductionSudden severe hemorrhage from locally advanced fungating breast carcinoma and its associated cutaneous lesions is rarely reported. Transcatheter arterial embolization has been used widely in the setting of intractable neoplastic hemorrhage arising from primary and metastatic tumors of the lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. Here, we detail the use of transcatheter arterial embolization in controlling torrential hemorrhage in a patient with advanced invasive breast cancer and multiple comorbidities.Case presentationWe report the case of a 28-year-old African-American woman who presented with acute torrential hemorrhage from a high-grade invasive ductal breast carcinoma. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a 14cm mass with extensive muscle, fascial, and cutaneous invasion. Owing to the extent of invasion and multiple comorbidities, she was deemed to be unsuitable for surgical management. Selective angiography of the left internal mammary artery revealed no tumoral blush, extravasation, or pseudoaneurysm. Transcatheter arterial embolization was undertaken, and complete occlusion of the vessel was demonstrated. No further episodes of hemorrhage occurred.ConclusionsThough rare, sudden severe hemorrhage from advanced breast cancer may be definitively managed by embolization alone and thus surgery may be avoided.

Investigation of Physical Activity Monitors and their Relationship to Traditional Physiological Measures during Human Exercise
Purpose: Accelerometry data from 2 physical activity monitors (PAM) paired with 3 physiological measures (heart rate, oxygen uptake, and energy expenditure) across 3 exercise modes (constant treadmill load, stepping, and incremental treadmill exercise). Methods: 10 males performed 9 intensities each of steady-state treadmill and stepping exercise with wrist- and ankle-mounted PAMs. Last 2 minutes of each exercise was defined as steady-state, where energy expenditure (EE), derived by indirect calorimetry, and vector magnitude units (VMU), derived from accelerometer vectors, were averaged. Seven combinations of PAM configuration were compared. 2-factor ANOVA determined the effect of speed, grade, and their interaction for treadmill exercise, and the effect of step height, step rate, and their interaction for stepping exercise. 10 different, equally healthy subjects performed 3 incremental treadmill exercise tests with a chest-mounted PAM. Slopes from HR/V &#775;O_2 and HR/VMU were compared, with repeatability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).Results: Mean EE (Kcal/min) for all steady-state exercises ranged between 3 and 18 kcal/min 2-factor ANOVA revealed no effect of grade on all PAM configurations during treadmill exercise.  ICC for HR/V &#775;O_2 slopes = 0.80 ICC for HR/VMU slopes = 0.31Discussion: PAM output was not influenced by grade for any configuration, which can be problematic for predicting EE. Slopes and intercepts of HR/V &#775;O_2 was deemed more repeatable across 3 incremental exercise tests than HR/VMU.

Necessity of Lumbar Puncture in Patients Presenting with New Onset Complex Febrile Seizures
Introduction: This study aims to characterize the population of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) for a first complex febrile seizure, and subsequently assess the rate of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) occurrence in this population. Furthermore, this study seeks to identify whether a specific subset of patients may be at lesser risk for ABM or other serious neurological disease.
      Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the charts of patients between the ages of 6 months to 5 years of age admitted to an ED between 2005 and 2010 for a first complex febrile seizure (CFS). The health information department generated a patient list based on admission and discharge diagnoses, which was screened for patient eligibility. Exclusion criteria included history of a complex febrile seizure, history of an afebrile seizure, trauma, or severe underlying neurological disorder. Data extracted included age, gender, relevant medical history, descriptions of seizure, treatment received, and follow-up data. Patients presenting with two short febrile seizures within 24 hours were then analyzed separately to assess health outcomes in this population.
      Results: There were 193 patients were eligible. Lumbar puncture was performed on 136 subjects; it was significantly more likely to be performed on patients that presented with seizure focality, status epilepticus, or a need for intubation. Fourteen patients were found to have pleocytosis following white blood cell (WBC) count correction, and 1 was diagnosed with ABM (0.5% 95% confidence interval: 0.0–1.5, n = 193). Forty-three patients had 2 brief febrile seizures within 24 hours. Of the 43, 17 received lumbar puncture while in the ED. None of these patients were found to have ABM or other serious neurological disease.
      Conclusion: ABM is rare in patients presenting with a first complex febrile seizure. Patients presenting only with 2 short febrile seizures within 24 hours may be less likely to have ABM, and may not require lumbar puncture without other clinical symptoms of neurological disease.West J Emerg Med.

[manf, heart, pathway, cardiomyocyte, ersr, stress, activation, growth]

Discovery of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) as a secreted, endoplasmic reticulum stress response-induced gene, and its role in the heart
Activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) occurs when nascent protein folding in the ER is impeded. Such impediment can occur in the heart upon myocardial ischemia, when there is a lack of oxygen and nutrient flow to the heart, leading to ischemic damage. This can be minimized by activation of protective pathways such as the ERSR, in particular, the ATF6 branch of the ERSR. ATF6, a transcription factor, induced numerous genes in the heart, including mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF). MANF is induced in cardiomyocytes, in the heart, in response to in vivo myocardial infarction and in response to simulated ischemia, in neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocyte cultures, in vitro. Unlike many other ER-resident ERSR induced proteins, MANF has a non-canonical ER-retention sequence, which may result in its conditional secretion. MANF expression in resulted in protection from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. MANF knockdown in cardiomyocytes resulted in increased susceptibility to simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R)-induced cell death, while addition of recombinant MANF (rMANF) conferred protection, suggesting a possible autocrine/paracrine function. MANF overexpression led to decreased cardiomyocyte growth, while MANF knockdown exacerbated hypertrophy, as characterized by activation of the MAPK pathway, and NFAT, and induction of hypertrophic growth markers such as ANF. rMANF had no effect on cardiomyocyte growth, suggesting a role for intracellular MANF. While the exact mechanism of action is still unclear, MANF overexpression during sI/R enhanced activation of pro- survival signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K/Akt, and addition of rMANF also activated the MAPK pathway. These findings indicate that MANF may have multiple mechanisms of action, and that it may be dependent on its location (intracellular or extracellular) and the nature of the stress (pro-growth vs ER stress). While further studies are required to fully understand the role of MANF, these studies, for the first time, demonstrate that MANF not only protects myocytes from ER stress-induced cell death, but also from hypertrophic growth, which is known to lead to myocyte death, and eventually heart failure

Problem-solving versus cognitive restructuring of medically ill seniors with depression (PROMISE-D trial): study protocol and design
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					With an ageing population in most Western countries, people are living longer but often with one or more chronic physical health problems. Older people in physically poor health are at greater risk of developing clinical depression. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Problem Solving Therapy (PST) have both been found to be efficacious in treating late-life depression, however patients with &#8220;multi-morbidity&#8221; (i.e. more than one chronic condition) are often excluded from these trials. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of CBT and PST in treating older adults who have one or more chronic physical health conditions and a diagnosable depressive disorder. This study will be the first to explicitly target the treatment of depression in older people in primary care settings presenting with a range of health problems using behavioural interventions.
				
				
					
						Methods/design
					The PROMISE-D study is a randomised controlled trial of two evidence-based treatments for late-life major or minor depression for patients who also have at least one co-morbid chronic health problem. Participants will be randomised to two active interventions (PST or CBT) or enhanced treatment-as-usual (E-TAU). Primary outcomes will be depression diagnostic status and severity of depression (according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale). Secondary outcomes will be anxiety severity, quality of life and health care utilisation. Assessments will be conducted by a researcher who remains blind to the patient&#8217;s treatment allocation and will be conducted pre and post-treatment and at six and 12 months follow-up. Health care utilisation will be assessed throughout a two year period following entry to the trial. Executive function, rumination and emotion regulation will also be measured to determine the impact of these factors on treatment response in two treatment groups.
				
				
					
						Discussion
					Multi-morbidity, the experience of two or more chronic health problems, is becoming an increasing problem internationally, particularly amongst the elderly. Evidence-based psychological treatments exist for late-life depression and these have been shown to be effective for participants with individual health problems and depression. However, there are no studies that have compared the two leading psychotherapies shown to be effective in the treatment of late-life depression. In addition, many trials of psychotherapy with older adults exclude those with multi-morbidity. Hence, this trial will confirm whether CBT and PST are efficacious in the treatment of depression in the context of complex medical needs and determine which of these two interventions is most efficacious.

Electrocardiogram changes in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis
Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) attacks are characterized as recurrent, transient episodes of muscle weakness that range from mild weakness to complete flaccid paralysis. Episodes of weakness are accompanied by hypokalemia, which left untreated can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (6). In this case study, we followed a patient’s potassium levels analyzing how they correlate with electrocardiogram changes seen while treating his hypokalemia and ultimately his paralysis.

Safety and Efficacy of Prehospital Diltiazem
Introduction: Very few studies exist on the use of diltiazem in the prehospital setting. Some practitioners believe this medication is prone to causing hypotension in this setting. Our goals were to determine whether the prehospital administration of diltiazem induced hypotension and to evaluate the efficacy of the drug.
      
         Methods: Our two-tiered system is located in a suburban region of New Jersey with advanced life support (ALS) care provided by fly-car units. The ALS units do not transport patients, and all of them are hospital based. The ALS providers are employed by the hospital system. In New Jersey, all ALS care requires online medical control, including the administration of diltiazem. We retrospectively reviewed patient care records for those who were believed to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and were given diltiazem in a suburban emergeny medical services system over a 22-month period. We examined the differences between heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) on the initial evaluation and on arrival to the emergency department (ED). A hypotensive response was defined as a final systolic BP (SBP) less than 90 mmHg and a drop in SBP of at least 10 mmHg. Diltiazem was considered effective if the ED HR was ,100 beats per minute (bpm) or if it decreased 120%.
      
         Results: During the study period, 26,979 patients were transported. Of these patients, 2,488 had a documented rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Of the 320 patients who received diltiazem, 42 patient encounters were excluded for incomplete data, yielding 278 patients for analysis. The average initial SBP was 139 mmHg and the average diastolic BP was 84 mmHg. The average diltiazem dosage was 16.7 mg. Two patients became hypotensive. The average initial HR was 154 bpm. On arrival to the ED, 33% of the patients had an HR , 100 bpm and 69% had a drop in HR 1 20%. The overall efficacy of prehospital diltiazem was 73%.
      
         Conclusion: In the prehospital setting, diltiazem is associated with a very low rate of hypotension and appears to be effective in decreasing HR adequately. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(3):296–300.

Predictors of Hepatotoxicity in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Patients Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy
Hepatotoxicity is a common side effect of antiretroviral therapy with severe hepatotoxicity necessitating a regimen change. This was a retrospective cohort study that investigated the predictors of severe hepatotoxicity in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy identified to have clinically significant elevations in transaminases.  Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as an alanine aminotransferase level (ALT) greater than 275 IU/ml.  The prevalence of severe hepatotoxicity was 23%.  In multivariable stepwise regression analysis, only HBsAg, higher median HIV viral load and lower median ALT at database entry were predictors of severe hepatotoxicity.  In a cohort of HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) coinfected patients, only higher log HIV viral load at database entry showed a trend towards significance as a predictor of severe hepatotoxicity, in multivariable stepwise regression analysis.  Neither antiretroviral regimen class nor single agent was associated with severe hepatotoxicity. HBV infection, but not HCV infection, was a significant predictor of severe hepatotoxicity in HIV infected patients on antiretroviral therapy.  Conclusion: In a cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, HBV infection, ALT and log HIV viral load at database entry were significant predictors of severe hepatotoxicity, while antiretroviral regimens were not.

The Treatment of Cutaneous Abscesses: Comparison of Emergency Medicine Providers' Practice Patterns
Objectives: Cutaneous abscesses are commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Although incision and drainage (I&D) remains the standard treatment, there is little high quality evidence to support additional interventions such as pain control, type of incision, and use of irrigation, wound cultures, and packing. Although guidelines exist to support clinician management of abscesses, they do not clearly specify these additional interventions. This study sought to describe the ED treatments administered to adults with uncomplicated superficial cutaneous abscesses, defined as purulent lesions requiring incision and drainage, that could be managed in an ED or outpatient setting.
      Methods: Four hundred and seventy four surveys were distributed to 15 EDs across the United States.  Participants were queried about their level of training and practice environment as well as specific questions regarding their management of cutaneous abscesses in the ED.
      Results: In total, 350 providers responded to the survey (74%).  One hundred eighty nine respondents (54%) were attending physicians, 135 (39%) were residents and 26 (7%) were mid-level providers.  Most providers (76%) used narcotics for pain management, 71% used local anesthetic over the roof of the abscess, and 60% used local anesthetic in a field block for pain control.  Only 48% of responders routinely used irrigation after I&D.  Eighty-five percent of responders used a linear incision to drain the abscess and 91% used packing in the wound cavity.  Thirty two percent routinely sent wound cultures and 17% of providers routinely prescribed antibiotics. Most providers (73%) only prescribed antibiotics if certain historical factors or physical findings were present on exam.  Antibiotic treatment, if used, favored a combination of 2 or more drugs to cover both Streptococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (47%). Follow up visits were most frequently recommended at 48 hours unless wound was concerning and required closer evaluation.
      Conclusion:   Variability exists in the treatment strategies for abscess care. The majority of providers used narcotic analgesics in addition to local anesthetic, linear incisions, and packing.  Most providers did not irrigate, order wound cultures, or routinely prescribe oral antibiotics unless specific risk factors or physical signs were present.  Limited evidence is available at this time to guide these treatment strategies. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(1):23–28.

Observed Communication in Distressed Couples' Interactions
Behavioral perspectives of relationship distress suggest that communication and relationship outcomes are tightly linked in couples. The series of studies in this dissertation examine observed communication in 10&ndash;min videotaped interactions at each of three time points (i.e., pre&ndash;therapy, post&ndash;therapy, 2&ndash;year follow&ndash;up) from a sample of 134 distressed couples assigned to either Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy (TBCT; Jacobson &amp; Margolin, 1979) or Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (IBCT; Jacobson &amp; Christensen, 1998) in a randomized clinical trial. Although both treatments assume communication to be an integral aspect of relationship functioning, they are distinguished by IBCT&rsquo;s incorporation of acceptance techniques and use of contingency&ndash;shaped change strategies, and TBCT&rsquo;s explicit change focus using rule&ndash;governed methods. In Paper 1 we examined changes in individual partner communication rated by trained coders. We found continued improvements in communication following treatment termination, with IBCT couples demonstrating greater improvements from post&ndash;therapy to 2&ndash;year follow&ndash;up relative to TBCT couples. We also found limited evidence of associations between communication and relationship outcomes at 2&ndash; and 5&ndash;year follow&ndash;up. Finally, we replicated an odd finding that increased positivity is associated with poorer outcomes but clarified this finding by demonstrating that counterintuitive links between positivity and relationship satisfaction disappear after controlling for withdrawal. In Paper 2 we examined the extent to which &ldquo;naïve&rdquo; (untrained) raters could make useful judgments of couples&rsquo; interactions. We compared naïve ratings of both overall relationship quality and dyadic interaction patterns to the trained ratings from Paper 1. Not only were naïve and trained ratings closely linked, but naïve ratings were also strongly and consistently associated with relationship satisfaction. Naïve ratings uniquely predicted relationship outcomes, and at times were better predictors of outcomes than trained ratings. In Paper 3 we investigated whether changes in naïve ratings over time depended on treatment condition. Consistent with the underlying theories of change in the respective treatments, TBCT couples improved more from pre&ndash;therapy to post&ndash;therapy, but IBCT couples improved more from post&ndash;therapy to 2&ndash;year follow&ndash;up. Taken together, the findings in this dissertation support communication improvements in couples following therapy termination, and the utility of innovative methods of communication assessment.

Occult Pneumothoraces in Acute Trauma Patients
Introduction: Many traumatic pneumothoraces (PTX) are not seen on initial chest radiograph (CR) (occult PTX) but are detected only on computed tomography (CT). Although CR remains the first tool for detecting PTX, most trauma patients with significant thoracoabdominal injuries will receive both CT and CR. The primary objective of this study was to retrospectively determine the effectiveness of CR for detecting PTX in trauma patients. Our hypotheses were that CR is a sensitive indicator of PTX on CT, that chest pain and shortness of breath are good predictors of PTX on CR, and that we could determine other predictors of PTX on CR.
      Methods: All trauma patients presenting to our Level I trauma center with a CT-diagnosed PTX over a 2-year period who had both a CR and a chest CT were included. The CT reading was considered the gold standard for PTX diagnosis. Electronic medical records were searched using key words for diagnoses, symptoms, demographics, and radiologic results. We recorded the official radiologist readings for both CR and CT (positive or negative) and the size of the PTX on CT (large, moderate, small, or tiny). The outcome variable was dichotomized based on presence or absence of PTX detected on CR. Descriptive statistics and v2 tests were used for univariate analysis. A regressionanalysis was performed to determine characteristics predictive of a PTX on CR, and 1 variable was added to the model for every 10 positive CRs. With equal-size groups, this study has the power of 80% to detect a 10% absolute difference in single predictors of PTX on CR with 45 subjects in each group.
      Results: There were 134 CT-documented PTXs included in the study. Mean age was 42, and 74% were men. For 66 (49%) patients, PTX was detected on CR (sensitivity¼50%). The CR detected 30% of small PTX, 35% of moderate PTX, and 33% of large PTX. Comparing patients with and without PTX on CR, there were no significant differences in shortness of breath or chest pain. There no relationships between PTX detected on CR and age, gender, penetrating versus blunt injury, bilaterality of the PTX, or presence of lung contusion or hemothorax on CT. After adjusting for all significant variables, predictor of a PTX detected on CR was air in the tissue on CR (adjusted odds ratio OR¼3.8) and PTX size (compared to a tiny PTX, adjusted OR¼2.0 for a small PTX, 7.5 for a moderate PTX, and 51 for a large PTX). Chest tubes were used in 89% of patients with PTX on CR and 44% of patients with PTX only on CT (difference 45%; 95% confidence interval 30, 58).
      Conclusion: Factors associated with PTX on CR included air in the soft tissue on CR and size of the PTX. Even when PTX is not apparent on CR, 44% of these PTXs received placement of a chest tube. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):437–443.

Yoga as a complementary treatment of depression: effects of traits and moods on treatment outcome.
Preliminary findings support the potential of yoga as a complementary treatment of depressed patients who are taking anti-depressant medications but who are only in partial remission. The purpose of this article is to present further data on the intervention, focusing on individual differences in psychological, emotional and biological processes affecting treatment outcome. Twenty-seven women and 10 men were enrolled in the study, of whom 17 completed the intervention and pre- and post-intervention assessment data. The intervention consisted of 20 classes led by senior Iyengar yoga teachers, in three courses of 20 yoga classes each. All participants were diagnosed with unipolar major depression in partial remission. Psychological and biological characteristics were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and participants rated their mood states before and after each class. Significant reductions were shown for depression, anger, anxiety, neurotic symptoms and low frequency heart rate variability in the 17 completers. Eleven out of these completers achieved remission levels post-intervention. Participants who remitted differed from the non-remitters at intake on several traits and on physiological measures indicative of a greater capacity for emotional regulation. Moods improved from before to after the yoga classes. Yoga appears to be a promising intervention for depression; it is cost-effective and easy to implement. It produces many beneficial emotional, psychological and biological effects, as supported by observations in this study. The physiological methods are especially useful as they provide objective markers of the processes and effectiveness of treatment. These observations may help guide further clinical application of yoga in depression and other mental health disorders, and future research on the processes and mechanisms.

Forelimb EMG-based trigger to control an electronic spinal bridge to enable hindlimb stepping after a complete spinal cord lesion in rats
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					A complete spinal cord transection results in loss of all supraspinal motor control below the level of the injury. The neural circuitry in the lumbosacral spinal cord, however, can generate locomotor patterns in the hindlimbs of rats and cats with the aid of motor training, epidural stimulation and/or administration of monoaminergic agonists. We hypothesized that there are patterns of EMG signals from the forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion that uniquely represent a signal for the &#8220;intent&#8221; to step with the hindlimbs. These observations led us to determine whether this type of &#8220;indirect&#8221; volitional control of stepping can be achieved after a complete spinal cord injury. The objective of this study was to develop an electronic bridge across the lesion of the spinal cord to facilitate hindlimb stepping after a complete mid-thoracic spinal cord injury in adult rats.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We developed an electronic spinal bridge that can detect specific patterns of EMG activity from the forelimb muscles to initiate electrical-enabling motor control (eEmc) of the lumbosacral spinal cord to enable quadrupedal stepping after a complete spinal cord transection in rats. A moving window detection algorithm was implemented in a small microprocessor to detect biceps brachii EMG activity bilaterally that then was used to initiate and terminate epidural stimulation in the lumbosacral spinal cord. We found dominant frequencies of 180&#8211;220 Hz in the EMG of the forelimb muscles during active periods, whereas these frequencies were between 0&#8211;10 Hz when the muscles were inactive.
				
				
					
						Results and conclusions
					
					Once the algorithm was validated to represent kinematically appropriate quadrupedal stepping, we observed that the algorithm could reliably detect, initiate, and facilitate stepping under different pharmacological conditions and at various treadmill speeds.

Boarding of Admitted Patients: Comparison Between Emergency Department and Inpatient Nurses
Introduction: The boarding of admitted patients in the emergency department (ED) is a major cause of crowding and access block. One solution is boarding admitted patients in inpatient ward (W) hallways. This study queried and compared ED and W nurses’ opinions toward ED and W boarding. It also assessed their preferred boarding location if they were patients.
      Methods: A survey administered to a convenience sample of ED and W nurses was performed in a 631-bed academic medical center (30,000 admissions/year) with a 68-bed ED (70,000 visits/year). We identified nurses as ED or W, and if W, whether they had previously worked in the ED. The nurses were asked if there were any circumstances where admitted patients should be boarded in ED or W hallways. They were also asked their preferred location if they were admitted as a patient. Six clinical scenarios were then presented, and the nurses’ opinions on boarding based on each scenario were queried. 
      Results: Ninety nurses completed the survey, with a response rate of 60%; 35 (39%) were current ED nurses (cED), 40 (44%) had previously worked in the ED (pED). For all nurses surveyed 46 (52%) believed admitted patients should board in the ED. Overall, 52 (58%) were opposed to W boarding, with 20% of cED versus 83% of current W (cW) nurses (P < 0.0001), and 28% of pED versus 85% of nurses never having worked in the ED (nED) were opposed (P < 0.001). If admitted as patients themselves, 43 (54%) of all nurses preferred W boarding, with 82% of cED versus 33% of cW nurses (P < 0.0001) and 74% of pED versus 34% nED nurses (P = 0.0007). The most commonly cited reasons for opposition to hallway boarding were lack of monitoring and patient privacy. For the  6 clinical scenarios, significant differences in opinion regarding W boarding existed in all but 2 cases: a patient with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but requiring oxygen, and an intubated, unstable sepsis patient.
      Conclusion: Inpatient nurses and those who have never worked in the ED are more opposed to inpatient boarding than ED nurses and nurses who have worked previously in the ED. Primary nursing concerns about boarding are lack of monitoring and privacy in hallway beds. Nurses admitted as patients seemed to prefer not being boarded where they work. ED and inpatient nurses seemed to agree that unstable or potentially unstable patients should remain in the ED but disagreed on where more stable patients should board. West J Emerg Med 2013;

Study Protocol: The Back pain Outcomes using Longitudinal Data (BOLD) Registry
AbstractBackgroundBack pain is one of the most important causes of functional limitation, disability, and utilization of health care resources for adults of all ages, but especially among older adults. Despite the high prevalence of back pain in this population, important questions remain unanswered regarding the comparative effectiveness of commonly used diagnostic tests and treatments in the elderly. The overall goal of the Back pain Outcomes using Longitudinal Data (BOLD) project is to establish a rich, sustainable registry to describe the natural history and evaluate prospectively the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of interventions for patients 65 and older with back pain.Methods/designBOLD is enrolling 5,000 patients&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;65&#8201;years old who present to a primary care physician with a new episode of back pain. We are recruiting study participants from three integrated health systems (Kaiser-Permanente Northern California, Henry Ford Health System in Detroit and Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates/ Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in Boston). Registry patients complete validated, standardized measures of pain, back pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life at enrollment and 3, 6 and 12&#8201;months later. We also have available for analysis the clinical and administrative data in the participating health systems&#8217; electronic medical records. Using registry data, we will conduct an observational cohort study of early imaging compared to no early imaging among patients with new episodes of back pain. The aims are to: 1) identify predictors of early imaging and; 2) compare pain, functional outcomes, diagnostic testing and treatment utilization of patients who receive early imaging versus patients who do not receive early imaging. In terms of predictors, we will examine patient factors as well as physician factors.DiscussionBy establishing the BOLD registry, we are creating a resource that contains patient-reported outcome measures as well as electronic medical record data for elderly patients with back pain. The richness of our data will allow better matching for comparative effectiveness studies than is currently possible with existing datasets. BOLD will enrich the existing knowledge base regarding back pain in the elderly to help clinicians and patients make informed, evidence-based decisions regarding their care.

“I Can’t Walk!” Acute Thrombosis of Descending Aorta Causing Paraplegia
A 50-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute, bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation, as well as absent pulses bilaterally. Computed tomography angiography showed complete occlusion of the aorta below the inferior mesenteric artery, extending to the iliac bifurcations. Echocardiographic findings showed severe systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction of 15%) and cryptic cardiogenic shock in spite of stable vital signs. Prior to early operative intervention, an early goal-oriented hemodynamic strategy of shock management resulted in the resolution of motor and sensory deficits. After definitive surgical intervention, the patient was discharged neurologically intact. Acute aortic occlusion is frequently accompanied by myocardial dysfunction, which can be from mild to severe. The most severe form can even occur with normalvital signs or occult cardiogenic shock. Early detection and goal-directed preoperative hemodynamic optimization, along with surgical intervention in the ED, is required to optimize outcomes. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(5):424–427.

The San Francisco Centalized Intake Unit: A Description of Participants and Service Episodes
Using client data from the publicly-funded drug abuse treatment system in San Francisco, California, this study compared demographic characteristics of clients of a central intake unit (CIU) to those of clients who did not access the CIU, and examined characteristics of CIU episodes. The San Francisco CIU was intended to make appropriate referrals of CIU clients to treatment programs, and 47.9% of these episodes were followed by a subsequent treatment episode within 90-days of admission to the CIU. Of all individuals in the treatment system, a quarter had been to the CIU and as many as 9% of all treatment episodes were at the CIU. The majority of CIU episodes were short, consistent with the nature of assessment and referral services. These data suggest that incorporating strategies to enhance admissions to post-CIU services could increase CIU impacts. The post-CIU admission patterns were consistent with greater availability of outpatient and day treatment slots in the system. The pre-CIU admission patterns suggested that treatment agencies in the system used the CIU as a means to transition their clients into additional or longer-term treatment.

Implementation of an efficacious intervention for high risk women in Mexico: protocol for a multi-site randomized trial with a parallel study of organizational factors
AbstractBackgroundStudies of implementation of efficacious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention
interventions are rare, especially in resource-poor settings, but important, because they have
the potential to increase the impact of interventions by improving uptake and sustainability.
Few studies have focused on provider and organizational factors that may influence uptake
and fidelity to core intervention components. Using a hybrid design, we will study the
implementation of an efficacious intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
among female sex workers (FSWs) in 12 cities across Mexico. Our protocol will test a &apos;trainthe-
trainer&apos; implementation model for transporting the Mujer Segura (Healthy Woman)
intervention into community-based organizations (CBOs).MethodsWe have partnered with Mexican Foundation for Family Planning (Mexfam), a nongovernmental
organization that has CBOs throughout Mexico. At each CBO, trained
ethnographers will survey CBO staff on characteristics of their organization and on their
attitudes toward their CBO and toward the implementation of evidence-based interventions
(EBIs). Then, after CBO staff recruit a sample of 80 eligible FSWs and deliver a standardcare,
didactic intervention to 40 women randomly selected from that pool, a Mexfam staff
person will be trained in the Mujer Segura intervention and will then train other counselors to
deliver Mujer Segura to the 40 remaining participating FSWs. FSW participants will receive
a baseline behavioral assessment and be tested for HIV and STIs (syphilis, gonorrhea, and
chlamydia); they will be reassessed at six months post-intervention to measure for possible
intervention effects. At the same time, both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected
on the implementation process, including measures of counselors&apos; fidelity to the intervention
model. After data collection at each CBO is complete, the relative efficacy of the Mujer
Segura intervention will be analyzed, and across CBOs, correlations will be examined
between individual and organizational provider characteristics and intervention efficacy.DiscussionThis cooperative, bi-national research study will provide critical insights into barriers and
facilitating factors associated with implementing interventions in CBOs using the &apos;train the
trainer&apos; model. Our work builds on similar scale-up strategies that have been effective in the
United States. This study has the potential to increase our knowledge of the generalizability
of such strategies across health issues, national contexts, and organizational contexts.

Physical and biological dynamics of surfzone bacterial pollution : sources, transports, and removal mechanisms
Nearshore concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are controlled by a complex array of physical and biological processes. The studies herein evaluate the contribution of several such process to coastal FIB dynamics using laboratory studies, mathematical modeling, and fieldwork. Two field sites are discussed; Border Fields State Beach (BFSB) and Huntington Beach, both sites of chronic FIB contamination in Southern California. At Huntington Beach field measurements of alongshore currents and horizontal diffusion were used to parameterize a suite of individual based particle tracking models. These models were used diagnostically to evaluate the contribution of physics and mortality to FIB dynamics. Advection and diffusion were found to explain a significant fraction of surfzone FIB decay, but played a lesser role offshore, suggesting that offshore FIB loss may be dominated by mortality rather than physics. No single mechanism was identified that best-explained FIB mortality at this beach, although cross-shore variable mortality mechanisms had higher skill than spatially constant ones. At BFSB the relative contribution of physics and mortality to nearshore FIB dynamics varied temporally rather than in the cross-shore. Generalized linear model analyses at this beach linked FIB contamination to an anthropogenic beach nourishment. Field-based microcosm experiments (using FIB from this source), in combination with surfzone bacterial monitoring, showed that FIB concentrations were controlled by rapid mortality of a "sensitive" FIB fraction and physical dilution/mixing, which became steadily more important as sensitive FIB died off, leaving behind a resistant community. Co-existing populations of sensitive and resistant FIB were also observed in laboratory experiments evaluating the effects of phytoplankton concentration on FIB mortality. Mortality in these experiments was biphasic, with loss of sensitive FIB occurring > 10x faster than resistant FIB. Notably, bloom concentrations of phytoplankton halved mortality rates of both FIB groups, enhancing survivorship. This signal was not obscured by physical transport/mixing (Huntington Beach particle tracking model), suggesting that phytoplankton have the potential to be an important factor controlling FIB concentrations. This dissertation highlights the importance of both physics and biology as factors controlling nearshore FIB and points to phytoplankton communities as an under-evaluated control on FIB growth/mortality in marine systems

The Effects of Land Use on the Mobility of Elderly and Disabled and Their Homecare Workers, and the Effects of Care on Client Mobility: Findings from Contra Costa, California
This study looks at the relationships among land use; the mobility of disabled and elderly recipients of public home healthcare; the mobility of their homecare workers; and how much care those homecare workers provide. The findings are based on nearly 1,300 survey responses from clients and homecare workers in the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program in Contra Costa County, California, a publicly funded program for individuals with disabilities who have low incomes. The homecare workers I surveyed belong to the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). The qualitative data and descriptive statistics paint a portrait of both populations’ transportation habits and challenges. Regression analyses, controlling for variables such as car ownership, disability level, gender, age, and race, tested the interactions between the variables of interest in six hypotheses.
      The results are complex and occasionally conflicting, yet patterns appear. For example, the IHSS clients have car-use rates far lower than average, with only 10% driving themselves when they leave home, and almost half live alone; these facts, combined with their low incomes and disabilities, mean that IHSS clients are sensitive to how much transportation assistance they receive in terms of how often they leave home and what destinations they are able to reach. They also respond to land use characteristics, especially when measured at the neighborhood scale, with those living in higher density and accessibility areas generally experiencing greater mobility. The homecare workers similarly have low incomes and use alternative modes of transportation more often than do Contra Costa commuters on average. Unlike their clients, homecare workers living in higher density and accessibility areas generally experienced increased travel challenges. But living closer to their clients was associated with being able to provide more effective care, as was having an easier commute measured by other variables. The more care provided, the greater mobility their clients experienced.
      The populations of care recipients and professional homecare workers are growing as, among other trends, the proportion of senior citizens increases and families disperse across the country or world. Understanding mobility barriers as well as ways to facilitate efficient and effective care provision becomes all the more important. This study describes transportation problems that IHSS clients and caregivers encounter and points to certain possible responses, in particular expanding the transportation assistance that caregivers are able to provide.

NELL-1 Injection Maintains Long Bone Quantity and Quality in Ovariectomy-Induced Osteoporotic Senile Rat Model
Over 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and is the predominant cause of fractures in the elderly. Treatment of fractures in the setting of osteoporosis is complicated by a suboptimal bone regenerative response due to a decline in the number of osteoblasts, their function and survival. Consequently, an osteogenic therapeutic to prevent and treat fractures in osteoporotic patients is needed. NELL-1 (Nel-like molecule-1), a novel osteoinductive growth factor, has been shown to promote bone regeneration. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the capacity of recombinant NELL-1 to prevent ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis in a senile rat model. Ten month old female Sprague Dawley rats underwent either sham surgery or OVX. Subsequently, 50 uL of 600 ug/ml NELL-1 lyophilized onto 0-50 um tricalcium phosphate (TCP) carrier was injected into the femoral bone marrow cavity while phosphate buffered saline (PBS) control was injected into the contralateral femur. Our microCT results showed that OVX+PBS/TCP control femurs showed a continuous decrease in bone volume (BV) and bone mineral density (BMD) from 2 to 8 weeks post-OVX. In contrast, OVX+NELL-1/TCP femurs showed resistance to OVX-induced bone resorption showing BV and BMD levels similar to that of SHAM femurs at 8 weeks post-OVX. Histology showed increased endosteal woven bone, as well as decreased adipocytes in the bone marrow of NELL-1 treated femurs compared to control. NELL-1 treated femurs also showed increased immunostaining for bone differentiation markers Osteopontin (OPN) and Osteocalcin (OCN). These findings were validated in vitro, in which overexpression of NELL-1 in OVX bone marrow stem cells resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation. Thus, NELL-1 effectively enhances in situ osteogenesis in the bone marrow, making it potentially useful in the prevention and treatment of osteoporotic fractures.

The Effects of Community Violence Exposure on Adolescents' Health
The relations between community violence exposure (CVE) during adolescence and a selection of six co&ndash;occurring health related outcomes were investigated using data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The mechanism by which CVE affected adolescent health was then examined through depression and self regulation. The health related outcomes comprised self-reported assessments of general health, physical problems, BMI (Body Mass Index), sleep problems, physical activity and sedentary behavior from approximately 14,000 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19. The adolescents were divided into a younger and older group with the break at 16 years and older; analyses were conducted separately for each age group and examined at two time points separated by one year. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the effects of CVE on adolescent health. The mediation pathways through depression and self regulation and whether these relations varied by gender were tested using multiple mediation analyses (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008). Gender, socioeconomic status, and childhood maltreatment were entered as control variables. Findings indicated CVE affected all health related outcomes but were minimal for sedentary behavior and BMI. In general, both depression and self regulation mediated the effect of CVE on general health, physical problems, sleep, and physical activity. Moderating effects revealed CVE had a more adverse impact on sedentary behavior and BMI among females at the second time point.

Patient-specific modeling of cardiac electromechanics in dyssynchronous heart failure
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an increasingly popular therapy for heart failure patients with intraventricular conduction delay, such as left bundle branch block. However, clinical trials with CRT have revealed that about 30% of patients may be classified as non-responders mainly due to a lack of predictive, mechanism-based objective criteria for patient selection. In addition, even responders exhibit variable degrees of benefit from the therapy, implying that it is not always performed in an optimal fashion. In order to predict and optimize the outcomes of CRT on individual patients, methods for generating anatomically detailed three- dimensional finite element models of failing human heart and estimating various patient-specific model parameter values from clinical measurements in heart failure patients are developed. The three-dimensional finite element model was generated from cardiac computed tomography images obtained at end-diastole. The fiber architecture was modeled by computing the eigenvectors from nodal fields of diffusion coefficients obtained from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI). The endocardial activation maps, which serve as initial conditions in estimating the three-dimensional activation sequence of the myocardium, were generated by fitting endocardial activation time measurements from electroanatomic mapping. Lastly, a method for estimating left ventricular volumes from transthoracic echocardiograms was proposed. These methods provide efficient techniques to estimate patient-specific model parameters and therefore, will prove useful in patient- specific model development and ultimately, in predicting clinical outcomes of CRT on individual heart failure patients

Possible transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection from an elite controller to a patient who progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a case report
Abstract
				
				
					
						Introduction
					Most individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, exhibit persistent virus replication and declining CD4+ cell numbers, and progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome within 10&#8201;years of infection. Elite controllers are rare individuals with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection who can maintain undetectable plasma virus levels and remain asymptomatic without antiretroviral therapy. It has been proposed that elite controllers benefit from being infected with attenuated human immunodeficiency virus-1 variants.
				
				
					
						Case presentation
					A 31-year-old African woman presented with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection during pregnancy and was diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Subsequently, her husband, a 31-year-old African man, was tested and found to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus-1. His plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 ribonucleic acid level was found to be below the limit of detection of the clinical assay.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					This report provides evidence for the first described case of human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection possibly transmitted from an elite controller to a patient who progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. This observation strengthens the case against avirulence as a mechanism that protects elite controllers.

Design of a Thermally-Actuated Gas Lift Safety Valve
Gas-lifted oil wells are susceptible to failure through malfunction of gas lift valve assemblies (GLV). One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well annulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This is a growing concern as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions, and repair and monitoring become difficult. Currently no safeguard exists in the GLV to prevent product passage in the event of check valve failure. In this paper a design and operational procedures are proposed for a thermally-actuated positive-locking safety valve to seal the GLV in the event of check valve failure. A thermal model of the well and GLV system is developed and compared to well data to verify feasibility of a thermally-actuated safety valve. A 3× scale prototype safety valve is built and tested under simulated failure scenarios and well start-up scenarios. Realistic well temperatures in the range of 20C to 70C are used. Results demonstrate valve closure in response to simulated check valve failure and valve opening during simulated well start-up.

Variation in Specialists’ Reported Hospitalization Practices for Children with Blunt Abdominal Trauma
Introduction:Children with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) are often hospitalized despite no intervention.We identified factors associated with emergency department (ED) disposition of children with BAT and differing computed tomography (CT) findings.
      Methods:We surveyed pediatric and general emergency physicians (EPs), pediatric and trauma surgeons regarding care of two hypothetical asymptomatic patients: a 9-year-old struck by a slow-moving car (Case 1) and an 11-month-old who fell 10 feet (Case 2). We presented various abdominal CT findings and asked physicians about disposition preferences. We evaluated predictors of patient discharge using multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for hospital and ED characteristics, and clinician experience. PediatricEPsserved as the reference group.
      Results:Of 2,003 eligible surveyed, 636 (32%) responded. For normal CTs, 99% would discharge in Case 1 and 88% in Case 2. Prominent specialty differences included: for trace intraperitoneal fluid (TIF), 68% would discharge in Case 1 and 57% in Case 2. Patients with TIF were less likely to be discharged by pediatric surgeons (Case 1: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32, 0.82; Case 2: OR 0.49,95% CI 0.30, 0.79).Patients with renal contusions were less likely to be discharged by pediatric surgeons (Case 1: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.95)andmore likely by general EPs (Case 1: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.25, 2.69; Case 2: OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.14, 4.89).
      Conclusion:Substantial variation exists between specialties in reported hospitalization practices of asymptomatic children after abdominal trauma with minor CT findings. Better evidence is needed to guide disposition decisions. West J Emerg Med. 0000;00(0)000

Patient-Based Endodontic Outcomes, Systematic Reviews of Pathology and Pain Prevalences
Patient-based research provides insight into real-world endodontics. Cross-sectional studies describe the health status of populations. Root canal-associated pain is a source of fear for patients, a concern of dentists, and is remembered and shared. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and defined searches selected articles in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO databases. Prevalence of periapical radiolucency and root canal treatment were calculated. L'Abbe plots evaluated the influence of root canal treatment on pain prevalence and severity. 5% of teeth had periapical radiolucencies, 9% endodontically treated, 37% of treated teeth had periapical radiolucencies, and 2% of untreated teeth had periapical radiolucencies. Pre-treatment, 24 hour, and 1 week pain prevalences were 81(28)%, 40(24)%, and 11(14)%. Pre-treatment, 24 hour, and 1 week pain severities, were 54(24)%, 24(12)%, and 5(5)%. L'Abbe plots revealed a decrease in pain prevalence and severity. Prevalence of periapical radiolucency and root canal treatment was very high. Pain prevalence and severities decreased after treatment.

					The prevalence of sub-clinical P. falciparum parasitaemia was low in Maputo, whether determined by microscopy (0.4%) or PCR (1.9%), but substantially higher in Mocuba (7.6 and 14.7%, respectively). Nested PCR detected nearly 70% more cases of sub-clinical parasitaemia than microscopy, but differences occur by locality. HIV-1 infected persons were more likely to be sub-clinically parasitaemic than HIV-1 uninfected individuals recruited from the same geographic areas. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole use did not substantially reduce sub-clinical parasitaemia.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Dried blood spots are a convenient and sensitive technique for detecting sub-clinical infection with P. falciparum by nested PCR. Prevalence of P. falciparum is substantially lower in Maputo where malaria control programmes have been more active than in the rural town of Mocuba. In Mocuba, among those presenting for HIV-1 counseling and testing, the prevalence of P. falciparum is substantially higher in those who test positive for HIV-1 than those without HIV-1 infection. The clinical implications of sub-clinical P. falciparum infection among HIV-1 infected persons warrant additional study.

Evidence for sleep-dependent memory consolidation in human and mice
Sleep has been implicated as playing an important role in memory consolidation. Considerable indirect evidence suggests a role for sleep in hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents. Hippocampal "place cells" that were active during maze running were more likely to be activated during subsequent sleep, a phenomenon known as neural replay. In addition to hippocampal neural replay, it has been asserted that the hippocampus and cortex communicate during sleep by means of hippocampal generated high frequency burst patterns, which are temporally correlated with spindles in the medial prefrontal cortex during slow- wave sleep. Despite this evidence not a single study specifically demonstrates improved memory after sleep in rodents, although several studies demonstrate deficits in memory due to sleep deprivation. The most commonly used approach to examine behavioral effects of sleep on memory consolidation has been the sleep deprivation method. Sleep deprivation studies typically find that handling the animals during the sleep phase (i.e. depriving sleep) leads to memory deficits. Although this may be suggestive that sleep is important for memory, there may be other explanations for the impairment, such as stress-related deficits from the constant handling. In Chapter 1, we reexamine the effects of sleep deprivation (i.e. gentle handling) on rodent Pavlovian fear conditioning. We found that the deprivation method itself (i.e., gentle handling) induced deficits independent of sleep suggesting that the sleep deprivation method might be a problematic way to examine the role of sleep in memory consolidation. In Chapter 2, we detailed a naturalistic method to examine whether Pavlovian fear conditioning is enhanced after a sleep phase, as compared with an equivalent passage of an awake phase. We found that sleep selectively enhanced hippocampus-dependent memory in mice. In Chapter 3, we investigated the relationship between pharmacologically induced sleep and Pavlovian fear conditioning. We found that therapeutic doses of zolpidem (0.01-0.5 mg/kg) did not affect memory acquisition or consolidation. Additionally, we found that 8 mg/kg of zolpidem induced deep sleep. Next, we explored the effects of pharmacologically induced deep sleep and memory consolidation. We found that a drug-induced "mouse nap," an episode of deep sleep during the awake phase, selectively enhanced contextual memory. Next, we wanted to expand our findings to human memory. In Chapter 4, we utilized a nap paradigm to examine how sleep affected memory compared to caffeine and an awake-placebo control. We found that sleep improved consolidation of verbal memory compared to both caffeine and the control. Lastly, in Chapter 5, we took advantage of the nap paradigm to study how sleep integrates new information with prior experiences. We found that REM sleep, compared to NREM sleep and quiet wake, improved problem solving by assimilating new information with past experience to create a richer network for future use. Both the rodent and human evidence provide strong support for the critical role of sleep in stabilizing and reorganizing new information

Isoform Specific Regulation of miRNA 21 and miRNA 194-2 by HNF4&#945;
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4&#945; (HNF4&#945;/NR2A1) is a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors which plays a crucial role in the early development of the liver, intestine/colon, pancreas and kidney as well as maintaining metabolic and organismal homeostasis. Based on usage of alternative promoters (P1 and P2) and alternate splicing, it is estimated that nine different splice variants of HNF4&#945; exist. The P1- and P2-driven variants differ by 16 amino acids in their N-terminal amino terminal (AB) domain that encodes an activation function (AF-1). It has been shown previously that expression of P1-driven HNF4&#945; protein is decreased in different human cancers such as hepatocellular, gastric, renal and colorectal carcinomas, while P2-driven HNF4&#945; is either unchanged or up regulated. HNF4&#945; is known to play an important role during early embryonic colon development where it regulates genes related to epithelial function. In addition, HNF4&#945; has been shown to function in protecting the epithelium during experimental colitis in young adult mice. The functional consequences of the up regulation of the P2-driven HNF4&#945; in human cancer are not known.                                   In Chapter 2 a potential link between levels of specific splice variants of HNF4&#945; and miRNA 21, an oncogenic miRNA is investigated. miR-21 has been implicated in the development, growth, progression and metastasis of different types of cancers including colorectal, hepatocellular and pancreatic cancers. A series of in vitro assays using human colorectal cancer cells are performed, miRNA-21 levels is detected using stem loop RT-PCR. The results show that ectopic expression of P2-driven HNF4&#945; preferentially regulates miRNA 21 in human embryonic kidney and colon cancer cell lines that do not express endogenous HNF4&#945;. Knockdown of P2-driven HNF4&#945; in a colon cancer cell line that expresses endogenous HNF4&#945;, results in preferential decrease of miRNA 21 levels in a different human colorectal cancer cells (Caco-2). In order to elucidate the potential functional significance of miRNA-21 regulation by HNF4&#945;, both P1- and P2-driven HNF4&#945; were knocked down using siRNA, This results in downregulation of miRNA 21 as well as reduction in cell number. Ectopic expression of a miRNA 21 mimic in the HNF4&#945; knockdown cells partially restored the cell count. The molecular mechanism by which HNF4&#945; regulates miRNA 21 expression is explored in experiments that show that HNF4&#945; binds the promoter region of miRNA 21 and that P2-driven HNF4&#945; preferentially activates the human miRNA 21 promoter in a transient transfection system. Taken together, these observations lead us to propose that P2-driven HNF4&#945; preferentially activates miRNA 21, an oncogenic miRNA, thus suggesting a functional significance of P2-driven HNF4&#945; upregulation in colon cancer.                          In Chapter 3, the potential functional role of isoform-specific HNF4&#945; and miRNA 21, in a mouse model of chemical (DSS) induced colitis is investigated in which colitis is induced by the addition of DSS in the drinking water. Mortality, rectal bleeding, colon length, and spleen/body weight ratios were all differentially affected in both male and female transgenic mice (expresses only P2- driven HNF4&#945;) compared to WT indicating an enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic mice to DSS. Immunoblotting and stem loop RT PCR performed on colonic tissue isolated from the DSS-treated mice showed that the expression of both HNF4&#945; and miRNA 21 correlates with better recovery from DSS-induced colitis. These findings suggest that HNF4&#945;-mediated regulation of miRNA 21 may play an important role in colitis and could be used as a marker for improved prognosis of colitis.                    In Chapter 4, a potential link between specific splice variants of HNF4&#945; and miRNA 194-2 are explored. miR-194-2 has been implicated in intestinal epithelial differentiation, cell invasion and inhibition of Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). Ectopic expression of P2-driven human HNF4&#945; resulted in a preferential upregulation of miRNA 194-2 in human embryonic kidney and colon cancer cell lines. miRNA 194-2 levels were also found to be elevated in the distal colon of transgenic mice that expresses only P2-driven HNF4&#945;. These results suggest that miRNA-194-2, like miRNA-21, may be preferentially regulated by P2-driven HNF4&#945;. Further investigation is required to address the potential functional significance of this regulation.                            Finally, in Chapter 5 the implications of the results of Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are discussed in detail. The importance of the role of HNF4&#945; in general regulating these two microRNAs (miR-21 and miR 194-2) is considered as well as the relevance of the differential expression by the P1- and P2-driven isoforms. Finally, the role of these microRNAs and HNF4&#945; splice variants are discussed in the broader context of the function of the colon in both the normal and diseased states.

The Hip Fracture Surgery in Elderly Patients (HIPELD) study: protocol for a randomized, multicenter controlled trial evaluating the effect of xenon on postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery
Abstract


Background
Strategies to protect the brain from postoperative delirium (POD) after hip fracture are urgently needed. The development of delirium often is associated with the loss of independence, poor functional recovery, and increased morbidity, as well as increases in length of hospital stay, discharges to nursing facilities, and healthcare costs. We hypothesize that xenon may reduce the burden of POD, (i) by avoiding the need to provide anesthesia with a drug that targets the &#947;-amino-butyric acid (GABA)A receptor and (ii) through beneficial anesthetic and organ-protective effects.


Methods and design
An international, multicenter, phase 2, prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel group and controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of POD, diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery under general anesthesia with xenon or sevoflurane, for a period of 4 days post surgery (primary outcome) is planned. Secondary objectives are to compare the incidence of POD between xenon and sevoflurane, to evaluate the incidence of POD from day 5 post surgery until discharge from hospital, to determine the time to first POD diagnosis, to evaluate the duration of POD, to evaluate the evolution of the physiological status of the patients in the postoperative period, to evaluate the recovery parameters, to collect preliminary data to evaluate the economical impact of POD in the postoperative period and to collect safety data. Patients are eligible if they are older aged (&#8805; 75 years) and assigned to a planned hip fracture surgery within 48 h after the hip fracture. Furthermore, patients need to be willing and able to complete the requirements of this study including the signature of the written informed consent. A total of 256 randomized patients in the 10 participating centers will be recruited, that is, 128 randomized patients in each of the 2 study groups (receiving either xenon or sevoflurane).

Physical Activity and Depressive Symptoms among Korean Americans in Los Angeles
Korean Americans are among the most rapidly growing U.S. population groups, yet relatively little is known about factors associated with their mental health.  Depressive symptoms have been documented among Korean Americans, but targeting depression in this group may be challenging due to cultural norms that inhibit discussion of emotions and structural barriers to the receipt of health care.  Physical activity (PA) has been negatively associated with depression in other groups and may be a promising means of addressing depressive symptoms among Korean Americans, yet the relationship between PA and depression has not yet been examined in this group.  Moreover, few studies have investigated factors associated with PA among Korean Americans.  Prevalence of tradition gender roles among Korean Americans suggest that gender may be important to consider in studies of PA and depression in this group.  To address gaps in the extant literature, two studies are conducted to examine PA and depressive symptoms among Korean American women and men.  The first study examines PA in detail and evaluates factors associated with obtaining minimally recommended levels of PA.  The second study examines PA in relation to depressive symptoms, independently and in association with health insurance status and chronic disease diagnosis.  Participants (N=260) were recruited at Los Angeles Korean churches. Data were collected on-site using interviewer administered Korean language questionnaires.  PA was assessed using the International PA Questionnaire, Short Form (IPAQ-SF).  Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Eight Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).  Data are evaluated among the total sample and by gender.  PA is described in terms of overall levels, intensity, common types of and barriers to activity, and guidelines knowledge.  Logistic regression analyses are used to examine odds of meeting minimal PA guidelines in relation to guidelines knowledge, the most commonly reported barrier to PA (lack of time), social and environmental support for PA, presence of children in the home, weight status, and chronic disease diagnosis (hypertension, heart disease, or diabetes), controlling for demographic covariates.  PA is evaluated in keeping with the 2007 ACSM/AHA PA guidelines, with secondary analyses to consider the 2008 PA Guideline for Americans.  Overall levels of depressive symptoms are examined and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used to evaluate symptoms consistent with moderate or lesser levels of depression in relation to PA, chronic disease diagnosis, and health insurance status, controlling for demographic covariates.  Seemingly unrelated regression analyses are conducted to examine relationships evaluated in OLS analyses of depressive symptoms while jointly estimating total PA as a function of factors examined in relation to meeting minimal PA guidelines.    Rates of PA and depressive symptoms observed in the sample were higher than those reported for the U.S. population.  Average levels of depressive symptoms were greater among women than men in the sample.  Overall, PA levels did not vary by gender and PA was not independently associated with depressive symptoms among women or men.  Among men, health status was a determinant of the association between: (a) PA and depression and (b) health insurance status and depression.  Specifically, among men diagnosed with a chronic disease, depressive symptoms were lower among those who met, versus do not meet, minimal PA guidelines and higher among those without, versus with, health insurance coverage.  Among women, lack of health insurance coverage was independently associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms whereas heath status was the factor most strongly associated with PA.  Odds of obtaining minimally recommended levels of PA were greater among women with, versus without, chronic disease diagnoses.  Guidelines knowledge and reporting time as a barrier were the factors most strongly associated with PA among men; odds of obtaining minimally recommended levels of PA were greater among men with, versus without, PA guidelines knowledge and lower among men who did, versus did not, report time as a PA barrier.  Similarities were observed between Koreans and other Americans in terms of PA guidelines knowledge as well as common types of PA and barriers to PA.   Failure to observe a relationship between PA and depression was surprising.  Additional studies are needed to determine the reason for the findings, and to examine the relationship between PA and depressive symptoms among Korean Americans.  Findings suggest that interventions may be needed to address depressive symptoms in this group and that gender differences may be important to consider in these efforts.  Health status may be important to consider when targeting depression among Korean American men in particular.  Insurance status may also be important to consider in such efforts; additional research is needed to examine the reasons underlying the relationship between insurance status and depression, especially among women.  Despite higher levels of PA observed in the sample in comparison to U.S. population-level estimates, the finding that at least one-fourth of participants failed to obtain minimally recommended levels of PA indicates that efforts to increase PA levels among Korean Americans are needed.  Findings suggest that chronic disease diagnosis may serve as a teachable moment for increasing PA in this group, particularly among women.  Similarities observed between the sample and the larger population in terms of types of PA reported, barriers to activity, and knowledge of PA guidelines demonstrate a low need for tailoring of PA focused materials for Koreans.  Findings expand the limited literatures related to PA and depressive symptoms among Korean Americans and point to numerous directions for future research.
