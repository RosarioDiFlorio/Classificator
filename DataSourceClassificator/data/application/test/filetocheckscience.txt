TECA: A Parallel Toolkit for Extreme Climate Analysis
We present TECA, a parallel toolkit for detecting extreme events in large climate datasets. Modern climate datasets expose parallelism across a number of dimensions: spatial locations, timesteps and ensemble members. We design TECA to exploit these modes of parallelism and demonstrate a prototype implementation for detecting and tracking three classes of extreme events: tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers. We process a modern TB-sized CAM5 simulation dataset with TECA, and demonstrate good runtime performance for the three case studies.

Roles of SPLAYED gene in auxin -mediated organogenesis in Arabidopsis
Auxin plays an important role in many aspects of plant growth and development. Despite the importance of auxin, very little is known about how auxin is produced in plants since auxin biosynthesis in plants is extremely complicated. Characterizing the developmental defects caused by auxin deficiency can help us to improve our current understanding in the mechanisms of plant development. Under yuc4-/- background, a partial auxin deficient gene SYD was isolated through EMS forward screening. Disruption in the SYD gene causes defects that are more severe than in yuc4 mutants when comparing seedlings, leaves, and flowers. These findings suggest that SYD enhances the loss of function yuc4 and plays important roles throughout plant development and organogenesis. Furthermore, the genetic interactions of SYD and three other auxin genes NPY1, CUC1, and PIN1 were investigated and the results suggest that all these genes are likely to be involved in the same pathway

Comprehensive Pyrometry of Incandescent Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene in the Visible and Near Infrared
Pyrometry via blackbody radiation is used to measure temperature of systems throughout physics.  The spectrum, described by Planck's law, depends solely on the temperature T and surface area A of a black source.  However, the derivation of Planck's law considers only the limit where wavelength &lambda; << L, the linear dimension of the source.  Many nanosystems, however, exist in the opposite limit, &lambda; > L, in the visible and near infrared.We investigate this subwavelength limit of thermal radiation by bringing multi-walled carbon nanotubes, for which r << &lambda; < L$, to incandescence via joule heating.  Their light is measured in an optical microscope, and their geometry is measured with a transmission electron microscope.  With complete knowledge of the source geometry and the photon emission, a full characterization of the temperature, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of each nanofilament is possible.  We find that the filaments emit highly polarized light with suprablack effective emissivities, indicative of thermal radiation originating in a phase coherent manner from the nanotube's volume as opposed to its surface area, in concordance with classical electromagnetism.Multiwavelength pyrometry is then performed on graphene, which has linear dimensions in the classical blackbody limit and theoretical gray emission.  This pyrometry allows us to measure the number of layers in the graphene, a result confirmed with absorption measurements in agreement with Kirchoff's law of thermal radiation.  Light emitted from incandescent graphene's bulk is found to be unpolarized, yet exhibits polarization as high as 20% near the sheet edge in accordance with diffraction theory.  However, light polarized to 5% is observed originating from the bulk away from the hot region, which we attribute to anisotropy in the temperature gradient.We also find that as temperature of a nanotube and graphene increases, the signal in the near infrared becomes suppressed compared to the emission models.  As trapped surface states and contaminants on graphene samples shift the Fermi energy away from the Dirac point, long wavelength transitions become disallowed.  Thus, this infrared effect owes to the transparency at long wavelengths of carbon nanostructures with a Fermi level shifted away from the Dirac point, implying that broadband optical modulation in the visible and near infrared is attainable through gating and heating of carbon nanotubes and graphene.

Crystallographic Analysis of a Hammerhead Ribozyme Variant and Its Impact on Catalytic Activity
<div style="text-align: center;"><b>Abstract</b></div><div style="text-align: center;">Eric P. Schultz</div></p><div style="text-align: center;">Crystallographic Analysis of a Hammerhead Ribozyme Variant and Its Impact on Catalytic Activity</div></p>Over the past two decades, the hammerhead ribozyme has been extensively studied leading to many new insights regarding the biochemical and structural properties of catalytic RNAs.  Despite these insights, the role metal ions in catalysis is still of great debate.  We have obtained a 1.55Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme from <em>Schistosoma mansoni</em> in conditions that permit detailed observation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions binding in the ribozyme's active site.  A Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the N7 of G10.1 and the adjacent A9 phosphate in a manner identical to that previously observed for divalent cations.  A second Na<sup>+</sup> ion binds to the Hoogsteen face of G12, the general base in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction, thereby potentially dissipating the negative charge of the catalytically active enolate form of the base.  We have also obtained a 2.2Å crystal structure of a hammerhead ribozyme variant containing adenine substituted for the general base that displays a structurally perturbed active site.  Our results suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> directly and specifically substitutes for divalent cations in the hammerhead active site.  Additionally, we suggest that hammerhead ribozyme substituted with adenine for the general base may compete between two conformational states: an active state in which A12 is situated for deprotonation of the 2'H of C17; and an inactive state in which A12 makes a non-canonical base pair A9, causing a perturbation in the active site, disrupting metal ion binding.  These results permit us to estimate the contribution that structural perturbation has on the catalytic activity of other hammerhead ribozyme variants containing nucleobase substitutions for the general base.

Injury-elicited stressors alter endogenous retrovirus expression in lymphocytes depending on cell type and source lymphoid organ
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Murine leukemia virus-type endogenous retroviruses (MuLV-ERVs) constitute ~10% of the mouse genome and are associated with various pathophysiologic processes. In this study, we examined whether MuLV-ERVs&#8217; response to burn-elicited stressors is specific for certain lymphocyte populations and/or locations of lymphoid organ.
				
				
					
						Results
					B- and T-cells, which were sorted from nine lymphoid organs of C57BL/6J mice after burn, were subjected to MuLV-ERV expression analyses. Overall, the post-burn MuLV-ERV expression pattern was dependent on lymphocyte type, time after injury, location of lymphoid organ, and MuLV-ERV type. For instance, the MuLV-ERV expression in T-cells from the thymus and three cervical lymph nodes decreased at 3 hours post-burn while the expression of some MuLV-ERVs was augmented in B-cells derived from the mesenteric lymph node. The MuLV-ERV U3 sequences population of the burn-24 hours group was less diverse in comparison to the no burn and burn-3 hours groups. In addition, it was apparent that at the 24 hours time point, the U3 populations of B-cells from both no burn and burn groups were less heterogeneous than the T-cells&#8217; U3 populations. Using the U3 sequences, some of which were isolated only from specific experimental groups (B- vs. T-cells; no burn vs. burn), as probes, 51 putative MuLV-ERVs, including 16 full-length proviruses, were mapped followed by characterization of their biologic properties.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					MuLV-ERVs&#8217; response to burn-elicited stressors may be differentially controlled depending on lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, MuLV-ERV type, and stress duration.

[attention, selective, control, eye, task]

On the control of selective attention in the primate superior colliculus
Selective attention is a fundamental aspect of our experience of both the internal and external environment. I deal here with its specific incarnation as spatial attention, in which behavior is guided by one of several competing visual signals. The superior colliculus (SC), a brainstem structure best known in primates for its role in the control of voluntary eye movements, has long been suspected of a role in the control of attention. Nevertheless, proof of such a connection has remained elusive since we normally selectively process visual information by directing gaze to objects of interest. I here present evidence that causally links neural activity in the SC to the control of selective attention independent of its role in the control of eye movements. We conducted reversible lesion studies in primates trained on a selective attention task. The task required the monkeys to covertly attend to some stimuli without moving their eyes and to ignoring misleading stimuli. Information at the attended location instructed the monkeys where to move their eyes or which buttons to push in order to receive rewards. Reversible inactivation of the SC caused the monkeys to ignore information in the cued location and instead to base decisions on the misleading signals. This change in behavior could not be attributed to a primary sensory deficit nor to the motor consequences of lesion of the SC, thus proving that normal SC function is required for selective attention. In addition, we performed neurophysiological recordings in the SC during the task. I describe the responses of functional classes of neurons suspected to regulate attention and how these groups may contribute to the control of selective attention. In particular, I describe a group of cells with oscillatory activity associated with working memory and with selective attention. The characteristics of these neurons during the task suggest that they could be critical for selecting which stimuli will be perceived or will guide behavior

Developing Novel Biointerfaces and Biomaterials with Surface Plasmon Resonance and SPR Imaging
Much research has focused on the development of analytical methods to monitor a multitude of biological interactions including protein-carbohydrate, protein-lipid, and protein-DNA among others. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) remains one of the most exciting techniques that allows for real-time data collection and label free detection amenable to many biological systems. This thesis focuses on the development of novel sensing interfaces/materials for biomolecular interaction analysis (BIA) with SPR and SPR imaging (SPRi).The first half of this work focuses on the development of unique surface chemistry designs to examine biological interactions. Firstly, in an effort to augment understanding of lectin (protein)-carbohydrate interactions, SPR spectroscopy is used to display differential binding of lectins to various synthetic carbohydrates. This biointerface was later adapted to a high-density array format for SPR imaging detection. Secondly, to expand the use of SPR to large bioparticle detection another interface based on the generation of a mass-enhancing product at the sensing interface for highly sensitive and fast detection of <italic>E. coli</italic> is presented. Results indicate a multi-fold signal enhancement of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in buffer and on spinach leaves.The second part of this thesis focuses on the development of new substrates for both SPR and SPR imaging experiments. Firstly, the fabrication of ultra-thin (ca. 5-8 nm) glass layers on top of a gold surface for SPR biosensing applications is demonstrated. This nanoglassy layer is created by employing a high-pressure, low-volume paint gun technique, resulting in ultra-thin and fracture-free substrates for biosensing applications including monitoring membrane protein interactions in real-time. Finally, the facile fabrication of gold-coated etched glass substrates for SPR imaging that reduces background resonance 5-fold <italic>in situ</italic> compared to the standard gold island array platform is presented. The etching of the glass substrate induces a variation in the resonance condition and thus in the resonance angle between the etched wells and the surrounding area, leading to the isolation of the array spot resonance with a significant reduction of the background resonance. Additionally, these chips enhance the SPR evanescent field intensity 3-fold compared to standard planar gold chips and significantly enhance SPR imaging surface sensitivity.

Nucleation and Cross-Slip of Partial Dislocations in FCC Metals
Nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack and cross-slip of partial dislocations under general loading in FCC metals are analyzed based on a multiscale model which incorporates atomic information into continuum-mechanics approach. In both analyses, the crack and the slip planes are modeled as surfaces of displacement discontinuities embedded in elastic media. The atomic potentials between the adjacent atomic layers along the slip planes are assumed to be the generalized stacking fault energies, which are obtained based on atomic calculations. The relative displacements along the slip planes, corresponding to the configurations of partial dislocations and stacking faults, are solved through the variational boundary integral method. The energetics of partial dislocation nucleation at the crack and cross-slip in FCC metals Al and Cu are comparatively studied for their distinctive difference in the intrinsic stacking fault energy. For the analysis of nucleation of partial dislocations at a crack, several new features have emerged compared with nucleation of perfect dislocations in previous studies. Among them, the critical stress and activation energy for nucleation of partial dislocations are markedly lowered. Depending on the value of stacking fault energy and crack configuration, the saddle-point configurations of partial dislocations can be vastly different in terms of the nucleation sequence and the size of the stacking fault. The implications of these new findings on mechanical behavior of nanostructured crystalline materials are elaborated.For the analysis of cross-slip of partial dislocations, the conclusion from previous studies that cross-slip in FCC metals can be influenced by intrinsic stacking fault energy is confirmed. Furthermore, it is found that in Al, the preference of the gliding plane depends on the competition between the two resolved shear stresses on the slip planes. In Cu, the most preferred loading condition for cross-slip is that a lager compressing Escaig shear stress on the primary slip plane is accompanied with stretching Escaig shear stress on the cross-slip plane. The analysis of activation energy indicates that thermal motion plays an important role in cross-slip in FCC metals.

Synthesis and Characterizations of Colloidal Nanostructured Copolymers of Aniline and Aniline Derivatives
Nanostructured conducting polymers such as polyaniline are promising candidates for next-generation electronics because of their low cost, mechanical flexibility, good solution processability, along with the low-dimensionality that is characteristic of nanoscale materials. Here, we further expand the attractive properties of polyaniline by copolymerizing it with a variety of substituted aniline monomers, with electron donating groups, electron withdrawing groups, or substituents that can enhance the solubility of the final polymer. The resulting copolymers combine the unique properties of the homopolymers such as the high electrical conductivity of polyaniline and the good processability/solubility of the polyaniline derivatives.Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal the nanofibrous nature of the copolymers with uniform diameters. The feeding ratios of aniline and aniline derivatives of one representative copolymer are elucidated from 1H-NMR studies. The different relative compositions of each copolymer also allow us to tune the electrical transport properties, the optical absorption, and the stability of the aqueous dispersion step-by-step, characterized by 2- probe resistance, UV-vis, and Zeta-potential measurements, respectively.The resulting copolymers exhibit enhanced conductivity compared to the poorly conductive substituted-polyaniline homopolymers and better aqueous dispersion stability than their conventional bulk counterparts, rendering them suitable for many potential applications.

Tactile Cues, Bilaterally Asymmetrical Leg Movements and Body Distortion in Isopod Turn Alternation
Because woodlice (Porcellio scaber and pillbugs (Eluma purpurascens) that traveled closer to the outer wall of alleys both before as well as after a 90° forced turn subsequently made sharper free turns in the opposite direction, it seemed possible that a quantitative relationship existed between tactile stimulation arising from wall contact and free-turn behavior However, on emerging from straight runways, without any forced turns, pillbugs turned at sharper angles than woodlice but there was no relationship between the size of a turn and amount of wall contact apart from a very minor one for woodlice only. It was concluded that tactile stimuh played a negligible part in turn alternation of either species thereby supporting involvement of proprioceptive cues. By requiring woodlice to negotiate a forced turn lined with glass on the outer half of the floor, it became apparent that their alternation was determined by proprioceptive feedback from bilaterally asymmetrical leg movements rather than distortion of body segments.

S. aureus bacteria : a new target of serum calcification activity
Staphylococcus aureus are gram- positive bacteria that cause skin and soft tissue infections. The continual incidence of infection is of great concern especially with the advent of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Continued investigation on mechanisms our body uses to fight bacterial infection is vital. Our study suggests that the body takes advantage of a mechanism that mineralizes type-I collagen of bone and tendon to also mineralize bacteria. Serum driven bacterial mineralization may be a mechanism of innate immunity to control bacterial infection by affecting their viability or growth. S. aureus was incubated in serum under various experimental conditions to determine the necessary factors in the mechanism of mineralization, as well as the extent and location of formed mineral. These experiments indicate that: 1) A large serum nucleator is required to generate mineral crystals 2) TNAP is essential for mineralization by activating the serum nucleator. Inhibition of TNAP prevents bacterial mineralization and addition of pure TNAP restores the ability of serum to mineralize bacteria. 3) Fetuin is necessary for localizing mineralization within the interior of the bacteria. Without fetuin, mineral forms predominantly outside bacteria. These results demonstrate a similar mechanism of mineralization as type&ndashcollagen 4)In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that bacteria have similar size exclusion properties as collagen\\1,2,3\\. Small molecules (< 14kDa) can penetrate the bacterial matrix while molecules (>50 kDa) are excluded \\4,5,6\\. Lastly, through TEM it is observed that the mineral is formed throughout bacteria and has a similar morphology to hydroxyapatite.

Cortical Processing of Frequency Modulated Sweeps in a Mouse Model of Presbycusis
The population over the age of 65 years old is rapidly increasing around the world. Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is one of the most prevalent disabilities associated with age and can impair speech understanding and social and emotional well-being. Deficits in auditory processing, including speech understanding are likely caused by an interaction between changes in the way the brain processes sound and peripheral sensory hearing loss. It is difficult to disambiguate changes that occur within the brain independent of peripheral hearing loss and those that change because of it. To that end, this dissertation provides a framework for beginning to tease out how the relative contributions of peripheral sensory hearing loss (loss of cochlear hair cells) on cortical processing of frequency modulated (FM) sweeps in a mouse model of presbycusis (strain C57/bl6). FM sweeps are sounds that change in frequency over time. Human language and animal vocalizations contain FM sweeps. The genetic engineering tools present in the mouse make it a suitable model for probing the genetic roots and underlying mechanisms of neural dysfunction, such as is seen in presbycusis. This C57/bl6 mouse strain undergoes predictable high frequency hearing loss by 6 months of age, continuing to profound hearing loss by 12 months of age. The purpose of this dissertation was to establish cortical response properties to FM sweeps as a function of age in a mouse model of presbycusis. Three experiments were performed. In the first experiment, FM sweep response properties were profiled in the young adult core auditory cortex. The main findings of the first experiment indicate that the young adult mouse auditory cortex is selective for a narrow range of FM sweep rates (between 0.5 and 3 kHz/msec) and this selectivity is depth dependent, suggesting FM sweep processing undergoes changes within the a cortical column. The second experiment explored the mechanisms that shape FM sweep rate selectivity. The main findings of the second experiment were that two mechanisms shape FM sweep rate selectivity in the young adult cortex, duration tuning for tones and sideband inhibition. Sideband inhibition is the dominant mechanism in the auditory cortex, shaping FM sweep rate selectivity in approximately 84% of neurons tested. Duration tuning shaped FM sweep rate selectivity in approximately 34% of neurons tested. The third experiment compared direction selectivity, FM rate selectivity, variability, and mechanisms between three age groups, young (1 - 3 months), middle (6-8 months), and old (14 - 20 months). The main findings of the third experiment were that presbycusis results in decreased selectivity, slowed FM rate selectivity, increased variability and decreased reliance on sideband inhibition. The results of these studies serve as a framework for comparisons with mouse strains who do not experience age-related hearing loss.

Hydrocarbon Seeps of the Mesozoic Great Valley Group Forearc Strata and Franciscan Complex, Northern and Central California, U.S.A.
Hydrocarbon seeps and their associated chemosymbiosis-based communities have been documented throughout modern oceans, as well as in Neoproterozoic through Pleistocene aged rocks in the stratigraphic record.  A particularly good record of ancient hydrocarbon seeps occurs in Mesozoic strata (Tithonian-Maastrichtian) along the western North American continental margin, cropping out throughout the Great Valley Group forearc strata and the Franciscan Complex.  This extensive record allows for the comparison of the paleoecological signatures of stratigraphically and spatially related hydrocarbon seeps, which are geotectonically, petrographically, and isotopically consistent with each other.Ten hydrocarbon seeps were located throughout this region and their physical, morphological, and paleoecological signatures were documented.  Analyses indicate that their chemical signatures are petrographically and paragenetically similar and their geochemical values are consistently anomalous, however, their physical and biological signatures are surprisingly variable.  The localities are strikingly different from each other in regards to faunal composition and morphological characteristics.  The deposits include variably sized lenses, pods, mounds, and continuous outcrops.  Eighteen taxa were identified, the most common being vestimentiferan worm tubes.  Gastropods are the most abundant clade, while bivalves are the most diverse.  No taxon is found at all ten localities and each locality is dominated by a different taxon that is commonly only a minor constituent of another localities faunal assemblage.  This variability indicates that, as with modern seeps, heterogeneity is driven largely by the ephemeral nature of the seep environment, including ebullition volume, rate, and area, rather than by the duration of fluid advection.These ancient seep deposits cropping out in the GVG forearc strata and the Franciscan Complex preserve the physical, chemical, and biological signatures of a group of tectonically related ancient hydrocarbon seeps and are a record of 80 m.y. of intermittent fluid seepage, occurring over geologically short intervals. along the western North American continental margin.  As the abundance of recognized hydrocarbon seeps in this area continues to increase, they can be viewed collectively as a quasi-continuous, dynamic fluid-sediment-biotic system, with the potential to reveal larger evolutionary, biogeographic, geotectonic, and geochemical patterns of hydrocarbon seep processes and associated faunas through geologic time.

Magnetization reversal and the effect of patterning have been investigated in full-film and dotarrays of Co/Pd multilayers, using the first-order reversal curve and scanning electron microscopywith polarization analysis techniques. The effect of patterning is most pronounced in lowsputtering pressure films, where the size of contiguous domains is larger than the dot size. Uponpatterning, each dot must have its own domain nucleation site and domain propagation is limitedwithin the dot. In graded anisotropy samples, the magnetically soft layer facilitates themagnetization reversal, once the reverse domains have nucleated.

MONITORING ORGAN REGENERATION OF SEA CUCUMBER HOLOTHURIA LEUCOSPILOTA AFTER EVISCERATION
Defense mechanisms have been long recognized as an important factor in establishing the development of many organism life histories. As a result, many processes associated with ensuring survivability have been very well established in organisms that utilize defense mechanisms. How these defense mechanisms have shaped the evisceration and regenerative processes of sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota still remain largely unstudied. In this study it is revealed that Holothuria leucospilota remain very consistent in their modes of evisceration, ejecting the same organs in every evisceration event. The consistency is compounded by the finding that approximately 28% of their body mass is eviscerated regardless of organism size. In terms of organ regeneration, the thickening of the mesentery tissues is apparent at Day 4 and regeneration of the digestive tract at Day 16. Sediment feeding also resumes at Day 16 along with the regeneration of the digestive tract. No regeneration of the left respiratory tree or gonads is observed within the 28-day study.

Mechanism for Spontaneous Calcium Activity and Spinal Cord Neurotransmitter Specification, and the Role of Calcium Activity in Dopamine Specification in the Brain and Spinal Cord
Spontaneous electrical activity is a feature of the nervous system from early stages of development preceding synapse formation. An example of this is calcium-spike activity, which is displayed by embryonic Xenopus laevis spinal cord neurons, and has a role in neurotransmitter specification. Here I present data identifying a mechanism for calcium-spike activity that depends on GABA or glutamate activation of metabotropic receptors, and their recruitment of PKA or PKC. This work attributes a role to neurotransmitters and metabotropic receptors prior to synapse formation in modulating electrical activity that in turn modulates neurotransmitter specification. These results contribute to our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms recruited during development. In addition to electrical activity, transcription factors play a role in neurotransmitter specification. Here I present a study of the development of the dopaminergic system in Xenopus laevis to characterize the co-expression of dopamine with additional neurotransmitters, and with transcription factors. This led to identification of subclasses of dopaminergic neurons based on these markers. Calcium-spike activity plays a role in dopamine specification, but different dopaminergic nuclei respond to activity manipulations in a different way. Examination of the in situ calcium spike activity of spinal cord neurons showed that neurons with different molecular markers have distinct pattern of calcium-spike activity. These results provide the basis for further studies to establish the interplay between calcium-spike activity and transcription factors in the dopaminergic system

Investigating a method of producing "Red and Dead" galaxies
In optical wavelengths, galaxies are observed to be either red or blue. The overall color of a galaxy is due to the distribution of the ages of its stellar population. Galaxies with currently active star formation appear blue, while those with no recent star formation at all (greater than about a Gyr) have only old, red stars. This strong bimodality has lead to the idea of star formation quenching, and various proposed physical mechanisms. In this dissertation, I attempt to reproduce with Enzo the results of Naab et al. (2007), in which red and dead galaxies are formed using gravitational quenching,rather than with one of the more typical methods of quenching. My initial attempts are unsuccessful, and I explore the reasons why I think they failed. Then using simpler methods better suited to Enzo + AMR, I am successful in producing a galaxy that appears to be similar in color and formation history to those in Naab et al. However, quenching is achieved using unphysically high star formation efficiencies, which is a different mechanism than Naab et al. suggests. Preliminary results of a much higher resolution, follow-on simulation of the above show some possible contradiction with the results of Naab et al. Cold gas is streaming into the galaxy to fuel starbursts, while at a similar epoch the galaxies in Naab et al. have largely already ceased forming stars in the galaxy. On the other hand, the results of the high resolution simulation are qualitatively similar to other works in the literature that show a somewhat different gravitational quenching mechanism than Naab et al. I also discuss my work using halo finders to analyze simulated cosmological data, and my work improving the Enzo/AMR analysis tool "yt". This includes two parallelizations of the halo finder HOP which allows analysis of very large cosmological datasets on parallel machines. The first version is "yt-HOP," which works well for datasets between about 256³ and 512³ particles, but has memory bottlenecks as the datasets get larger. These bottlenecks inspired the second version, "Parallel HOP," which is a fully parallelized method and implementation of HOP that has worked on datasets with more than 2048³ particles on hundreds of processing cores. Both methods are described in detail, as are the various effects of performance- related runtime options. Additionally, both halo finders are subjected to a full suite of performance benchmarks varying both dataset sizes and computational resources used. I conclude with descriptions of four new tools I added to yt. A Parallel Structure Function Generator allows analysis of two-point functions, such as correlation functions, using memory- and workload- parallelism. A Parallel Merger Tree Generator leverages the parallel halo finders in yt, such as Parallel HOP, to build the merger tree of halos in a cosmological simulation, and outputs the result to a SQLite database for simple and powerful data extraction. A Star Particle Analysis toolkit takes a group of star particles and can output the rate of formation as a function of time, and/or a synthetic Spectral Energy Distribution (S.E.D.) using the Bruzual and Charlot (2003) data tables. Finally, a Halo Mass Function toolkit takes as input a list of halo masses and can output the halo mass function for the halos, as well as an analytical fit for those halos using several previously published fits

A study on circadian regulation of the cardiovascular system: dysfunction in the BACHD Huntington's Disease model and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-deficient mice and the use of scheduled exercise to rescue circadian deficits.
The circadian system coordinates rhythms of behavior, physiology and gene expression with the external cues of light and dark, and the dysfunction of this system leads to the development of disease. Huntington's disease patients experience circadian symptoms and are at an increased risk for serious cardiovascular events that often lead to death. We, therefore, explored circadian and cardiovascular dysfunction in the BACHD model of Huntington's disease (HD). Diurnal and circadian rhythms of heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature were significantly blunted along with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system as measured by baroreceptor reflex. Circadian disruption could be attributed to reduced Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) signaling in HD, therefore, we examined whether cardiovascular rhythms were disrupted in the VIP-deficient mouse. We detected deficits in the diurnal and circadian rhythms of HR, HRV, body temperature and cage activity in VIP-deficient mice, suggesting that VIP is crucial for the circadian regulation of physiological outputs, including the cardiovascular system. Stabilization and realignment of the circadian system with the light/dark cycle may help decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we explored the ability of scheduled exercise to drive and reorganize rhythms in behavior, physiology and gene expression in WT and VIP-deficient mice. Many of the deficits in diurnal rhythms displayed by VIP-deficient mice were rescued by exercise during the late night. In summary, these studies examined mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates the cardiovascular system using BACHD and VIP-deficient mice. We also introduced a new tool to help temporally restructure behavior, which improved various parameters of the circadian system in a circadian compromised mouse model.  This tool could potentially be applied to humans with circadian symptoms, to help deter the development of cardiovascular disease associated with circadian disruption.

Copper stress response in marine Synechococcus
Marine Synechococcus is an abundant, globally distributed group of picocyanobacteria that are highly diverse, with at least ten subclades described. Copper can be both a micronutrient and a toxicant and of the main phytoplankton groups marine Synechococcus is the most sensitive to copper toxicity, however, there are not many genes identified that are involved in copper response in marine Synechococcus. Global expression microarrays and copper growth assays were used to compare copper stress response between coastal and open ocean strains of marine Synechococcus and found that coastal strains are more tolerant to copper stress and that in one coastal strain the source of this tolerance may lie in its horizontally transferred genomic regions. This was further investigated through functional characterization of two copper- responsive genes in genomic islands. Through inactivation, both genes were found to provide copper tolerance and one of the genes was more abundant in the winter months at a coastal monitoring site. Two genes that were commonly induced by the coastal and open ocean strains were also characterized. One gene of unknown function that may bind copper was found to be involved in copper tolerance. The other gene, putative Deg-protease, was found to be essential for alkaline phosphatase induction and for outer membrane reorganization. Synechococcus clade IV is an important coastally abundant clade and clade IV representative CC9902 is missing some genes that were copper-responsive in the other two strains. Proteome and transcriptome analyses of CC9902 were done following copper stress and validated transcriptional copper stress response at the protein level as well as identified unique and common responses for this strain. Response of natural assemblages of coastal marine Synechococcus were assessed through transcriptional response to copper as well as shifts in diversity of the Synechococcus community following copper addition and verified several copper responsive genes from culture studies and furthermore found that a unique population was enriched following copper addition. For this dissertation, genes and pathways involved in marine Synechococcus copper stress response were identified and characterized, contributing to our understanding of the ecology and physiology of this globally important group with regards to this environmentally relevant metal

Lateral Asymmetries in Human Evolution
Lateral asymmetries are not confined to humans. Palaeozoic trilobites and calcichordates are now known to have been asymmetrical; song control in passerines is vested in the left cerebral hemisphere; learning which is lateralized to the left forebrain of chicks includes imprinting, visual discrimination learning and auditory habituation, while responses to novelty, attack and copulation are activated by the right; in rats the right hemisphere is involved in emotional behavior and spatial discriminations, and there are numerous other behavioral, anatomical and pharmacological asymmetries; the left hemisphere of the female mouse is superior at processing its pups' calls, and there are reports of behavioral asymmetries in impala, cats and dogs. Anatomical asymmetries in the primate brain, from monkeys upwards, are matched by increasing evidence of behavioral asymmetries in visual pattern discrimination, discrimination of species-specific calls, and handedness. We discuss the interaction of preexisting behavioral and brain asymmetries with the evolution in hominids of an upright bipedal posture and tool use, and the origins of language, and conclude that there may be a continuity with earlier species of our two most obvious asymmetries, language lateralization and hand preferences. There may be an ancient left-brain specialization for sensory and motor discrimination learning, which is complemented by a relegation to the right of primitive spatial and emotional functions.

Gene Regulation in M Cell Lineages: In Vitro and In Vivo
M cells are specialized epithelial cells, which assist immune surveillance by transcytosis of particles and antigens to underlying lymphoid tissues. So far, three M cell phenotypes have been identified in airways and intestines. However, the mechanism of M cell differentiation is poorly understood, as well as the relationships between different M cell subtypes. To better understand these questions, we treated human (Caco-2BBe) and rodent (IEC-6) intestinal epithelial cell lines with lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) and TNF receptor (TNFR) agonists. Treated cells were then studied for regulation of genes previously shown to associate with M cell and Follicle-Associated Epithelium (FAE).  Moreover, we used a reporter transgenic mouse strain to follow the development of M cell subsets in vivo, and examined the de novo induction of M cells by cholera toxin (CT).We found that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists can induce transcription of FAE specific genes (Ccl20 and Lamb3) as well as rodent M cell specific genes such as Sgne-1/Scg5, Cldn4, and Gp2 in Caco2-BBe cells and IEC-6 cells. These cytokines have distinct but complementary effects; TNFR agonists induced FAE specific genes, while the LTbetaR agonist induces M cell specific genes. The combination of these cytokines showed additive induction of the FAE-associated Ccl20, Lamb3 and a surprisingly the induction of CD137/Tnfrsf9. Functionally, cytokine treatment led to both the reorganization of microvilli as well as Claudin-4 redistribution. Moreover, with the help of the reporter transgenic mouse model, we have found that M cells overlying intestinal Peyer's patches (PP) and Nasal Associated Lymphoid Tissue (NALT) have distinct developmental origins, yet show convergent phenotypes, such as expression of a PGRP-S reporter in vivo. By contrast, though PP and Villous M cells are derived from intestinal crypt stem cells, their phenotypes are clearly distinct. Thus, PP M cells form an intimate M cell-dendritic cell functional unit while Villous M cells do not engage with underlying DC. Though B lymphocytes are thought to play a critical role in M cell function by forming a basolateral pocket and possibly signaling through CD137, initial commitment to M cell lineages is B lymphocyte and CD137 independent. In addition, CT can causes rapid induction of new M cells in the airway and intestines without cell division, suggesting transdifferentiation from mature epithelial cells. CT-induced M cells show the local M cell phenotype without evidence for mixed phenotypes. Finally, M cell phenotypes display distinct capabilities; thus, intestinal PP M cells were more efficient than Villous M cells in the uptake of Salmonella. Our studies show that LTbetaR and TNFR agonists induce many features associated with M cell differentiation, and suggest that these agonists may be involved in secondary lymphoid tissue development in vivo. Additionally, we confirmed that the differentiation of M cells in vivo toward strictly defined phenotypic subsets, and is consistent with functional specialization.

High-Speed Manipulation of Cells and Particles for Single-Cell Analysis and Mechanophenotyping
Due to the heterogeneity of cellular populations it is important to assay individual cells to garner an accurate representation of the system of interest, and oftentimes the cells which are most critical to detect are in a minority. High-throughput single-cell analysis methods, especially flow cytometry, possess this ability and have had a significant impact on the way many diseases are diagnosed and monitored and the way research in biology is performed. The frontiers of single-cell analysis lie in extending the accessibility of these methods to the point-of-care, where the cell manipulation strategies of traditional flow cytometry are ill-suited, and expanding upon the number and type of biomarkers which can be measured. This dissertation reports the development of new strategies for manipulating cells and particles in high-speed flows, a critical step toward meeting the needs of next-generation cytometric technologies. These strategies employ inertial phenomena present in finite Reynolds number confined flows to transfer cells and particles across laminar streamlines and perform operations on cells. Specifically, this dissertation reports the development of (1) a theoretical background and design criteria for inertial focusing at high Reynolds number, (2) a method for performing continuous rapid solution exchange around cells, and (3) a tool for assaying the mechanical properties of cells at a throughput comparable to flow cytometry (`deformability cytometry'). Generalized design rules, developed in the earlier work, were employed to develop tools for automated cellular sample preparation (`rapid inertial solution exchange') and to focus cells to ensure uniform hydrodynamic stretching in the deformability cytometry method and will be applicable to many future applications of inertial focusing for cytometry, imaging, and bead-based tools. Rapid inertial solution exchange will increase the accessibility of complicated assays to the point-of-care by increasing repeatability of cell-based protocols and minimizing labor-associated time and cost requirements while the label-free metrics provided by deformability cytometry stand in contrast to the variability and cost associated with label-based methods, and potentially extend the use of cytometric methods to new arenas and for more frequent and accurate monitoring of disease.

Variation in exposure to Anopheles gambiae salivary gland peptide (gSG6-P1) across different malaria transmission settings in the western Kenya highlands
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The existing metrics of malaria transmission are limited in sensitivity under low transmission intensity. Robust surveillance systems are needed as interventions to monitor reduced transmission and prevention of rapid reintroduction. Serological tools based on antibody responses to parasite and vector antigens are potential tools for transmission measurements. The current study sought to evaluate antibody responses to Anopheles gambiae salivary gland peptide (gSG6- P1), as a biomarker of human exposure to Anopheles bites, in different transmission settings and seasons. The comparison between anti-MSP-119 IgG immune responders and non-responders allowed exploring the robustness of the gSG6-P1 peptide as a surveillance tool in an area of decreasing malaria transmission.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Total IgG levels to gSG6-P1 were measured in an age-stratified cohort (&lt; 5, 5&#8211;14 and&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;15 years) in a total of 1,366 participants from three localities in western Kenya Kisii (hypoendemic), Kakamega (mesoendemic), and Kombewa (hyperendemic) including 607 sera that were additionally tested for MSP-119 specific responses during a low and a high malaria transmission seasons. Antibody prevalence and levels were compared between localities with different transmission intensities. Regression analysis was performed to examine the association between gSG6-P1 and MSP-119 seroprevalence and parasite prevalence.
				
				
					
						Result
					Seroprevalence of gSG6-P1 in the uphill population was 36% while it was 50% valley bottom (&#967;2&#8201;=&#8201;13.2, df&#8201;=&#8201;1, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001). Median gSG6-P1 antibody levels in the Valley bottom were twice as high as that observed in the uphill population 4.50 vs. 2.05, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001 and showed seasonal variation. The odds of gSG6-P1 seropositives having MSP-119 antibodies were almost three times higher than the odds of seronegatives (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.87, 95% CI 1.977, 4.176). The observed parasite prevalence for Kisii, Kakamega and Kombewa were 4%, 19.7% and 44.6% whilst the equivalent gSG6-P1 seroprevalence were 28%, 34% and 54%, respectively.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					The seroprevalence of IgG to gSG6-P1 was sensitive and robust in distinguishing between hypo, meso and hyper transmission settings and seasonal fluctuations.

A method to study global spatial patterns related to sensory perception in scalp EEG
Prior studies of multichannel ECoG from animals showed that beta and gamma oscillations carried percep- tual information in both local and global spatial patterns of amplitude modulation, when the subjects were trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS). Here the hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG human subjects trained to discriminate simultaneous visual-auditory CS. Signals were continuously recorded from 64 equispaced scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Hilbert transform gave the analytic phase, which segmented the EEG into temporal frames, and the ana- lytic amplitude, which expressed the pattern in each frame as a feature vector. Methods applied to the ECoG were adapted to the EEG for systematic search of the beta–gamma spectrum, the time period after CS onset, and the scalp surface to locate patterns that could be classified with respect to type of CS. Spatial patterns of EEG amplitude modulation were found from all subjects that could be classified with respect to stimulus combination type significantly above chance levels. The patterns were found in the beta range (15–22 Hz) but not in the gamma range. They occurred in three short bursts following CS onset. They were non-local, occupying the entire array. Our results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so that future studies in brain–computer interfacing can be better focused. Our methods may be most valuable for analyzing data from dense arrays with very high spatial and temporal sampling rates.

Evaluation of common genetic variants in 82
candidate genes as risk factors for neural tube
defects
AbstractBackgroundNeural tube defects (NTDs) are common birth defects (~1 in 1000 pregnancies in the US and Europe) that have complex origins, including environmental and genetic factors. A low level of maternal folate is one well-established risk factor, with maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation reducing the occurrence of NTD pregnancies by 50-70%. Gene variants in the folate metabolic pathway (e.g., MTHFR rs1801133 (677&#8201;C&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T) and MTHFD1 rs2236225 (R653Q)) have been found to increase NTD risk. We hypothesized that variants in additional folate/B12 pathway genes contribute to NTD risk.MethodsA tagSNP approach was used to screen common variation in 82 candidate genes selected from the folate/B12 pathway and NTD mouse models. We initially genotyped polymorphisms in 320 Irish triads (NTD cases and their parents), including 301 cases and 341 Irish controls to perform case&#8211;control and family based association tests. Significantly associated polymorphisms were genotyped in a secondary set of 250 families that included 229 cases and 658 controls. The combined results for 1441 SNPs were used in a joint analysis to test for case and maternal effects.ResultsNearly 70 SNPs in 30 genes were found to be associated with NTDs at the p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.01 level. The ten strongest association signals (p-value range: 0.0003&#8211;0.0023) were found in nine genes (MFTC, CDKN2A, ADA, PEMT, CUBN, GART, DNMT3A, MTHFD1 and T (Brachyury)) and included the known NTD risk factor MTHFD1 R653Q (rs2236225). The single strongest signal was observed in a new candidate, MFTC rs17803441 (OR&#8201;=&#8201;1.61 1.23-2.08, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0003 for the minor allele). Though nominally significant, these associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, with respect to sample size and scope of evaluation of candidate polymorphisms, this is the largest NTD genetic association study reported to date. The scale of the study and the stringency of correction are likely to have contributed to real associations failing to survive correction. We have produced a ranked list of variants with the strongest association signals. Variants in the highest rank of associations are likely to include true associations and should be high priority candidates for further study of NTD risk.

Assessment of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in cAMP/PKA- and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of S49 murine lymphoma cells
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) was first described 40 years ago, and has been the subject of active study for the past 20 years. Discovery of death stimuli, death receptors, and downstream signals in the mechanisms for apoptosis has provided information for the design of treatment strategies for various cancers. The cell line used for this study, S49, is a murine lymphoma derived from immature T lymphocytes. Studies of apoptosis in S49 lymphona cells, in particular in response to increases in glucocorticoid and the second messenger cAMP, may serve as a basis for the design of drugs for the treatment of lymphoma or leukemia cancer patients. The focus of efforts in this thesis was on the protein Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl family, which initiates downstream signals that lead to cell death. My studies involved the use of double transgenic rtTA/tetO-Bim S49 cell lines to conditionally express Bim with doxycycline treatment. The results show that increased expression of Bim in response to doxycycline is sufficient to trigger S49 cell apoptosis. In addition, studies conducted with S49 cells with plasmid insert that produces Bim short hairpin RNAs show that Bim is necessary for cAMP/PKA- and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Thus, expression of Bim appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis in S49 cells, and the PKA and glucocorticoid pathways converged upstream or at the point of induction in Bim expression. The results thus define the mechanism for the killing of S49 cells by cAMP/PKA and glucocorticoids

Optimizing the utility of diffusion imaging for discovering genetic and environmental influences on neural development, degeneration, and disease
The complex interplay of nature and nurture make each individual unique in several ways; however, certain combinations of genetic and environmental factors lend themselves to devastating neurological diseases, whose mechanistic pathways are not fully understood. Many of these disorders damage and deteriorate the white matter neural connections within the brain. Non-invasive imaging techniques have recently been used to map structural variation in the living human brain; yet now, with the growing advances in diffusion-based magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques and its wide scale availability, we are able to uncover more about the interworking connections of the brain than ever before. In the work presented in this thesis, the utility of dMRI is explored. First, we examine the stability and reliability of diffusion imaging protocols --- these acquisition protocols are often limited by a clinical time constraint and therefore trade-offs are made, which may compromise directional or spatial resolution and can affect signal-to-noise or reproducibility in brain maps. Next, we explore the degree to which genetic interpretations from the same individuals can be affected by the choice of imaging protocol. A preliminary investigation into different methods of population-based analyses lends itself to a large heritability study of brain fiber asymmetry. Knowledge of the genetic influence on brain fiber integrity motivates a study of the most pressing global nutritional deficiency, iron, and its genetic correlates, on the healthy human brain structure. Methods presented are then carried forward on genetic and environmental fiber mapping experiments independently, studying the microstructural effect of a single Alzheimer's disease risk gene on healthy young adults and also cerebrovascular confounds in HIV patients. Finally, the brain's network and organization is visualized as a matrix describing the degree of physical connections between functional cortical regions through tractography and cortical parcellation. The degree of genetic and environmental influence on the ``human connectome" is then estimated. These works mark only the beginning of this line of research, which will be further expanded with studies of connectivity biomarkers, viral and gene interactions, and global efforts in combining data to expand the search for genes influencing brain microstructure.

Computational drug design applied to neglected disease
Herein is described the identification of novel inhibitors of key pathogenic proteins, the use of established computational techniques to further drug discovery, and the development of novel computational methods, with the ultimate goal of identifying small-molecule compounds that, with further development, may serve as future treatments for neglected diseases. Two of the pathogens targeted, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, are neglected because they are tropical, and drugs marketed solely to the developing world are rarely profitable. A third disease, H1N1 pandemic influenza, is somewhat neglected because it is only now emergent. For Trypanosoma brucei, two drug-discovery projects are described, focusing on two crucial enzymes : UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase and RNA editing ligase 1. For Trypanosoma cruzi, the dynamics of cruzain, a crucial cysteine protease, are studied and characterized. Finally, for influenza, predicted inhibitors of neuraminidase (N1) are presented. Aside from describing identified enzyme inhibitors, the current work also describes several new methods that may be generally applicable to drug discovery. These new methods include a multidimensional strategy for the identification of secondary targets of known small-molecule inhibitors in the absence of global structural and sequence homology with the primary target protein, a novel computer-aided drug design algorithm (AutoGrow) that combines the strengths of both fragment-based growing and docking algorithms, and an extension to the relaxed complex scheme that accounts for both population-shift and induced-fit contributions to ligand binding

Effect of temperature and iron-oxide nano-particle inclusions on the ultrasound vaporization pressure of perfluorocarbon droplets for disease detection and therapy
Introduction: The longer circulating time and larger particle count of perfluorocarbon (PFC) droplets make them more effective as targeted contrast agents compared to microbubbles. It has also been shown that conversion of PFC droplets to microbubbles improves ultrasound (US) sensitivity to emulsions by 10 orders of magnitude. PFC droplets, with their higher boiling point and smaller particle size are more desirable to prevent spontaneous aporization and maximum accumulation of emulsions. However, the high US energy required to induce phase conversion in these emulsions is not clinically feasible. We hypothesized that by increasing the temperature and using Iron-oxide nanoparticles(IONP) as nucleation sites within the more stable and submicron droplets, the US energy required to vaporize them may be lowered. Material and method: A sample of 60%w/v iron-oxide loaded PFC droplets with mean diameter of 200nm was manufactured and characterized. A phantom was designed to allow for the interaction between the US energy and droplets. A high intensity focused ultrasound system (HIFU) was used to generate US pressures and a heat exchanger pump was used to control the temperature while emulsions of PFHB and PFP with or without IONP were circulated through the chamber. A harmonic imaging system was also used to detect the generated microbubbles. Discussion and result: The effect of temperature and IONP on the vaporization rate and threshold of PFC emulsions were determined. It was shown that presence of IONP and higher temperature increase the rate and decreases the vaporization threshold of PFC emulsions

Thermal Characterization of Nanostructures and Advanced Engineered Materials
Continuous downscaling of Si complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and progress in high-power electronics demand more efficient heat removal techniques to handle the increasing power density and rising temperature of hot spots. For this reason, it is important to investigate thermal properties of materials at nanometer scale and identify materials with the extremely large or extremely low thermal conductivity for applications as heat spreaders or heat insulators in the next generation of integrated circuits. The thin films used in microelectronic and photonic devices need to have high thermal conductivity in order to transfer the dissipated power to heat sinks more effectively. On the other hand, thermoelectric devices call for materials or structures with low thermal conductivity because the performance of thermoelectric devices is determined by the figure of merit Z=S^2e/K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, K and e are the thermal and electrical conductivity, respectively. Nanostructured superlattices can have drastically reduced thermal conductivity as compared to their bulk counterparts making them promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Other applications calling for thin films with low thermal conductivity value are high-temperature coatings for engines. Thus, materials with both high thermal conductivity and low thermal conductivity are technologically important. The increasing temperature of the hot spots in state-of-the-art chips stimulates the search for innovative methods for heat removal. One promising approach is to incorporate materials, which have high thermal conductivity into the chip design. Two suitable candidates for such applications are diamond and graphene. Another approach is to integrate the high-efficiency thermoelectric elements for on-spot cooling. In addition, there is strong motivation for improved thermal interface materials (TIMs) for heat transfer from the heat-generating chip to heat-sinking units. This dissertation presents results of the experimental investigation and theoretical interpretation of thermal transport in the advanced engineered materials, which include thin films for thermal management of nanoscale devices, nanostructured superlattices as promising candidates for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials, and improved TIMs with graphene and metal particles as fillers providing enhanced thermal conductivity. The advanced engineered materials studied include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and microcrystalline diamond (MCD) films on Si substrates, directly integrated nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films on GaN, free-standing polycrystalline graphene (PCG) films, graphene oxide (GOx) films, and "pseudo-superlattices" of the mechanically exfoliated Bi2Te3 topological insulator films, and thermal interface materials (TIMs) with graphene fillers.

The regulation of global deSUMOylation by human SUMO- specific proteases
SUMOylation - the covalent tagging of a target protein with a SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) molecule - has recently emerged as an important post-translational modification in regulating a wide array of biological events. SUMOylation is a dynamics process, where SUMO- specific proteases (SENPs) process proSUMO molecules and also deconjugate them from substrates. My dissertation focuses on the deconjugating activity of SENPs and addresses the role they play in regulating the global SUMOylation "status quo" of eukaryotic cells. SENPs are among the most specific proteases and only cleave SUMO molecules, yet they exhibit substantial substrate specificity among SUMO paralogs. To address the deconjugating specificities of human SENPs, I developed two different proteomics strategies to profile these proteases. One method has the potential to identify lysines of SUMOylation, besides the SUMOylation substrate itself, while the other can differentiate SUMOylated substrates from SUMO-interactors. To this end, I demonstrated the proof-of-principle of both methods and have identified polySUMOylated substrates. Such polySUMOylation (ie: modification of proteins by SUMO chains) has been an elusive phenomenon to study. In fact, so far, mainly mass spectrometry has shed light on the nature of SUMO chains through identifying SUMO-SUMO isopeptides. Thus, in the bulk of my dissertation, using a conjugatable, but not deconjugatable SUMO, I demonstrate the abundance of SUMO chains in vivo, make them visually appreciable and uncover the rapid dynamics of SUMOylation through their deconjugation. I propose that the balance of the dynamics is largely due to the action of SENPs in constantly cleaving SUMO from its targets, whether from a target protein or from another SUMO. This way, SENPs guard the SUMOylation status of the proteome, which by definition includes keeping in check modification of substrates by SUMO chains. I also establish the mechanism of SUMO chain deconjugation, which I show to be stochastic. Lastly, I reiterate the importance of deSUMOylation in vivo, by showing that the lack of deSUMOylation is adversary for the growth of Schizosaccharomyces pombe under replicative stress and for human cells

Mentally Unhealthy Days Among Los Angeles Immigrants: A Finite Mixture Modeling Approach
This thesis examines the impact of immigration on reports of mentally unhealthy days among respondents in the 2007 Los Angeles Health Survey. I argue that the findings in the extant literature are unstable due to unobserved heterogeneity in response. I fit 3 different regression models: the Poisson, the Negative Binomial, and the mixture of Negative Binomial models. From the test of goodness fits, the Mixture of the Negative Binomial models has a better fit than the other two traditional statistical models. A significant mixing proportion of my mixture model indicates that mixture of the Negative Binomial models is necessary. Two distinct distributions indicate that the model fits and identifies two kinds of people: distressed and non-distressed individuals. I use the finite mixture parameter estimates to calculate the posterior probability of being in the non-distressed group; meanwhile, I find evidence that race and economic status play important roles in classification but not migration-related factors, including years in US, citizenship and language ability.

Time Courses of Desensitization and Recovery From Adaptation in Mouse Rod Photoreceptors
Sensitivity and dynamic range are two important characteristics of sensory receptors in the nervous system that define the physiological role of these cells. Rod cells in the retina of a mouse have the ability to detect very dim lights by closing cyclic-gated nucleotide channels. This extreme sensitivity would be impractical if the dynamic range on these cells was limited. Adaptation is a process by which the sensitivity of the transduction cascade is adjusted so cells can function within broader ranges of stimuli. Electrical recordings of circulating currents have been used to show that in the presence of steady background light, rods are desensitized so that saturation doesn't occur, and they remain responsive to increments and decrements of illumination. Furthermore, changes in calcium concentration have been proposed to mediate modulations of various molecules within the transduction pathways. In this project, we investigated the time course of desensitization and recovery in adaptation using suction electrode recording. We were able to show, desensitization at various ranges of adapting light, as manifested by the fact that reduction in sensitivity acceleration of recovery is already present at 500 ms. We also demonstrated that in recovery from adaptation, sensitivity of the rod returns back to its dark-adapted levels within 2 seconds. The persistence of adaptation in the form of acceleration of recovery was present with extremely dim lights and the time constant of its recovery to dark-adapted levels was dependent on the intensity of the background light.

Wavelength Categorization by Goldfish (Carassius auratus)
Goldfish pressed a paddlefor intermittent food reinforcement in the presence of one of seven different monochromatic wavelengths. Wavelengths in 20nm steps from 430 to 690 nm, matched for "brightness," were then presented for 20 days during which food maintained responding to the training stimulus. Generalization gradients calculated from the final four days were asymmetric. A long wavelength gradient showed maintained responding above 630 nm; at short wavelengths responding generalized below 490 nm; four middle wavelength gradients could indicate two groupings having maximum responses at around 510 and 570 nm.

Integration of cartilage and bone through a calcified cartilage interface to form a functional osteochondral graft
Articular cartilage is a load-bearing tissue covering the ends of long bones that normally allows for painless motion of joints. Adult articular cartilage has limited capacity for self-repair when injured. Current surgical treatments for cartilage defects include the transplantation of fresh osteochondral tissue from autologous or allogeneic sources to restore the architecture and characteristics of native tissue at the defect site. Such treatments have a successful clinical history but are limited by tissue availability. Osteochondral tissue engineering aims to fabricate osteochondral grafts in vitro but faces the challenge of integrating the cartilaginous and osseous layers to form a mechanically functional unit. The native osteochondral interface consists of a zone of calcified cartilage (ZCC) that anchors articular cartilage to subchondral bone through an interdigitated zone of intermediate stiffness. Thus, the overall goal of this dissertation was to form a functional osteochondral tissue graft in vitro by integrating articular cartilage to bone through a biomimetic transitional zone of calcified cartilage. The ZCC at the human osteochondral interface was found to have increased hydraulic conductance, or ease of fluid transport, and undergo changes in thickness and vascularity with increasing stages of osteoarthritis, suggesting that the ZCC is a zone of active tissue remodeling during cartilage repair. Cartilage explants were used to investigate conditions for in vitro calcification of cartilage and the resulting functional biomechanical consequences of matrix calcification. The in vitro calcification of immature articular cartilage in medium supplemented with beta-glycerophosphate was dependent on cell viability and occurred only in the deep zone, resulting in a local increase in mechanical stiffness. Calcification of mature cartilage occurred within 3 days in medium with supersaturated calcium and phosphate and was dependent on supplementation with fetuin, an abundant serum protein. Cartilage explants cultured atop devitalized bone underwent fetuin-mediated calcification in the zone adjacent to bone, thereby attaching cartilage to bone through a calcified cartilage interface and achieving integration strengths similar to that of native immature osteochondral tissue. These studies demonstrate that calcification can be used to integrate cartilage and bone to form a mechanically functional osteochondral graft. Such methods can be useful to provide biological fixation of cartilaginous grafts to bone for the formation of osteochondral grafts suitable for the treatment of large defects or ultimately, for resurfacing damaged or osteoarthritic joints

[er, cell, stress, cycle, checkpoint, chapter]

Characterization of the ER stress checkpoint in mammalian cells
Progression through the cell cycle adapts to both internal and environmental stimuli to ensure fidelity of cell division. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress arising from an imbalance between cellular demand for protein folding and ER capacity has been described to cause G1 cell cycle arrest. The molecular components of this ER stress checkpoint have just begun to be uncovered. Although evidence emerge to suggest a prosurvival role for the ER stress-induced cell cycle arrest, the functional significance of this checkpoint in mammalian cells largely remains as an open question. Given the implication of ER stress in multiple human diseases like cancer and neurological disorders, elucidation of the link between ER stress and cell cycle may provide new insights to the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases. In Chapter 1, I introduce the principles of cell cycle regulation and checkpoint responses, leading to a discussion on the discoveries that support an emerging ER stress checkpoint in eukaryotic cells. In Chapter 2, I investigate the mechanisms underlying cell cycle delay in G1 in response to ER stress in mammalian cells, showing that ER stress reduces the protein expression of Skp2 by downregulating Ufd1, a protein that stabilizes Skp2 through its ability to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP13. This results in an accumulation of p27 that partly contributes to G1 arrest in ER-stressed cells. In Chapter 3, I identify another regulator of the ER stress checkpoint, APC/C-Cdh1, and begin to examine the upstream signals responsible for activating APC/C-Cdh1 under ER stress conditions. In Chapter 4, I provide a summary of the work and discuss the implications of my findings

Quantitative analysis of the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide through teeth
Dental whitening is a rapidly expanding cosmetic industry. However, due to lack of quantitative analysis regarding the mass transport of hydrogen peroxide through teeth, clinical parameters like application time remain largely empirical, and little is known regarding the extent to which whitening should be supplemented with heat, light, or other activators. This study presents an experimental method fit to a mathematical model that can be used to determine the physical parameters of peroxide transport in teeth for various external conditions, sufficiently general to extend to platforms other than dental whitening. Using these methods, the diffusivity of hydrogen peroxide through bovine enamel at room temperature was determined to be 5.83×10^(-8) ± 0.50×10^(-8) cm2/s, with thermal activation energy of 48.30 ± 1.34 kJ/mol. These results, in combination with clinical studies, can be used to optimize clinical whitening parameters and serve as a basis for additional studies aimed at controlling peroxide diffusion, ultimately minimizing harmful side-effects while maintaining whitening efficacy.

The non-canonical NFkappaB pathway modulates inflammatory signaling by the canonical NFkappaB pathway
Two distinct NFkappaB signaling pathways have been described; the canonical pathway that mediates inflammatory responses, and the non-canonical pathway that is involved in immune system development. The former is dependent on the IkappaB kinase adaptor molecule NEMO, and the latter is independent of it. My dissertation encompasses approaches including biochemistry, molecular biology, mouse genetics and computational simulations to investigate potential crosstalk mechanisms between these two pathways. Specifically, I describe evidence for two distinct mechanisms by which the non-canonical NFkappaB pathway determines the responsiveness of canonical pathway to inflammatory signals. In the first mechanism, low homeostatic non-canonical signaling in tissue fibroblasts allows for accumulation of the non-canonical IkappaB, IkappaBdelta, during pathogen inflammatory exposure. Accumulation of IkappaBdelta thereby 242}0reduces RelA:p50 activity at late time points. In the second mechanism, elevated homeostatic non-canonical signaling in inflammatory dendritic cells results in the formation of a previously overlooked dimer, RelB:p50. RelB:p50 forms a complex with canonical IkappaB's and contributes to canonical signaling when cells are exposed to inflammatory stimuli. These observations suggest that NEMO-dependent and independent signaling should be viewed within the context of a single NFkappaB signaling system, which mediates signaling from both inflammatory and organogenic stimuli in an integrated manner. Further, homeostatic regulation determines the responsiveness of the signaling system and perturbed homeostatic control renders pathological outcomes. As in other regulatory biological systems, a systems approach, including mathematical models that include quantitative and kinetic information, is useful to characterize the network properties that mediate physiological function, and that may break down to cause or contribute to pathology

Cluster analysis of host cytokine responses to biodefense pathogens in a whole blood ex vivo exposure model (WEEM)
AbstractBackgroundRapid detection and therapeutic intervention for infectious and emerging diseases is a major scientific goal in biodefense and public health. Toward this end, cytokine profiles in human blood were investigated using a human whole blood ex vivo exposure model, called WEEM.ResultsSamples of whole blood from healthy volunteers were incubated with seven pathogens including Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus anthracis, and multiple strains of Yersinia pestis, and multiplexed protein expression profiling was conducted on supernatants of these cultures with an antibody array to detect 30 cytokines simultaneously. Levels of 8 cytokines, IL-1&#945;, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1 and TNF&#945;, were significantly up-regulated in plasma after bacterial exposures of 4 hours. Statistical clustering was applied to group the pathogens based on the host response protein expression profiles. The nearest phylogenetic neighbors clustered more closely than the more distant pathogens, and all seven pathogens were clearly differentiated from the unexposed control. In addition, the Y. pestis and Yersinia near neighbors were differentiated from the B. anthracis strains.ConclusionsCluster analysis, based on host response cytokine profiles, indicates that distinct patterns of immunomodulatory proteins are induced by the different pathogen exposures and these patterns may enable further development into biomarkers for diagnosing pathogen exposure.

A Novel Human Adipocyte-Derived Basement Membrane for Tissue Engineering Applications
Tissue engineering strategies have traditionally focused on the use of synthetic polymers as support scaffolds for cell growth. Recently, strategies have shifted towards a natural biologically derived scaffold, with the main focus on decellularized organs. Here, we report the development and engineering of a scaffold naturally secreted by human preadipocytes during differentiation. During this differentiation process, the preadipocytes remodel the extracellular matrix by releasing new extracellular proteins. Finally, we investigated the viability of the new basement membrane as a scaffold for tissue engineering using human pancreatic islets, and as a scaffold for soft tissue repair. After identifying the original scaffold material, we sought to improve the yield of material, treating the cell as a bioreactor, through various nutritional and cytokine stimuli. The results suggest that adipocytes can be used as bioreactors to produce a designer-specified engineered human extracellular matrix scaffold for specific tissue engineering applications.

An interdisciplinary approach to characterize flash flood occurrence frequency for mountainous Southern California
The research presented in this dissertation is a prototype synthesis of hydrologic, meteorological, and geomorphologic principles and modeling toward the characterization of flash flood occurrence frequency in the southern California mountainous region. Globally, flash flooding has the highest fatality rate per person affected among natural disasters and occurs over small spatial (<500 km²) and short time (<12 hours) scales. This research characterizes regional flash flood occurrence potential with high spatial resolution (O30 km²) through an interdisciplinary modeling approach that involves diagnostic analysis to understand the small- and large- scale forcings and effects of flash flooding in southern California, geomorphologic principles to define the level of flood occurrence in streams draining flash flood prone basins, numerical modeling of orographically-forced precipitation with high resolution, hydrologic modeling of soil moisture evolution, and, as a synthesis of models and data, the simulation of flash flood occurrence potential. The research begins with an investigation of observed precipitation and streamflow at scales relevant to flash flood occurrence, i.e., hourly to daily timescales (Chapter 1). This analysis, based on a compiled regional database, demonstrates the influence of larger scale climatic forcing on the regional precipitation and streamflow occurrence associated with flash flooding conditions in southern California. Geomorphologic principles defining bankfull streamflow and the hydrologic index for flash flood occurrence are presented in Chapter 2, with region-specific relationships for predicting bankfull conditions with high spatial resolution. High spatial and temporal resolution estimates of precipitation are required in this research due to small scales of flash flood occurrence in nature. Chapter 3 intercompares three alternative methods for estimating orographically driven precipitation in the region based on raingauge data and numerical models, and includes the adaptation and application of a simplified high resolution orographic precipitation model for southern California. The research culminates in Chapter 4 with the characterization of soil moisture climatology (1949-2005), and a multi-model ensemble characterization of the historical regional flash flood occurrence frequency. Frequency is estimated by counting the instances of precipitation exceeding the threshold satisfying bankfull and soil moisture deficit conditions as defined from the earlier geomorphologic and soil moisture modeling study. Chapter 4 concludes with an application of the integrative methodology developed to identifying changes in flash flood occurrence frequency under projected climatic change

Odor representations in olfactory cortex
Events in our external world are transformed into internal percepts and experiences. How can we begin to understand this transformation? It starts with the stimulation of peripheral sensory organs and ultimately requires the holistic synthesis of ensemble neural activity in the cortex. The cortex is composed of circuits connecting diverse types of neurons across various functional brain regions. In order to fully understand the cortical representation of an external stimulus, we must dissect out basic components of the circuit and characterize their stimulus response properties. We study neural circuits in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex of rodents using electrophysiological recordings in brain slices and < italic>in vivo</italic>. We examine the underlying synaptic mechanisms of odor representations, and how it can be modulated. First, we demonstrate an early developmental critical period for plasticity and structural changes in principal neurons of the olfactory cortex in response to sensory afferent activity. Next, we use in vivo recordings to demonstrate that synaptic inhibition is widely recruited by odor stimuli, whereas synaptic excitation is more selective in principal neurons. We show that the recruitment of both local interneurons as well as intracortical excitatory connections serve to shape odor-evoked synaptic activity. Synchronous beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations between the olfactory cortex and bulb are thought to be important for odor discrimination. We find that odor-evoked synaptic currents in principle cells of olfactory cortex are couple to beta frequency oscillations in the local field potential. A time window between oscillatory synaptic excitation and inhibition restricts the spike timing of odor-evoked spikes. Beta frequency oscillations have been shown to require a centrifugal feedback loop from olfactory cortex back to the bulb. We use an optogenetic approach to reveal that cortical feedback projections provide inhibition onto mitral cells in the olfactory bulb via activation of granule cells. This work establishes a framework to understand basic components of odor representations in olfactory cortex, and a role for cortico-bulbar feedback loop. In combination with work done in the visual, auditory, somatosensory and gustatory cortices, this study contributes to a more complete understanding of sensory information processing by cortical circuits

[chemokine, cell, cancer, receptor, functional, spectrometry, chapter, mass, gag, survival]

Structural and functional analysis of chemokine interactions with glycosaminoglycans and chemokine receptors
Chemokines are involved in cell migration and activation during routine immune surveillance, inflammation and even cancer metastasis. The migration of chemokine receptor- bearing cells, including leukocytes and tumor cells, occurs in response to the secretion of chemokines, which accumulate on cell surfaces through interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) where they effectively serve as traffic signals to guide cell movement. Engagement of chemokines with their receptors subsequently causes the activation of signaling pathways that result in firm adhesion and extravasation of the cell into tissue, and in the case of leukocytes, activation of defense mechanisms. However, in cancer cells, the signaling pathways can be exploited or redirected, resulting in responses like survival, growth and proliferation. Herein, a structural and functional approach was used to address specific questions about the interactions of chemokines (i) with GAGs and (ii) with chemokine receptors in the context of cancer. Technically, the use of mass spectrometry has been a strong theme throughout these studies. In Chapter 2, a novel application of hydroxyl radical footprinting coupled with mass spectrometry was used to characterize the GAG binding specificity of the chemokine, MCP-3/CCL7. Potential GAG binding epitopes, identified by mass spectrometry, were then validated by mutagenesis and functional assays. In Chapter 3 and 4, a phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry strategy was used to elucidate CXCL12- mediated survival signaling through the receptor, CXCR4, in cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While signaling cascades involved in chemokine- mediated migration are well established, pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation in cancer, are not. Methods developed for phosphopeptide enrichment, and subsequent analysis via mass spectrometry are described in Chapter 3, and interesting/novel phosphoproteins, potentially involved in CXCL12-mediated CLL survival are described in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, a functional approach was taken to elucidate the roles of receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer growth and metastasis. The data show that CXCR7 affects the functional activity of CXCR4 in vitro, and decreases the extent of lung metastases in vivo, without inhibiting primary tumor growth. Overall, these studies serve to better understand some of the regulatory mechanisms that control chemokine function in normal physiology and in cancer

RNA-Seq reveals complex genetic response to deepwater horizon oil release in Fundulus grandis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The release of oil resulting from the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon (DH) drilling platform was one of the largest in history discharging more than 189 million gallons of oil and subject to widespread application of oil dispersants. This event impacted a wide range of ecological habitats with a complex mix of pollutants whose biological impact is still not yet fully understood. To better understand the effects on a vertebrate genome, we studied gene expression in the salt marsh minnow Fundulus grandis, which is local to the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and is a sister species of the ecotoxicological model Fundulus heteroclitus. To assess genomic changes, we quantified mRNA expression using high throughput sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) in F. grandis populations in the marshes and estuaries impacted by DH oil release. This application of RNA-Seq to a non-model, wild, and ecologically significant organism is an important evaluation of the technology to quickly assess similar events in the future.
				
				
					
						Results
					Our de novo assembly of RNA-Seq data produced a large set of sequences which included many duplicates and fragments. In many cases several of these could be associated with a common reference sequence using blast to query a reference database. This reduced the set of significant genes to 1,070 down-regulated and 1,251 up-regulated genes. These genes indicate a broad and complex genomic response to DH oil exposure including the expected AHR-mediated response and CYP genes. In addition a response to hypoxic conditions and an immune response are also indicated. Several genes in the choriogenin family were down-regulated in the exposed group; a response that is consistent with AH exposure. These analyses are in agreement with oligonucleotide-based microarray analyses, and describe only a subset of significant genes with aberrant regulation in the exposed set.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					RNA-Seq may be successfully applied to feral and extremely polymorphic organisms that do not have an underlying genome sequence assembly to address timely environmental problems. Additionally, the observed changes in a large set of transcript expression levels are indicative of a complex response to the varied petroleum components to which the fish were exposed.

A double tweezers and laser ablation (scissors) microscope for biological studies
Optical tweezers and scissors are two common applications of laser micro-beams in biological research. Previously in our lab, there have been experiments that utilized both optical trapping and cutting, but in these experiments, optical trapping and cutting were performed at different time-points as the sample would have to be transferred from an optical cutting system to an optical trapping system or vice versa. In this project, we designed and built a combined laser scissors and tweezers microscope that (1) has two trapping beams and (2) uses a short pulsed tunable 200 fs 76 MHz 710-990 nm Ti:Sapphire laser for laser microsurgery. Both the position and power of all three beams can be independently controlled. Moreover, experiments were performed to test the ability of the system to trap and move whole chromosome or chromosome fragments inside living PTK-2 cells as well as chromosomes in suspension. The optical scissors laser was used at 730 nm to successfully cut chromosomes inside live cells. The optical traps were able to move whole chromosomes or chromosome fragments (after cutting) inside live Nocodazole-treated cells and also chromosomes isolated in suspension. The optical traps were not able to move intact or cut chromosomes inside un-treated cells, cold-treated cells or cells where the kinetochore or microtubule spindle was damaged using the optical scissors. Our experiments show that chromosome's geometry and index of refraction allow for easy trapping. However, when inside cells, the microenvironment around them, especially the microtubule spindle cage, can prevent any trapping movement

Development of FRET-based Technologies for Dynamic and Quantitative Measurement of Protein-protein Interactions and High-throughput Screening of Small Chemical Inhibitors of the SUMO Pathway
SUMOylation is an important post-translational protein modification mechanism which plays important roles in a variety of biological processes. Conjugation and deconjugation of SUMO is a cascade event requiring multiple protein-protein interactions between SUMO, SUMO E1-E3 enzymes and SUMO substrates. The nature of the SUMOylation network indicates a great potential for small chemical inhibitors to be used in the investigation and manipulation of this important pathway. FRET is an energy transfer phenomenon which occurs between two spectrum-overlapping fluorophores in close proximity. The efficiency of FRET is highly dependent on the distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores, which makes FRET very powerful in the detection of molecular interactions. The goal of my research is to develop FRET-based techniques to study protein-protein interactions in the SUMOylation network and to identify bioactive chemical compounds which can inhibit the activity of this pathway. Using engineered fluorescent proteins to modify protein components involved in the SUMOylation pathway, I set up a FRET-based assay and developed mathematical algorithms to determine the binding affinity of non-covalent protein-protein interactions. I then developed this FRET-based assay into high-throughput screening platforms to look for small chemical inhibitors which can disrupt the interaction of SUMO1 and its E2 enzyme, Ubc9. I further used FRET-based strategy to set up a whole-pathway screening assay to identify SUMOylation/deSUMOylation inhibitors. Over 200,000 compounds were screened and the positive hits were characterized for their activities in vitro and in cells. Finally, I was able to use FRET to detect the formation of intermediate protein complex during SUMOylation reactions, and used the assay to map the targets of the SUMOylation inhibitors identified from the high-throughput screening. These FRET-based applications provide powerful tools for the study of the SUMOylation pathway and can be used in the investigation of protein-protein interactions in other biological pathways.

MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS OF THE SOLAR TACHOCLINE
According to helioseismic inversions, the Sun exhibits two different rotational regimes. The inner radiative region rotates almost uniformly whereas the outer convection zone rotates differentially with the rotation rate decreasing with latitude. The transition region, which is located in the vicinity of the radiative-convective interface, is a very thin layer known as the solar tachocline. Both hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical theories have been proposed to explain such a sharp rotational transition. This thesis presents and analyzes numerical simulations of the solar tachocline that explain the rotational regimes of the interior of the Sun as the result of the interaction between fluid in motion and magnetic fields.

Different associations of white matter lesions with depression and cognition
AbstractBackgroundTo test the hypothesis that white matter lesions (WML) are primarily associated with regional frontal cortical volumes, and to determine the mediating effects of these regional frontal cortices on the associations of WML with depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.MethodsStructural brains MRIs were performed on 161 participants: cognitively normal, cognitive impaired but not demented, and demented participants. Lobar WML volumes, regional frontal cortical volumes, depressive symptom severity, and cognitive abilities were measured. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify WML volume effects on frontal cortical volume. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the MRI-depression and the MRI-cognition path relationships.ResultsWML predicted frontal cortical volume, particularly in medial orbirtofrontal cortex, irrespective of age, gender, education, and group status. WML directly predicted depressive score, and this relationship was not mediated by regional frontal cortices. In contrast, the association between WML and cognitive function was indirect and mediated by regional frontal cortices.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in older adults may differ.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in the etiology of detal hydrocephalus
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small, ubiquitous phospholipid that acts as an extracellular signaling molecule through at least six cognate G protein-coupled receptors LPA₁₋₆. These receptors mediate diverse biological responses, including developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological effects. The embryonic nervous system is a major site of LPA presence and action through its receptors, although the precise cellular and mechanistic roles are not well understood. To study the role of LPA signaling in an intact developing cortex, I developed an in utero injection paradigm targeting mouse brain and used histology and immunochemistry in combination with pharmacological perturbation and LPA receptor null mutants to study this system. Overactivation of LPA₁ via a single LPA bolus exposure causes disruption of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) residing in the ventricular zone of the fetal brain, numerous accompanying histological changes - including ventricular dilation, formation of neurorosettes and heterotopias, mitotic displacement, loss of ependymal cells, ciliary defects, and 3rd ventricular occlusion - and subsequently fetal hydrocephalus (FH). In addition, exposure to blood derivatives and components such as serum and plasma through hemorrhage, two major sources of LPA, also cause FH. This modeled disorder can be prevented using both LPA₁ null mutants and pharmacological antagonism. This novel role of LPA in the etiology of FH is consistent with multiple, independent hydrocephalic models and clinical observations, suggesting common mechanistic pathways and, importantly, potential therapeutic targets for the amelioration of this disorder

[gesture, analysis, faithfulness, laryngeal, debuccalization, perceptual, case, consonant, neutralization]

An experimental approach to debuccalization and supplementary gestures
Debuccalization is a weakening phenomenon whereby various consonants reduce to laryngeals. Examples include Spanish s-aspiration (s becomes h word-finally) and English t-glottalization (t becomes glottal stop syllable-finally). Previous analyses of debuccalization view it as a lenition process that deletes or manipulates formal phonological features. This dissertation frames debuccalization based on the articulatory gestures involved rather than features. In the default case, debuccalization processes delete oral gestures and leave behind laryngeal gestures. This is captured in an Optimality Theoretic grammar by the low ranking of faithfulness to oral gestures, and the high ranking of faithfulness to laryngeal gestures. The motivation for changing the consonant is a markedness constraint which favors more articulatorily efficient consonants. When this constraint outranks oral faithfulness, consonants debuccalize.This constraint system allows us to account for many cases of debuccalization well, but it highlights other cases where the laryngeal gestures of the debuccalized consonant and the fortis version are not identical---cases which show supplementary gestures. These supplementary gestures require an explanation, and three competing analyses are considered: perceptual faithfulness, dissimilation, and neutralization avoidance. The perceptual faithfulness analysis claims that the laryngeal gesture is changed to make the resulting sound more similar to the underlying sound. The dissimilation analysis states that the laryngeal gesture is changed to make it less like its neighboring sounds. Finally, the neutralization avoidance analysis claims that laryngeal gestures must change to avoid neutralization with other phonemes.I first demonstrate that all three analyses are able to account for the case study of Indonesian k-debuccalization (k becomes glottal stop in coda position). Moreover, all three are consistent with the principles of Optimality Theory and have plausible motivations. As such, experimental data is used to provide evidence for or against the competing analyses. A perceptual experiment was designed to verify the perceptual faithfulness and dissimilation analyses, evaluating the predictions each analysis makes regarding perceptual similarity. Some evidence is found for the perceptual faithfulness account of Indonesian. An artificial grammar learning experiment was also performed, which was used to test the possibility of a learning bias of avoiding neutralization in phoneme inventories, and the evidence from this experiment provides support for the neutralization avoidance analysis.

Novel core promoter elements in the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans and their influence on expression detected by genome-wide analysis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The core promoter is the region flanking the transcription start site (TSS) that directs formation of the pre-initiation complex. Core promoters have been studied intensively in mammals and yeast, but not in more diverse eukaryotes. Here we investigate core promoters in oomycetes, a group within the Stramenopile kingdom that includes important plant and animal pathogens. Prior studies of a small collection of genes proposed that oomycete core promoters contain a 16 to 19 nt motif bearing an Initiator-like sequence (INR) flanked by a novel sequence named FPR, but this has not been extended to whole-genome analysis.
				
				
					
						Results
					We used expectation maximization to find over-represented motifs near TSSs of Phytophthora infestans, the potato blight pathogen. The motifs corresponded to INR, FPR, and a new element found about 25 nt downstream of the TSS called DPEP. TATA boxes were not detected. Assays of DPEP function by mutagenesis were consistent with its role as a core motif. Genome-wide searches found a well-conserved combined INR+FPR in only about 13% of genes after correcting for false discovery, which contradicted prior reports that INR and FPR are found together in most genes. INR or FPR were found alone near TSSs in 18% and 7% of genes, respectively. Promoters lacking the motifs had pyrimidine-rich regions near the TSS. The combined INR+FPR motif was linked to higher than average mRNA levels, developmentally-regulated transcription, and functions related to plant infection, while DPEP and FPR were over-represented in constitutively-expressed genes. The INR, FPR, and combined INR+FPR motifs were detected in other oomycetes including Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, Phytophthora sojae, Pythium ultimum, and Saprolegnia parasitica, while DPEP was found in all but S. parasitica. Only INR seemed present in a non-oomycete stramenopile.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The absence of a TATA box and presence of novel motifs show that the oomycete core promoter is diverged from that of model systems, and likely explains the lack of activity of non-oomycete promoters in Phytophthora transformants. The association of the INR+FPR motif with developmentally-regulated genes shows that oomycete core elements influence stage-specific transcription in addition to regulating formation of the pre-initiation complex.

Design of FastQuery: How to Generalize Indexing and Querying System for Scientific Data
Modern scientific datasets present numerous data management and analysis challenges. State-of-the-art index and query technologies such as FastBit are critical for facilitating interactive exploration of large datasets. These technologies rely on adding auxiliary information to existing datasets to accelerate query processing. To use these indices, we need to match the relational data model used by the indexing systems with the array data model used by most scientific data, and to
provide an efficient input and output layer for reading and writing the indices. In this work, we present a flexible design that can be easily applied to most scientific data formats. We demonstrate this flexibility by applying it to two of the most commonly used scientific data formats, HDF5 and NetCDF. We present two case studies using simulation data from the particle accelerator and climate simulation communities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new design, we also present a detailed
performance study using both synthetic and real scientific workloads.

Synthesis and Applications of Large Area Graphene-Based Electrode Systems
Graphene is a single sheet of carbon atoms with outstanding electrical and physical properties and being exploited for applications in electronics, sensors, fuel cells, photovoltaics and energy storage. However, practical designs of graphene-based electrode systems and related experimental implementations are required to realize their widespread applications in nano- to bioelectronics. In this dissertation, different graphene-based electrode systems having metallic and semiconducting properties are synthesized optimizing process conditions. Also realized is the potential of the fabricated electrode systems by applying them in practical applications such as sensor devices and fuel cells.  	The zero bandgap of semimetal graphene still limits its application as an effective field-effect transistor device or a chemiresistor sensor operating at room temperature. It has been shown theoretically and experimentally that graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) or nanomeshes (GNMs) can attain a bandgap that is large enough for a transistor device, and hence would show high sensitivity to various gaseous species or biomolecules. Large-area mono- and bilayer graphene films are synthesized by a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique depending on the carbon precursors such as methane, acetylene and ethanol, and the results are compared using optical microscopy (OM), Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A simple reactive ion etching (RIE) combined with well-established nanosphere lithography is performed on the synthesized CVD-grown monolayer graphene platform to fabricate large area GNMs with specific dimension and periodicity. The fabricated GNMs chemiresistor sensor devices show excellent sensitivity towards NO2 and NH3, significantly higher than their film counterparts. The GNM sensor devices exhibit sensitivities of about 4.32%/ppm (parts-per-million) in NO2 and 0.71%/ppm in NH3 with estimated limit of detections of 15 ppb (parts-per billion) and 160 ppb, significantly lower than Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limits of 5 ppm (NO2) and 50 ppm (NH3), respectively. The demonstrated studies on the sensing properties of graphene nanomesh would essentially lead further improvement of it's sensitivity and selectivity as a potential sensor material.	Furthermore, a three-dimensional (3D) carbon electrode in the form of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a graphene floor is applied as a supporting electrode for platinum (Pt) nanoflowers electrocatalysts in methanol oxidation as well as in nonenzymatic sensing of blood glucose. Experimental results demonstrate an enhanced efficiency of the 3D graphene-carbon nanotubes hybrid film, as catalyst support, for methanol oxidation with regard to electroactive surface area, forward anodic peak current density, onset oxidation potential, diffusion efficiency and the ratio of forward to backward anodic peak current density (If/Ib). Also, the developed nonenzymatic 3D carbon hybrid sensor responded linearly to the physiological glucose concentration ranging from 1 to 7 mM (R2 = 0.978) with a sensitivity of 11.06 µA mM-1cm-2.

Codazzi Tensors with Two Eigenvalue Functions
This paper addresses a gap in the classifcation of Codazzi tensors with exactly two eigenfunctions on a Riemannian manifold of dimension three or higher. Derdzinski proved that if the trace of such a tensor is constant and the dimension of one of the the eigenspaces is n -1, then the metric is a warped product where the base is an open interval. Tojeiro generalized this result given the existence of a certain type of function of the eigenvalues of the Codazzi tensor, of which the trace is one example. We will show the equivalence of Tojeiro's condition to three other conditions. Furthermore, we construct examples of Codazzi tensorshaving two eigenvalue functions, one of which has eigenspace dimension n-1  where the metric is not a warped product with interval base, refuting a remark in Besse that the warped product conclusion holds without any restriction on the trace.

Travel Behavior Comparisons of Active Living and Inactive Living Lifestyles
The past century’s radical change, innovation in transportation technology and concomitant increase in options for our travel modes moves us away from walking to an almost total extinction of modes that require physical exercise. This is accompanied by a modern American city design that requires the use of an automobile with urban sprawl creating distant destinations that alter older methods of travel and make active forms of transportation almost impossible. However, many more reasons exist that motivate people to choose physically inactive modes as our research shows here. Using a two-day activity diary collected in Centre County Pennsylvania, we identify which factors influence active versus inactive mode choice. In this analysis, we examine the correlation between trip purpose and travel mode, the correlation between age and travel mode, and perform an analysis of travel distances to determine what the distance threshold is for active modes. In addition, a latent class cluster analysis establishes a profile for both physically active as well as inactive travelers and their correlation with person and household characteristics. Key findings include that trips made using active modes are significantly different than trips made by inactive modes and persons with active transportation lifestyles are significantly different than persons with inactive lifestyles. This raises the following issue: policies designed for and motivated by persons with active lifestyles risk to fail if they do not succeed in meeting the needs for everyday life of those with inactive lifestyles.

Telling friends from foes : strontium isotope and trace element analysis of companion burials from Pusilhá, Toledo District, Belize
In Maya bioarchaeology, distinguishing the remains of revered ancestors from sacrificial victims often proves difficult due to the frequently poor bone preservation and the similarities of their archaeological contexts. Strontium isotope and trace element analysis are here applied to a population (n=16) of elite Maya from the Late and Terminal Classic Period (600-850 AD) site of Pusilhá, Toledo District, Belize. Three multiple burials in particular were investigated to determine whether the companion figures were sacrificed enemies or were the curated remains of revered ancestors. The strontium and trace element data find no significant differences between any the principal and companion figures, suggesting that they were not sacrificed enemies or foreigners. One burial pair, however, exhibited nonlocal signals in both individuals

Effector Functions and Regulation of Host Antiviral Immunity
Interferons (IFNs) are essential anti-viral cytokines that suppress viral infections by upregulation of antiviral effectors, collectively called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).  We identified ISGs by gene expression profiling and performed functional screen of 288 ISGs that have antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and murine gammaherpes virus (MHV68).  Validation of antiviral genes from the screen demonstrated ISGs have inhibitory effect on specific virus.  In particular, BMP2 inhibited MHV68 but not VSV replication.  Conversely, Tap1 overexpression and deficiency led to resistance and susceptibility to VSV infection, respectively, while having effect on MHV68 growth. Initially identified by its antiviral activity against VSV and MHV68, cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) was found to be an ISG that cause antiviral effect by production of a soluble oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol.  Toll-like receptor agonists induced Ch25h in an IFN-dependent manner.  Ch25h overexpression and 25HC treatment broadly inhibited replication of other enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including HIV, HSV, RSSEV, RVFV, and EBOV.  Ch25h and 25HC inhibited efficiency of viral fusion in VSV and HIV.  Administration of 25HC suppresses HIV replication in humanized mice, while functional loss of Ch25h lead to increased susceptibility to infections in vitro and in vivo.Since interferons regulate many genes that can have profound impact on cellular homeostasis, regulation of IFN is tightly regulated.  We have identified retinoid-X-receptors (RXR) to be a suppressor of type-I IFN response.  Overexpression of RXR and activation of RXR with RXR-specific agonists led to increased viral susceptibility to viral infection in RAW264.7 cell lines.  Functional loss of RXR in F9 embryonal caricoma cell lines led to increased resistance to viral infection.  RXR agonists inhibited phosphorylation of upstream signaling activators of IFN, TBK and IRF3.  Gene expression analyses show RXR inhibited many ISGs induced by dsRNA mimetic, polyI:C and partial suppression of genes induced by lipidA.  In effort to use virus as a tool to improve immunity, we developed an approach for live-attenuated vaccine development by genome-wide profiling.  Using flu as a model, we generated high-density mutations in the influenza (WSN strain) M-gene and profiled the fitness of every mutation in vivo through time.  By selecting mutants that exhibited an attenuated growth profile, we identified a mutant, W7-791, that grew in vitro, infected mice, and was not virulent.  Vaccination of mice with W7-791 conferred protection against lethal infectious dose of two strains of H1N1 influenza and a phylogenetically disparate, H3N2 virus.

[anger, trait, error, bias, state]

Evolved Error Management Biases in the Attribution of Anger
Judgments of others' emotional states and inclinations had recurrent fitness consequences for ancestral humans. Such judgments, made under uncertainty, can result in false positives (overestimating an emotional state or trait) or false negatives (underestimating the same). When the costs of these two errors consistently and historically differed, natural selection will have favored a bias toward making the less costly error. The perception of anger entails such asymmetry. Averaged across situations over evolutionary time, underestimation of anger was the more costly error, as the fitness decrements resulting from physical harm or death due to insufficient vigilance were greater than those resulting from lost social opportunities due to excessive caution. I therefore hypothesized that selection has favored an overestimation bias in the evaluations of others' state anger and general anger-proneness (trait anger) relative to evaluations of other traits to which this error asymmetry does not apply. Moreover, I hypothesized that additional attributes which make the actor more dangerous or make the observer more vulnerable increase the error asymmetry with regard to inferring state anger and trait anger, and should therefore correspondingly increase this overestimation bias. In the study described in Chapter 2 (N = 292), models photographed with a neutral expression and holding a potentially dangerous household object were judged to be angrier than those holding a harmless object, even though the held object provided no normative information about their emotional state. In Chapter 3, Study 1 (N = 161), a fictitious individual depicted in a vignette was judged to have higher trait anger than trait disgust even after controlling for the raters' perception of how emotionally he behaved. Moreover, trait anger ratings were more responsive than trait disgust ratings to behavioral cues of emotionality. In Chapter 3, Study 2 (N = 335), participants viewed images of angry or fearful faces. The interaction of factors indicating target's formidability (male sex), target's intent to harm (direct gaze), and perceiver's vulnerability (being female or high belief in a dangerous world) increased ratings of the target's trait anger but not trait fear. In aggregate, these results suggest a domain-specific bias in evaluating anger.

Tolumonas auensis (Fischer-Romero et al. 1996) is currently the only validly named species of the genus Tolumonas in the family Aeromonadaceae. The strain is of interest because of its ability to produce toluene from phenylalanine and other phenyl precursors, as well as phenol from tyrosine. This is of interest because toluene is normally considered to be a tracer of anthropogenic pollution in lakes, but T. auensis represents a biogenic source of toluene. Other than Aeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila, T. auensis strain TA 4T is the only other member in the family Aeromonadaceae with a completely sequenced type-strain genome. The 3,471,292-bp chromosome with a total of 3,288 protein-coding and 116 RNA genes was sequenced as part of the DOE Joint Genome Institute Program JBEI 2008.

Location errors were reduced to ~20 m horizontally and ~80 m vertically. The locations reveal a complex pattern of faulting with <italic>en<italic> <italic>echelon<italic> fault segments trending in toward the northwest, approximately parallel to the North American-Pacific plate boundary and <italic>en<italic> <italic>echelon<italic>, conjugate features trending to the northeast. The relocated seismicity is highly correlated with the mapped faults showing triggered surface slip in response to the EMC mainshock. Aftershocks are located between depths of 2 km and 11 km, consistent with previous studies of seismogenic thickness in the region. Three-dimensional analysis reveals individual and intersecting fault planes between 5 km and 10 km in the along-strike and along-dip directions. These fault planes remain distinct structures at depth, indicative of conjugate faulting, and do not appear to coalesce onto a through-going fault segment.  Measurements of surface displacement along the Laguna Salada-West and East (LS-W and LS-E, respectively) branches reveal no triggered surface creep on either branch following the EMC mainshock. Approximately 2 mm of triggered surface creep was observed on the LS-W in response to the 14 June 2010 M5.7 Ocotillo earthquake, however no creep was measured along the LS-E. Relocated seismicity shows that aftershock activity occurs along the LS-E, however not along the LS-W in the time period between these earthquakes. The area east of the LS-W was seismically active following the EMC mainshock, however; no systematic migration patterns were observed. Aftershock activity abruptly shuts off in this area following the Ocotillo earthquake. The majority of seismicity in the two-year period following the Ocotillo earthquake suggesting a complex spatial and temporal distribution of aftershock activity. The conjugate pattern of faulting, combination of seismicity and triggered surface creep and non-uniform aftershock migration patterns suggest that strain in the Yuha Desert is being accommodated in a complex ma

Efficient Bug Prediction and Fix Suggestions
Bugs are a well known Achilles' heel of software development. In the last few years, machine learning techniques to combat software bugs have become popular. However, results of these techniques are not good enough for practical adoption. In addition, most techniques do not provide reasons for why a code change is a bug. Furthermore, suggestions to fix the bug would be greatly beneficial. An added bonus would be engaging humans to improve the bug and fix prediction process.In this dissertation, a step-by-step procedure which effectively predicts buggy code changes (Bug Prognosticator), produces bug fix suggestions (Fix Suggester), and utilizes human feedback is presented. Each of these steps can  be used independently, but combining them allows more effective management of bugs. These techniques are tested on many open source and a large commercial project. Human feedback was used to understand and improve the performance of the techniques. Feedback was primarily gathered from industry participants in order to assess practical suitability.The Bug Prognosticator explores feature selection techniques and classifiers to improve results of code change bug prediction. The optimized Bug Prognosticator is able to achieve an average 97% precision and 70% recall when evaluated on eleven projects, ten open source and one commercial.The Fix Suggester uses the Bug Prognosticator and statistical analysis of keyword term frequencies to suggest unordered fix keywords to a code change predicted to be buggy. The suggestions are validated against actual bug fixes to confirm their utility. The Fix Suggester is able to achieve 46.9% precision and 38.9% recall on its predicted fix tokens. This is a reasonable start to the difficult problem of predicting the contents of a bug fix.To improve the efficiency of the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester, active learning is employed on willing human participants. Developers aid the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester on code changes that machines find hard to evaluate. The developer's feedback is used to enhance the performance of the Bug Prognosticator and the Fix Suggester. In addition, a user study is performed to gauge the utility of the Fix Suggester.The dissertation concludes with a discussion of future work and challenges faced by the techniques. Given the success of statistical defect prediction techniques, more industrial exposure would benefit researchers and software practitioners.

Evaluators, Explainers, Planners: The Importance of Basic Conceptions of What We Are Like as Agents
This dissertation focuses on two questions: What is right/wrong action? What is self-governed action? I argue that prominent, contemporary answers to these questions--moral theories and theories of self-governance, respectively--are grounded in basic conceptions of what we are like as agents. The substance of these theories can be explained, ultimately, in terms of a conception of what is fundamental to human agency. And I show how this observation has significant implications for how we should understand debates about which of these theories is best.	I focus on three basic conceptions of what we are like as agents: the evaluator, explainer and planning conceptions. I show that three of the leading theories of self-governance are each grounded in a different one of these conceptions and how this affects the debate about which theory is best. This way of looking at the dialectic tells against a common way of arguing against rival views. Arguments that appeal to intuitions about cases in order to generate counterexamples are not apt to be fair or persuasive because they too easily invoke contentious conceptions of what we are like as agents. But it suggests an alternative way to proceed. One can muster a holistic argument in favor of one's preferred basic conception, showing that it can ground independently plausible philosophical theories of various kinds. I suggest how such an argument might go for the evaluator conception, considering its merits as grounds for both a comprehensive theory of human agency and a moral theory.

Biosynthesis and engineering of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine : prenylated, non- ribosomal cyclic peptides of marine actinobacterial origin
Cyclomarins are potent anti-inflammatory cyclic peptides originally encountered in the estuarine streptomycete, strain CNB-982, and subsequently isolated from the marine obligate actinobacterium Salinispora arenicola CNS-205 along with the truncated antibacterial diketopiperazine cyclomarazines. The cyclomarins are composed of seven amino acid residues, two of which are of unique biosynthetic interest, 2-amino-3,5-dimethylhex-4-enoic acid (ADH), which has never been reported as a constituent of any peptide, and N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan, which is a rare example of the prenylation of a bacterial non-ribosomal peptide. The N-prenylated tryptophan residue, along with delta-hydroxyleucine, is present in both the cyclomarins and cyclomarazines, suggesting a common biosynthetic origin. Because of the unique structural features of ADH and N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan, along with the extensive tailoring of the remaining residues of cyclomarin, we initiated the interrogation of the biosynthetic machinery behind cyclomarin and cyclomarazine synthesis. We were able to determine the basic steps of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine production, along with insights into how the two unique amino acids are synthesized. Furthermore, we were able to identify the oxidative enzymes involved in tailoring both peptides. Analysis of the genome sequence of S. arenicola CNS-205 revealed the cym biosynthetic gene cluster, which is dominated by cymA, encoding for a seven module non- ribosomal peptide synthetase. Downstream of cymA are the genes for N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan synthesis via the prenyltransferase CymD, and ADH via cymE-H. CymEF is an aldolase/dehydrogenase pair utilized for the key C-C bond forming step of ADH synthesis, along with a methyltransferase CymG, and a dehydrogenase CymH. Upstream of cymA is the Fe²⁺/alpha-ketoglutarate dependent leucine delta-oxygenase CymW, and three cytochrome P450s oxidases, CymO, CymS, and CymV. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with in vivo mutagenesis confirmed the role of Cym W along with CymS as a N-(1,1-dimethyl-1-allyl)- tryptophan beta-hydroxylase, and CymV as a N-(1,1- dimethyl-2,3-epoxypropyl)-tryptophan epoxidase, and suggested the function of CymO as a phenylalanine beta- hydroxylase . In addition to establishing the function of the aforementioned enzymes, we were able to generate the novel N-(1-methyl)-tryptophan and N-(1-propargyl)- tryptophan analogs of both sized peptides in the cymD deficient mutant, confirming the preference for N- alkylated tryptophan residues and the amenability of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine to derivatization via mutasynthesis

Energy deposition in the body from external sources to chemically trigger cellular responses in desired localized regions
One of the major challenges of modern chemotherapy is to deliver a therapeutic dose of active drug to the tumor tissue without causing systemic exposure. The realization of this goal could considerably reduce the negative side effects experienced by patients. The work conducted in this thesis looks at two different approaches to trigger drug activation with the use of external energy sources. This avoids the challenges of relying solely on biochemical and environmental differences as triggers. The two triggers used were low intensity focused ultrasound and 365 nm light delivered with a custom designed needle UV LED fiber optic system. Both can be localized within the body to spatially highlight just the tumor tissue creating a stark differentiation between it and the healthy tissue. The 365nm light based delivery scheme developed here was the first demonstration of a photoactivatable doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug called DOX-PCB. DOX-PCB was shown to be 200 times less toxic than DOX and could be activated to a fully therapeutic form upon exposure to 365nm light. The pharmacokinetics showed a circulation half life comparable to that of DOX and stability against in vivo metabolic degradation. The 365 nm light was shown to adequately irradiate a centimeter of tumor tissue and cause localized activation. In vivo tumors exposed to the light had significantly higher doses of DOX than unexposed control tumors in the same individual. The second delivery scheme made use of focused ultrasound to activate echogenic drug delivery vehicles. These vehicles were the first demonstration of encapsulating microbubbles within liposomes. Specially designed optical equipment documented that the microbubble was ultrasound responsive. The microbubble was shown to violently cavitate and rupture the outer liposome membrane releasing the payload contents. The three dimensional localization of activation was demonstrated in tissue phantoms. The strengths of these two delivery schemes could complement each other when used together. The delivery vehicle could achieve high doses of DOX-PCB within the tumor while the low toxicity prevents harm to the liver and spleen. The 365 nm light could then activate just the DOX-PCB found within the tumor itself causing localized cell death

Ernest Belfort Bax: Marxist, Idealist, Positivist
Bax was the leading philosopher of the socialist revival in Britain during the 1880s.  He saw Marxism as an economic and historical science that lacked a philosophical and ethical basis.  Consequently, he tried to justify the Marxian dialectic by using a philosophy indebted to German idealism to show that the dialectic was a fact about reality itself, and he also tried to provide an ethical defence of Marxism in terms of a positivist ethic enshrining the goals of the French Revolution.  Such an understanding of Bax's philosophy makes his political activities appear more rational than historians have previously thought.

[chaos, noise, step, sensory, system]

Chaotic neocortical dynamics.
The first step of the sensory systems is to construct the meaning of the information they receive from the senses. They do this by generating random noise and then filtering the noise with adaptive filters. We simulate the operation with the solutions of matrices of ordinary differential equations that predict bifurcations between point and limit cycle attractors. The second step is integration of the outputs from the several sensory systems into a multisensory percept (gestalt), which in the third step is consolidated and stored as knowledge. Simulation of the second step requires use of landscapes of non-convergentchaoticattractors. This is not deterministic chaos, which is much too brittle owing to the infinite sensitivity to initial conditions. It is a hybrid form we callstochastic chaos, which is stabilized by additive noise modeled on noise sources in the sensory systems. Thus bifurcation and chaos theory provides tools for succinct empirical models of cortical dynamics performing the most basic cognitive operations: generalization, abstraction, and categorization in constructing knowledge. The descriptions are in a form that is suitable for more advanced modeling using analog VLSI, neuropercolation from random graph theory, non-equilibrium dissipative thermodynamics, and macroscopic many-body physics. This review concludes with a summary of the applications of stochastic chaos in pattern classification and some prescriptions for neurobiologists on what to look for in large-scale anatomical formations.

[field, spacetime, quantum, model, general, scalar, manifold]

A Model of Spacetime Emergence in the Early Universe
This thesis proposes and develops much of the groundwork for a model of emergent physics, posited to describe the initial condition and early evolution of a universe.  Two different considerations motivate the model.  First, the spacetime manifold underlying general relativity and quantum theory is a complex object with much structure, but its origin is unexplained by the standard picture.  Second, it is argued, the usual assumption of the preexistence of this manifold leads to possibly intractable theoretical (not observational) difficulties with the usual cosmological inflation idea.  Consistent with both considerations, the assumption of a manifold that precedes a big bang cosmology is dropped; instead, a spacetime manifold with metric, Lorentz symmetry, and manifestation of standard quantum fields propagating on the spacetime all emerge in the model from a simpler, statistically scale invariant underlying structure, driven by an inflation-like process.    The basic structural components of the model are a stochastic (not quantum or classical) scalar field on a general metric space, plus a collection of quantum fields that supply the matter content once spacetime begins to emerge.  Importantly, standard quantum fields cannot be defined on the pre-emergent space; this is addressed by assuming quantum theory exists a priori, and then postulating that quantum fields can begin to manifest once an approximate spacetime has emerged.  Atypical fluctuations in the scalar field transiently break the statistical scale invariance in a localized region of the general metric space; a very small subset have field configurations of approximate spacetimes which can potentially evolve into an initial condition for a universe.  Spacetime structure and geometry then arise from the dependence of propagation speeds and spatial/temporal distances on variations in the scalar field; these variations are seeded by the matter (quantum) fields.  The thesis develops the mathematics of the basic components of the model in some detail, outlines a mechanism whereby scale invariance is broken and dimensionality is fixed, and develops processes and scenarios wherein variations in the scalar field can lead to spacetime geometry in an inflation-like process.  The resulting picture of spacetime is then compared with that of general relativity.

[soil, pile, resistance]

Nonlinear behavior and modeling of piles in partially liquefied and layered soil conditions
Saturated soils, particularly cohesionless soils, may liquefy when subjected to earthquake excitation, resulting in reductions in strength and stiffness of the soil. The consequences have shown to be devastating to foundations in past earthquakes. For pile foundations, a reduction of vertical or lateral soil resistance may cause failure of the super structure. To study this issue, two unique 1-g soil-pile tests were conducted. The models were constructed in a laminar soil box which was subsequently placed on a uniaxial shake table. One experiment focused on characterizing the soil resistance of partially liquefied soil, while the other on multi-layered soil and the effect of its movement and load demands on the nonlinear behavior of piles. These two different experimental configurations illustrate scenarios commonly observed in the field, where the behavior of the soil and the pile merit further investigation. While evidence in the literature indicates that the lateral soil ("p-y") resistance of piles in liquefiable soils is significantly reduced, the shape and amplitude of the reduced p-y curve during pore pressure build-up is not well understood. To investigate this, a single steel pile embedded in homogeneous saturated Nevada sand was subjected to sequential dynamic shaking and lateral inertial equivalent loading. A key goal in the test program was to develop a data set capable of rendering insight into the characteristics of p-y resistance under developing and partial liquefied soil conditions. Test data were used to back-calculate p-y resistance curves for partially liquefied soils. These curves are subsequently adopted in a numerical study of the behavior of piles in partially liquefied soils considering different layering conditions. In contrast, in a multi-layered soil profile, if a loose layer liquefies, large localized plastic demands may be generated in the piles. In the case of concrete piles, these demands manifest flexural cracks in the concrete, which weakens the pile and exposes it to subsequent environmental degradation. During the experiments conducted herein to study this issue, plastic demands in the pile were characterized using curvature profiles coupled with back-calculation of the plastic hinge length and post-test physical observations. Numerical modeling studies demonstrate the applicability of current design- oriented tools to capture these key response parameters needed for design

High Performance Abrasion-Resistant Materials:  Lessons from Nature
Chitons are marine mollusks found worldwide in the intertidal or subtidal zones of cold water as well as in tropical waters. These organisms have evolved an amazing feeding structure called a radula. The radula is a ribbon-like structure that consists of abrasion resistant teeth anchored to a flexible stylus that the organism uses to abrade rocky substrates to reach endolithic and epilithic algae. In this work, we investigated the radula in Cryptochiton stelleri, the largest of the chitons. Using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, an ultrastructural analysis and investigation of mechanical properties of fully mineralized radular teeth from C. stelleri, as well as the mineralization process of these teeth, has been performed to gain insights into structure-function relationships of the abrasion resistant, impact tolerant, and anti-fatigue composites synthesized by nature. Shape, wear patterns, and feeding positions of the teeth have been analyzed to provide teeth working conditions that can be used in finite element analysis modeling of the tooth, which helps to provide a foundation to produce abrasion-resistant, impact-tolerant and anti-fatigue materials.     An overall analysis of mature radular teeth using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Raman Spectroscopy revealed a magnetite containing hard shell with an iron phosphate containing soft core. &#945;-chitin was also identified in mature teeth with powder XRD. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis uncovered the higher carbon concentration at the core region than at the shell. Hardness and modulus gradients from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the teeth, which contributes to a self-sharpening mechanism, were revealed by nanoindentation. The mechanical measurements revealed the teeth had the highest hardness (12.5 GPa) and modulus (125 GPa) of any biomineral reported to date.    Phase transformation and structural development during the biomineralization process of the radular teeth were analyzed with EDS, synchrotron XRD, Micro- X-ray Fluorescence (µXRF), SEM and TEM. The phase transformation from ferrihydrite to magnetite, which occurred at the tip of the leading edge, along with aggregation of mineral particles and shrinkage of organic fibers were discovered.     Regional micro- and nanostructures as well as the mechanical properties of the mature teeth were characterized via SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces, TEM and nanoindentation. Nanorods structures were found at the trailing edges and the surfaces of the leading edges of teeth. The middle of the leading edge of the tooth is made of close-packed particles and exhibited the highest hardness and modulus. The rods at the trailing edge were orientated along the surface curvature of the trailing edge, while the rods at the surface of the leading edge were rotated 90°. The diameters of the rods at the trailing edge were larger than those at the leading edge. Tooth performance was simulated with FEM analysis on a radular tooth model obtained from confocal microscopy imaging. Tensile stresses were concentrated at the leading edge, while the compressive stresses were concentrated at the trailing edge. Both of the stress directions are guided along the surface curvature, following the major orientation of the rods. The combination of regional ultrastructural features of these teeth, consisting of the highest hardness and modulus mineral known in Nature, enables the radular teeth to be optimized abraders during the feeding process.

Lifetimes of Confined Acoustic Phonons in Ultrathin Silicon Membranes
We study the relaxation of coherent acoustic phonon modes with frequencies up to 500 GHz in ultrathin free-standing silicon membranes. Using an ultrafast pump-probe technique of asynchronous optical sampling, we observe that the decay time of the first-order dilatational mode decreases significantly from ∼4.7  ns to 5 ps with decreasing membrane thickness from ∼194 to 8 nm. The experimental results are compared with theories considering both intrinsic phonon-phonon interactions and extrinsic surface roughness scattering including a wavelength-dependent specularity. Our results provide insight to understand some of the limits of nanomechanical resonators and thermal transport in nanostructures.

Pink Pigmented Lesions on Massive Porites in Mo’orea: Distribution and Environmental Factors
Abstract.Much of the recent decline in coral reefs can be attributed to coral disease; however, very little is known about coral immunity. Pink non-nomral pigmented immune response lesions have been seen on massivePoritescoral in Mo’orea. Field surveys were conducted around the island measuring; sedimentation, water flow rate, location in the fringing or back reef and the number ofDendropoma maximumandSpirobranchus giganteusembedded in the coral to test for an association with the immune response. Multivariate linear regression reveals a nearly significant positive association betweenSpirobranchusgiganteusand pink lesions. This study suggestsS. giganteusmay play a role in this immune response or be linked to some other confounding factor. Thus,S.giganteuscould be a potential bio-indicator for coral disease to help aid reef conservation efforts.

Neural correlates of auditory word processing in infants and adults
For the majority of people, words are first learned and are communicated in high proportions in the auditory modality. However, the neural dynamics underlying speech perception are poorly understood. Even more limited, is knowledge of the neurophysiological processes and neuroanatomical structures that afford developing language abilities in infants. This dissertation investigates these issues in a series of related studies that are aimed at characterizing the spatial and temporal neural dynamics of auditory word processing in both developing 12-19 month old infants and adults. The first study, performed in adults, reveals new evidence for a neural response that is selective for auditory words, relative to acoustically- matched control sounds. This response appears to index a stage in speech processing wherein an incoming word sound is translated from an acoustic signal into a linguistically relevant code. This information can then be passed along the speech processing stream so that eventually the appropriate meaning of a word can be selected amongst representations stored within associative left fronto-temporal networks. The second study, performed in both adults and 12-18 month old infants, demonstrates that the neural mechanism responsible for encoding lexico-semantic word information has similar spatial and temporal characteristics in infants and adults. Prior work has not been able to establish whether infants and adults share similar neural substrates for language, and these findings suggest that the neurophysiological processes important for word understanding reside within similar neural networks throughout the lifespan. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the regional neuroanatomical changes that take place in the developing cortex of 12-19 month old- infants, the third study examines age-related changes tissues signal properties assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. This a period in development that is pivotal for emerging linguistic, cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors, however, the maturational changes that occur brain structures are poorly understood at these ages. This study reveals large changes in structural measures within precisely the specific areas that were demonstrated to generate lexico-semantic activity in study two. Together, these studies help to advance current understanding of neurophysiological processing stages and neural structures involved in auditory word processing in both the developing and mature brain. These findings invite a host of new studies that will continue to further knowledge of how speech processing is instantiated within the brain. Finally, with the use of multimodal imaging techniques such as those described in the present studies, there is increasing potential for new research aimed at understanding the neurobiological underpinning of language and other cognitive behaviors

A coexistence of small flower and interlocking pinwheel structure is observed for the self-assembly of phenyl-propynenitrile molecules, with the preference of the more complex pinwheel structure attributed to the surface stress induced by molecular adsorption. Metal-organic coordination interaction on a 2-dimensional surface has been explored through a comparative study of isocyanide and cyanide molecules with the same molecular backbones.

Vaccination with a non-human random sequence amyloid oligomer mimic results in improved cognitive function and reduced plaque deposition and micro hemorrhage in Tg2576 mice
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					It is well established that vaccination of humans and transgenic animals against fibrillar A&#946; prevents amyloid accumulation in plaques and preserves cognitive function in transgenic mouse models. However, autoimmune side effects have halted the development of vaccines based on full length human A&#946;. Further development of an effective vaccine depends on overcoming these side effects while maintaining an effective immune response.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We have previously reported that the immune response to amyloid oligomers is largely directed against generic epitopes that are common to amyloid oligomers of many different proteins and independent of a specific amino acid sequence. Here we have examined whether we can exploit this generic immune response to develop a vaccine that targets amyloid oligomers using a non-human random sequence amyloid oligomer. In order to study the effect of vaccination against generic oligomer epitopes, a random sequence oligomer (3A) was selected as it forms oligomers that react with the oligomer specific A11 antibody. Oligomer mimics from 3A peptide, A&#946;, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), and A&#946; fibrils were used to vaccinate Tg2576 mice, which develop a progressive accumulation of plaques and cognitive impairment. Vaccination with the 3A random sequence antigen was just as effective as vaccination with the other antigens in improving cognitive function and reducing total plaque load (A&#946; burden) in the Tg2576 mouse brains, but was associated with a much lower incidence of micro hemorrhage than A&#946; antigens.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					These results shows that the amyloid A&#946; sequence is not necessary to produce a protective immune response that specifically targets generic amyloid oligomers. Using a non-human, random sequence antigen may facilitate the development of a vaccine that avoids autoimmune side effects.

[burst, odor, response]

Odor-related bulbar EEG spatial pattern analysis during appetitive conditioning in rabbits.
Mildly thirsty rabbits were classically conditioned by reinforcement with water to give a discriminative licking response to the presentation of odors. The jaw movement component of the licking conditioned response (JM CR) was elicited only by the reinforced odor; an increase in the relative frequency of sniffing (RR CR) occurred to both reinforced (CS+) and nonreinforced (CS-) odors. Oscillatory electroencephalographic bursts of high-frequency (40-80 Hz) potentials were recorded epidurally from the lateral olfactory bulb with 64-electrode arrays (8 X 8, 3.5 X 3.5 mm) chronically implanted. Emphasis was on comparing bursts during odor presentation with bursts preceding odor arrival on each trial. A "detection" burst was characterized as occurring immediately after odor arrival and before the sniff response. "Discrimination" bursts occurred during the RR CR and before the JM CR onset. Significant air-odor burst differences (together with sniffing) occurred through up to six sessions for both CS+ and CS- odors for "discrimination" bursts but not for "detection" bursts.

Development and Applications of a Computational Framework for Protein and Drug Design
Interactions between biomolecules are essential to biological function, and fundamentally understanding the forces that drives these interactions is of great medical importance. Molecular modeling approaches represent a powerful set of tools for gaining a mechanistic perspective of biomolecular interactions at the atomic level. Due to the complexities of biological environments, a diverse set of molecular modeling methods are often needed to capture various aspects of biomolecular function. Here we present a computational framework that utilizes established molecular modeling methods, such as molecular dynamics, Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics, and small-molecule docking, as well as includes novel tools for elucidating the role of electrostatics in protein association. Our novel computational tool, Analysis of Electrostatics Similarity Of Proteins (AESOP), utilizes theoretical mutagenesis, electrostatic clustering, and electrostatic free energies of association to evaluate the role of each charged residue in protein association. The AESOP framework has been applied to various biomolecular systems, including barnase-bartstar, the gold-standard system for protein electrostatics, as well as for the successful design of novel SUMO-4 substrate analogs. One biological system that is of key interest is the complement immune system, which is an ancient component of innate immunity. The complement system is involved in the opsonization and clearance of foreign pathogens, and achieves its function through a cascade of protein-protein interactions largely driven by electrostatics. The key role of electrostatics in complement function is further evidenced by the existence of electrostatic "hot-spots" on the surface of complement proteins, and by the fact that pathogens utilize electrostatics in complement targeted evasion mechanisms. Over-activation of the complement system is implicated in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and as a result anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR has become an important drug target. We have developed a conformationally-sampled pharmacophore model for known C5aR antagonists, which has utility in the design/evaluation of novel C5aR antagonists. We have also performed virtual screening based on a newly developed model of the interaction between C5aR and known potent antagonist PMX-53, and have identified a structurally diverse set of potential C5aR ligands. These studies define a computational framework that has utility in the analysis of many other protein targets.

Describing strong correlations with mean-field approximations
Strong electron correlations in electronic structure theory are purely quantum effects arising as a result of degeneracies in molecules and materials, and exhibit significantly different yet interesting characters than do weak correlations. Although weak correlations have recently been able to be described very efficiently and accurately within single particle pictures, less known are good prescriptions for treating strong correlations efficiently. Brute-force calculations of strong correlations in wave 
function theories tend to be very computationally-intensive, and are usually limited to small molecules for applications.

Breaking symmetry in a mean-field approximation is an efficient alternative to acquire strong correlations with, in many cases, qualitatively accurate results. The
symmetry broken in quantum chemistry has been traditionally of spin, in so-called unrestricted methods, which typically break spatial symmetry as a consequence, and vice versa, in most situations. In this work, we present a novel approach to accurately describing strong correlations with a mean-field cost by means of Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory. We are inspired by the number-symmetry-breaking in HFB, which, with an attractive particle interaction, accounts for strong correlations, while maintaining spin and spatial symmetry. We show that this attractive interaction must be restricted to the chemically-relevant orbitals in an active space to obtain physically meaningful results. With such constraints, our constrained pairing mean-field theory (CPMFT) can accurately describe potential energy curves of various strongly-correlated molecular systems, by cleanly separating strong and weak correlations. To achieve the correct dissociation limits in hetero-atomic molecules, we have modified our CPMFT functional by adding asymptotic constraints. We also include weak correlations by combining CPMFT with density functional theory for chemically accurate results, and reveal the connection between CPMFT and traditional unrestricted methods.

The similarity between CPMFT and unrestricted methods leads us to the idea of constrained active space unrestricted mean-field approaches. Motivated by CPMFT, we partially retrieve spin-symmetry that has been fully broken in unrestricted methods. We allow symmetry breaking only in an active space. This constrained unrestricted Hartree-Fock (CUHF) is an interpolation between two extrema: the fully broken-symmetry solution and the symmetry preserved solution. This thesis defines the theory behind and reports the results of CUHF. We first show that, if an active space is chosen to include only open-shell electrons, CUHF reduces to restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF), and such CUHF proves in many ways significantly

Development of High-Throughput and Real-Time Methods for the Detection of Infectious Enteric Viruses
Waterborne transmitted viruses pose a public health threat due to their stability in aquatic environments and their ease of transmission with high morbidity rates at low infectious doses. The ability to detect infectious viruses is of critical importance for environmental health and safety. Current methods to assess the presence of infectious viruses are based on detecting the production of cytopathic effects from mammalian cell culture and can take up to weeks before positive identification. Improved methods for rapid and reliable detection and population quantification of infectious viruses are needed for public health assessments. Molecular beacons (MBs), which produce fluorescence upon target binding, provide a simple and separation-free scheme for rapid and sensitive detection of infectious viruses. However, for real-time studies in living cells, the durability of MBs is affected by the intracellular nuclease degradation. Additionally, cell fixation and permeabilization are required to maintain the cellular structure before introducing MBs. In this study, we developed several FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based MBs combined with fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the fluorescent hybrids with newly synthesized viral RNA as an indication of viral infection and to subsequently follow virus spread among cells in situ/in vivo. To prevent nucleolytic degradation, we designed MBs containing 2'-O-methyl RNA bases with phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages, which specifically target the 5' noncoding region of the viral genome. A cell-penetrating Tat peptide was appended to the FRET probes to facilitate non-invasive entry into host cells. To further improve the probe sensitivity in providing real-time and long-term detection of viral replication, MBs composed of quantum dot and gold nanoparticles were generated. Confluent cell monolayers were incubated with the probes followed by infection with virus dilutions and the fluorescence intensity was monitored in real time. Sensitivity experiments showed that 1 PFU detection limit could be achieved within one replicative cycle. The illumination of fluorescent cells increased in a dose-responsive manner and enabled the direct quantification of infectious viral doses. By introducing the modified MBs into the host cell population prior to viral infection and tracking the change of fluorescence signals, we observed cell-to-cell spread when progeny virions infected new host cells in which the infectious cycle could be repeated. The specific nature of these probes enable their utility for rapid diagnostics of viral infections and real-time viral detection in vivo provides sufficient information regarding multiple steps in infection processes at the subcellular level, which will be valuable for the prevention, control, and understanding of viral infection.

Searching for Variants, Genes, and Pathways Involved in Hyperlipidemia
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying variants with low to moderate effects on serum lipid levels.  However, determining the causal variant and underlying mechanism in an associated region has been difficult since linkage equilibrium (LD) of the associated variants often extends to large regions covering multiple genes, and GWAS provide no functional information.  Using adipose gene expression data, we provide evidence of mechanism underlying a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) GWAS signal in the apolipoprotein B (APOB) region.  First, we determined that an LDL-C GWAS signal uncovered in a population of European ancestry (rs7575840) replicates in a Mexican study sample (1).  Mexicans are an understudied population with a high prevalence of dyslipidemia; 44% of the population has high total cholesterol levels (above 200 mg/dl) (2).  To further elucidate the mechanism underlying the association between rs7575840 and LDL-C, we measured lipid particle subclasses using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and we determined that rs7575840 is also associated with apoB-containing lipid particles, including very small very-low-density lipoprotein, intermediate lipoprotein, and LDL particles (1).  We also discovered a possible mechanism underlying the increase in apoB-containing particles; rs7575840 disrupts a transcription factor binding site of the transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, impacting gene expression of APOB and a noncoding RNA BU630349 in adipose tissue (1).  In our second study, we searched for whether novel genes and biological gene expression networks associated with triglyceride (TG) levels replicated and shared across populations (Haas et al. submitted (3)).  Adipose tissue has previously been shown to be involved in regulation of serum TG levels in humans (4).  High serum TG levels predispose to coronary heart disease (CHD). Searching for novel TG-associated biological networks in adipose tissue may provide novel insights into TG regulation.  We measured gene expression in adipose samples from two Finnish and one Mexican study sample.  In each study sample, we observed a module (biological gene expression network) that was significantly associated with serum TG levels (3). The most significant TG modules observed in each of the three study samples significantly overlapped (p<10-10) and shared 34 genes, utilizing two unique methods of measuring gene expression, microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Thus, the results should be robust to the measurement method of gene expression. In the 34 genes shared between the three TG modules, more nonsynonymous variants (p=0.034) and overall variants (p=0.018) were observed in individuals with high TGs when compared with the individuals with low TGs (3).  Seven of the 34 genes (ARHGAP30, CCR1, CXCL16, FERMT3, HCST, RNASET2, SELPG) were identified as the key hub genes of all three TG modules (p<10-7) (3). As only 11 of the 34 genes have prior evidence of involvement in CHD, type 2 diabetes, or obesity, our study provides 23 new candidates for TG regulation.  Furthermore, two of the 34 genes (ARHGAP9, LST1) reside in previous TG GWAS regions, suggesting them as the regional candidates underlying the GWAS signals. This study presents a novel TG biological network shared across populations.Our next study focused on determining whether Procadherin 15 (PCDH15) variants are involved with Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCHL).  Previous studies have revealed that PCDH15 resides in a region linked to FCHL (5-7), so we hypothesized that nonsynonymous variants in PCDH15 may be associated with FCHL in 92 Finnish and Dutch families.  We discovered that one variant (rs10825269) associates with serum TG, apoB, and TC (Total Cholesterol) levels in these families (8).  Next, we made a PCDH15 knockout model in collaboration with investigators at Case Western Reserve University and discovered that serum TG and TC levels decreased in mice with both copies of PCDH15 knocked out (8).

Flash pyrolysis coupled to molecular beam extraction and single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry along with quantum chemical calculations are employed to study the pyrolysis of organic molecules with relevance to combustion processes.  Branching ratios for the molecular elimination and bond fission pathways was achieved for ethyl and propyl iodides providing information about the nature of the mechanism with relation to chemical structure.  Similarly, the decompositions of a series of alkyl methyl ethers, whose anti-knock ability in commercial fuels is attributed to the molecular elimination pathway, was investigated to examine the competition of primary and subsequent homolyses at higher temperatures, which tend to promote "knock".  The isomerization/decomposition of isoprene was looked at in detail with special attention to the formation of soot precursor, most notably the "first ring" benzene.  Cyclopentadiene and methylcyclopentadiene are known to be highly sooting fuels and were pyrolyzed to study the initial steps in aromatization.  The pyrolysis of cyclohexene, cyclopentene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene were conducted to facilitate interpretation of aromatic formation and to compare experimental results with well established mechanisms.  Finally, the pyrolysis of methylcyclohexane, an important component some jet fuels, was studied.

Evolution of shell loss in Opisthobranch gastropods: sea hares (Opisthobranchia, Anaspidea) as a model system
Due to the advantages of the hard, calcifying shell, the Mollusca are one of
the most successful animal phyla. The shell forms during embryonic and larval
development; however, many molluscan groups have a highly reduced shell or have
lost it completely as development and maturation proceeds. These major
developmental transitions in shell morphology frequently correlate with ecological
transitions (e.g. diet change/change from planktonic to bethic existence pre- and
post-metamorphosis, respectively). While shell loss may leave an organism
vulnerable to predation, many have evolved alternative means to deter predators.
Here we compare and contrast the post-hatching larval development and shell
growth through the use of the life cycle staging of Bursatella leachii and Aplysia
californica in laboratory settings. The larval developmental sequence of B. leachii is
indistinguishable to other previously described plankotrophic aplysiids. However, the
growth rate and size of B. leachii larvae differ from A. californica larvae substantially,
growing relatively faster and larger by an average of 10 μm. We also describe the
life cycle of B. leachii in context of the development of the larval shell and its
subsequent loss in post-metamorphic stages. Comparison of the Stage 6 shells,
both whole and cross-sections, of A. californica and B. leachii through the use of
SEM showed little difference in morphology. These data indicate that we have
established a reliable culturing technique for B. leachii in the laboratory which makes
this species can be easily amendable to experimentation at all developmental stages.
Metamorphosis and shell loss/reduction in A. californica and B. leachii highlight the
differences of the developmental program of both species, which reflects its
complexity at a molecular, cellular and organismal level. The comparison of sea
hares is an ideal evolutionary comparative model system for the loss of acquired
features.
Molluscan biomineralization has been of broad scientific interest ranging from
paleontological (molluscan shells provide one of the best fossil records for a
metazoan phylum), to material science (perl and nacre formation) research.
Although the properties (i.e. evolutionary origins, construction, patterning, physical) of
the molluscan shell have been studied for decades, the underlying molecular and
cellular mechanisms of how shell formation occurs are just recently surfacing with the
identification of a handful of shell forming proteins. It is now known that one of the
main components involved in the control of shell synthesis are the proteinaceous
constituents of the shell matrix with in different kinds of functions (i.e. cell signaling,
enzymatic activities), which are contributing to the diversity of different shell types in
gastropod, bivalve and scaphopod molluscs. However, the differential gene
expression and regulation within the mantle still remains unknown. Here we relate
the developmental expression of eleven genes present in the mantle, the organ
responsible for the secretion of the shell, in the sea hare Aplysia californica
(Opisthobranchia, Anaspidea). Six genes that show very little changes in expression
levels (Cluster 1). Three genes shows increased levels of expression during
trochophore and veliger stages which then decrease in metamorphic stages (Cluster
3). Two genes had peptide-like profiles, genes that low expression during early

Odors that Modify CO2 Receptor Activity in Insects and Their Effect on Innate CO2-Mediated Behavior and Neuronal Plasticity
CO<sub>2</sub> present in exhaled air is considered to be one of the most important olfactory cues for mosquitoes, causing activation of long-distance host-seeking flight behavior, as well as increased sensitivity to other skin odors. Here I show that volatile odorants from fruit can strongly inhibit the CO<sub>2</sub> receptor in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and completely abolish CO<sub>2</sub>-mediated behavior. Using the `empty neuron' in vivo expression system we establish that the odorants act directly on the CO<sub>2</sub> receptor Gr21a/Gr63a. Following my work on italic>Drosophila</italic> , I have used electrophysiology assays to perform a comprehensive analysis of structurally related odorants in multiple vector mosquito species that have conserved CO<sub>2</sub> receptor proteins.  I have identified three novel classes of odorants that dramatically alter the response of the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive neuron. Detailed behavioral analyses for some of these odors show a dramatic disruption in the ability of mosquitoes to be attracted to CO<sub>2</sub>, offering a powerful approach to develop a new generation of insect repellents and lures that can reduce the ability of mosquitoes to seek out humans.  While looking for inhibitors of the CO<sub>2</sub> response, I have also studied italic>Drosophila</italic>  Stress Odor as well as other activators of the CO<sub>2</sub> neurons across italic>Drosophila</italic>  species to investigate the role of these odors in the ecology of the fruit fly.  In addition, I have investigated whether an odor-rich environment shapes the development of the olfactory system.  Olfactory stimuli may regulate chemosensory gene expression and neuronal plasticity in invertebrates which could potentially alter the perception of odor stimuli and lead to significant behavioral modifications.  I show that when flies are exposed to a CO<sub>2</sub> inhibitory odor immediately after eclosion, a critical period in adult olfactory development, CO<sub>2</sub> receptor expression is severely reduced.  This reduced expression is reversed when the fly is removed from odor exposure indicating that neuronal cell death does not occur.  In addition, I show that this odor exposure reduces expression of other antenna and palp specific odor receptors.

Modulation of intermolecular interactions in single- molecule magnets
Polynuclear manganese clusters exhibiting interesting magnetic and quantum properties have been an area of intense research since the discovery of the first single- molecule magnet (SMM) in 1993. These molecules, below their blocking temperature, function as single-domain magnetic particles which exhibit classical macroscale magnetic properties as well as quantum mechanical phenomena such as quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) and quantum phase interference. The union of classical and quantum behavior in these nanomaterials makes SMMs ideal candidates for high-density information storage and quantum computing. However, environmental coupling factors (nuclear spins, phonons, neighboring molecules) must be minimized if such applications are ever to be fully realized. The focus of this work is making small structural changes in well-known manganese SMMs in order to drastically enhance the overall magnetic and quantum properties of the system. Well-isolated molecules of high crystalline quality should lead to well-defined energetic and spectral properties as well. An advantage of SMMs over bulk magnetic materials is that they can be chemically altered from a "bottom-up" approach providing a synthetic tool for tuning magnetic properties. This systematic approach is utilized in the work presented herein by incorporating bulky ligands and/or counterions to "isolate" the magnetic core of Mn4 dicubane SMMs. Reducing intermolecular interactions in the crystal lattice (neighboring molecules, solvate molecules, dipolar interactions) is an important step toward developing viable quantum computing devices. Detailed bulk magnetic studies as well as single crystal magnetization hysteresis and high-frequency EPR studies on these sterically- isolated complexes show enhanced, and sometimes even unexpected, quantum dynamics. The importance of intra- and intermolecular interactions remains a common theme throughout this work, extending to other SMMs of various topology including large wheel-shaped complexes, hexanuclear rods, and even small dinuclear species

Biomechanical implications of muscle cell-ECM communication
Proper regulation of the composition and structure of muscle is vital to both its load bearing and force producing capabilities. At every scale of muscular organization, from the individual protein to the whole organ, components communicate with each other to develop and maintain a complex and dynamic equilibrium. The mechanisms and major players involved in this communication are poorly understood. Desmin is an intermediate filament protein integral to the muscle fiber cytoskeleton. It is thought to be involved in stabilizing the contractile apparatus and providing a mechanical link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effects of communication loss caused by desmin deletion on muscle physiology. An approach combining experiments and computational modeling was implemented to show that cytoskeletal alterations in muscle can have wide ranging functional consequences, from gene expression changes in the nucleus to extracellular matrix remodeling

A case-control study of physical activity patterns and risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The interactive effects of different types of physical activity on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been fully considered in previous studies. We aimed to identify physical activity patterns that take into account combinations of physical activities and examine the association between derived physical activity patterns and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
				
				
					
						Methods
					We examined the relationship between physical activity patterns, identified by principal component analysis (PCA), and AMI risk in a case-control study of myocardial infarction in Costa Rica (N=4172), 1994-2004. The component scores derived from PCA and total METS were used in natural cubic spline models to assess the association between physical activity and AMI risk.
				
				
					
						Results
					Four physical activity patterns were retained from PCA that were characterized as the rest/sleep, agricultural job, light indoor activity, and manual labor job patterns. The light indoor activity and rest/sleep patterns showed an inverse linear relation (P for linearity=0.001) and a U-shaped association (P for non-linearity=0.03) with AMI risk, respectively. There was an inverse association between total activity-related energy expenditure and AMI risk but it reached a plateau at high levels of physical activity (P for non-linearity=0.01).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These data suggest that a light indoor activity pattern is associated with reduced AMI risk. PCA provides a new approach to investigate the relationship between physical activity and CVD risk.

Development and application of a 6.5 million feature 
affymetrix genechip® for massively parallel discovery of 
single position polymorphisms in lettuce (Lactuca spp.)
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					High-resolution genetic maps are needed in many crops to help characterize the genetic diversity that determines agriculturally important traits. Hybridization to microarrays to detect single feature polymorphisms is a powerful technique for marker discovery and genotyping because of its highly parallel nature. However, microarrays designed for gene expression analysis rarely provide sufficient gene coverage for optimal detection of nucleotide polymorphisms, which limits utility in species with low rates of polymorphism such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa).
				
				
					
						Results
					We developed a 6.5 million feature Affymetrix GeneChip&#174; for efficient polymorphism discovery and genotyping, as well as for analysis of gene expression in lettuce. Probes on the microarray were designed from 26,809 unigenes from cultivated lettuce and an additional 8,819 unigenes from four related species (L. serriola, L. saligna, L. virosa and L. perennis). Where possible, probes were tiled with a 2 bp stagger, alternating on each DNA strand; providing an average of 187 probes covering approximately 600 bp for each of over 35,000 unigenes; resulting in up to 13 fold redundancy in coverage per nucleotide. We developed protocols for hybridization of genomic DNA to the GeneChip&#174; and refined custom algorithms that utilized coverage from multiple, high quality probes to detect single position polymorphisms in 2 bp sliding windows across each unigene. This allowed us to detect greater than 18,000 polymorphisms between the parental lines of our core mapping population, as well as numerous polymorphisms between cultivated lettuce and wild species in the lettuce genepool. Using marker data from our diversity panel comprised of 52 accessions from the five species listed above, we were able to separate accessions by species using both phylogenetic and principal component analyses. Additionally, we estimated the diversity between different types of cultivated lettuce and distinguished morphological types.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					By hybridizing genomic DNA to a custom oligonucleotide array designed for maximum gene coverage, we were able to identify polymorphisms using two approaches for pair-wise comparisons, as well as a highly parallel method that compared all 52 genotypes simultaneously.

Optimized Designs and Materials for Nanostructure Based Solar Cells
Nanostructure-based solar cells are attracting significant attention as possible candidates for drastic improvement in photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion efficiency. Although such solar cells are expected to be more expensive there is growing need for the efficient and light-weight solar cells in aero-space and related industries. In this dissertation I present results of the theoretical, computational and experimental investigation of novel designs for quantum dot superlattice (QDS) based PV elements and advanced materials for transparent solar cells. In the first part of the dissertation I describe possible implementation of the intermediate-band (IB) solar cells with QDS. The IB cells were predicted to have PV efficiency exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit for a single junction cell. The parameters of QDS structure have to be carefully tuned to achieve the desired charge carrier dispersion required for the IB operation. The first-principles models were used to calculate the electrical properties and light absorption in QDS. This approach allowed me to determine the dimensions of QDS for inducing the mini-band which plays the role of the IB. Using the detailed balance theory it was determined that the upper-bound PV efficiency of such IB solar cells can be as high as ~51%. The required QDS dimensions on the basis of InAsN/GaAsSb are technologically challenging but feasible: ~2-6 nm. Using the developed simulation tools I proposed several possible designs of QDS solar cells including one, which combined the benefits of the IB concept and the advanced tandem cell design. The second part of the dissertation presents a study of graphene layers as transparent electrodes for the PV cells. The graphene layers were mechanically exfoliated from bulk graphite and characterized with micro-Raman spectroscopy. It was found that graphene electrodes have good electrical conductivity, which reveals unusual temperature dependence beneficial for the proposed application. The decrease in resistance with temperature was explained by the thermal generation of the electron-hole pairs in the conditions when the carrier mobility is limited by the defect scattering. The final part of the dissertation presents simulation results of electrical current transport in graphene ribbons, which can be used as transparent electrodes or interconnects.

Capturing circulating tumor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Early metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be detected by the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. During the course of therapeutic attempts, monitoring CTC changes in patients with HCC is helpful for the efficacy assessment. Nevertheless, the markers used for the detection, such as α-feto protein, asialoglycoprotein receptor or epithelial cell adhesion molecule, CD133 or CD90, are not specific for HCC CTCs. In spite of these limitations, a timely determination of the existence of CTCs will be beneficial for the monitoring of distant metastases, the evaluation of therapeutic attempts, and the prediction of prognosis.

THE INFLUENCE OF LIGAND PARAMETERS ON THE PHOTOLABILITY OF NITRIC OXIDE FROM DESIGNED  IRON, MANGANESE, AND RUTHENIUM NITROSYLS  UNDER VISIBLE LIGHT
Photoactive metal nitrosyls (NO complexes of metals) have drawn attention as potential drugs for delivery of nitric oxide (NO) to biological targets under the control of light. Major success in this area has been achieved with designed metal nitrosyls derived from ligands that contain carboxamide group(s). This thesis details the design strategies used to synthesize such carboxamide containing metal nitrosyls. As a first step, DFT and TDDFT calculations were used to elucidate the electronic structures and varying photoactivities of iron, manganese, and ruthenium nitrosyls derived from identical pentadentate ligand frames, as described in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, a set of tetradentate dicarboxamide ligand frames with different combinations of phosphine-P, phenolato-O, and/or pyridine-N donors was employed in order to uncover which atom types promote low-energy light absorption in ruthenium nitrosyls. Part one details the reactions of phosphine containing ligands with RuCl<sub>3</sub> and subsequent exposure to NO gas. Such reactions lead to the eventual isolation of diamagnetic Ru(II) complexes with oxidized ligand frames and no bound NO. The second part of Chapter 3 focuses on a set of {RuNO}<super>6</super> nitrosyls with dicarboxamide ligands with a varying numbers of phenolate-O and pyridine-N donors. The resulting nitrosyls have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. All three complexes are diamagnetic, exhibit &nu;NO in the range 1780-1840 cm<super>-1</super> and rapidly release NO in solution upon exposure to low power UV light. Results of theoretical studies on these {RuNO}<super>6</super> nitrosyls indicate considerable contribution from ligand orbitals in the MOs involved in transitions leading to NO photolability.	In Chapter 4, the attachment of resorufin and fluorescein derived dye chromophores was explored as a way to further sensitize ruthenium nitrosyls to visible light.  First, the steric effects of the in-plane ligands in these dye-sensitized {RuNO}<super>6</super> nitrosyls on their NO photolability were examined. Next, the direct conjugation of dye chromophores was compared with dye attachment via a linker to understand the mechanism of photoactivation in these dye-bound ruthenium nitrosyls.  In addition the fluorescence properties of these dye-conjugated nitrosyls were characterized and found to provide a potential signal showing when and where NO has been delivered.

Microbial Diversity Studies in Sediments of Perennially Ice-covered Lakes, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica
Abstract of the dissertationMicrobial diversity studies in sediments of perennially ice-covered lakes, McMurdo Dry Valleys, AntarcticabyChao TangDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in MicrobiologyUniversity of California, Riverside, October 2009Dr. Brian Lanoil, Chairperson   The primary refuge for life in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM), Antarctica, is a suite of perennially ice-covered lakes, which are entirely microbial ecosystems. Compared with the microbiology studies in the ice-cover, water column and microbial mats, microbial communities in sediments, which are important components for nutrient cycling and prokaryotic diversity in lacustrine systems, have received considerably less study in these lakes.    This is the first study characterizing detailed overall prokaryotic diversity in sediments of MCM lakes. The two selected lakes are Lake Fryxell and west lobe of Lake Bonney (WLB) from Taylor Valley. These two lakes have very distinct benthic geochemistry. Non-culture molecular techniques including clone library and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis utilizing 16S rRNA gene marker was used. High bacterial diversity and low archaeal diversity was detected in sediments of both lakes; however, the sediment microbial communities are significantly different. Sequences of major bacterial OTUs from WLB sediments exhibited exclusive relatedness to cold environment sequences, suggesting the adaptation to the coldness. Sediment microbial community in Fryxell seemed to be influenced by neighboring marine system and involved in methane cycling.    Interspersed layers of microbial mats and terrigenous particles that penetrated through the ice cover largely represent the sediments stratigraphy in MCM lakes. Sedimentation is very slow. Samples from distant sections of the long sediment core of WLB were used to investigate microbial community change over long geologic period. Different origins of sediments (biogenic or terrigenous) and microbial community's evolution were proposed as explanation for the observed differences in microbial community structure from different sections. A fine scale depth profile of surface sediments from Fryxell was studied. There was clearly microbial population change with depths, likely due to geochemistry transition.    Sulfate reduction was found to co-exist with methanogenesis in Fryxell sediments with very low sulfate. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) diversity was studied by characterizing dsrAB gene, which encodes for dissimilatory sulfite reductase, the conserved enzyme in all SRB. Two novel dsrAB lineages were discovered. Adaptation of the two dominant clusters to low sulfate condition was suggested; other clusters seemed to be related to marine SRB.

Characterization of Ultrafine Particles  and Other Traffic Related Pollutants Near Roadways in Beijing
The mass concentrations of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 um), number concentration of ultrafine particles (UFP, particles with aerodynamic diameter < 100 nm), concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as mass concentrations of black carbon (BC, results from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, usually consists of several linked carbon atoms, commonly referred to as "soot") were measured near the Peking University (PKU) campus in Beijing from December 10th to December 23rd, 2011. Correlation between UFP number concentrations and PM2.5 mass concentrations, as well as PM2.5 mass concentrations and BC mass concentrations were determined while taking into consideration the local meteorological conditions and traffic densities determined from recorded video footage. Traffic emissions were calculated using ultrafine particle number concentration (PNC) and CO2 concentrations. The PM2.5 mass concentration, PNC, BC mass concentration as well as calculated traffic emission data were compared with existing data for the Los Angeles metropolitan region. The differences and similarities between the two data sets were compared and discussed.No correlation was found between PNC and PM2.5 mass concentrations. However, a high correlation between BC and PM2.5 mass concentrations was found. Also, correlations were identified between local meteorological conditions such as wind direction and PNC, PM2.5, and BC mass concentrations near roadways, especially when the site was downwind of local traffic.  No correlation was found between wind speed and PNC, although strong correlations were found between wind speed and PM2.5, as well as BC mass concentrations. Days where both PM2.5 mass concentrations and PNC were higher at the control site were observed to be wind direction dependent, indicating the detection of regional emission sources. A strong correlation between PM2.5 mass concentrations and local visibility was also demonstrated. In terms of traffic, total traffic had almost no correlation with PNC. However, total diesel traffic was found to have some correlation to PNC, with higher diesel vehicle volume correlating to higher PNC. Finally, from the comparison between Los Angeles and Beijing data sets, Beijing tends to have higher emission factors, as well as near roadway PNC and PM2.5 mass concentrations, after controlling for wind direction.Data generated from this study could be used to model near roadway exposures to PM2.5 as well as UFP, especially from an occupational exposure standpoint for roadside workers such as food stand workers, traffic directing personnel, among others.

Genetic and Biochemical Analysis of the GTPase Associated Center of the Ribosome
A macromolecular ribonucleoprotein complex called the ribosome is responsible for translation of the genetic code into proteins. The overall structure of the ribosome and its catalytic mechanisms are highly conserved across the three kingdoms of life. During all stages of protein synthesis ribosomes interact with a family of conserved protein factors that hydrolyze a bound molecule of GTP through an intrinsic GTPase mechanism and release GDP and inorganic phosphate. In isolation, the GTPase factors have very low GTPase activity. However, upon binding to the ribosome activity of their GTPase centers is highly stimulated. The hydrolysis of GTP is coupled to conformational rearrangements that promote various stages of protein synthesis. The protein factors interact with an overlapping binding site on the large ribosomal subunit known as the GTPase Associated Center (GAC). The GAC is composed of two separate regions of the 23S rRNA known as the L11 stalk and the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL), which are proposed to individually contribute to the GTPase activation of the factors and the coupling of hydrolysis to the reactions of protein synthesis. In this work the role of the SRL and L11 stalk during protein synthesis have been explored. We find that the SRL is essential for the GTPase activity of elongation factor (EF) -G and the folding of 23S rRNA. Portions of the L11 stalk are dispensable for the GTPase activity of EF-G and EF-Tu; however, mutant ribosomes translate with reduced accuracy. A correlation between the position of the L11 stalk and the binding of translation factors is explored, and we suggest that the L11 stalk plays a direct role in controlling access of the factor's GTPase G domain to the SRL. We uncover a role for rRNA tertiary interactions in maintaining the architecture of the L11 stalk as well as a tertiary pathway between the SRL and L11 stalk. Additionally, we show that removal of the entire stalk inactivates ribosomes.

Detection of Damage in a Composite Structure Using Guided Waves
Advanced composites are being increasingly used in state-of-the-art aircraft and aerospace structures. In spite of their many advantages composite materials are highly susceptible to hidden flaws that may occur at any time during the life of a structure and if undetected, may cause sudden and catastrophic failure of the entire structure.  An example of such a structural component is the "honeycomb composite" in which thin composite skins are bonded with adhesives to the two faces of extremely lightweight and relatively thick metallic honeycombs. These components are often used in aircraft and aerospace structures due to their high strength to weight ratio. Unfortunately, the bond between the honeycomb and the skin may degrade with age and service loads can lead to separation of the load-bearing skin from the honeycomb (called "disbonds") and compromise the safety of the structure. The need for model-based studies is widely recognized in the NDE community and a great deal of work has indeed been carried out for simple, metallic structures. However the literature on composite structures is rather limited due to the enormous mathematical complexity involved in dealing with them. In this dissertation a comprehensive approach including numerical (finite element method) and analytical method is used for calculating the ultrasonic wavefield in composite structural components with and without defects.  Laboratory experiments are carried out on a composite honeycomb specimen containing damage to the skin or a localized disbond at the skin-core interfaces. The skin and the honeycomb composite are considered separately in order to understand the interaction of ultrasonic waves with damage in the two structures. The waves are launched into the specimen using a broadband PZT transducer and are detected by a distributed array of identical transducers located on the surface of the specimen. The guided wave components of the signals are shown to be strongly influenced by the presence of a defect in the skin or the honeycomb composite structure. The experimentally observed results are used to develop an autonomous scheme to locate the disbonds. The calculated results from the simulations are compared with existing and new experiments to validate and improve the models. The results should be very useful in model-based understanding of ultrasonic data collected during nondestructive inspection and evaluation (NDI/NDE) of advanced aircraft and aerospace structure and in the development of reliable health monitoring systems in the structures.

Downscaling Future Climate Projections to the Watershed Scale: A North San Francisco Bay Case Study
We modeled the hydrology of basins draining into the northern portion of the San Francisco Bay Estuary (North San Pablo Bay) using a regional water balance model (Basin Characterization Model; BCM) to estimate potential effects of climate change at the watershed scale. The BCM calculates water balance components, including runoff, recharge, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and stream flow, based on climate, topography, soils and underlying geology, and the solar-driven energy balance. We downscaled historical and projected precipitation and air temperature values derived from weather stations and global General Circulation Models (GCMs) to a spatial scale of 270 m. We then used the BCM to estimate hydrologic response to climate change for four scenarios spanning this century (2000–2100). Historical climate patterns show that Marin’s coastal regions are typically on the order of 2 °C cooler and receive five percent more precipitation compared to the inland valleys of Sonoma and Napa because of marine influences and local topography. By the last 30 years of this century, North Bay scenarios project average minimum temperatures to increase by 1.0 °C to 3.1 °C and average maximum temperatures to increase by 2.1 °C to 3.4 °C (in comparison to conditions experienced over the last 30 years, 1981–2010). Precipitation projections for the 21st century vary between GCMs (ranging from 2 to 15% wetter than the 20th-century average). Temperature forcing increases the variability of modeled runoff, recharge, and stream discharge, and shifts hydrologic cycle timing. For both high- and low-rainfall scenarios, by the close of this century warming is projected to amplify late-season climatic water deficit (a measure of drought stress on soils) by 8% to 21%. Hydrologic variability within a single river basin demonstrated at the scale of subwatersheds may prove an important consideration for water managers in the face of climate change. Our results suggest that in arid environments characterized by high topo-climatic variability, land and water managers need indicators of local watershed hydrology response to complement regional temperature and precipitation estimates. Our results also suggest that temperature forcing may generate greater drought stress affecting soils and stream flows than can be estimated by variability in precipitation alone.

The Genetics of de novo Methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana
Cytosine DNA methylation is an ancient form of transcriptional control that is conserved across all kingdoms of eukaryotes. DNA methylation plays a major role in silencing of selfish genetic elements, such as transposons. Additionally, in some instances, DNA methylation is required for genomic imprinting and regulation of endogenous genes. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, at least three pathways, each with its own methyltransferase, maintain DNA methylation. MET1 targets CG dinucleotide sequences; due to the inherent symmetry across DNA strands, MET1 is able to recognize hemimethylated sites after DNA replication, thus maintains faithful methylation patterns. CMT3 typically has preference for CHG sites (where H is A, T, or C), and is targeted to chromatin via its chromodomain, which has specificity for histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation--another epigenetic mark associated with heterochromatin. Finally, DRM2 maintains CHH, or asymmetric, methylation through targeting by a dual siRNA/long non- coding RNA pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). It should be noted that CMT3 and DRM2 are both capable of methylating non-CG sites. While all three methyltransferases maintain existing DNA methylation patterns, only the RdDM pathwayestablishes the mark in all sequence contexts, in a process known as de novo methylation. 		In this dissertation I will describe both forward and reverse genetic techniques I have used to uncover factors required for de novo methylation. For both techniques, I made use of the FWA transgene. In wild-type plants, the RdDM pathway is able to target, methylate, and silence the transgene at the repeats in its 5' UTR. However, in RdDM mutants, the transgene remains unmethylated and expresses, leading to a late-flowering phenotype. From a mutagenesis screen, I discovered novel mutations in 11 genes required for DNA methylation establishment. I will describe the methodologies of cloning and characterizing those mutants. Additionally, from the same study, I was able to show a de novo methylation phenotype from previously described RdDM mutant alleles.In a reverse genetic screen, utilizing a collection of insertional mutations in known or putative RNA binding proteins, I helped characterize a known RNA splicing factor, the first such RNA processing protein shown to be required for RdDM. I also showed that two partially redundant paralogs of the IDN2 RNA-binding protein are required for RdDM and de novo methylation. Further biochemical analysis revealed that the paralogs form a complex with IDN2. In collaboration with a structural biology group, we solved the structure of the RNA binding motif of IDN2.Finally, I will discuss the data explicating the relationship between histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylases and the RdDM pathway. We made the surprising discovery that active demethylation is required for RdDM maintenance, but not establishment. In sum, the work in this dissertation contributes to our knowledge of the components and mechanism of RdDM, and how the RNA polymerase-dependent pathway is affected by perturbations in local chromatin.

Antibodies Purification Using ELP-zz Domain Fusions
Antibodies are immune system&ndashrelated proteins called immunoglobulins (IgGs) which have applications for medical diagnostics and research. However, their purification from different sources has always been a challenge because of low antibody concentration and higher purity requirements for usage. The unique capability of Elastin like Proteins (ELPs) to reversibly precipitate at a relatively modest temperature has been utilized for purification of antibodies. This feature of ELPs to purify antibodies has already been explored using larger fusion domains such as Protein L and Protein G. However the usage of larger Protein G/L fusions with ELP resulted in 10&ndashfold lower expression when compare to ELP or ELP fusions with shorter peptides.  In the current work, ELP fusions with a small IgG&ndashbinding peptide i.e. zz domain (a synthetic IgG binding domain derived from the Staphylococcus aureus protein A) were generated. The production of ELPVPGVG&ndash78&ndashzz fusion in E. coli ( &sim 500 mg/L) was found to be five-fold higher than ELPVPGVG&ndash78&ndashProL (&sim100 mg/L). In addition, the ELPVPGVG&ndash78&ndashzz fusion showed excellent binding affinity toward human, mouse, and rabbit IgGs, enabling simple purification of the different antibodies by reversible thermal precipitation. In order to recover antibody from the ELP&ndashzz&ndashIgG complex, different elution conditions were investigated. Close to 90% recovery was achieved using 0.5 M arginine pH 3.8 buffer. To further increase the production of ELP-zz fusion protein, three different ELP domains (VPGXG)&ndash40 (where X= K:V:F=1:8:1); (VPGXG)&ndash60 (where X= K:V:F=1:8:1), (VPGXG)&ndash80 (where X= K:V:F=1:8:1), were generated. Production of ELP(KV8F)&ndashzz fusions were increased by two fold, while maintaining similar binding affinity for IgGs. Due to its high level production and affinity for different IgGs, we believe that these ELP-zz fusions will be useful as an economical, highly efficient, and universal platform for the purification of antibodies.

Towards Accurate Reconstruction of Phylogenetic Networks
Since Darwin proposed that all species on the earth have evolved from a common ancestor, evolution has played an important role in understanding biology. While the evolutionary relationships/histories of genes are represented using trees, the genomic evolutionary history may not be adequately captured by a tree, as some evolutionary events, such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), do not fit within the branches of a tree. In this case, phylogenetic networks are more appropriate for modeling evolutionary histories. 

In this dissertation, we present computational algorithms to reconstruct phylogenetic networks from different types of data. Under the assumption that species have single copies of genes, and HGT and speciation are the only events through the course of evolution, gene sequences can be sampled one copy per species for HGT detection. Given the alignments of the sequences, we propose systematic methods that estimate the significance of detected HGT events under maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). The estimated significance aims at addressing the issue of overestimation of both optimization criteria in the search for phylogenetic networks and helps the search identify networks with the ``right" number of HGT edges. We study their performance on both synthetic and biological data sets. While the studies show very promising results in identifying HGT edges, they also highlight the issues that are challenging for each criterion. 

We also develop algorithms that estimate the amount of HGT events and reconstruct phylogenetic networks by utilizing the pairwise Subtree-Prune-Regraft (SPR) operation from a collection of trees. The methods produce good results in general in terms of quickly estimating the minimum number of HGT events required to reconcile a set of trees. Further, we identify conditions under which the methods do not work well in order to help in the development of new methods in this area. 


Finally, we extend the assumption for the genetic evolutionary process and allow for duplication and loss. Under this assumption, we analyze gene family trees of proteobacterial strains using a parsimony-based approach to detect evolutionary events. Also we discuss the current issues of parsimony-based approaches in the biological data analysis and propose a way to retrieve significant estimates. 

The evolutionary history of species is complex with various evolutionary events. As HGT contributes largely to this complexity, accurately identifying HGT will help untangle evolutionary histories and solve important questions. As our algorithms identify significant HGT events in the data and reconstruct accurate phylogenetic networks from them, they can be used to address questions arising in large-scale biological data analyses.

[brain, function]

Representations: Who Needs Them?
Biologists by tradition have seldom used the term representation to describe their findings. Instead they have relied on phrases such as "receptor field" on the sensory side and "command" or "corollary discharge" on the motor side when discussing neural control of sensation and motion in goal–directed behavior. Such words connote dynamic process rather than symbolic content. One might suppose that this neglect of a now common word reflects diffidence about discussing so–called higher functions of the brain, owing to a humbling lack of understanding of the brain's complexity. Inspection of biology textbooks belies this view. Biologists have shown no lack of hubris in pontificating about the properties of the brain supporting mental functions. On the contrary, they have always taken pride in being uniquely qualified to explain brain function to anyone willing to listen.

Lung tumor tracking, trajectory reconstruction, and motion artifact removal using rotational cone-beam projections
Management of lung tumor motion is a challenging and important problem for modern, highly conformal radiotherapy. Poorly managed tumor motion can lead to imaging artifacts, poor target coverage, and unnecessarily high dose to normal tissues. The goals of this dissertation are to develop a real-time localization algorithm that is applicable to rotational cone-beam projections acquired during regular (6̃0 seconds) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, and to use these tracking results to reconstruct a tumor's trajectory, shape and size immediately prior to treatment. Direct tumor tracking is performed via a multiple template matching algorithm where templates are derived from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). Three- dimensional (3D) tumor trajectories are reconstructed by binning two-dimensional (2D) tracking results according to their corresponding respiratory phases. Within each phase bin a point is calculated approximating the 3D tumor position, resulting in a 3D phase-binned trajectory. These 3D trajectories are used to construct motion blurring functions which are in turn used to remove motion blurring artifacts from reconstructed CBCT volumes with a deconvolution algorithm. Finally, the initial direct tracking algorithm is combined with diaphragm-based tracking to develop a more robust "combined" tracking algorithm. Respiratory motion phantoms (digital and physical), and example patient cases were used to test each technique. Direct tumor tracking performed well for both phantom cases, with sub-millimeter root mean square error (erms) in the axial and tangential imager dimensions. In patient studies the algorithm performed well for many angles, but exhibited large errors for some projections. Accurate 3D trajectories were successfully reconstructed for patients and phantoms. Errors in reconstructed trajectories were smaller than the errors in the direct tracking results in all cases. The deblurring algorithm performed excellently in phantom studies. Deblurring was also effective on an example patient case, though the benefits were less stark. Finally, the combined tracking algorithm performed equally to or better than direct tumor tracking in the phantom and patient cases examined. While the preliminary results for each technique are promising, the algorithms must be tested on a larger data set with well defined ground truth to investigate potential clinical applications

[microelectrode, impedance]

Modeling And Design Of Low Impedance Microelectrodes
Microelectrodes are devices through which neural signals are obtained or delivered. The goals for designing microelectrodes are maximum selectivity (ability to select and record from a single cell) and minimum impedance. It is very important to reduce the impedance of metal microelectrodes as much as possible since the main source of noise for metal microelectrodes is thermal noise which is directly related to impedance. Signal to noise ratios are  particularly  important  in  the  quality  of  the  signal  that  can  be  received  by the microelectrode.In order to increase selectivity, small size microelectrodes are desired but as the size of the microelectrode decreases the impedance increases so fabrication of small size microelectrodes with low impedance is always a challenge.To reduce the resistance of microelectrodes a traditional approach is electroplating them with platinum black, however the impedance of the microelectrode, using this method, is generally unstable. Creating microstructures on electrodes is another approach that has been tried before without a significant success.This work investigates the problems with the design of microstructures and introduces a novel design and technique to fabricate microelectrodes with significantly lower impedance than traditional flat microelectrodes, yet more stability than the platinum black coating approach.

Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides Induce Suppression of Natural Killer Cell Function
Natural Killer (NK) cells comprise a unique subset of lymphocytes with innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells. Autologous NK cells and mature dendritic cells (DC) mutually activate each other and this interaction is believed to be important for NK cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. However, it has been shown that NK cell mediated lysis is greatly suppressed after interaction with stem cells 1-3. It is believed that a phenomenon called split angery occurs in activated NK cells, causing the cells to lose their cytotoxic functions, but gain the ability to secrete cytokines. Understanding the interactions that take place between NK cells and the tumor microenvironment, and how these immune cells are able to specifically target virally infected and cancerous cells, but not healthy cells, is crucial for future developments of more effective preventative and therapeutic approaches in the battle of infectious diseases and cancer. In this study we hypothesized that oral and intestinal bacteria promote differentiation of the Oral Squamous Cancer Stem Cells (OSCSCs) and the Colorectal carcinoma cell line (HT29) through two primary mechanisms. The first, being through direct activation of OSCSCs and HT29s, and the second being through the induction of split anergy in interacting NK cells.Patient derived oral tumors and colorectal carcinomas were used in a standard 51Chromium release assay to determine their sensitivity or resistance against NK cell mediated lysis. The secretion of key cytokines by NK cells, such as Interferon- Gamma (IFN-&#947;), were determined using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs). Experimental findings of this project demonstrate that the engagement of CD16 receptors on NK cells or interaction with monocytes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterial LPS, or AKF-1 (a combination of eight bacterial strains) lead to the support of differentiation of stem cells via increased cytokine secretion by NK cells.

The transcriptional landscape of the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum in both a toxR mutant and its parental strain
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum is an established model for studying high pressure adaptation. In this paper we analyse the parental strain DB110 and the toxR mutant TW30 by massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq). ToxR is a transmembrane DNA-binding protein first discovered in Vibrio cholerae, where it regulates a considerable number of genes involved in environmental adaptation and virulence. In P. profundum the abundance and activity of this protein is influenced by hydrostatic pressure and its role is related to the regulation of genes in a pressure-dependent manner.
				
				
					
						Results
					To better characterize the ToxR regulon, we compared the expression profiles of wt and toxR strains in response to pressure changes. Our results revealed a complex expression pattern with a group of 22 genes having expression profiles similar to OmpH that is an outer membrane protein transcribed in response to high hydrostatic pressure. Moreover, RNA-seq allowed a deep characterization of the transcriptional landscape that led to the identification of 460 putative small RNA genes and the detection of 298 protein-coding genes previously unknown. We were also able to perform a genome-wide prediction of operon structure, transcription start and termination sites, revealing an unexpected high number of genes (992) with large 5&#8242;-UTRs, long enough to harbour cis-regulatory RNA structures, suggesting a correlation between intergenic region size and UTR length.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					This work led to a better understanding of high-pressure response in P. profundum. Furthermore, the high-resolution RNA-seq analysis revealed several unexpected features about transcriptional landscape and general mechanisms of controlling bacterial gene expression.

Self-Sustaining Dynamical Nuclear Polarization Oscillations in Quantum Dots
Early experiments on spin-blockaded double quantum dots revealed robust, large-amplitude current oscillations in the presence of a static (dc) source-drain bias. Despite experimental evidence implicating dynamical nuclear polarization, the mechanism has remained a mystery. Here we introduce a minimal albeit realistic model of coupled electron and nuclear spin dynamics which supports self-sustained oscillations. Our mechanism relies on a nuclear spin analog of the tunneling magnetoresistance phenomenon (spin-dependent tunneling rates in the presence of an inhomogeneous Overhauser field) and nuclear spin diffusion, which governs dynamics of the spatial profile of nuclear polarization. The proposed framework naturally explains the differences in phenomenology between vertical and lateral quantum dot structures as well as the extremely long oscillation periods.

Through-bond Correlation Methods for Assigning Protein Resonances with Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
Solid state NMR Spectroscopy is emerging as a mainstream tool in structural biology. Resonance assignments are an essential first step in structural studies, and in the majority of studies to date, these have employed through-space, dipolar correlation spectroscopy. In NMR, it is the scalar or J-coupling interaction that signifies covalent through-bond contact, while the dipolar coupling provides through-space distance constraints. This research involves developing new correlation methods based on scalar-couplings for solid state NMR of proteins.     CTUC COSY, a new scalar-coupling-driven correlation method is introduced which is robust for chemical shift correlation in solids by combining the indirect evolution and transfer periods into a single constant time interval. Both theory and experiment point to distinct advantages of this protocol which was originally motivated by the challenge of obtaining through-bond connectivity in dynamic solids, where global molecular motion renders dipolar-driven correlation methods ineffective, and where liquid-state methodologies proved inapplicable. In this work, it was shown that this new J-MAS method provides substantially increased spectral resolution without compromising sensitivity, which we find to be comparable to or better than the sensitivity of dipolar methods. The results demonstrated that scalar-based methods are sufficiently well developed to serve as a complementary tool to dipolar methods, which will be especially useful for the assignment of large proteins, where resonance overlap presents a major challenge to solid-state NMR.

     Extensive variational computations are reported for the ground state energy of the non-relativistic two-electron atom. Several di erent sets of basis functions were systematically explored, starting with the original scheme of Hylleraas. The most rapid convergence is found with a combination of negative powers and a logarithm of the coordinate s = r1+r2. At N = 3091 terms we pass the previous best calculation (Korobov's 25 decimal accuracy with N = 5200 terms) and we stop at N = 10257 with E = -2.90372, 43770, 34119, 59831, 11592, 45194, 40444, ...     Previous mathematical analysis sought to link the convergence rate of such cal-culations to speci c analytic properties of the functions involved. The application ofthat theory to this new experimental data leaves a rather frustrating situation, wherewe seem able to do little more than invoke vague concepts, such as "flexibility." Weconclude that theoretical understanding here lags well behind the power of availablecomputing machinery.

Using computational alchemy to predict protein-ligand binding free energies
Alchemical free energy methods use the computer to make unphysical changes to select atoms of a system during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which facilitate computation of the free energy difference between two physically relevant states. For computation of protein- ligand binding free energies, alchemical intermediate simulations interpolate between the protein-bound ligand state and the unbound ligand state. The use of multiple, short, independent MD simulations has been shown to improve conformational space sampling compared to single trajectories of longer length. This dissertation describes the application of this approach to the thermodynamic integration (TI) method for computing binding free energies from alchemical simulations. Particularly in chapters two and four, the independent trajectory TI (IT- TI) approach is demonstrated to give more accurate binding free energy estimates than single TI estimates and allows calculation of a statistically well-defined uncertainty. We use IT-TI to compute accurate absolute. binding free energies for several inhibitors to the avian influenza viral protein neuraminidase and, in chapter four, also to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme RmlC. The N1 neuraminidase protein has a solvent exposed active site, with many charged residues residing on flexible loops that interact with complementary ligand charge groups. In contrast, RmlC has a smaller, less solvated, and more hydrophobic binding pocket, adding a new test case for the performance of IT-TI. In chapter two, we also use non- alchemical MD simulations to analyze important binding interactions and hydration changes within the N1 active site. We quantify the thermodynamic contributions of these interactions with relative binding free energies computed with IT-TI for alchemical modifications of select ligand moieties. In chapter three, we take further advantage of the dynamic, atomistic description of biomolecular systems afforded by MD simulations to characterize the effect of a calcium ion that binds N1 near the active site. MD simulations, along with IT-TI alchemical free energy calculations, indicate that this bound ion is key for an effective N1 binding pose and is important for accurate models of the N1-drug interface. Current implementations of alchemical methods require many user-defined and non- standardized inputs for performance of these calculations. In chapter four, we use IT-TI on both the N1 and RmlC systems to test varied TI protocols, which we find to have a significant impact on the reliability of free energy estimates. We propose a protocol that maximizes predictive power for the two investigated systems, while allowing speed up of the calculations with distributed computing. Altogether, we show the utility of IT-TI for thermodynamic analysis of biochemical events, and anticipate the application of IT-TI to develop improved and potent drugs

A microfluidic device for DNA sequencing by denaturation
The goal of this work is to develop an experimental platform to carry out controlled DNA denaturation reactions while monitoring the fractional hybridization using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Because shorter oligonucleotides denature at a lower temperature, it is possible to decode the sequence based on their melting temperatures. This technique, known as Sequencing by Denaturation, is based on the sequential denaturation of DNA fragments generated by a Sanger dideoxy sequencing reaction on surface-bound DNA templates. To perform these experiments, a device was constructed consisting of nine microfluidic channels formed by an adhesive silicone gasket sandwiched between a coverslip and a stainless steel plate that is encased in an aluminum block. Cooling and heating capabilities are provided by thermoelectric modules, which are in contact with another aluminum block that serves as the heatsink and microscope stage insert. The device satisfies the major criteria for performing this sequencing method. The microfluidic channels are uniformly heated to ensure that all the molecules experience the same temperature. Additionally, the device undergoes a consistent thermal expansion throughout the temperature ramp, allowing the imaging plane to be tracked by the microscope. We demonstrated the ability to determine the components of a denaturation profile created by the combination of four different oligonucleotide lengths. Based on simulation data, we also determined that it might be possible to resolve a denaturation curve using as few as fifty probes. Due to the speed, simplicity, and low cost of sequencing with SBD, it has potential to enable large-scale genome re-sequencing and genotyping

Dynamic Modeling of Cell Migration and Spreading Behaviors on Fibronectin Coated Planar Substrates and Micropatterned Geometries
An integrative cell migration model incorporating focal adhesion (FA) dynamics, cytoskeleton and nucleus remodeling, actin motor activity, and lamellipodia protrusion is developed for predicting cell spreading and migration behaviors. This work is motivated by two experimental works: (1) cell migration on 2-D substrates under various fibronectin concentrations and (2) cell spreading on 2-D micropatterned geometries. These works suggest (1) cell migration speed takes a maximum at a particular ligand density (~1140 molecules/µm2) and (2) that strong traction forces at the corners of the patterns may exist due to combined effects exerted by actin stress fibers (SFs). The integrative model of this paper successfully reproduced these experimental results and indicates the mechanism of cell migration and spreading. In this paper, the mechanical structure of the cell is modeled as having two elastic membranes: an outer cell membrane and an inner nuclear membrane. The two elastic membranes are connected by SFs, which are extended from focal adhesions on the cortical surface to the nuclear membrane. In addition, the model also includes ventral SFs bridging two focal adhesions on the cell surface. The cell deforms and gains traction as transmembrane integrins distributed over the outer cell membrane bond to ligands on the ECM surface, activate SFs, and form focal adhesions. The relationship between the cell migration speed and fibronectin concentration agrees with existing experimental data for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell migrations on fibronectin coated surfaces. In addition, the integrated model is validated by showing persistent high stress concentrations at sharp geometrically patterned edges. This model will be used as a predictive model to assist in design and data processing of upcoming microfluidic cell migration assays.

UTILIZING ADVANCED TECHNIQUES IN NMR SPECTROSCOPY TO STUDY THE CONFORMATIONAL ASPECTS OF MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY FOR N-METHYLATED CYCLIC PEPTIDES.
The conformational hypothesis of membrane permeability hypothesizes that certain macrocyclic scaffolds can exhibit an abnormally high degree of permeability producing a larger logP value than expected due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding which locks the macrocycle into a specific conformation where the hydrophilic functional groups are buried within the molecule causing it to become lipophilic enough to cross the membrane.  Exploring this concept in previous work resulted in the synthesis of a 32 membered library of cyclic peptides with the same sequence varying in stereochemistry and N-methylation pattern.  From this library two cyclic peptides, compounds 1 and 2 were found to exhibit an abnormally large logP value when assayed using the PAMPA permeability assay.  This result lead us to synthesize more of these compounds and subject them to a series of NMR and other analytical experiments to computationally determine these two molecules 3D structure as they exist in chloroform solution, used to mimic the environment of the inside of membrane bilayer.  These NMR structures were produced using NOESY derived distance restraints and the molecular modeling program CYANA.   These structures provide valuable information about what types of conformational motifs can be used when designing novel therapeutic compounds.

Non-Photonic Electron at High Transverse Momentum in Au+Au Collisions and Bottom Quark Production in p+p Collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV
A new form of matter with de-confined quarks and gluons, named the "Quark Gluon Plasma" (QGP), is predicted by Lattice Qutantum Chromodynamics to exist at high temperatures and/or high baryon density regions in the QCD phase diagram. Experimental evidence indicates that the QCD matter created in high energy Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven National Lab is a strongly-coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma. One of the central goals of heavy ion physics is to understand the QGP through quantitative comparisons between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Heavy flavor quarks are believed to be a unique probe for this task, because they are dominantly produced in the initial hard scatterings, where the production rate can be well calculated by perturbative-QCD(pQCD). When heavy favor quarks traverse the QGP medium, they bear the imprints of the medium via their interactions with the medium. Dynamical models have been developed to calculate the interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP medium to quantitatively extract the medium properties.This dissertation presents a series of experimental studies with the electrons produced in the semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor quarks in Au+Au and p+p collisions, which serve as the proxies for heavy flavor quarks. These electrons are referred to as non-photonic electrons (NPE), to be differentiated from the main background of photonic electrons. The production of NPE at high pT is found to be highly suppressed in central and semi-central Au+Au collisions, compared to binary-collision scaled production in p+p collisions. The azimuthal anisotropy of NPE is found to be finite at high pT, and the azimuthal correlation between high pT NPE and low pT hadrons exhibits a broadening in the away-side, both of which strengthen the evidence for a strong coupling between heavy flavor quarks and the QGP medium. In addition, the bottom quark production cross-section in p+p collisions is obtained based on the measured spectrum of NPE and the ratio of bottom/charm decay electrons.

The structures of full-length p53 monomer and tetramer when unbound to DNA and structural domain determination in p53
p53 is well-known as a tumor suppressor or genome guardian. It is a transcription factor composed of multiple domains. When bound to DNA, p53 assembles as a tetramer and starts recruiting other proteins to form a transactivation complex that initiates the transcription of p53-targeted genes. Due to p53's inherent flexibility in its N and C termini, the structure of full-length p53 has not been solved by X-ray crystallography. However, structures of fragments of p53 domains have been solved by X-ray crystallography. Electron microscopy (EM) single particle 3D reconstruction is an alternative way of solving p53's structure. In this thesis work, I have determined the structure of full-length p53 as a monomer and as a tetramer using EM single particle 3D reconstruction. p53 monomer, with a molecular weight of 43kDa, is one of the smallest proteins that have been solved by EM. The EM structure of p53 monomer looks like a sickle-shaped molecule where the N-terminus and C-terminus form a right angle, which is in agreement with existing crystallographic data. p53 tetramer, with a molecular weight of 172 kDa, has a square shape where the DNA- binding domains are not in contact and the tetrameric structure is maintained by interactions involving the N- and C-terminal domains. Based on this tetrameric structure and known structures of p53 fragments in X-ray crystallography, I have come to the conclusion that there are two distinct quaternary states of p53 tetramers, one unbound to DNA and the other bound to DNA. When unbound to DNA, p53 tetramer has an open, relaxed square shape which is larger than the compacted parallelogram shape of p53 tetramer when bound to DNA. p53 mutants often observed in cancer, which are being investigated in my lab at the moment, are speculated to accumulate inside the nucleus in this open, relaxed quaternary state

Discovering and mapping chromatin states using a tree hidden Markov model
Abstract
            
            New biological techniques and technological advances in high-throughput sequencing are paving the way for systematic, comprehensive annotation of many genomes, allowing differences between cell types or between disease/normal tissues to be determined with unprecedented breadth. Epigenetic modifications have been shown to exhibit rich diversity between cell types, correlate tightly with cell-type specific gene expression, and changes in epigenetic modifications have been implicated in several diseases. Previous attempts to understand chromatin state have focused on identifying combinations of epigenetic modification, but in cases of multiple cell types, have not considered the lineage of the cells in question.
            We present a Bayesian network that uses epigenetic modifications to simultaneously model 1) chromatin mark combinations that give rise to different chromatin states and 2) propensities for transitions between chromatin states through differentiation or disease progression. We apply our model to a recent dataset of histone modifications, covering nine human cell types with nine epigenetic modifications measured for each. Since exact inference in this model is intractable for all the scale of the datasets, we develop several variational approximations and explore their accuracy. Our method exhibits several desirable features including improved accuracy of inferring chromatin states, improved handling of missing data, and linear scaling with dataset size. The source code for our model is available at http:// http://github.com/uci-cbcl/tree-hmm

Chemical, biochemical and molecular genetic interrogation of biosynthetically robust marine cyanobacteria
Marine cyanobacteria exhibit a high production of bioactive and structurally diverse natural products. A number of these secondary metabolites or their derivatives are lead compounds in drug development programs aimed at providing new therapies to treat cancer, bacterial infections, inflammatory responses, and in crop protection to kill harmful microbial pathogens and insects. Isolation and structural analysis of marine and terrestrial cyanobacterial natural products has provided access to a large number of mixed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/ polyketide synthase (NRPS/PKS) systems. In chapter 1 of this dissertation I provide a brief history of marine natural products, arguing that the discipline was slow to begin but has grown to become a highly valuable and resourceful discipline. Also, I provide background on the genetic architecture of secondary metabolite pathways citing examples of both canonical and less-common catalytic domains in these megasynthases. Chapter 2 profiles the biochemical robustness of the marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya bouillonii. Due in part to little physiological variation among marine cyanobacteria, I argue that many of the compounds attributed to a Lyngbya sp. or Lyngbya majuscula were likely isolated from L. bouillonii. Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to the attempt of isolating the apratoxin A gene cluster from two different L. bouillonii strains. The first of these chapters describes my effort to use traditional molecular genetic techniques on a strain that was not growing in culture. This approach resulted in the isolation of a pathway inconsistent with the predicted biosynthesis of apratoxin A. In my second attempt, described in chapter 4, I used the new and fundamentally necessary approach of single cell isolation and whole genome amplification, together with traditional techniques to successfully target and isolate the apratoxin gene cluster. The project described in chapter 5 provided me the opportunity to investigate another dimension of marine cyanobacteria. I assayed the biochemical activity of the specialized ECH₁, ECH₂ and ER catalytic domains. I was able to show that the jamaicamide enzymes were catalytically active towards the non-chlorinated jam substrate

A novel critical period for inhibitory plasticity in rat somatosensory cortex
The cerebral cortex encodes sensory information with astonishing precision, but it is also confronted with the impressive task of reworking and rewiring its physiology in the face of a changing environment. Hubel and Weisel first characterized the impact of sensory deprivation on the development of cortical response properties, but there is still much we do not know about which forms of cortical plasticity are induced with sensory deprivation, as well as which cell types and synapses mediate plasticity. While traditional models of cortical plasticity proposed Hebbian ("use it or lose it") rules in excitatory circuits as the primary substrate for cortical plasticity, recent advances to the classical model include an important role for non- Hebbian forms of plasticity, and show that inhibitory circuits are a major site of sensory plasticity. A precisely regulated balance between cortical excitation and inhibition is crucial for sensory processing and plasticity, but our understanding of inhibitory synapse development is lacking. Here we investigate the impact of sensory experience on the development and function of inhibitory synapses in rat primary somatosensory cortex. I deprived the D-row of rat whiskers (beginning on the 7th postnatal day, P7) in order to probe how experience guides inhibitory synapse development. I found that deprivation reduced inhibitory currents at P15 in layer (L) 4 and at P21 in L2/3. Evoked inhibition was also reduced at P15 in L4. This reduction in inhibition constitutes a homeostatic form of plasticity, as it would ultimately increase excitatory activity in response to sensory deprivation. Surprisingly, inhibitory currents recovered to control (spared) levels after this one-day period. Our findings demonstrate that the development of inhibitory signaling in S1 during the first postnatal month occurs in a largely experience-independent fashion, but that sensory deprivation during this period causes a delayed and transient reduction in the efficacy of inhibitory signaling. Our results also reveal that these transient changes in mIPSC amplitude and frequency can be dissociated, meaning that they are mechanistically independent. These results add to the growing body of evidence that inhibitory circuits undergo homeostatic plasticity in response to sensory use and disuse in primary sensory cortex

Functional genomic analysis of the let-7 regulatory network reveals novel targets with roles in growth and development
Maintaining the proper balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation is essential to the success of multicellular organisms. Loss of regulation of these processes leads to disease states, such as cancer. The microRNA let-7 is a conserved regulatory gene that plays an important role in promoting differentiation. I have under taken a new approach to find novel regulatory targets of this essential gene in the C. elegans model system. I utilized the expression differences in wild-type and let-7 mutant strains to find candidate genes that are over-expressed in let-7 mutants. Filtering this population of genes with computational and other expression data yielded a list of potential target genes that I screened for functional interaction with let-7 by RNA interference. Among the interacting genes were several developmental regulators, some of which have conserved roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation in mammals, supporting a role for let-7 as a master regulator of these processes. I have also made significant progress toward developing a let-7 regulated reporter system that can be used to test for direct interactions with let-7 and also explore the target recognition rules for microRNAs in general

Whole transcriptome analysis of the silicon response of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Silicon plays important biological roles, but the mechanisms of cellular responses to silicon are poorly understood. We report the first analysis of cell cycle arrest and recovery from silicon starvation in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana using whole genome microarrays.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Three known responses to silicon were examined, 1) silicified cell wall synthesis, 2) recovery from silicon starvation, and 3) co-regulation with silicon transporter (SIT) genes. In terms of diatom cell wall formation, thus far only cell surface proteins and proteins tightly associated with silica have been characterized. Our analysis has identified new genes potentially involved in silica formation, and other genes potentially involved in signaling, trafficking, protein degradation, glycosylation and transport, which provides a larger-scale picture of the processes involved. During silicon starvation, an overrepresentation of transcription and translation related genes were up-regulated, indicating that T. pseudonana is poised to rapidly recover from silicon starvation and resume cell cycle progression upon silicon replenishment. This is in contrast to other types of limitation, and provides the first molecular data explaining the well-established environmental response of diatoms to grow as blooms and to out-compete other classes of microalgae for growth. Comparison of our data with a previous diatom cell cycle analysis indicates that assignment of the cell cycle specific stage of particular cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases should be re-evaluated. Finally, genes co-varying in expression with the SITs enabled identification of a new class of diatom-specific proteins containing a unique domain, and a putative silicon efflux protein.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Analysis of the T. pseudonana microarray data has provided a wealth of new genes to investigate previously uncharacterized cellular phenomenon related to silicon metabolism, silicon&#8217;s interaction with cellular components, and environmental responses to silicon.

Identification of Burseraceae trees from Peru: a comparison of the nuclear DNA marker ITS and the plastid DNA marker rbcL for DNA barcoding
The immense plant diversity that is characteristic of tropical rain forests often makes it difficult for ecological and conservation studies to identify individual plant species and measure biodiversity. DNA barcoding is a species identification technique that utilizes standard, short dnA sequences to distinguish between species when traditional taxonomic identification is not practical. Accurate identification of animals with DNA barcoding has been well established, but a universally accepted DNA barcode for plants still does not exist. The use of nuclear DNA markers and plastid DNA markers from the chloroplast are the two contending approaches to DNA barcoding. This study compares the utility of the nuclear DNA marker ItS and the plastid DNA marker rbcL as DNA barcodes among 35 Burseraceae tree species from the Peruvian Amazon. I found that the proposed DNA barcode rbcL greatly underperformed the nuclear marker ItS as a DNA barcode. While both markers exhibited greater than 90% amplification success ItS demonstrated a mean pairwise percentage sequence divergence of 5.4% while rbcL demonstrated 0.83%. Additionally, at 1% sequence divergence resolution ItS discriminated between 99% of species-pairs while rbcL only discriminated between 26%. The results of my study suggest that ItS should not be completely discounted from the plant DNA barcode debate and rbcL be reevaluated as a proposed universal barcode.

5'-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression studies reveal a transcriptomic switch during fruiting body development in Coprinopsis cinerea
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The transition from the vegetative mycelium to the primordium during fruiting body development is the most complex and critical developmental event in the life cycle of many basidiomycete fungi. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process has long been a goal of research on basidiomycetes. Large scale assessment of the expressed transcriptomes of these developmental stages will facilitate the generation of a more comprehensive picture of the mushroom fruiting process. In this study, we coupled 5'-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (5'-SAGE) to high-throughput pyrosequencing from 454 Life Sciences to analyze the transcriptomes and identify up-regulated genes among vegetative mycelium (Myc) and stage 1 primordium (S1-Pri) of Coprinopsis cinerea during fruiting body development.
				
				
					
						Results
					We evaluated the expression of &gt;3,000 genes in the two respective growth stages and discovered that almost one-third of these genes were preferentially expressed in either stage. This identified a significant turnover of the transcriptome during the course of fruiting body development. Additionally, we annotated more than 79,000 transcription start sites (TSSs) based on the transcriptomes of the mycelium and stage 1 primoridum stages. Patterns of enrichment based on gene annotations from the GO and KEGG databases indicated that various structural and functional protein families were uniquely employed in either stage and that during primordial growth, cellular metabolism is highly up-regulated. Various signaling pathways such as the cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways were also identified as up-regulated, consistent with the model that sensing of nutrient levels and the environment are important in this developmental transition. More than 100 up-regulated genes were also found to be unique to mushroom forming basidiomycetes, highlighting the novelty of fruiting body development in the fungal kingdom.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We implicated a wealth of new candidate genes important to early stages of mushroom fruiting development, though their precise molecular functions and biological roles are not yet fully known. This study serves to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fruiting body development in the model mushroom C. cinerea.

[ikappabalpha, nfkappab, folding, kinetics, binding, ar5-6, free]

The effect of consensus mutation on the folding and binding kinetics of I(kappa)B(alpha)
The NFkappaB signaling system is important in gene regulation following cellular stress and is linked with numerous cancers and inflammatory diseases. The inhibitor of NFkappaB, IkappaBalpha, holds NFkappaB in the cytoplasm until cellular signaling initiates the degradation of IkappaBalpha. Free NFkappaB enters the nucleus and up-regulates many genes, including the one for. Freshly synthesized IkappaBalpha actively dissociates NFkappaB from the DNA, returning to the resting state. The foldedness of IkappaBalpha plays several important roles in NFkappaB signaling. IkappaBalpha is composed of six ankyrin repeats (ARs), two of which, AR5-6, are weakly folded in free IkappaBalpha but fully fold upon NFkappaB binding. The weakly folded nature of AR5-6 allows quick degradation of free IkappaBalpha, keeping the cellular concentration of the free inhibitor low and ensuring a fast response when NFkappaB is activated. The foldedness of AR5-6 is also important in the stripping of NFkappaB from DNA by IkappaBalpha. Here, I examined the foldedness of IkappaBalpha by measuring the folding and binding kinetics. In Chapter 2, I examined the folding kinetics of free IkappaBalpha, measuring the kinetics of the well-folded AR1-4 fragment, then comparing the folding kinetics of the full ARD to AR1-4. Using a phi- value analysis, I found that the outer helices of AR3-4 fold first, followed by the outer helices of AR1-2 then finally inner helices. The addition of AR5-6 did not change the folding kinetics, showing that AR5-6 do not contribute to the folding of free I&kappa;B&alpha;. The bioinformatically-derived ankyrin repeat consensus was also shown to be stabilizing, and will be a useful tool providing potentially infinite stabilization of IkappaBalpha. In Chapter 3, I examined the effect of a hydroxyl modification on the biophysical properties of IkappaBalpha. We accurately measured the folding, flexibility, and binding of WT and hydroxylated IkappaBalpha and saw that these properties were unaffected by hydroxylation. In Chapter 4, I studied the coupled folding and binding kinetics of IkappaBalpha using a tryptophan probe in AR6. Stabilizing mutations had no influence on the binding kinetics, but introduction of mutations in AR6 that pre-fold AR5-6 resulted in a decreased binding rate, suggesting a fly-casting binding mechanism

The evolution of North Pacific climate since the late Miocene
A lack of paleo-proxy data has made it difficult to determine the mechanisms responsible for the warm climates of the late Miocene and early Pliocene. Though modeling work suggests that the global distribution of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the depth of the global thermocline may have been important to maintaining past warm climates, paleoceanographic data is needed to test these ideas. This dissertation uses geochemical proxy reconstructions of SST, thermocline depth, and precipitation from North Pacific sediments to test the role that the oceans played in shaping late Miocene and Pliocene climates.  Chapter 2 uses alkenone paleothermometry and d<super>18</super>O of planktonic foraminifera to show that the SSTs of the mid-latitude North Pacific ~13-5 Ma were decoupled from atmospheric <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>, possibly due to a deeper-than-modern global thermocline.  The data indicates that thermocline shoaling after ~5 Ma, possibly related to changes in ocean basin shape, led to a stronger coupling between SSTs and atmospheric <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub> in more recent epochs.  Chapter 3 uses new alkenone and Mg/Ca SSTs with published SST estimates to test the importance of SST gradients in the warm late Miocene and early Pliocene. Kriging of SST data was used to construct maps of late Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene time-slices.  The results, which show that basin-wide SST gradients were weak (relative to modern) in the early Pliocene but even weaker during the late Miocene, support the hypothesis that weak SST gradients contributed to warm global temperatures. Chapter 4 assesses the utility of the dD<sub><italic>n</italic>-alkanes</sub> in marine sediments as a proxy of precipitation on the continents.  Ground-truthing of California Margin core tops indicated that dD<sub><italic>n</italic>-alkanes</sub> from southern California Margin sediments are suitable for down-core reconstructions of past precipitation.  Additionally, a low-resolution dD<sub><italic>n</italic>-alkanes</sub> record generated for this study showed that the establishment of the modern mediterranean climate in southern California might have resulted from the SST changes described in Chapters 2 and 3. Overall, this dissertation shows that reconstructions of past oceanographic and climate conditions of the North Pacific support the hypothesis that SST gradients played a major role in shaping the warm climates of the early Pliocene and late Miocene.

[iron, sulfurreducen, fur, gene, regulator, transcriptional, uptake, key, role, expression]

Investigation of the Fur regulon in G. sulfurreducens
Iron is an essential element in bacteria as a result of being commonly used as a cofactor. In G. sulfurreducens, the assimilatory need for iron is especially high as a result of up to 111 coding sequences for c-type cytochromes, many of which have multiple heme-binding sites. It may also be necessary for G. sulfurreducens to carefully regulate its iron uptake and transport as a result of its environmental iron concentrations constantly being in flux. Thus, the direct transcriptional role of a key iron-dependent regulator known as the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) was investigated in G. sulfurreducens through expression profiling of a variety of iron conditions via microarray analysis in combination with binding sites elucidated via chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarrays (ChIP-chip). 224 genes were determined according to the ChIP-chip binding profile to be directly regulated by Fur, and 22 of these genes overlapped with differential expression observed in expression profiling. From this study, Fur was determined to be the primary regulator of genes involved in iron uptake and transport as well as a key regulatory of several other genes that play key roles in G. sulfurreducens. The implications of this study also provide a commentary on the methods generally used to determine the genome-wide role of transcriptional regulations as well as the complexity of transcriptional regulation

Production and Ebullition of Methane in a Shallow Eutrophic Lake (Lake Elsinore, CA)
The volume of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and other gases in sediments and the rate of CH4 ebullition were determined for a shallow eutrophic freshwater lake in Southern California. Gas volume, principally as CH<sub>4</sub>, was measured at 28 sites in July 2010, followed by monthly sampling at 7 sites through December 2011. Gas volumes measured in July 2010 at the 28 sites exhibited a complex dependence on sediment properties; the volume of CH<sub>4</sub> and other gases were negligible in very coarse-textured sediment with low water and organic carbon contents. Gas volumes increased strongly with increased silt content, and were highest in sediments with intermediate water contents (60-70%), organic carbon contents (2-3%) and depths (approximately 4 m). Methane was the dominant gas collected from sediment (80 - 90%), while carbon dioxide comprised roughly 2 - 3% of sediment gas in the lake. Gas sampling during cool winter months found very low or undetectable volumes of gas present, while sediment gas volumes increased markedly during the spring and early summer months, and then declined in late summer and fall. The rate of CH<sub>4</sub> ebullition, quantified with an echosounder, also varied markedly across the lake and seasonally. High rates of ebullition were measured at all 7 sites in July 2011 (up to 96 mmol CH<sub>4</sub> m<super>-2</super> d<super>-1</super>), while the rates were >50% lower in September and negligible in December 2010. Ebullition rates were inversely correlated with depth and most other sediment properties, but strongly positively correlated with sand content. No simple relationship between ebullition rate and sediment gas volume across the set of sites was found, although ebullition rates at individual sites were positively related to gas volume. Measurements of acoustic target strength of individual bubbles across the sediments and over time were also made. Bubble size and volume varied weakly across the different sediments and depths, with no strong correlation with sediment properties. A statistical characterization of the population of bubbles found broadly normally-distributed bubble size, with kurtosis values of -0.84 to +1.11 and skewness values of -0.23 to 0.62. The ensemble-average weighted mean bubble volume was 0.094&#61617;0.023 cm<super>3</super>, although individual bubbles with target strengths as low as -68dB (0.0013 cm<super>3</super>) and as high as -43dB (4.689 cm<super>3</super>) were found.

[haplotype, algorithm, pedigree, datum, zero-recombinant, genotype, configuration]

A linear-time algorithm for reconstructing zero-recombinant haplotype configuration on a pedigree
Abstract



Background

When studying genetic diseases in which genetic variations are passed on to offspring, the ability to distinguish between paternal and maternal alleles is essential. Determining haplotypes from genotype data is called haplotype inference. Most existing computational algorithms for haplotype inference have been designed to use genotype data collected from individuals in the form of a pedigree. A haplotype is regarded as a hereditary unit and therefore input pedigrees are preferred that are free of mutational events and have a minimum number of genetic recombinational events. These ideas motivated the zero-recombinant haplotype configuration (ZRHC) problem, which strictly follows the Mendelian law of inheritance, namely that one haplotype of each child is inherited from the father and the other haplotype is inherited from the mother, both without any mutation. So far no linear-time algorithm for ZRHC has been proposed for general pedigrees, even though the number of mating loops in a human pedigree is usually very small and can be regarded as constant.



Results

Given a pedigree with n individuals, m marker loci, and k mating loops, we proposed an algorithm that can provide a general solution to the zero-recombinant haplotype configuration problem in O(kmn + k
2
m) time. In addition, this algorithm can be modified to detect inconsistencies within the genotype data without loss of efficiency. The proposed algorithm was subject to 12000 experiments to verify its performance using different (n, m) combinations. The value of k was uniformly distributed between zero and six throughout all experiments. The experimental results show a great linearity in terms of execution time in relation to input size when both n and m are larger than 100. For those experiments where n or m are less than 100, the proposed algorithm runs very fast, in thousandth to hundredth of a second, on a personal desktop computer.



Conclusions

We have developed the first deterministic linear-time algorithm for the zero-recombinant haplotype configuration problem. Our experimental results demonstrated the linearity of its execution time in relation to the input size. The proposed algorithm can be modified to detect inconsistency within the genotype data without loss of efficiency and is expected to be able to handle recombinant and missing data with further extension.

The Effects of Gaseous Ozone and Nitric Acid Deposition on two Crustose Lichen Species From Joshua Tree National Park
Lichens are dependent on atmospheric deposition for much of their water and nutrients, and due to their sensitivity to pollutants, are commonly used as bioindicators for air quality. While studies have focused on epiphytic (tree dwelling) lichens as bioindicators, virtually nothing is known about crustose (rock dwelling) lichens. The atmospheric pollutants ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) are two major pollutants found within the Los Angeles Basin. While recent O<sub>3</sub> research suggests it does not significantly affect lichen growth, HNO<sub>3</sub> appears to be phytotoxic to some lichens. As both of these pollutants are deposited downwind from the L.A. basin into Joshua Tree National Park (JOTR), lichen species located in the park may provide a sensitive indicator of pollution effects. This research studied two lichen species of particular interest from Joshua Tree National Park, <italic>Lobothallia praeradiosa</italic> (Nyl.) Hafellner, and <italic>Acarospora socialis</italic> H. Magn., both of which are crustose species with unknown sensitivities to O<sub>3</sub>, as well as hypothesized and unknown sensitivities to nitrogen compounds, respectively. Little research exists for either species, possibly because of the difficulty in working with crustose lichens. This research attempted to expand the background knowledge of these species by exposing them to varying levels of O<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>, to ascertain their physiological responses. Physiological measures of chlorophyll fluorescence, dark respiration, microscopic imaging, and lichen washes (as a proxy for membrane leakage), were measured throughout the exposure period. Results indicated that both species had similar sensitivities to O<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>. Both species registered physical damage during the O<sub>3</sub> fumigation, as well as a decrease in respiration. Neither species showed major physical damage to HNO<sub>3</sub>, but both manifested a decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence, suggesting damage to the photosynthetic systems of the algae symbiont. These results suggest that both of these species could be used as passive bioindicators for O<sub>3</sub>, but may not be technically feasible for use as bioindicators of HNO<sub>3</sub> pollution. Overall, this research expanded the background knowledge of these two crustose species, their possible interactions between the fungal and algal components, their susceptibilities to two different pollutants, and their potential use as passive bioindicators for atmospheric pollution.

Discovery of ubiquitin ligases involved in cytoplasmic quality control
Selective degradation of non-native proteins by cytoplasmic quality control (CQC) mechanisms is at the heart of many misfolded protein disorders. The first line of defense is the molecular chaperone network that binds to misfolded proteins and prevents them from engaging in deleterious interactions with the surrounding environment. Degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system is a main avenue for eliminating these misfolded proteins. How the chaperone network and the ubiquitination machinery are working together in the cytoplasm to accomplish this feat is only beginning to be understood. These studies have discovered two ubiquitin ligases that are responsible for ubiquitinating and promoting the degradation of cytoplasmic misfolded proteins. These two ligases are Ubr1 and San1. Ubr1 is the first cytoplasmic ligase to be discovered to carry out quality control in this compartment in S. cerevisiae. San1 is a nuclear quality control ligase, and its discovered role in CQC highlights a previously unknown pathway for degrading cytoplasmic misfolded proteins. Both ubiquitin ligases function in a chaperone dependent manner. San1 requires chaperones for transport of misfolded proteins to the nucleus where it is believed it then ubiquitinates its substrates directly. Ubr1 more directly utilizes the chaperones for to facilitate ubiquitination. The chaperone networks of Hsp70 and Hsp90 were required for degradation and ubiquitination of CQC substrates. The Hsp70 cochaperones, Ydj1 and Sse1, were found to also be required for elimination of CQC substrates; however, other cochaperones previously found to be involved in CQC were not. This suggests that the framework for CQC is built upon the Hsp70 and Hsp90 machines, and the cochaperones modulate their activity by providing substrate specificity and recruitment of certain UPS factors to promote degradation. Additionally, Ubr1 is able to ubiquitinate insoluble CQC substrates, but requires the activity of Hsp70, Ydj1 and Sse1 to do so; indicating that chaperone function is not merely relegated to keeping misfolded proteins soluble, but is needed for presentation of misfolded substrate to the ubiquitin ligase. The E3 ligase Ubr1 is highly conserved across eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, and the knowledge gained of its role in chaperone dependent CQC will impact future studies of misfolded protein diseases

[metabolite, marine, cyanobacterium, natural, experiment, biosynthesis, product]

Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine natural products biosynthesis
The marine environment represents one of the most promising sources of novel, bioactive natural products. The process used in their discovery has been simplified and accelerated greatly in the 20th century with the advent of new technology, including spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chromatography, in conjunction with bioassay -guided fractionation. However, more recent developments in genomics and metabolomics suggest that the biosynthetic capacity and interrelationships between organisms has been underappreciated and could likely yield many more important discoveries, both in medical value and in basic biological understanding. Contained in this dissertation are a series of unique experiments that harness the capacity of Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) to detect multiple metabolites concurrently from a single, small sample. This ability is used to capture the temporal dynamics of biosynthesis and turnover of secondary metabolites from cultured marine filamentous cyanobacteria, both in relation to each other and to primary metabolites. These temporal relationships are useful for improving compound yields from cultured organisms, tracking nitrogen in nutrient cycles, as well as providing an experimental tool to explore secondary metabolism in general. Also contained are the first images of natural products captured by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry, revealing complex chemical microenvironments in marine sponges and the distribution of known bioactive metabolites in marine cyanobacteria. Initial results also suggest that there is differential distribution of metabolites in cultured cyanobacteria. A third series of experiments exploiting the sensitivity of MALDI was conducted on single cells of filamentous marine cyanobacteria that are freed from the sheath and associated heterotrophs. The results reveal that many known natural products are found in single cells, further confirming their origin of biosynthesis; however, it appears not all cells from a filament contain the same metabolites. Nitrogen labeling experiments with these same preparations suggest the biosynthesis of the metabolites that are present occurs at similar rates. The last set of experiments employ Ion Mobility mass spectrometry on various preparations of marine filamentous cyanobacteria and show that this new technology can effectively separate out halogenated metabolites from complex mixtures, a powerful tool for the identification and discovery of bioactive metabolites

Historical change in coral reef communities in Caribbean Panama
Scientists have witnessed a profound transformation in Caribbean coral reefs since the 1980s that includes a widespread mortality of corals and a shift in coral species composition. These changes have been widely attributed to modern disturbances such as coral disease and coral bleaching that have become prevalent in the most recent decades. However, the demise of corals in the Caribbean represents the most recent chapter in a long history of human alteration of Caribbean reef ecosystems. Centuries of human over-exploitation of turtles, manatees, monk seals, and predatory and large herbivorous fishes had virtually eliminated these organisms from reefs long before the 1980s. Historical deforestation of watersheds draining onto reef habitats had likely also substantially changed reef environments prior to this time. The timing and ultimate causes of change in Caribbean coral communities remains unresolved because of a lack of quantitative information about the state of these reefs from a time period preceding the 1980s. My dissertation reconstructed coral and mollusk community composition from reefs in Caribbean Panama over approximately the past 150 years to extend the timeline of ecological change. This work showed that changes in coral and mollusk communities occurred at least 50 years ago and likely as far back as the mid 19th century, a period coinciding with rapid human population growth and deforestation in the regions of study. Data confirmed that major changes in coral and mollusk communities off the Central American coast predate the first appearance of coral disease and bleaching outbreaks and that the demise of Caribbean coral populations is likely rooted in older anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing and deforestation. This work provides a more accurate ecological baseline of Caribbean coral reefs that will provide a better frame of reference for future reef management actions

Ultraviolet resonance Raman and fluorescence studies of folded and unfolded conformations of the membrane protein OmpA
This dissertation focuses on the folding dynamics of a bacterial membrane protein, Outer Membrane Protein A (OmpA), using fluorescence and Ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy. Our model Beta-barrel membrane protein, OmpA, contains five native anchoring Tryptophan residues. The spectroscopic properties of trp residues are highly sensitive to the local environment, making it an ideal probe for membrane protein folding studies. Utilizing trp fluorescence, refolding studies were performed on single trp mutants of OmpA to determine the thermodynamic stability of these trp mutants. The important noncovalent interactions that promote stability in OmpA are pairwise aromatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the N₁H moiety of trp. Refolding studies were also performed on truncated single-trp mutants, in which the soluble domain of the protein was removed. These studies resulted in increased stability relative to the full-length protein and suggest the absence of the soluble domain may destabilize the unfolded transmembrane domain. Ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRR) is a powerful vibrational technique that can selectively probe different biological chromophores depending on excitation wavelength. Excitation wavelength dependence studies were performed on OmpA using wavelengths from 206.5 nm - 236.5 nm. This study determined an optimal excitation wavelength of 228-nm to selectively enhance signal from trp residues in OmpA. Additionally, UVRR was used to monitor changes in trp environmental hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and dihedral torsion angle in different conformations of OmpA. The first UVRR spectra were collected of OmpA in a highly scattering environment and show differences in folded and unfolded conformations of the protein, showing the applicability of this technique to study membrane protein folding. UVRR spectra were collected of trp mutants of OmpA at different time points in the folding/insertion process to determine the types of noncovalent interactions with trp residues, and the folding timescales these interactions occur. Our results indicate noncovalent interactions start to form within the first 20 minutes after initiation of folding into DMPC vesicles and continue to show subtle changes over the course of the folding process. Additionally, there is evidence for interactions between trp residues and lipids, inter- residue hydrogen bonding, and amino-aromatic interactions

[impact, climate, temperature, change, essay, increase, program, farmer, yield, variation]

Three essays on environment and development economics
This dissertation is composed of three original, self- contained essays on environment and development economics. In the first essay we examine the relationship between weather and rice production at the farm level in Asia. Higher minimum temperature reduced yield while higher maximum temperature raised it; radiation's impact varied by growth phase. Combined, these effects imply that yield at most sites would have grown more rapidly during the high-yielding season but less rapidly during the low- yielding season if observed temperature trends at the end of the 20th Century had not occurred. Diurnal temperature variation must be considered when investigating the impacts of climate change on irrigated rice in Asia. In the second essay, I expand on the models used in the first, and incorporate the fact that agricultural yield functions are non-linear, with sharp negative impacts when crops are exposed to temperature in excess of certain thresholds. Exploiting exogenous variation in planting date, I demonstrate exogenous variation in above-threshold exposure-time comparable to the projected increase due to 100 years of climate change, and analyze the ability of farmers to make adjustments to compensate. I show that farmers do make small adjustments in the quantity of seed that they plant, as well as the amount of nitrogen fertilizer that they apply to the crop. This has important implications for the validity of the typical approach of using observed weather shocks to measure the impact of climate change on agriculture : farmers make adjustments according to expectations. As climate change will be slow and predictable, measuring agricultural output as a function of unpredictable shocks may overstate the true impact of climate change. The third essay is unrelated to the first two, and in it we study the consequences of poverty alleviation programs for environmental degradation. We exploit the community-level eligibility discontinuity for a conditional cash transfer program in Mexico to identify the impacts of income increases on deforestation, and use the program's initial randomized rollout to explore household responses. We find that additional income raises consumption of land-intensive goods and increases deforestation. The observed production response and deforestation increase are larger in communities with poor road infrastructure. This suggests that better access to markets disperses environmental harm and that the full effects of poverty alleviation can be observed only where poor infrastructure localizes them

Combinatorial Approaches to Accurate Identification of Orthologous Genes
The accurate identification of orthologous genes across different species is a critical and challenging problem in comparative genomics and has a wide spectrum of biological applications including gene function inference, evolutionary studies and systems biology. During the past several years, many methods have been proposed for ortholog assignment based on sequence similarity, phylogenetic approaches, synteny information, and genome rearrangement. Although these methods share many commonly assigned orthologs, each method tends to produce an ortholog assignment significantly different from the others.In this dissertation, we study the problem of assigning orthologous genes among closely related genomes on a genome scale. We first give a brief review of the existing methods for ortholog assignment in the literature, followed by a comprehensive comparison of each method. We then propose a new combinatorial approach for assigning ortholog pairs between a pair of closely related genomes by addressing the limitations of the existing methods. Our approach is based on the parsimony principle to transform one genome to another by minimizing the number of genome rearrangement events, including reversal, transposition, fusion, fission and gene duplications. By explicitly incorporating tandem gene duplication model and combining phylogenetic approaches, we develop an improved system MSOAR 2.0. Our experimental results on both simulated data and real data show that MSOAR 2.0 achieves the highest overall prediction accuracy among different programs in comparison.Based on pairwise genome comparison results, we extend our ortholog assignment method to multiple genome comparison and develop a new system MultiMSOAR 2.0 to identify ortholog groups among multiple genomes. In MultiMSOAR 2.0, pairwise orthology information produced by MSOAR 2.0 is used to construct multipartite graphs for each gene family. In order to partition each gene family into a set of disjoint sets of orthologous genes, a multidimensional matching problem is formulated and a heuristic maximum weight matching algorithm is proposed. The partition results are then used to label the species tree. Considering some biological constraints, we formulate the tree labeling problem in the combinatorial optimization framework and develop two dynamic programming algorithms to solve the problem. Our experimental results show that MultiMSOAR 2.0 achieves much higher prediction accuracy than the existing ortholog assignment systems for multiple genomes. Moreover, MultiMSOAR 2.0 also provides information about gene births, duplications and losses in evolution, which may be of independent biological interest.

Comparison of class 2 transposable elements at superfamily resolution reveals conserved and distinct features in cereal grass genomes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Class 2 transposable elements (TEs) are the predominant elements in and around plant genes where they generate significant allelic diversity. Using the complete sequences of four grasses, we have performed a novel comparative analysis of class 2 TEs. To ensure consistent comparative analyses, we re-annotated class 2 TEs in Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays and assigned them to one of the five cut-and-paste superfamilies found in plant genomes (Tc1/mariner, PIF/Harbinger, hAT, Mutator, CACTA). We have focused on noncoding elements because of their abundance, and compared superfamily copy number, size and genomic distribution as well as correlation with the level of nearby gene expression.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Our comparison revealed both unique and conserved features. First, the average length or size distribution of elements in each superfamily is largely conserved, with the shortest always being Tc1/mariner elements, followed by PIF/Harbinger, hAT, Mutator and CACTA. This order also holds for the ratio of the copy numbers of noncoding to coding elements. Second, with the exception of CACTAs, noncoding TEs are enriched within and flanking genes, where they display conserved distribution patterns, having the highest peak in the promoter region. Finally, our analysis of microarray data revealed that genes associated with Tc1/mariner and PIF/Harbinger noncoding elements have significantly higher expression levels than genes without class 2 TEs. In contrast, genes with CACTA elements have significantly lower expression than genes without class 2 TEs.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					We have achieved the most comprehensive annotation of class 2 TEs to date in these four grass genomes. Comparative analysis of this robust dataset led to the identification of several previously unknown features of each superfamily related to copy number, element size, genomic distribution and correlation with the expression levels of nearby genes. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing TE superfamilies when assessing their impact on gene and genome evolution.

[neutrino, wind, time, supernova, ndw, pn]

Signatures of the Late Time Core-Collapse Supernova Environment
The hot and dense proto-neutron star (PNS) born subsequent to core-collapse in a type II supernova explosion is an intense source of neutrinos of all flavors.  It emits the 3-5 x 10^53 ergs of gravitational binding energy gained during collapse as neutrino radiation on a time scale of tens of seconds as it contracts, becomes increasingly neutron-rich and cools.  While the supernova explosion mechanism and associated accretion of material is expected to influence the neutrino emission at early time  (i.e. t <~ 1 s post bounce) the late time neutrino signal is shaped by the properties of the PNS, such as the nuclear equation of state (EoS), neutrino opacities in dense matter, and other microphysical properties that affect the cooling timescale by influencing either neutrino diffusion or convection.  Detection of significant numbers of late time supernova neutrinos will provide a direct window into the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars, if the neutrino signal can be modeled accurately.  The average emitted neutrino energies also strongly affect nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind, neutrino induced nucleosynthesis further out in the star, and the patterns of neutrino oscillations outside of the PNS.This thesis examines a number of aspects of this environment.  First, the equations of spherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics are discussed, a new code for calculating neutrino transport in PNSs is described, and first results from this code are presented.  It is found that the NDW is neutron rich for at least a few seconds, in contrast to other recent work.  This change in the expected wind electron fraction is traced to the correct treatment of the nucleon dispersion relations in an interacting medium and turns out to be influenced by the sub-nuclear density symmetry energy.  Late time convection in PNSs is also studied.  It is found that the density dependence of the symmetry energy may affect the duration of convective activity, which is imprinted in the neutrino luminosity evolution.  The second part of the thesis focuses on the neutrino driven wind (NDW) which is blown from the surface of the PNS.  Time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of the NDW are presented, which include accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction network.  Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities,predictions of the contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the entire supernova are made. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, it is found no r-process occurs in the most basic wind scenario because the NDW entropy is too low, the dynamical timescale is too long, and the wind electron fraction is too high.  It is possible that the wind produces the N = 50 closed shell isotopes, but this depends on the neutrino luminosities employed.  The effect of a secondary heating source on the wind is then considered.  The general characteristics of a secondary heating source required to produce r-process nucleosynthesis are discussed.  Then gravitoacoustic power excited either by convection or g-mode oscillations of the PNS is considered as a possible source of this heating.  It is found that this a viable mechanism for increasing the wind entropy and decreasing the the dynamical timescale to values that are favorable for the r-process, when the neutrino spectra found in the first part of the thesis are assumed.

Investigating the molecular basis of local adaptation to thermal stress: population differences in gene expression across the transcriptome of the copepod Tigriopus californicus
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Geographic variation in the thermal environment impacts a broad range of biochemical and physiological processes and can be a major selective force leading to local population adaptation. In the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, populations along the coast of California show differences in thermal tolerance that are consistent with adaptation, i.e., southern populations withstand thermal stresses that are lethal to northern populations. To understand the genetic basis of these physiological differences, we use an RNA-seq approach to compare genome-wide patterns of gene expression in two populations known to differ in thermal tolerance.
				
				
					
						Results
					Observed differences in gene expression between the southern (San Diego) and the northern (Santa Cruz) populations included both the number of affected loci as well as the identity of these loci. However, the most pronounced differences concerned the amplitude of up-regulation of genes producing heat shock proteins (Hsps) and genes involved in ubiquitination and proteolysis. Among the hsp genes, orthologous pairs show markedly different thermal responses as the amplitude of hsp response was greatly elevated in the San Diego population, most notably in members of the hsp70 gene family. There was no evidence of accelerated evolution at the sequence level for hsp genes. Among other sets of genes, cuticle genes were up-regulated in SD but down-regulated in SC, and mitochondrial genes were down-regulated in both populations.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Marked changes in gene expression were observed in response to acute sub-lethal thermal stress in the copepod T. californicus. Although some qualitative differences were observed between populations, the most pronounced differences involved the magnitude of induction of numerous hsp and ubiquitin genes. These differences in gene expression suggest that evolutionary divergence in the regulatory pathway(s) involved in acute temperature stress may offer at least a partial explanation of population differences in thermal tolerance observed in Tigriopus.

[ctcfl, gene, cell, ctcf, expression, nucleosome]

The male germ cell gene regulator CTCFL is functionally different from CTCF and binds CTCF-like consensus sites in a nucleosome composition-dependent manner
AbstractBackgroundCTCF is a highly conserved and essential zinc finger protein expressed in virtually all cell types. In conjunction with cohesin, it organizes chromatin into loops, thereby regulating gene expression and epigenetic events. The function of CTCFL or BORIS, the testis-specific paralog of CTCF, is less clear.ResultsUsing immunohistochemistry on testis sections and fluorescence-based microscopy on intact live seminiferous tubules, we show that CTCFL is only transiently present during spermatogenesis, prior to the onset of meiosis, when the protein co-localizes in nuclei with ubiquitously expressed CTCF. CTCFL distribution overlaps completely with that of Stra8, a retinoic acid-inducible protein essential for the propagation of meiosis. We find that absence of CTCFL in mice causes sub-fertility because of a partially penetrant testicular atrophy. CTCFL deficiency affects the expression of a number of testis-specific genes, including Gal3st1 and Prss50. Combined, these data indicate that CTCFL has a unique role in spermatogenesis. Genome-wide RNA expression studies in ES cells expressing a V5- and GFP-tagged form of CTCFL show that genes that are downregulated in CTCFL-deficient testis are upregulated in ES cells. These data indicate that CTCFL is a male germ cell gene regulator. Furthermore, genome-wide DNA-binding analysis shows that CTCFL binds a consensus sequence that is very similar to that of CTCF. However, only ~3,700 out of the ~5,700 CTCFL- and ~31,000 CTCF-binding sites overlap. CTCFL binds promoters with loosely assembled nucleosomes, whereas CTCF favors consensus sites surrounded by phased nucleosomes. Finally, an ES cell-based rescue assay shows that CTCFL is functionally different from CTCF.ConclusionsOur data suggest that nucleosome composition specifies the genome-wide binding of CTCFL and CTCF. We propose that the transient expression of CTCFL in spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes serves to occupy a subset of promoters and maintain the expression of male germ cell genes.

[mhcus, synapse, elimination, nmj, activity-dependent, mechanism, neuromuscular]

MHC class I is required for activity-dependent structural remodeling at the developing neuromuscular junction
Mature patterns of connectivity in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems require the selective elimination of redundant synaptic connections through activity-dependent mechanisms. At the developing neuromuscular junction (NMJ), individual muscle cells initially receive inputs from multiple motor neurons that are eliminated during the first two postnatal weeks until each motor endplate is monoinnervated. While the requirement for electrical activity in the normal progression of synapse elimination is well established, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here we identify proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) as endogenous mediators of activity -dependent synapse elimination at the developing NMJ. MHCI protein is expressed at the NMJ during synapse elimination and genetic reduction of cell surface MHCI significantly increases the number of muscles that remain multiply innervated at the end of the remodeling period. Supernumerary inputs in MHCI-deficient animals are functional and persist into adulthood and the impairment of remodeling in MHCI-deficient animals is associated with a persistent increase in the mean amplitude of the miniature endplate potential (mEPP), suggesting that MHCI is required for the functional weakening of neuromuscular synapses. Additionally, acute blockade of MHCI function by in vivo injection of anti-MHCI antibodies is sufficient to impair developmental synapse elimination in wild type mice. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of activity-dependent synapse elimination at the developing NMJ, and suggest that MHCI is part of a core mechanism of activity-dependent synapse remodeling that is conserved in the peripheral and central nervous systems

A synthesis of marine predator migrations, distribution, species overlap, and use of Pacific Ocean Exclusive Economic Zones
Many marine predator populations are commercially important and are threatened by human activities. As a result, many of these populations are heavily depleted, declining, or are recovering from past depletion.  Recovery and management of threatened and exploited marine predators are complicated by life histories that 1) span international waters, 2) are dynamic in space and time, and 3) are hidden from direct observation.  My goal with this dissertation was to attain a synthetic understanding of the implications of marine predator migratory life histories on the spatio-temporal dynamics of distribution, species overlap, and residency in Exclusive Economic Zones of countries. I analyzed an electronic tracking dataset provided by the Tagging of Pacific Predators program that contained location data for pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks, tuna, turtles, and whales.  This dataset included 257,133 daily locations recorded from 1,679 individuals representing 18 species of pelagic predators electronically tracked in the Pacific Ocean during an eight-year period.  Many marine predators are broadly recognized as exceptional migrants but there has been little integration of traditional migratory theory with the study of their movements.  In chapter one, I examined whether theoretical nonlinear models of migration developed for ungulates and based upon a fundamental statistic of random walk theory (net squared displacement) provide a useful framework for quantifying and predicting marine predator migratory behavior.  I found that migration models fit species as ecologically dissimilar as moose and Pacific bluefin tuna suggesting that a unified approach to quantifying migration across taxa and biomes may be possible. The potential utility of marine protected areas (MPAs) for pelagic conservation is debated, especially for wide-ranging species with large, dynamic area requirements.  In chapter two I used kernel density analysis to determine the spatial and temporal extents of the distributions and core habitats of marine predators and quantified patterns of species overlap that could help guide management strategies.  I found that spatial management measures may not need to be prohibitively large to include major core habitats of wide-ranging species---at least in reference to the size distribution of large extant MPAs.  However, to account for seasonal variability in distribution, spatial measures may need to be dynamic, numerous, and/or embedded within strategic multi-scale zoning strategies.  Seals, sharks, tuna, and turtles had high probabilities of overlap with black-footed albatross and sooty shearwaters.  Spatial conservation efforts targeted at seabirds could help focus ecosystem management in this vast pelagic realm.       Integrated international efforts are required to effectively manage threatened and exploited populations of wide-ranging species.  In chapter three I used generalized additive mixed-effects models to investigate non-linear daily trends in the probability of occurrence in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and in the high seas, and to account for the effects of tagging location, tagging date, track duration, and autocorrelated time-series data.  Ninety-four percent of Pacific Ocean EEZs were visited.  Land-breeding populations were estimated to spend 14-33% of their annual cycles within the waters of their breeding EEZs, and 53 to 76% of the year in the high seas. In contrast, most fish and shark populations were estimated to spend less than a quarter of their annual cycle in international waters.  My results describe the suite of countries with shared management responsibility throughout the year for each species, and detail when this responsibility commences and concludes.

Development of Co-Ni-Ga Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys (FSMAs) by Investigating the Effects of Solidification Processing Parameters
Among Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloys (FSMAs), Co-Ni-Ga ternary alloys have attracted great attention due to their high Curie and martensitic transformation temperatures as well as improved ductility. Single &#946; phase undergoes the martensitic transformation in this system, which is the base of ferromagnetic shape memory effect. In this investigation, Electromagnetic Levitation (EML) technique was employed to assess the effect of bulk supercooling and rapid solidification on near <italic>Heusler-type</italic> dual phase Co <sub>46</sub>Ni<sub>27</sub> Ga<sub>27</sub>and single phase Co<sub>48</sub>Ni<sub>22</sub>Ga<sub>30</sub> (at%) compositions.  The effects of &#947;+&#946; microstructure on the martensitic and austenitic transformation temperatures and magnetic properties were also investigated. The presence of &#947;phase was found to suppress the martensitic and austenitic transformations to below room temperature. Bulk supercooling and rapid solidification led to the formation of homogeneous single martensitic phase from hyperperitectic alloy, which under normal solidification form the dual &#947;+&#946; phases. Moreover, in contrast with martensite forming from Co<sub>48</sub>Ni<sub>22</sub>Ga<sub>30</sub>, the hyperperitectic martensite in supercooled Co<sub>46</sub>Ni<sub>27</sub> Ga<sub>27</sub> samples showed no grain boundaries microsegregation. The martensite also showed a high Curie temperature about 127°C and good directional magnetic properties, including different in- and out-of-plane magnetization up to saturation level, and different coercivity from around 14 Oe for in-plane direction to about 42 Oe at the 50° angle. The role of solidification variables and chemical composition in the microstructure, and phase transformation in the ternary alloys Co<sub>50</sub>Ni<sub>50-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub> (at%) with x ranging up to 50, and Co<sub>100-2y</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub> (at%) with y ranging from 15 to 35 were studied as well. For the metastable single &#946; phase of supercooled Co<sub>50</sub>Ni<sub>22.5</sub>Ga<sub>27.5</sub> alloy in Co<sub>50</sub>Ni<sub>50-x</sub>Ga<sub>x</sub>series, the martensitic transformation showed thermal stability during cyclic cooling and heating (up to 350°C) revealing its potential as a FSMA candidate. In Co<sub>100-2y</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub series, on the other hand, paramagnetic Co<sub>40</sub>Ni<sub>30</sub>Ga<sub>30<sub> alloy showed martensite to austenite transformation temperature higher than 470°C, indicating its potential as High Temperature Shape Memory Alloy (HTSMA).

Evolutionary Study of Genome Features in Cereals: a Focus on Endogenous Small RNA Generation
The prevalence of large scale genomic studies and technological advances in recent years is promising in the investigation of genome features in more details. The focus of this dissertation is to recruit publicly available genome data and to adopt common and novel computational methods to study the generation and evolution of two classes of small RNAs in cereals. Such a study is important since first small RNAs play a central role in several fundamental processes in cells like genome integrity, gene expression & response to stresses; and second there is a widening gap between the amount of raw and the processed and genomic data which needs to be addressed by computational biology strategies. By the aid of comparative genomics approach the sources of two different types of small RNAs were investigated. Our results provide a strong support that overlapping genes (OGs) could be a source of natural antisense transcripts-small interfering RNAs (nat-siRNA) in cereals while most nat-siRNA generation is not well conserved in them. In addition, our data demonstrate that OGs are common and mostly species specific in maize, rice and Brachypodium and there is no obvious correlation between their number and the total number of genes or genome size; however, genome size and architecture does affect the frequencies and types of overlapping genes. By comparative analysis of the orientation of OGs several birth and death mechanisms were proposed among which translocation and gene creation are the major ones. Moreover, we improved the annotation of microRNA (miRNAs) genes in cereals which produce another type of small RNAs that have crucial regulatory roles in development and stress responses. A novel methodology was developed to use a large number of the recently available RNAseq data to refine gene boundaries of miRNAs and a comparative analysis were performed on them. By defining these upstream regions and using the alignment of the orthologous ones, several miRNA specific regulatory elements were identified which are conserved in cereals and are good candidates for experimental verification. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates that use of publicly available data and computational approaches would increase our understanding of smallRNAs and their evolution. This can provide a foundation for the community to study their expression and function more precisely.

Moisture absorption modeling using design of experiments
The effect of temperature and humidity on equilibrium moisture content of laminates was studied by response surface design. Two glass fabric-reinforced laminated composite materials with different epoxy matrix resins, laminates A and B, were studied. Laminates A and B used are cyanate ester and polyphenylene oxide modified epoxy based laminate, respectively. The results show that the response surface profiles of moisture absorption for the two laminate materials are similar though their amounts of moisture absorption are different. The temperature-humidity interaction effect and the quadratic effect of temperature are significant for laminate A. However, only the linear effects of temperature and humidity are significant for laminate B. Predictive models relating the important factors to the equilibrium moisture content were proposed in the article. The models developed can be used to predict and assess the reliability of the laminates for moisture related failures.

[iron, vf, siderophore, bacterium, marine]

The role of siderophores in algal-bacterial interactions in the marine environment
Iron is arguably the most important micronutrient in the marine environment due to its involvement in many vital physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, oxygen transport, electron transfer and nitrogen fixation. However, the availability of iron is hampered by its poor solubility and tendency to form biologically inaccessible colloidal and oxo-polymeric species. This lack of availability is more pronounced in the oceanic environment where the solubility of iron(III) is even lower than in most terrestrial environments and where the majority of soluble iron is complexed by organic ligands that dominate its speciation. Consequently, iron has been shown to limit microorganisms in large areas of the ocean. In response to iron limitation, many marine bacteria have been shown to produce siderophores, LMW complexing agents that possess high affinity for Fe(III). Recently, the traditional view of siderophores as sole iron chelators has been challenged by the discovery of their role in the transport of other metals and their interactions with cell-to-cell communication systems in bacteria. Chapters 2 and 3 of this dissertation discuss another unique trait of siderophores: the ability to efficiently bind borate. The high concentration of boron in the ocean (0.4 mM) and the affinity of two major siderophore families, the catecholates and the citrates, to this element suggest a possible unknown biological function. Further proteomic studies are underway to examine the importance of boron to marine bacteria. Chapter 4 investigates siderophore production of a group of marine bacteria belonging to the Marinobacter genus, some of which were isolated from lab cultures of dinoflagellates and coccolithophores, in response to iron limitation. Two algal-associated subclades of Marinobacter spp. were found to produce the photoactive siderophore vibrioferrin (VF) while non-algal associated species did not. This correlation between algal association and VF production leads to what appears to be a mutualistic relationship between both organisms where the bacteria contribute iron via the photochemistry of VF and the phytoplankton release dissolved organic matter (DOM) that support the growth of the bacteria and ultimately fuel the biosynthesis of VF. The photochemistry of VF and its influence on iron speciation is further elucidated in chapter 5, where it is shown that ferric- vibrioferrin rapidly degrades in sunlight leaving behind a highly bioavailable form of iron, Fe'. Because light is central to the photochemistry of VF and consequently to any interactions between VF-producers and phytoplankton, I sought to investigate the influence of light on gene expression of iron uptake genes in M. algicola DG893. Chapter 6 reveals a selective response of iron uptake genes related to only the metabolism of VF. In addition, environmental samples collected during a research cruise in the North Atlantic in 2009 demonstrate that VF- producers are concentrated near the surface during daytime. This pattern of vertical distribution demonstrates that although these organisms are not abundant in the ocean, they are relevant to iron biogeochemistry and further work is needed to elucidate the extent of their contribution to iron speciation and to algal iron uptake

Characterization of homologous recombination proteins in telomere processing and t-circle formation
The linear ends of natural chromosomes (telomeres) should resemble internal genome scissions. For the stability of cells it is imperative that telomeres avoid eliciting a DNA damage response. Yet recent data has shown that DNA damage repair proteins involved in homologous recombination repair are localized to the telomeres during the cell cycle. In this dissertation, I have further examined the role of HR proteins at the telomeres in the model organism C. elegans, and have found that HR proteins are required for the proper processing and maintenance of telomeres. Further, by examining the extra-chromosomal t- circles in C. elegans strains with HR proteins disrupted, I have shown that HR protein disruption leads to a decrease in t-circles. These data strongly suggest that t- circles are a byproduct of t-loop formation

Development of Novel Diagnostic Tools and beyond for Targets of  Human Significance: Metabolites, Toxins & Viruses
Tools for the rapid assessment of diseased condition and underlying causative agent, disease progression and treatment outcome are prerequisites to meeting the goal of providing best health care possible.  These tools should be highly selective and sensitive, show rapid response and of low cost for their wide spread use. Utilizing the growing knowledge about the organisms/conditions causing the diseased state, identifying suitable biomarkers and by incorporating newer technologies, novel diagnostics tools with above mentioned qualities can be built. Utilizing Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) we have built biosensors for detection of Protective antigen (PA) toxin secreted by anthrax causing bacteria and ultra-sensitive detection of glucose in unconventional body fluids. These nano-biosensors display high sensitivity and selectivity for the target can be easily adapted to develop point of care devices. Through these sensors we have established a methodology for SWNT based sensor fabrication and shown different modes of operation for detection of both charged and uncharged analytes. Utilizing fluorescence based protein probe, we have developed an in vivo assay for HIV detection. This probe is sensitive to HIV protease, which is synthesized during its replication and plays an important role in formation of viable viral progeny. We are also able to assess the HIV protease activity in vivo against several wild type and mutant versions of its natural cleavage sites. These quantified kinetic parameters will help in gaining better understanding of protease-substrate and protease-inhibitor interactions. By mimicking the drug resistance causing protease and cleavage site mutations in our assay we can capture the altered kinetics and gain understanding of their contribution to resistance towards protease inhibitors. Our cell based assay is a better choice than the in vitro assays for screening newer inhibitors as it mimics the natural environment encountered by the enzyme and also provides the initial bioavailability and toxicity data for the candidate drugs.

Fish, fishing, diving and the management of coral reefs
This dissertation is a multi-disciplinary attempt to understand how coral reef resources can be sustainably managed. I begin by examining the peer-reviewed literature on artisanal reef fisheries, identifying gaps in knowledge, and proposing a set of priority areas for future research. Ecological examinations of trap fishing and gill nets follow. Fish trap bycatch can be dramatically reduced by the inclusion of escape gaps that allow juveniles and narrow-bodied species to escape, although catch of ecologically important herbivores remains high. Gill nets capture the few remaining apex predators present on Caribbean coral reefs, and as such are unsustainable. The second half of the dissertation is a tripartite presentation of the results of interviews with 177 fishers and 211 professional SCUBA divers on Curaçao and Bonaire. First, I consider whether interviewees' baseline conception of a healthy reef ecosystem is actually a degraded state, and they have a "shifting baseline." Then, I evaluate interviewees' discount rates and present bias, and relate those measures to their preferred management approaches. Lastly, I contemplate how to reconcile ecosystem requirements with stakeholder preferences, and use socioeconomic information to develop a sustainable management plan

Observations of Starburst Galaxies: Science and Supporting Technology
In chapter 1 we report on the development of wavefront reconstruction and control algorithms for multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) and the results of testing them in the laboratory under conditions that simulate an 8 meter class telescope. The UCO/Lick Observatory Laboratory for Adaptive Optics Multi-Conjugate testbed allows us to test wide field of view adaptive optics systems as they might be instantiated in the near future on giant telescopes. In particular, we have been investigating the performance of MCAO using five laser beacons for wavefront sensing and a minimum variance algorithm for control of two conjugate deformable mirrors. We have demonstrated improved Strehl ratio and enlarged field of view performance when compared to conventional AO techniques. We have demonstrated improved MCAO performance with the implementation of a routine that minimizes the generalized isoplanatism when turbulent layers do not correspond to deformable mirror conjugate altitudes. Finally, we have demonstrated suitability of the system for closed-loop operation when configured to feed back conditional mean estimates of wavefront residuals rather than the directly measured residuals. This technique has recently been referred to as the ``pseudo-open-loop'' control law in the literature.  Chapter 2 introduces the Multi-wavelength Extreme Starburst Sample (MESS), a new catalog of 138 star-forming galaxies (0.1 < z < 0.3) optically selected from the SDSS using emission line strength diagnostics to have SFR greater than 50 solar mass per year based on a Kroupa IMF.  The MESS was designed to complement samples of nearby star forming galaxies such as the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), and ultraviolet luminous galaxies (UVLGs).  Observations using the multiband imaging photometer (MIPS; 24, 70, and 160 micron channels) on the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate the MESS galaxies have IR luminosities similar to those of LIRGs, with an estimated median L_TIR of 3 times 10^11 solar luminosities.  The selection criteria for the MESS suggests they may be less obscured than typical far-IR selected galaxies with similar estimated SFRs. We estimate the SFRs based directly on luminosities to determine the agreement for these methods in the MESS.

Biophysical characterization of p53 regulatory domain and MDM2
p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a central role in responding to DNA damage by activating DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. In resting cells, MDM2 negatively regulates p53 by both blocking p53- coactivator interactions, as well as promoting p53 ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. In stressed cells, p53 transcriptional activity is positively regulated by its own C-terminal regulatory domain through non-specific DNA interactions that enhance specific DNA binding through the DNA binding domain. Mutations in p53 DNA binding domain and upregulation of MDM2 are involved in 50% of cancer cases. Understanding p53 and MDM2 at molecular level is crucial to design pharmacological targets to fight cancerous cells. However, structures of full-length of p53 and MDM2 have not yet been determined. The first goal of this thesis is to understand the DNA binding properties and crystal structure of the two most C -terminal domains of p53 (p53CTD) that include the tetramerization and regulatory domains. Our analytical centrifugation results indicated that p53 CTD binds to specific and non-specific DNA and that it changes from tetrameric state to dimeric state upon DNA binding. Our second goal is to understand the oligomerization state of MDM2 using AUC and transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicated that recombinant full-length MDM2 self- assembles to forms spherical particles of different sizes formed by different oligomerization

Parametrically-aided sensing in the short-wave infrared frequency band and beyond
In this dissertation, wideband frequency-mixing parametric processes in nonlinear light guides are engineered to enable implementation of mature near-infrared wavelength band technology in the spectrally significant short-wave infrared band. An ultracompact, powerful, widely-tunable, all-fiber laser transmitter is demonstrated in silica- based mixer and used for spectral fingerprinting of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, highly-sensitive optically- preamplified receiver is demonstrated, providing high-gain and low-noise figure operation in arbitrary spectral windows of the short-wave infrared band. Lastly, candidate non-silica platforms for extending the mixer operation to the mid-infrared spectral regions are rigorously analyzed

Structural and functional analysis of the chemokine CCL27 and the expression and purification of silent chemokine receptors D6 and DARC
Chemokines are small chemoattractant proteins that function by binding to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on a wide variety of cell types, triggering cascades of intracellular signaling pathways. While they are best known for their role in leukocyte migration, both in standard immune surveillance and maintenance, as well as in response to inflammation, chemokines are involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. In addition to their complex function, the chemokine network itself is highly complex, with some chemokines being specific to one receptor, while others activate multiple receptors expressed on different cell types and in some cases, resulting in very different cellular responses. This project in part involves the chemokine CCL27, which is expressed in skin and selectively chemoattracts CLA⁺ memory T cells expressing the chemokine receptor, CCR10. The first set of aims for this project involved a comprehensive analysis of the structural and functional mechanism contributing to the biological diversity of CCL27. This was accomplished through a biophysical characterization of the oligomerization properties, residues targeting receptor activation, as well as sites of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions for this chemokine. The results suggest that CCL27 exists in multiple oligomeric states, and its unique oligomerization patterns appear to play a role in the diversity of its multiple binding partners. The second major project aim involves optimization of the expression and purification of the silent chemokine receptors D6 and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC). D6 and DARC are termed silent receptors because they bind many chemokines with high affinity and specificity, but unlike other chemokine receptors, they do not signal through G-proteins. Instead, they act as regulators, either by targeting their chemokine ligands for degradation, or by shuttling them from one location to another. One of the rate-limiting steps in the biophysical characterization of 7- transmembrane helical chemokine receptors is obtaining sufficient amounts of purified, functional protein. In this project, a tetracycline-indicuble mammalian cell expression system is applied to both D6 and DARC. Results from the initial test expressions and purifications indicate that this method was successful in generating solubilized receptor protein

Mechanical Property Measurements of Membranes and Viruses by Using Fluorescence Interference Contrast Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy
The elasticities of freestanding curved lipid bilayer arrays formed on micron-diameter wells fabricated on a Si wafer were studied by measuring the height profile using fluorescence interference contrast microscopy. Dark and bright rings resulted from the interference of lipid fluorophore excitation and emission between the direct light and that reflected from the bottom surface of the well. By changing the osmotic pressure difference across the bilayers, the relationship between the pressure and membrane curvature was measured. Using Helfrich theory, the effective surface tension of the bilayer was extracted. Saturated and unsaturated lipids and the influence of cholesterol and ergosterol were investigated. The results show ergosterol decreases the effective surface tension, whereas cholesterol makes the membrane more rigid. The demonstrated technique should find wide application in studying the modification of the elasticities of membranes due to changes in lipid composition or interaction with non-membrane components. The elasticity of membranes was also studied by indenting immobilized intact giant vesicles on glass using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in a fluid environment. Here the buckling force on the vesicles under different force loading rates was used to calculate the Young's modulus E of the lipid membranes. We also imaged brome mosaic virus (BMV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) in a fluid environment by using AFM. Then effective spring constants were measured for both viruses from force indentation experiments. BMV showed a linear response regime for indentation up to 32 % of the diameter.  SINV while initially had a nonlinear response which turned into linear for larger forces. Then E for both viruses was calculated by using thin shell model. BMV has an E of 202 MPa which is much closer to that of CCMV where it was 110 MPa for SINV. Finally, the interaction between melittin membranes composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids using the AFM and fluorescence microscopy was studied. We observed that melittin only interacted with unsaturated lipid membrane. It damaged it and transformed the unsaturated lipid membrane into a new thinner bilayer. The role of cholesterol was also studied and found to have a strong role in the interaction.

Peptides, Diamines, and Nucleobases: Investigations in Ion Chemistry
Peptides, Diamines, and Nucleobases: Investigations in Ion ChemistryAaron MoehligDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, June 2011Dr. Thomas H. Morton, ChairpersonGas-phase ion chemistry offers a variety of experimental tools that can assist in determining the structure and properties of molecules that are difficult to purify and isolate or available in only small concentrations. This thesis highlights three areas where ion chemistry has been successfully used to give new insight into the structures and properties of various peptides, diamines, and nucleobases. PeptidesPeptide biosynthesis incorporates only L-isomers of the chiral amino acids, however, D-isomers can result from post-translational modifications performed by epimerase enzymes or through spontaneous racemization.  Sequential mass spectrometry can be used to measure quantitative differences in the fragmentation patterns of peptides containing a single D-amino acid. This thesis describes the differences in the collsionally activated dissociation (CAD) patterns of the diastereomers of the tripeptide Gly-Ser-Lys (GSK) and the tetrapeptide Gly-Leu-Ser-Lys (GLSK). The latter is among the tryptic fragments expected from the digest of alpha-synuclein, a protein found in Lewy bodies implicated in Parkinsonism and other neurological disorders. The differences between the CAD fragmentation patterns is used to develop a method to quantitate the amount of the GLdSK diastereomer in a mixture of GLSK.   Diamines	Vibrational spectra of the conjugate acid of the linear diamine N,N,N',N'-tetramethylputrescine  has been recorded in the gas-phase with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) and solid-phase by inelastic neutron scattering (INS). A band near 550 cm-1 is observed in both spectra and is assigned as the asymmetric stretch of a proton between two nitrogens based on deuterium substitution. The position of this band agrees with the value predicted from a 2-dimensional potential energy surface. The reduced dimensionality of the potential energy surface, which treats the ion as though it has a linear geometry, predicts the zero-point energy level to be slightly above the calculated barrier to proton transit suggesting that this is a low-barrier hydrogen bond and the proton is equally shared between the two nitrogens. The cyclic diamine N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-cis-1,5-diaminocyclooctane was synthesized and its 1-dimensional potential energy surface predicted the zero-point energy to be below the calculated barrier to proton transit suggesting that it is not a low-barrier hydrogen bond. The IRMPD and INS spectra will be recorded to determine if the value of the N-H-N asymmetric stretch matches with theory.Nucleobases	The vibrational spectrum of proton-bound dimers consisting of 1-methylcytosine, 1,5-dimethylcytosine, and 5-fluoro-1-methylcytosine has been recorded and the structure of the dimers as well as the location of the band corresponding to the N-H-N asymmetric stretch were determined based upon comparisons with theoretical spectra and isotopic substitution. The proton between the two nucleobases prefers to be situated on one side of the dimer and is not equally shared between the two nitrogens based upon the presence of two IR bands in the spectrum of the proton-bound dimer formed between 1-methylcytosine and 1,5-dimethylcytosine that correspond to the N-H-N asymmetric stretches of the two tautomers of the dimer.

Characterization of Binding Interactions Between Heparin, and Peptides and Peptidomimetics
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONCharacterization of Binding Interactions Between Heparin, and Peptides and PeptidomimeticsByMark HamzaDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, June 2010Dr. Dallas L. Rabenstein, Chairperson	The aim of this work is to determine the feasibility of peptides and/or peptidomimetics, such as peptoids and peptide/peptoid hybrids, as suitable replacements for Protamine, a drug used to inactivate heparin's anticoagulant activity. Heparin is administered to prevent blood coagulation during certain medical procedures, such as cardiopulmonary bypass. Heparin prevents coagulation by forming a complex with antithrombin, a serine protease inhibitor, thereby accelerating antithrombin's activity. Protamine is then used to restore the coagulation cascade by displacing heparin from antithrombin forming a heparin-Protamine complex. As Protamine has exhibited detrimental side-effects during its administration, this work has endeavored to design a safer alternative.	Several methods have been implemented to characterize the binding interaction between heparin, and the peptides and peptidomimetics developed in this work: (i) isothermal titration calorimetry was utilized to acquire a quantitative binding constant which demonstrated that some of the peptides and peptidomimetics exhibit a high heparin-binding affinity which is critical to displace heparin from antithrombin; (ii) heparin affinity chromatography was used to determine a relative heparin-binding affinity between peptides and peptidomimetics for which a quantitative binding constant could not be measured due to weak heparin-binding interactions; (iii) secondary structure of peptides and peptidomimetics was ascertained by circular dichroism. The compounds synthesized in this work were observed to conform to either a polyproline I-type or polyproline II-type helical secondary structure. Establishing secondary structure is a vital factor in the rational design of heparin-binding peptides and peptidomimetics.	The results of this work show that peptides and peptidomimetics can be rationally designed so as to bind heparin with high affinity. This is an important step in demonstrating that the peptides and peptidomimetics designed in this work have the potential to replace Protamine as an antagonist to heparin.

Home Environment Consequences of Commute Travel Impedance
The physical and perceptual dimensions of commuting travel impedance were again found to have stressful consequences in a study of 99 employees of two companies. This quasi-experimental replication study, which focuses here on home environment consequences, investigated the effects of physical impedance and subjective impedance on multivariate measures of residential satisfaction and personal affect in the home. Both sets of residential outcome measures were found to be significantly related to the two impedance dimensions. As predicted, gender was a significant moderator of physical impedance effects. Females commuting on high physical impedance routes were most negatively affected. Previously found subjective impedance effects on negative home mood, regardless of gender, were strongly replicated with several methods and were buttressed by convergent results with objective indices. The theoretical conjecture that subjective impedance mediates the stress effects of physical impedance was supported for the personal affect cluster but only for one variable in the residential satisfaction cluster. Traffic congestion has increased in metropolitan areas nationwide, and commuters, families, and organizations are absorbing associated hidden costs. The results are reviewed in terms of our ecological model, and the moderating effects of gender are discussed in terms of choice and role constraints.

Estimating Undrained Strength of Clays from Direct Shear Testing at Fast Displacement Rates
When the direct shear test is performed in accordance with ASTM guidelines, the measured shear stresses at failure estimate drained strength parameters.  We investigate the possibility of estimating undrained strength using direct shear testing at variable shear displacement rates on specimens composed of various combinations of kaolinite and bentonite. Even at fast displacement rates, constant volume conditions are not achieved in the direct shear device because of changes in specimen height that are large relative to allowable ASTM thresholds for constant volume simple shear testing. However, undrained strengths established by constant volume simple shear testing at slow strain rates are well approximated by direct shear tests conducted at fast shear displacement rates (time to failure < t50/8, where t50=time to 50% consolidation in a conventional oedometer test). Because of the simplicity of direct shear testing, such estimates of undrained strength may be useful in engineering practice when access to a simple shear device is limited. Nevertheless, fast direct shear tests have shortcomings, including lack of control of rate effects, and constant volume testing is recommended for critical projects.

PART I:  SPECTRAL GEOMETRY OF THE HARMONIC GASKET  PART II:  NONLINEAR POISSON EQUATION VIA A NEWTON-EMBEDDING PROCEDURE
This dissertation consists of two separate parts.  The first part, Chapters 1--4, concerns the construction of a Dirac operator and spectral triple on the harmonic Sierpinski gasket in order to recover aspects of Jun Kigami's measurable Riemannian geometry via methods of spectral or noncommutative geometry.  In particular, we recover Kigami's geodesic distance function on the gasket.  Chapters 2 and 3 cover prerequisite mathematics for understanding and potentially building upon the results in Chapter 4.  One of the main theorems in Chapter 4 is an example of a fractal analog to Connes' theorem on a compact Riemannian manifold.   Chapter 4 also contains a more general theorem which pertains to a class of sets built on curves. \\  The Dirac operator on a compact spin Riemannian manifold, in conjunction with the $C^{*}$-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on the manifold represented as multiplication operators on the Hilbert space of $L^{2}$-spinors forms what is called a spectral triple.  Connes' theorem states, in particular, that the triple contains enough information to recover the geodesic distance function on the manifold.  Connes' theory on the Riemmanian manifold serves as a model for defining `natural' geometries on spaces via suitable analogs of Dirac operators and spectral triples.\\Michel Lapidus, in collaboration with Christina Ivan and Eric Christensen, has done work using Dirac operators and spectral triples to construct geometries of some fractal sets built on curves.  These sets include graphs, infinite trees, and the Sierpinski gasket in Euclidean metric (i.e. the gasket as it is usually constructed, from equilateral triangles).  They were able to recover the geodesic distance,  Hausdorff dimension, and the standard self-similar measure on the gasket from a Dirac operator and spectral triple on the gasket.\\Jun Kigami has constructed a prototype for a measurable Riemannian geometry using the Sierpinski gasket in harmonic metric.  The Sierpinski gasket in harmonic metric, also referred to as the harmonic gasket,can be constructed using the harmonic functions on the Sierpinski gasket as a single coordinate chart.  Kigami has related measurable analogs of Riemannian energy, gradient, metric, volume, and geodesic distance in formulas which are analogous to their counterparts in Riemannian geometry.\\In Chapter 4, we construct several Dirac operators and their associated spectral triples for the harmonic gasket.  There are three different constructions, all of which recover Kigami's geodesic distance on the harmonic gasket.  The spectrum of each Dirac operator is also described in terms of the lengths of the edges or cells of the harmonic gasket, depending on the construction.  One of these constructions can be generalized to a certain class of sets built on curves in $R^{n}$.  Chapter 4 closes with a description of work in progress and future directions.\\The second part, Chapter 5, is an adaptation of an article I have written, textsc{nonlinear poisson equation via a newton-embedding procedure} (15 pages, 2010), which has been accepted for publication in the journal textsl{Complex Variables and Elliptic Equations}.  Chapter 5 is a version of the article, augmented to include some background on second order elliptic equations and the Newton-embedding procedure.\

Structure and Dynamics of Biological Macromolecules using NMR Spectroscopy
Nuclear magnetic resonance is a robust tool in a broad range of scientific area from biochemistry, material science to MRI in medical application.  In this thesis, two distinct works are presented in both solid sate and liquid state NMR.  Firstly, benefiting from the fast MAS and cleverly designed devices, both resolution and sensitivity of solid state NMR spectra have been improved many folds, so that it is available to study complex biological solids, such as proteins.  However there is always a need to increase resolution in order to work on more complicate systems.  Here, we introduce a series of highly resolved scalar-based three-dimensional homonuclear correlation experiments for 13C sidechain correlation in solid-state proteins.  These experiments are based on a sensitive constant-time format, in which homonuclear scalar couplings are utilized for polarization transfer, but decoupled during chemical shift evolution, to yield high resolution in indirect dimensions and band selectivity as desired.  Together with the experiments designed to obtain backbone correlations, we could fully assign the backbone and aliphatic sidechain chemical shifts with the 3D spectra that are collected on 9.4T magnet (1H frequency 400MHz) for model protein GB1.  We also discuss the method of chemical shift based structural refinement.	Another practice of NMR in my work is using 31P Dynamic NMR to characterize the backbone conformation and dynamics in DNA Dickerson Dodecamer.  The results confirm solid-state 2H-NMR experiments showing that the C3pG4 and C9pG10 steps experience unique dynamics.  And cytosine methylation has significant impact on the local dynamics.  The results also show that 31P Dynamic NMR is an efficient way to extract DNA backbone dynamic information, and provide detail knowledge to study DNA-protein interactions.

FtsZ dynamics and the regulation of division site selection by the MinCD division inhibitor in Bacillus subtilis
Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli regulate division site selection through two overlapping systems that together restrict FtsZ-ring assembly to midcell. The first system is nucleoid occlusion, which is mediated by the nonspecific DNA binding protein Noc and SlmA in B. subtilis and E. coli respectively. Nucleoid occlusion prevents assembly of the Z-ring across the nucleoid. The second system prevents division at the cell poles and is mediated by MinC and MinD (MinCD). In the absence of MinCD, division occurs at the cell poles, resulting in anucleate minicells in both E. coli and B. subtilis. The cellular localization of MinCD in E. coli and B. subtilis is differentially regulated by the unrelated proteins MinE and DivIVA respectively. B. subtilis DivIVA sequesters MinCD to the cell poles, where it interacts with FtsZ to prevent Z-ring assembly. E. coli MinE promotes the pole-to -pole oscillation of MinCD that results in a time averaged concentration of MinCD that is highest at the cell poles. The drastic difference between the localization of MinCD in E. coli and B. subtilis led me to reinvestigate the localization of B. subtilis MinCD using new methods. I constructed a transposon that I call TAGIT (Tn5 Assisted Gene Insertion Technology) to transcriptionally fuse gfp to minCD. TAGIT randomly inserts gfp into a target gene and allows for the rapid identification of in-frame insertions. I utilized TAGIT to construct a library of gfp -minCD insertions, from which I isolated a fully functional MinC-GFP that was subsequently integrated at the native chromosomal locus in B. subtilis in order to maintain wild type regulation of minCD. I then carried out time-lapse epifluorescence microscopy, TIRFM (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy), and SI (Structured Illumination) microscopy of MinC-GFP and FtsZ- GFP to study their cellular localization in growing cells. I propose a new model of MinC function; MinC prevents FtsZ structures that assemble immediately after cytokinesis at the new cell pole from supporting cell division. The highest concentration of MinC is found at midcell during the last stages of cytokinesis. MinC is then released from the division site thereby placing it in the same region of the cell at the same time that aberrant FtsZ structures assemble. There it disrupts the lateral interactions between FtsZ protofilaments, which promotes FtsZ to relocalize to the midcell, thus ensuring proper placement of the division site

Surface Deformation Associated With a Historical Diking Event in Afar From Correlation of Space and Air-Borne Optical Images
We present new measurements of the surface deformation associated with the riftingevent of 1978 in the Asal-Ghoubbet Rift, Republic of Djibouti using an optical imagecorrelation technique. Deformation in the rift associated with the event included thereactivation of the main bordering faults and the development of numerous open fissureson the rift floor. We combine these new measurements with ground-based observationsfrom previous work to constrain a kinematic model of the rift consisting of two borderingfaults reaching a depth of 3 km and a vertical dike below this depth. Our modelingindicates that the horizontal extension collectively accommodated by the faults andfissures amounts to 2.4-2.8 m, significantly higher than the amount of ~1.2 m estimatedby trilateration alone over a ~10 km baseline. The model suggests that during the 1978event, magmatic fluids were transferred from a mid-crustal reservoir to the shallowstructures, injecting dykes and filling faults and fissures, reaching the surface in theArdokoba fissural eruption.

In vitro Study of Herves Transposable Element of Anopheles gambiae and Use of RNA Interference (RNAi) in Culex quinquefasciatus
Transposable elements (TEs) and RNA interference (RNAi) are excellent genetic tools that could help control the incidence and spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, etc. This study aimed to 1) understand the RNAi mechanism in Culex quinquefasciatus, which will be used to study genes involved in pathogen transmission and will help reveal role of RNAi in antiviral immunity in this species; and 2) characterize the DNA sequences that regulate Herves transposase binding, which will help us understand its pre- and post-integration behavior within the host. By using the white eye-pigmentation gene as a marker for RNAi function we demonstrated that introducing dsRNA into embryos of Cx. quinquefasciatus induces a specific functional RNAi response, which silenced the white gene, consequently allowing a white-eye phenotype to be produced in the hatched larvae and adults. Sequence-specific knockdown of key RNAi components was achieved by introducing the homologous dsRNA into embryos of Cx. quinquefasciatus. We found ago2-mediated slicing to be more critical than dcr2-mediated dicing for the functional RNAi response in Cx. quinquefasciatus. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the previously reported results that RNAi components for small RNA biogenesis are present in Cx. quinquefasciatus. In addition, we found important differences in the number and the expression of ago genes, the predicted domain architecture of Dcr, and the RNAi response between Cx. quinquefasciatus and the model organism D. melanogaster. Transposition of Class II TEs is regulated by both cis-acting sequences and trans-acting host factors. In this study, we used purified Herves transposase to characterize the specific DNA-binding sites of the Herves transposase. The purified active Herves transposase showed site-specific binding to the subterminal and terminal sequences of the L- and R- ends of the element, respectively. Furthermore, the transposase bound strongly with the R-TIR but failed to bind to the L-TIR. We identified an 8bp sequence repeat as the transposase binding motif that is conserved on both the L- and R-end sequences and is critical and sufficient for Herves transposase binding.

The Amundsen Sea Polynya International Research Expedition (ASPIRE) (Dec 2010 - Jan 2011) investigated high latitude (71-75S, 110-120W) ocean dynamics to better understand the polynya's high biological production.  Hydrographic and dFe data from Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) measurements highlight a melt-laden outflow emanating from the Dotson Ice Shelf (DIS) and flowing between 400-600 m throughout the Dotson trough.  Observations in the polynya near icebergs show water mass mixing of meltwater and Circumpolar Deep Water and elevated concentrations of dFe, indicating that drifting icebergs could deliver iron into the mixed layer either from in situ melt or by mixing up melt-laden outflow waters from the DIS.  Time series data at the DIS outflow indicate warming since 2007.  Although nearby Pine Island Glacier (PIG) outflow is overall warmer and saltier than DIS outflow, calculated meltwater fractions show similar relative quantities of meltwater from both PIG and DIS.

Surface Reactivity of Copper Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) on Metal Surfaces
Acetamidinate precursors have shown great promise for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications, but potentially deposit impurities that may degrade the quality of the films and hinder their practical applications. To help solve this problem, the uptake, the surface chemistry, and the effect of hydrogen coadsorption of copper(I)( <italic>N,N'</italic>-di-<italic>sec</italic>-butylacetamidinate) and <italic>N,N'</italic>-di-<italic>sec</italic>-butylacetamidine on different metals were characterized under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions by using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The main objective of this research project has been to develop a better molecular-level understanding of the chemical reactions associated with ALD of copper metal films, to design and optimize the film deposition processes to be used in the microelectronics industry. In our initial studies on a Ni (110) single crystal, a temperature window between approximately 350 and 450 K was identified for the ALD of Cu using the Cu acetamidinate precursor: lower temperatures are insufficient for activation of the dissociative adsorption, and higher temperatures lead to continuous decomposition beyond Cu monolayer saturation. Approximately three dosing cycles are required to reach full Cu monolayer saturation, the equivalent of a film growth rate of ~0.75 Å/cycle in ALD. Preadsorption of hydrogen on the surface does not modify any of this behavior because of its rapid desorption at temperatures below 350 K once the gas-phase <sub>H2</sub>is removed. The surface chemistry of the Cu precursor is complex, leading to the desorption of not only hydrogen but also 2-butene and small amdine (<italic>N-sec</italic>-butylacetamidine, <super>s</super>But-NH-C(CH<sub>3</sub>)=NH); it seems that the amidine ligands decompose via beta-hydride elimination from one of their terminal <italic>sec</italic>-butyl moieties. The ligands of the copper acetamidinate precursors further decompose on Ni (110) surfaces at higher temperature, leading to the desorption of more hydrogen and leaving some carbon and nitrogen on the surface. The free hydrogenated amidine ligand is less reactive, and no <italic>N-sec</italic>-butylacetamidine is produced by its thermal activation, but the remaining chemistry follows similar temperature transitions. Similar results were also observed on a Cu (110) surface.Other copper precursors, Cu-KI5 (copper (I) (N(1(dimethylvinylsiloxy)-1- methylethano)-2-imino-4-pentanoate)) and Cu(acac) <sub>2</sub> (copper(II) acetylacetonate) in particular, were tested as well. Details of the results from this work are discussed.

The Influence of Metal Ions on the Tertiary Structure of the Prion Protein and Inherited Prion Disease
The prion protein (PrP) is the causative agent for a class of fatal neurodegenerative diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).  This highly conserved mammalian protein consists of two domains - a flexible N-terminus, which is implicated in PrP's biological function; and a structured C-terminus that misfolds to create the infectious agent.  Decades of research have determined that PrP binds copper and zinc and therefore contributes to metal ion homeostasis.  The role of these metal ions in TSE progression, however, is still unclear.  To clarify whether Cu2+ has a direct influence on the misfolding of PrP's structured domain, we assess the affinity of the C-terminal histidines for copper.  Our results show that this metal ion does not bind to PrP's C-terminus with a physiologically relevant affinity.  This work also challenges the notion that PrP's two domains are physically independent.  We identify here a novel Zn2+-driven inter-domain interaction in PrP.   The docking site of the Zn2+-bound N-terminus is localized to a region of the C-terminus that contains the majority of the inherited mutations that give rise to familial prion disease.  We therefore investigated the affect of these mutations, as well as a mutation protective against prion disease, on the inter-domain interaction.  We find that the pathogenic mutations exhibit a weakened inter-domain interaction, whereas the protective mutant has a strengthen interaction as compared to wild type PrP.  These results provide the first evidence of a change in the tertiary structure of PrP that correlates with the familial prion disease mutations.  Furthermore, these results provide new structural insight into PrP's biological processing and function.

Early Learning Capability in Rodents: A Review (Rattus Norvegicus and Mus Musculus)
Available data on learning capabilities in immature rodents are briefly summarized and some new findings on early learning in mice are presented. We omit the comparatively small number of works concerning precocial species of rodents, that is, guinea pigs and spiny mice. In a comparison we have already made (D'Udine and Alleva, 1983) we found that rodent species characterized as precocial types appeared to be affected in a dramatic way by environmental factors during postnatal development, as shown by profound modification of their adult behavioral patterns. Since the aim of our contribution is to review the methodological paradigms used to assess early learning capabilities in rodents, we shall focus here on the Norway rat and the house mouse, because they are the only species for which evidence has progressively been built up through the use of different tests.

Toward understanding the genetic basis of adaptation to high-elevation life in poikilothermic species: A comparative transcriptomic analysis of two ranid frogs, Rana chensinensis and R. kukunoris
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Understanding how organisms adapt to high-elevation environments at a genome scale provides novel insights into the process of adaptive evolution. Previous studies have mainly focused on endothermic organisms, while poikilothermic species may have evolved different mechanisms to cope with high-elevation environments. In this context, we sequenced transcriptomes of a pair of closely related anuran species, Rana chensinensis and R. kukunoris, which inhabit respective low- and high-elevation habitats. By comparing the two transcriptomes, we identified candidate genes that may be involved in high-elevation adaption in poikilothermic species.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Over 66 million sequence reads from each transcriptome were generated. A total of 41,858 and 39,293 transcripts for each species were obtained by de novo assembly. By comparing the orthologous transcripts, we identified 125 protein-coding genes that have likely experienced strong positive selection (Ka/Ks&gt;1). In addition, 335 genes that may bear a signature of positive selection (1&#8805;Ka/Ks&gt;0.5) were also recognized. By considering their functions, fourteen candidate genes were determined to be likely involved in high-elevation adaptation, including two CYP genes, USP-1, and several others.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					We identified a set of candidate genes that may have promoted adaptation of R. kukunoris to its high-elevation environment. These include several genes that have previously been associated with oxygen binding, response to UV radiation, and repair of free radical injury. Detailed molecular, physiological, and phenotypic studies are required to better understand the roles of these genes in improving the performance of R. kukunoris in a high-elevation environment. We have evidence for both convergent and divergent evolution between endothermic and poikilothemic species, but additional research across a wide range of organisms will be necessary to comprehend the complexity of high-elevation adaptation.

Identification and Characterization of Klf4 Functional Domains in Somatic Cell Reprogramming
Somatic cell reprogramming refers to the conversion of a differentiated cell with restricted developmental potential to a pluripotent cell through the collective action of defined factors.  This method of resetting the epigenome to an embryonic-like state has tremendous medical implications since these cells can subsequently be converted into any cell type of the body for use in regenerative therapies.  The reprogramming process is most often initiated by the expression of three transcription factors - Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 - in a target cell.  This work aims to better understand the mechanism of reprogramming by mapping functional domains in the Klf4 protein that are required for the induction of pluripotency.  Within these important regions of Klf4, we characterize specific contact sites with DNA and cofactor proteins that determine its reprogramming activity.  Finally, to further understand the properties within the DNA binding domain of Klf4 that enable its reprogramming activity, we determine the in vitro binding preferences of DNA binding domains within the Klf family and demonstrate the molecular basis of their functional divergence in somatic cell reprogramming.

[stimulus, cell, adaptation, background, ganglion, isus, output]

Temporal and Spatial Dependence of Adaptation on Ganglion Cells
One of the visual system’s many tasks is to be able to distinguish objects from the background. The ability to do this is limited and affected by the relationship between the object (or stimulus) of interest and the background. Adaptation in retinal neurons is the process of changing the cell’s response to a stimulus according to that stimulus’s background. When the stimulus is hard to discern from the background, the retina adapts by improving its sensitivity to low contrast. The large response range maintained by adaptation comes at a cost, however. Adaptation complicates neural coding by making the brain interpret identical stimuli as different based on differences in background. In order to further our understanding of adaptation, this study modified the background to be in terms of time and space rather than light intensity as is the norm. By changing the interval between two circular stimuli (inter-stimuli interval; IsI) of the same diameter, and by changing the diameter over a common IsI, we measured a ganglion cell’s output for one stimulus relative to another stimulus. the results show saturation (loss of output to the 2nd stimulus) of stimuli at lower IsIs. Also, the degree of saturation for a given IsI depends on the diameter of the stimulus. These combinations of results illustrate the temporal and spatial dependence of adaptation on ganglion cells. A larger-diameter stimulus involves multiple neurons surrounding the ganglion cell being recorded so various pathways most likely influence that cell’s ultimate output. Rapid stimuli (low IsI) can be defined as having large mean luminosity that directly affects ganglion cell output.

Implications of the impact of prevalence on test thresholds and outcomes: lessons from tuberculosis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					With today&#8217;s rapid advances in technology and understanding of disease, more screening and diagnostic tests have become available in a variety of sociodemographic and clinical settings. This analysis quantifies the impact of varying prevalence rates on test performance for given sensitivity and specificity values.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Using a worked example of latent tuberculosis infection, we compared true-positive (TP) and false-positive (FP) results when varying prevalence and test sensitivity and specificity. We used estimates from published literature to estimate two tests&#8217; sensitivity (81%, QuantiFERON&#174;-TB Gold In-Tube; 88%, T-SPOT&#174;.TB) and specificity (99%; 88%), and we used World Health Organization data to estimate disease prevalence in five countries.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Varying sensitivity impacted outcomes most in high-prevalence settings; change in specificity had greater impact in low-prevalence settings. In switching from QuantiFERON-TB to T-SPOT.TB (higher sensitivity, lower specificity), trade-offs between increasing case identification (TPs) and decreasing unnecessary treatments (FPs) varied dramatically with prevalence. Lower-prevalence settings paid a greater &#8220;price&#8221; of more FPs for each TP gained, with 37.7 FPs per TP in the United States (5% prevalence) versus 2.5 in the Ivory Coast (55% prevalence).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Prevalence affects test performance for given sensitivity and specificity values. To optimize test performance, disease prevalence should be incorporated in testing decisions, and sensitivity and specificity should be set locally, not globally. In lower-prevalence settings, using highly specific assays may optimize outcomes.

Electrochemical Synthesis of One-Dimensional Nanostructures for Sensor and Spintronic Applications
One-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanotubes, are extremely attractive building blocks for electronics because of their small sizes, which provide for extremely high density devices, and their unique properties that emerge from increased surface to volume ratios.  In addition their extremely high aspect ratios offer researchers the potential to build striped and coaxial structures with different components aligned along the cylindrical or radial axis of the wire, respectively.  Composition modulation can be used to incorporate multiple functionalities from intrinsic properties of the material or through interfacial phenomena.  However, spatial manipulation and the ability to assemble and position nanostructures in a controlled manner so they are registered to lithographically defined contacts is a critical step toward scalable integration in high-density nanodevices.  In this dissertation a generalized template directed approach with ancillary assembly, contact, and displacement techniques were utilized to synthesize and characterize individual nanostructures from uniquely configured conducting polymer, magnetic, and semiconductor nanomaterials for sensor and spintronic applications.  Conducting polymers are particularly appealing because they exhibit tunable transport characteristics along with electronic, magnetic and optical properties of metals or semiconductors while retaining the attractive mechanical properties and processing advantages of polymers. In the first part of this work single component conducting polymer nanowires were electropolymerized, dielectrophoretically assembled, and contacted via maskless electrodeposition.  Maskless electrodeposition was developed to selectively electrodeposit material on prefabricated microelectrode with no observable deposition on the conducting polymer nanowires, embedding the nanowire ends.  Two different conducting polymers were investigated, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyethylendioxythiophene (PEDOT).  Individual PPy nanowire devices demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to ammonia vapors, and PEDOT nanowire devices exhibited strong responses to volatile organic compounds.  The gas sensing performances of these single nanowire devices were tuned by dopant type and synthesis conditions.  Alternatively, single PEDOT nanowire devices were also completely coated in ferromagnetic material by implimenting non-selective electrodeposition.  The magnetoresistance (MR) of these devices also displayed anomalous behavior, drastically deviating from typical anisotropic magnetoresistance responses.  Additionally, multi-segmented noble/oxidizable nanowires were electrodeposited and subjected to galvanic displacement to create nanopeapod devices with Au peas and Te pods.

[lerner, part, sociobiology, ethology, determinism, genetic]

Review
Lerner's important book is divided into two parts, each of which deals with a significant issue. The first part presents a critique of genetic determinism espoused by contemporary ethology and sociobiology; the second part is a discussion of "developmental contextualism," Lerner's alternative to genetic determinism. Both parts of this book are also controversial: the first because of its treatment of Konrad Lorenz; the second because of the emotional and passionate attachment many still have to genetic determinism. Some have argued that Lerner's characterization of modern ethology and sociobiology is off the mark and outdated; this is, in fact, the case with several of the reviews in this special issue (Kaye, Lamb, Siegel). However, Lerner's characterization still forms the basis of much thinking in modern ethology and sociobiology, particularly in its new guise of "Evolutionary Psychology" (Caporael & Brewer, 1991; DeKay & Buss, 1992).

Strategies for developing a benchtop biosensor for the rapid detection of L-Alanine
As the subtle intricacies of mammalian metabolism have become further elucidated over the past several decades, substantial progress has been made in the medical and scientific communities to address metabolic disorders and the relationships between abnormalities in metabolism at the molecular level and their observable physiological ramifications. The amino acid alanine is known as a key molecule in protein and carbohydrate metabolism and nitrogen regulation, and has further been associated with a number of diseases and pathological conditions. It is also of interest to the commercial and biotechnological industries. Therefore, a rapid and inexpensive procedure for the measurement of alanine in biological or commercial samples would be of great use. Two amperometric methods for the measurement of L-alanine involving enzymatic biosensors are explored. The electrochemical foundations for the operation of the sensors are described. The unique reaction mechanism for the conversion of alanine to measurable products is discussed. Sensors are tested for alanine measurement via the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide and the reduction of oxygen. The response of the sensors to reacted alanine samples as well as standard solutions are evaluated with regards to sensitivity and rapidity. These studies show that the proposed reaction mechanism for alanine conversion and detection is feasible and that the development of an amperometric biosensor for this purpose is an attainable goal, while also suggesting that optimizing the sensitivity of the sensors is paramount to its utility

A common mechanism of clinical HIV-1 resistance to the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc despite divergent resistance levels and lack of common gp120 resistance mutations
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry by altering the CCR5 extracellular loops (ECL), such that the gp120 envelope glycoproteins (Env) no longer recognize CCR5. The mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to MVC, the only CCR5 antagonist licensed for clinical use are poorly understood, with insights into MVC resistance almost exclusively limited to knowledge obtained from in vitro studies or from studies of resistance to other CCR5 antagonists. To more precisely understand mechanisms of resistance to MVC in vivo, we characterized Envs isolated from 2 subjects who experienced virologic failure on MVC.
				
				
					
						Results
					Envs were cloned from subjects 17 and 24 before commencement of MVC (17-Sens and 24-Sens) and after virologic failure (17-Res and 24-Res). The Envs cloned during virologic failure showed broad divergence in resistance levels, with 17-Res Env exhibiting a relatively high maximal percent inhibition (MPI) of ~90% in NP2-CD4/CCR5 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and 24-Res Env exhibiting a very low MPI of ~0 to 12% in both cell types, indicating relatively &#8220;weak&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; resistance, respectively. Resistance mutations were strain-specific and mapped to the gp120 V3 loop. Affinity profiling by the 293-Affinofile assay and mathematical modeling using VERSA (Viral Entry Receptor Sensitivity Analysis) metrics revealed that 17-Res and 24-Res Envs engaged MVC-bound CCR5 inefficiently or very efficiently, respectively. Despite highly divergent phenotypes, and a lack of common gp120 resistance mutations, both resistant Envs exhibited an almost superimposable pattern of dramatically increased reliance on sulfated tyrosine residues in the CCR5 N-terminus, and on histidine residues in the CCR5 ECLs. This altered mechanism of CCR5 engagement rendered both the resistant Envs susceptible to neutralization by a sulfated peptide fragment of the CCR5 N-terminus.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Clinical resistance to MVC may involve divergent Env phenotypes and different genetic alterations in gp120, but the molecular mechanism of resistance of the Envs studied here appears to be related. The increased reliance on sulfated CCR5 N-terminus residues suggests a new avenue to block HIV-1 entry by CCR5 N-terminus sulfopeptidomimetic drugs.

Grid-based methods for diatomic quantum scattering problems III: Double photoionization of molecular hydrogen in prolate spheroidal coordinates
Our previously developed finite-element/ discrete variable representation in prolate spheroidal coordinates is extended to two-electron systems with a study of double ionization of H$_2$ with fixed-nuclei. Particular attention is paid to the development of fast and accurate methods for treating the electron-electron  interaction. The use of exterior complex scaling in the implementation offers a simple way of enforcing Coulomb boundary conditions for the electronic double continuum. While the angular distributions calculated in this study are found to be completely consistent with our earlier treatments that employed single-center expansions in spherical coordinates, we find that the magnitude of the integrated cross sections are sensitive to small changes in the initial-state wave function. The present formulation offers significant advantages with respect to convergence and efficiency and opens the way to calculations on more complicated diatomic targets.

                  Background
               
               A variety of species and experimental designs have been used to study genetic influences on alcohol dependence, ethanol response, and related traits. Integration of these heterogeneous data can be used to produce a ranked target gene list for additional investigation.

               In this study, we performed a unique multi-species evidence-based data integration using three microarray experiments in mice or humans that generated an initial alcohol dependence (AD) related genes list, human linkage and association results, and gene sets implicated in C. elegans and Drosophila. We then used permutation and false discovery rate (FDR) analyses on the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) dataset from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) to evaluate the ranking results and weighting matrices. We found one weighting score matrix could increase FDR based q-values for a list of 47 genes with a score greater than 2. Our follow up functional enrichment tests revealed these genes were primarily involved in brain responses to ethanol and neural adaptations occurring with alcoholism.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               These results, along with our experimental validation of specific genes in mice, C. elegans and Drosophila, suggest that a cross-species evidence-based approach is useful to identify candidate genes contributing to alcoholism.

Biosynthetic investigations of ansamycin natural products from marine-derived actinomycetes
Ansamycin polyketides from actinobacteria include the potent antibiotic and anticancer agents rifamycin SV, ansamitocin P-3, and geldanamycin. These natural product macrolactams are characterized by an mC₇N structural unit derived from the aromatic acid 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoate, which is carboxy extended by multimodular polyketide synthases utilizing primarily acetate and propionate building blocks prior to macrolactam cyclization. Herein, I report a multidisciplinary investigation of the biosynthesis of two structurally fascinating natural products produced by ansamycin biosynthetic machinery. Saliniketals A and B are unusual bicyclic polyketides from the obligate marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola that inhibit the cancer chemopreventative drug target ornithine decarboxylase. The saliniketals are noteworthy because of their structural similarity to the ansa portion of the rifamycin antibiotics, which co-occur in fermentation broth. Analysis of the S. arenicola genome identified a 106 kb rif gene cluster consisting of all the PKS and tailoring genes necessary for the biosynthesis of rifamycin B. No additional type I PKS with domain architecture consistent with saliniketal assembly could be identified, which suggested the saliniketals are products of the S. arenicola rif locus. Using stable isotope incorporation studies, PCR targeted mutagenesis, and chemical complementation with rifamycin pathway intermediates I have shown that the saliniketals and rifamycins share a single biosynthetic locus and a cytochrome P450 facilitates the divergence of the two compound classes. Additionally, in 2009 the novel ansamycin ansalactam A was isolated by the Fenical laboratory from an extract of a marine sediment-derived actinomycete of the genus Streptomyce. Unique from its predecessors, ansalactam A possesses a spiro-fused gamma -lactam moiety and an unusual isobutyrylmalonate polyketide extender unit. Using ¹³C-labeled precursors, I have shown that the unique branched chained polyketide extender unit of ansalactam A originates from the condensation of isobutyrate and acetate precursors. Further bioinformatic analysis of the partial ansalactam biosynthetic gene cluster identified a putative three gene cassette (KASII-HBDH-CCR) for the biosynthesis of isobutyrylmalonyl-CoA. Efforts towards the functional characterization of the novel polyketide biosynthetic genes are also discussed within

Neuronal class-specific patterns of calcium activity and target dependence of neurotransmitter expression in the developing spinal cord
The proper functioning of all nervous systems requires efficient communication among neurons. Neurotransmitters provide the fundamental basis for neural communication. Establishing the expression of the appropriate neurotransmitters in different populations of neurons is a critical challenge for neural development. This is a complicated process that involves multiple mechanisms, including intrinsic genetic coding, early neuronal activity and signal transduction cascades driven by neuronal targets. Embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons generate spontaneous transient elevations of intracellular calcium. Different classes of neurons exhibit this calcium spike activity in distinct patterns, and altering this activity modulates transmitter expression. However neurotransmitter expression is sensitive to this neuronal spike activity only during an early period of development. Both calcium spiking activity and the sensitivity of activity-dependent transmitter specification decrease and disappear as embryos mature. I showed that spinal transection causes neurons to resume calcium spike activity, and that enhancing this activity leads to increased expression of the inhibitory transmitter GABA. These results indicate a potential reopening of the sensitive period that exists earlier in development. Using a neuron-muscle co-culture system, I showed that muscle, as a neuronal target, plays important role in regulating transmitter expression. Muscle contact refines transmitter expression in cultured neurons by reducing the expression of non-cholinergic transmitters, GABA, glycine and glutamate, while leaving choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression unaltered. Trophic factors that are normally released at synapses and delivered retrogradely along axons appear to be sufficient to induce such changes. Further investigation revealed that muscle electrical activity is required for muscle-dependent suppression of non-cholinergic transmitter expression. In addition, muscle contact also suppresses neuronal spontaneous calcium activity and abolishes activity-dependent transmitter specification at early embryonic stages

Isolating Arabidopsis mutants affecting auxin-mediated development
Auxin is a plant hormone that plays essential roles in all aspects of growth and development. Plants have multiple pathways to synthesize auxin. The 11 YUCCA genes encode for FMO-like enzymes and catalyze the conversion of tryptamine to N-hydroxyl-tryptamine; they participate in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis branch. Molecular analysis of auxin mechanisms is difficult because genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling oftentimes belong to gene families. Here I conduct EMS forward genetic screening in the partially auxin deficient yuc1-/-yuc4-/+ background. I have isolated enhancer and suppressor mutants and attempted to identify the corresponding genes. In addition, a weak allele of the auxin transport gene PINOID - pid336, was cloned. Using pid336, I initiate another genetic screening employing T- DNA activation tagging method, in the sensitized yuc1-/- pid336-/- background. In total, I have screened more than two thousand lines, isolated several mutants, and have attempted to identify the genes involved. The identification and characterization of genes from my screening help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling

Nickel-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling of Phenol Derivatives and Total Synthesis of Welwitindolinone Natural Products
Chapter one provides a survey of the wide variety of unconventional phenol derivatives that are now available for use in traditional cross-coupling reactions. Emphasis is given to carbon-carbon (C-C) bond forming reactions with a brief discussion of other transformations. Chapters two and three are a discussion of our work in the field of nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of phenol derivatives. The use of aryl pivalates, sulfamates, carbamates, and carbonates in the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling is described, along with synthetic applications utilizing these phenol derivatives. A computational and experimental mechanistic study for the cross-coupling of aryl sulfamates and carbamates is also reported.Chapters four and five detail our efforts in the total synthesis of the welwitindolinone natural products. The enantiospecific total syntheses of (-)-N-methylwelwitindolinone C isothiocyanate and (-)-N-methylwelwitindolinone C isonitrile, as well as their respective C3-hydroxylated analogs are reported. The synthetic routes feature an aryne cyclization to rapidly construct the 4.3.1-bicyclic core of these molecules, as well as a late-stage intramolecular nitrene insertion to functionalize a bridgehead carbon. The strategic use of a deuterium kinetic isotope effect to improve the efficiency of the nitrene insertion is also discussed. A computational prediction for the stereochemical configuration at C3 of the hydroxylated welwitindolinones is presented, which was subsequently confirmed by experimental studies.

An Empirical Study of the Time Gap and its Relation to the Fundamental Diagram
The fundamental diagram is an important element in a variety of transportation studies. While various shapes of the fundamental diagram have been proposed and numerous debates on the best-fit fundamental diagram have been made, why the fundamental diagram has many different shapes has not been well explained. This study introduces time gap as a key parameter to understand drivers' behavioral differences at different locations and traffic conditions, then relate it to the shape of the fundamental diagram. From I-80 freeway event detector data, it is shown that time gap follows a certain probabilistic distribution and its mean value varies along locations. When downstream congestion is expected, drivers tend to take larger time gap than otherwise. It also turns out that drivers take different time gaps for different travel speeds.

Adaption Versus Phylogeny: The Role of Animal Psychology in The Study of Human Behavior
Advocates of Darwinian approaches to the study of behavior are divided over what an evolutionary perspective is thought to entail. Some take "evolution-mindedness" to mean "phylogeny-mindedness," whereas others take it to mean "adaptationmindedness." Historically, comparative psychology began as the search for mental continuities between humans and other animals: a phylogenetic approach. Independently, ethologists and now behavioral ecologists have placed far more emphasis on the nichedifferentiated mental abilities unique to the species being investigated: an adaptive approach. We argue that the output of complex, dynamical systems can be dramatically changed by only minor changes in internal structure. Because selection acts on the consequences of behavior, the behavioral output of the psyche will be easily shaped by adaptive demands over evolutionary time, even though the modification of the neurophysiological substrate necessary to create such adaptive changes may be minor. Thus, adaptation-mindedness will be most illuminating in the study of cognition and behavior, whereas phylogeny-mindedness will be most illuminating in the study of their neurophysiological substrates. Similarly, a phylogenetic approach to cognition and behavior is likely to cause one to overlook our most interesting, complexly designed species-typical traits, whereas using animal psychology to exfoliate general principles of behavioral ecology represents our best hope of understanding humanity's many zoologically unique characteristics.

Molecular and activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic refinement
In order to execute complex behavioral tasks, neural circuits must be precisely connected and each connection must be finely tuned. Neural circuits are shaped by molecular mechanisms that regulate the establishment of synaptic connections, as well as by changes in activity, which modifies those circuits. Both processes are needed to support a functional, plastic neural circuit. In the hippocampus, CA1 axons make divergent connections onto several classes of local interneurons. Remarkably, the presynaptic properties of each synapse depend on the identity of the post-synaptic partner. Synapses from CA1 axons onto basket cells exhibit short-term depression, whereas those onto oriens-lacunosum molecular (OLM) interneurons are strongly facilitating (Ali et al., 1998; Ali and Thomson, 1998). The molecular mechanisms underlying such target-cell specific synaptic specification remain unknown. Here we show that Elfn1, a single-pass transmembrane protein with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LLR) and fibronectin type 3 (FN3) domains, is expressed selectively by OLM interneurons and localizes to excitatory synapses. Lentiviral-mediated postsynaptic knockdown of Elfn1 in OLM interneurons strongly reduces short-term facilitation and increases the amplitude of synaptic currents. These effects are explained by an increase in presynaptic release probability, while postsynaptic properties are left unaffected. Thus, Elfn1 regulates facilitation at the CA1- OLM synapse by acting trans-synaptically to reduce presynaptic probability of release. These observations indicate that cell- and synapse- specific expression of LRR- containing proteins in postsynaptic neurons can contribute to the generation of functional synaptic diversity. Activity-dependent modification, in addition to molecular mechanisms, can shape synaptic function. Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity characterized by cell-wide changes in synaptic strength in response to changes in overall levels of neuronal activity. Here we report that bicuculline-induced increase in neuronal activity leads to a decrease in mEPSC amplitude and a decrease in expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 in rat hippocampal cultures. Bicuculline treatment also leads to an increase in the levels of the transcriptional repressor MeCP2, which binds to the GluR2 promoter along with the co-repressors HDAC1 and mSin3A. Down-regulation of MeCP2 by shRNA expression or genetic deletion blocks the bicuculline-induced decrease in GluR2 expression and mEPSC amplitude. These observations indicate that MeCP2 mediates activity- dependent synaptic scaling, and suggest that the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome, which is caused by mutations in MeCP2, may involve defects in activity- dependent regulation of synaptic currents. Taken together, these studies on the role of Elfn1 in target-cell specificity and MeCP2 regulation of synaptic scaling present novel roles for molecules in the specification and activity-dependent regulation of synapses

Social Signals Analyzed at the Single Cell Level: Someone is Looking at Me, Something Moved!
In the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the macaque brain there are populations of cells which respond selectively to faces. Studies of these cells reveal that they are very sensitive to the direction of eye gaze and posture of the head of other subjects. It is argued that one function of the cells is to enable analysis of where other individuals are directing their attention. Given this selectivity for complex socially relevant stimuli it is surprising that the STS contains cells that respond to touch anywhere on the body or to any movement seen in the visual environment. We have investigated these tactile and motion sensitive cells to determine their behavioural significance. In the awake, behaving monkey we found that the critical dimension for polymodal coding is whether or not the sensations are expected. Tactile stimulation out of sight cannot be predicted and elicits neuronal responses. By contrast, when the monkey can see and, therefore, predict impending contact, or when the monkey touches a familiar surface in a predictable location, cell responses are reduced or abolished. In an analogous way some cells are unresponsive to the sight of the monkey's own limbs moving but respond to the sight of other moving stimuli. Since unpredictable sensations are often caused by other animals, the STS area appears well suited to defining sensory stimuli that are important in social or predator/prey interactions.

"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), a heterogeneous disease exemplified by two cases and the important role of cytogenetics: a multidisciplinary approach"
Abstract
				T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare form of leukemia composed of mature T-cells that usually presents in older people with a median age of 65. Most cases of T-PLL will harbor chromosomal abnormalities involving 14q11.2 (TCR alpha/delta), 14q32 (TCL1) or Xq28 (MTCP-1), abnormalities of chromosome 8, 12p and deletions of the long arm of chromosomes 5, 6, 11 and 13. Cytogenetics, FISH, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) , SNP arrays with high resolution analysis have provided more precisely frequent submicroscopic gene and genomic lesions as well as breakpoints involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. One of the cornerstones to diagnose T-PLL are cytogenetic analysis. Here we summarize the current cytogenetic findings and we also describe two distinct cases of T-PLL where cytogenetics, FISH , morphologic analysis and flow cytometry helped to diagnose them accurately.

Towards an understanding of human alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor selectivity : the creation and characterization of a soluble ligand binding domain template
Receptors play a vital role in the transduction of cell to cell signaling. They are important proteins with recognition capacity in signal transduction, particularly in neurons. Cholinergic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems are defined by storage, release, and stimulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. At the synaptic cleft, the release of acetylcholine from presynaptic neurons triggers activation through channel opening of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the postsynaptic membrane. Previous research implicates the nAChRs in diseases including schizophrenia, drug addiction (specifically nicotine addiction), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The work presented here uses a comprehensive approach including structural studies, protein engineering, functional studies, and protein characterization to gain insight into the distinguishing characteristics that may contribute to ligand selectivity and structural components that contribute to receptor function. The main aim of this work was to create a soluble template of the ligand binding domain of human alpha-7-nAChRs to understand pharmacological selectivity, while also creating an efficient tool for therapeutic development. In order to validate this study, methods to test the functional activity of nAChRs were developed and in the process a novel calcium FRET sensor based assay was developed as a cost-effective tool for drug screening and functional ligand characterization on nAChRs and other ligand-gated, calcium-permeable, ion channels. To process the information generated by the developed assay, a novel data storage system in the form of a database was created. The creation of a soluble template fully identical to the ligand binding domain of human alpha-7-nAChR was not successful, but the protein generated served to identify structurally a glycosylation site on the receptor as well as proved to be a better binding homologue for alpha-7- nAChRs than any other proteins currently available. Overall, the mutational conversion of a soluble homologue to the human alpha-7-nAChR gave insight into the structural understanding of the extracellular domain of nAChRs. This template provides a better model to create lead compounds as therapeutics for diseases associated with the nAChRs

[olfactory, orn, receptor, glomerulus, behavior]

Propagation and modulation of activity in early olfactory processing and its relevance to odor-driven behavior
The olfactory system has evolved over hundreds of millions of years to perform odor recognition and discrimination across a large range of odor concentrations. One problem that is not well understood is how activity propagates and is modulated at the first synaptic transformation. The first olfactory relay of most organisms receives input from odorant receptor neurons (ORNs), whereby ORNs expressing a given odorant receptor send axons to a specific stereotyped glomerulus. ORNs synapse onto second order neurons that propagate olfactory information to higher brain areas. A hallmark of the first olfactory relay, is the presence of GABAergic local interneurons as well as a number of neuromodulators. We have therefore investigated how different components of the early olfactory circuit contribute to the olfactory representation and odor-driven behavior in Drosophila. We have asked three primary questions. 1) Is there lateral excitation between glomeruli? Using receptor gene mutations to silence ORN input to a given glomerulus, we observed that the projection neurons (PNs) of the same glomerulus have dramatically reduced odor-evoked action potentials. Thus, ORNs are the main drivers of PNs and lateral excitation is minor and potentially a modulatory mechanism. 2) How is gain control achieved in the antennal lobe? We found that the GABAB receptor is expressed in the presynaptic terminal of ORNs and mediates a feedback gain control of the early olfactory circuit. This gain control is important for pheromone-mediated mate localization. 3) Does internal state shape olfactory processing? We have found that starvation alters olfactory representation by upregulation of a neuropeptide receptor in select ORNs, which mediates starvation-dependent presynaptic facilitation. This neuropeptide signaling is important for starvation-dependent food search behavior. Together, these findings reveal how information propagates through the first olfactory relay and how it can be modulated to enhance odor-driven behavior

Macrophage imbalance (M1 vs. M2) and upregulation of mast cells in wall of ruptured human cerebral aneurysms: preliminary results
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					M1 and M2 cells are two major subsets of human macrophages that exert opposite effects on the inflammatory response. This study aims to investigate the role of macrophage M1/M2 imbalance and mast cells in the progression of human cerebral aneurysms to rupture.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Ten patients with cerebral aneurysms (five ruptured and five unruptured) underwent microsurgical clipping. During the procedure, a segment of the aneurysm dome was resected and immunostained with monoclonal antibodies for M1 cells (anti-HLA DR), M2 cells (anti-CD 163), and mast cells (anti-tryptase clone AA). A segment of the superficial temporal artery (STA) was also removed and immunostained with monoclonal antibodies for M1, M2, and mast cells.
				
				
					
						Results
					All ten aneurysm tissues stained positive for M1, M2, and mast cells. M1 and M2 cells were present in equal proportions in unruptured aneurysms. This contrasted with a marked predominance of M1 over M2 cells in ruptured aneurysms (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.045). Mast cells were also prominently upregulated in ruptured aneurysms (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). Few M1 and M2 cells were present in STA samples.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					M1/M2 macrophages and mast cells are found in human cerebral aneurysms; however, M1 and mast cell expression seems to markedly increase in ruptured aneurysms. These findings suggest that macrophage M1/M2 imbalance and upregulation of mast cells may have a role in the progression of cerebral aneurysms to rupture.

Harnessing Radical Chemistry for the Facile Identification of Post Translational Modification Sites in Proteins by Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry
Photodissociation (PD) mass spectrometry has been shown to be a useful analytical technique for determining protein modifications. Described herein is the development and application of photodissociation for various modifications. Photo-excitation with 266nm laser light normally does not yield fragmentation. However C-S, S-S, C-I, C-Br, and C-Cl bonds can be homolytic cleaved through direct dissociation pathways.  This selective fragmentation can be utilized to identify peptides or proteins of interest. Radicals generated through this process can cause further dissociation of the peptide backbone. Radical directed dissociation (RDD) is useful for identifying the location of modification sites. The selective nature of fragmentation is shown to provide facile identification of PTM sites by greatly simplifying data analysis. Reported herein is the discovery of a novel gas phase dissociation technique useful for the facile analysis of protein modifications. Phosphorylation sites are selectively modified through â elimination and Michael addition chemistry, installing photolabile group. Photodissociation yields homolytic cleavage of the C-S bond at the modification site, generating a â radical which is poised to fragment the peptide backbone selectively at the previously phosphorylated residue, thus allowing facile identification. Cysteine residues, uniquely reactive amino acids, are shown to form covalent bonds with quinones. Furthermore, the chromophoric properties can be leveraged for site specific photodissociation. Photodissociation reveals both the presence and location of modified cysteine residues. Selective fragmentation of a single bond in a whole protein is demonstrated. PD can be used to determine both the presence and site of modification generated by naturally occurring molecules, such as dopamine, which can harness quinone chemistry to modify proteins.Also reported is the discovery of photodissociation at 266 nm to selectively cleave disulfide bonds in the gas phase, while leaving all other bonds intact. This methodology can be used to identify disulfide bonded pairs in complex systems. LC-MS experiments utilizing photodissociation were developed for analysis of protein digests. Peptides containing biomarkers of oxidative stress can be easily identified by LC-PD-MS. Proteins exposed to oxidative stress can be halogenated at tyrosine residues. Homolytic cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond is a favorable process and allows facile identification of these types of biomarkers. Shown in this dissertation is the selectivity offered by photodissociation; homolytic cleavage allows simplification of data analysis by quickly identifying the peptides of interest in a mixture while subsequent selective backbone fragmentation allows facile analysis of protein modifications.

Modern scientific datasets present numerous data management and analysis challenges. State-of-the-art index and query technologies are critical for facilitating interactive exploration of large datasets, but numerous challenges remain in terms of designing a system for process- ing general scientific datasets. The system needs to be able to run on distributed multi-core platforms, efficiently utilize underlying I/O infrastructure, and scale to massive datasets.
We present FastQuery, a novel software framework that address these challenges. FastQuery utilizes a state-of-the-art index and query technology (FastBit) and is designed to process mas- sive datasets on modern supercomputing platforms. We apply FastQuery to processing of a massive 50TB dataset generated by a large scale accelerator modeling code. We demonstrate the scalability of the tool to 11,520 cores. Motivated by the scientific need to search for inter- esting particles in this dataset, we use our framework to reduce search time from hours to tens of seconds.

A study of saturated granular assemblages and its implications for transport, stress propagation and failure in marine sediments
The subject of small-scale marine sediment mechanics is an area of active research, motivated by its key role in beach and shelf processes. Much of the existing small- scale work has focused on two-phase flows and particle behavior at the sediment interface, and their role in sediment transport and shaping seabed morphology. The study presented here considers the behavior of unconsolidated sediments below the seabed, 100 to 1000 grain diameters deep. Motivated by field observations off La Jolla Shores Beach that suggest dynamical behavior at such depths, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to study the behavior of unconsolidated, saturated granular assemblies. Careful measurements of the apparent mass at the base of dry and saturated, glass beads pilings were acquired to examine stress redirection effects. The experiment protocol included slowly lowering the piling base to achieve reproducible piling configurations through wall friction mobilization. Results are analyzed using the Janssen and Oriented Stress Linearity (OSL) models, the latter allowing interpretation of the arching behavior in terms of arch direction and friction angle along arches. The data show qualitative similarities between dry and saturated granular assemblies, suggesting a commonality in their underlying physics, but quantitative differences in the intensity of the arching mechanism, probably associated with lubrication effects. Analysis of the piling quasistatic descent shows evidence of a progressive upward decompression punctuated with dynamic piling reconfigurations interpreted as relaxation oscillations. Both features are associated with spatial and temporal stress heterogeneities and have implications for modeling the mechanics of granular assemblies. Granular matter theories are expected to reproduce such observations occurring under minute deformations in these laboratory experiments. This work also describes a study of nearshore sediment accumulation and submarine canyon morphology offshore La Jolla, using new seismic data and bathymetry. Isopach maps of the sedimentary sequences overlying the bedrock reveal the critical role of the tectonic landscape on the spatial distribution of modern stratigraphic units. A detailed examination of the morphological characteristics of the Scripps and La Jolla canyons refines the relationship between canyon location and development and regional tectonic deformation, and provides insight on the stability of unconsolidated, saturated marine sediments

Bayes Neutral Zone Classification in Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Settings
Neutral zone classifiers allow for a region of neutrality when there is inadequate information to assign a predicted class label with suitable confidence.  A neutral zone classifier is defined by classification regions that trade off the cost of an incorrect classification against the cost of remaining neutral.  We derive a Bayes neutral zone classifier and demonstrate that it outperforms previous neutral zone classifiers with respect to the expected cost of misclassifications and also with respect to computational complexity.  Additionally, we present the scenarios where the previous neutral zone classifiers and the proposed Bayes neutral zone classifier achieve equivalence in both the two-class and three-class setting.Following the theoretical derivation of the Bayes neutral zone classifier we extend the methodology to both the unsupervised and semi-supervised setting via the EM algorithm for the purpose of developing neutral zone classifiers beyond the supervised setting.  Previous versions of neutral zone classifiers have only dealt with the supervised settings.  The discussion of unsupervised and semi-supervised neutral zone classifiers covers both the parametric and nonparametric cases.  Simulation studies in both the parametric and nonparametric cases show the improvements that can be obtained by adding labeled data for semi-supervised learning.     The Bayes neutral zone classifier is illustrated with a microbial community profiling application in which no training data is available.  In this example we show the benefits obtained over previous neutral zone classifiers.  Additionally, a simulation study is performed to investigate the benefits of using neutral zone classification to remove noise from microbial community profiling data sets.

He-CO₂ Systematics in groundwaters at Mount Lassen Volcano , Northern Califronia
Although CO₂ degassing from volcanic centers has been well documented, emissions from the flanks and areas surrounding volcanoes are not well quantified. To further investigate mechanisms of volcano degassing we have selected Mount Lassen, in the Cascades range, as a type locality where degassing occurs both proximal and distal to the volcano summit. Our aim is to quantify distal magmatic CO₂ release via groundwaters to compare to magmatic carbon fluxes centered on the summit region. We report new helium and carbon isotopes (³He/⁴He, delta¹³C) and relative abundance (CO₂³He) characteristics of 13 groundwater samples collected between 20 and 50 km from Lassen Peak. All of the sampled groundwaters have ³He/⁴He values greater than radiogenic production values (̃0.02 RA) indicating a discernible presence of mantle-derived helium addition. Carbon isotopes (delta¹³C) vary between -3.9 nd -7.7 ⁰/₀₀ (versus V-PDB). CO₂/³He values fall between 4.2 x 10⁹ and 5.7 x 10¹² all above typical MORB- like values (2 x 10⁹). Using groundwater chemistry, we resolve endogenic CO₂ for contributions from organic and carbonate derived CO₂. Then we combine our estimate of average endogenic CO₂ contributions with estimated groundwater flow rates to derive an endogenic carbon flux of 1.18 x 10⁷ kg year⁻¹. This value represents 25% of the total CO₂ release from Lassen. Only measuring carbon flux from the summit region of volcanoes may seriously underestimate the transfer rates of endogenic CO₂. Taken together, these data indicate large-scale transport and release of endogenic carbon upwards of 50 kilometers from the volcanic edifice

Decision-Making and Turn Alternation in Pill Bugs (Armadillidium Vulgare)
Twelve pill bugs (Armadillidium vulgare, Isopoda, Cmstacean) were examined in 200 successive T-mazes. When obstacles are present, A. vulgare tend to move by means of turn alternation, which is generally considered an innate adaptive behavior. With a decrease in air moisture, the bugs have a tendency to increase their turn alternation rate. However, in such long successive T-mazes as in this study, continued turn alternation should actually accelerate the bugs' desiccation. This fact implies that turn alternation cannot always work adaptively. In this trade-off situation, while three individuals kept turn alternation at a high rate (1) and four at a low rate, (2), the other five spontaneously increased the rate of turn alternation and then decreased it (3). This instability of turn alternation in group (3) is interpreted as resulting not from stochastic factors but rather from the bugs' own decision-making, and seems to be anescape behavior used to get out of the experimental apparatus. In order to verify thedecision-making hypothesis, all animals were subsequently tested in another successive T-maze apparatus, where the ends of the chosen alleys were shut, i.e., with 50 successive blind alleys. In this situation, while individuals of groups (1) and (2) continued to wander inside the apparatus, those of group (3) found a vertical roughwall, climbed it, and escaped from the apparatus in the middle of the experiment. Mostof the unexercised individuals in the control experiment did not show climbingbehavior

Surfzone tracer dispersion : methods, observations, and modeling
Decisions about recreational beach closures would be enhanced with better estimates of surfzone contaminant transport and dilution. New in situ methods, developed here, for measuring fluorescent Rhodamine WT dye tracer in the surfzone increase the temporal and spatial resolution over previous techniques. Bubbles and sand suspended by breaking waves in the surfzone interfere with in situ optical fluorometer dye measurements, but turbidity correction reduces root-mean-square dye concentration errors to < 5% of dye concentration magnitude. Alongshore tracer plumes, formed by continuously releasing dye in a wave driven alongshore current are used to examine cross- shore surfzone tracer dispersion at Huntington Beach, California. Ensemble averaged cross-shore tracer concentration profiles are generally shoreline attached (maximum at or near the shoreline), with increasing cross- shore widths and decreasing peak concentrations with downstream distance. For each release, cross-shore surfzone absolute diffusivities kappaxx, estimated using a simple Fickian diffusion solution with a no-flux boundary at the shoreline, range from kappaxx = 0.5-2.5 m²s⁻¹. The kappaxx scale best with a mixing-length scaling (correlation r² = 0.59 and the expected scaling versus kappaxx best-fit slope < 1), indicating that horizontal rotational motions are important for cross- shore tracer dispersion in the surfzone. The five tracer plumes used for kappaxx estimates are simulated with a time-dependent wave-resolving Boussinesq surfzone model (funwaveC) initialized with the observed bathymetry and incident wave spectra. The modeled and observed cross- shore structure of significant wave heights and mean alongshore currents have good qualitative agreement. Modeled and observed low frequency (< 0.03 Hz) horizontal rotational velocities, possibly important for cross-shore dispersion, have similar cross-shore structure, although magnitudes are slightly over predicted. Modeled tracer is spread by model currents and eddies, a breaking wave eddy diffusivity, and a small (0.01m̃²s⁻¹) background diffusivity. Mean model tracer concentration skill (compared to a zero prediction) is highly variable (from negative to 0.73), however cross-shore integrated moments (normalized by the cross-shore tracer integral) have consistently high skills (0̃.9). Modeled kappaxx estimates are similar to the observations, but the skill (0.4) is only moderate. The model breaking wave eddy diffusivity does not effect dispersion significantly

Cyclotron line and wind studies of galactic high mass X- ray binaries
High mass X-ray binaries are rotating neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields that channel accreting matter from their companion star onto the magnetic poles with subsequent collimated X-ray emission. The stars are fed either by a strong stellar wind of the optical companion or by an accretion disk, where material follows the magnetic field lines, emitting X-rays throughout this process either in the accretion column or directly from the neutron star surface. The fast rotation and the narrow collimation of the X-ray emission creates an observed pulsation, forming the concept of a pulsar. Some of the key questions of these thesis are the emission processes above the magnetic pole, including the influence of the magnetic field, the formation of the X-ray beam, and the structure of the stellar wind. An important process is the effect of the teraGauss magnetic field. Cyclotron resonance scattering creates spectral features similar to broad absorption lines (CRSFs or cyclotron lines) that are directly related to the magnetic field. The discovery of cyclotron lines ̃ 35 years ago allows for the only direct method to measure the magnetic field strength in neutron star systems. Variations in the line parameters throughout the pulse phase, and a dependence in the observed luminosity can also aid in the understanding of these processes. In this thesis I present the results of phase averaged and phase resolved analysis of the three high mass X-ray binaries CenX-3, 1A1118-61, and GX301-2. The data used for this work were obtained with NASA's Rossi X- ray Timing Explorer and the Japanese Suzaku mission. Both satellites are ideal to cover the broad energy band, where CRSFs occur and are necessary for understanding the continuum as a whole. In the process of investigating the 3 sources, I discovered a CRSF at ̃ 55 keV in the transient binary 1A1118-61, which indicates one of the strongest magnetic fields known in these objects. I used the variations of the CRSF in GX 301-2 throughout its pulse phase to develop a simple dipole model of the relationship between the magnetic moment vector and the spin axis of the neutron star. In Cen X-3 I use a similar model to demonstrate that the magnetic field most likely includes higher orders than just the simple dipole. The use of a wind model in high mass X-ray binaries can give information about the type of accretion, disk or wind, and the structure of the wind by measuring the amount of the material in the line of sight versus orbital phase. In Cen X-3, I used a simple spherical wind model throughout the two binary orbits and found that the observed absorption column densities are not consistent with pure wind accretion, and that either an accretion wake or a disk are needed to be consistent with the data. Similar results were observed in GX 301-2, where the neutron star may have passed through an accretion stream, increasing the observed amount of absorbed material

Insights into the regulation of NF-kappaB and mediation of the cellular stress response by NF-kappaB
NF-kappaB is a pleiotropic transcription factor, which is instrumental in regulating diverse cellular processes such as inflammation and cell survival. Enhanced NF- kappaB activity, due either to prolonged NF-kappaB activation upon exposure to cellular stress or misregulation of NF-kappaB, can lead to many neurodegenerative diseases as well as cancer. Thus, in this study, biological and biochemical approaches were used to characterize how NF-kappaB regulates the cellular stress response and how NF-kappaB activity itself is regulated. Chapter 1 introduces oxidative stress, which is the specific cellular stress used in this study, and reviews how oxidative stress affects all cellular components, including the proteasome and NF-kappaB. Chapter 2 characterizes the mechanism of NF-kappaB's cell death promoting function in response to oxidative stress and shows that NF-kappaB signaling actually promotes cell death. Furthermore, we suggest that NF- kappaB promotes cell death through the repression of pro -survival genes and induction of pro-death genes. Chapter 3 focuses on whether oxidized 20S proteasome enhances the ubiquitin independent degradation of NF-kappaB inhibitor molecule IkappaBgamma. We clearly show that the 20S proteasome is able to degrade IkappaBgamma in an ubiquitin independent manner. Preliminary LC-MS/MS data suggests that the 20S proteasome, which displays enhanced activity towards IkappaBgamma, can undergo cysteic acid modification. We suggest that mild oxidative stress can enhance proteasome activity, while severe oxidative stress impairs proteasomal activity. Chapter 4 provides strong evidence suggesting that PA28alphabeta bound 20S proteasome is responsible for the ubiquitin independent degradation of another NF-kappaB inhibitor molecule, free IkappaBalpha. All together, this work delineates how NF-kappaB signaling can mediate cell death in response to oxidative stress, how oxidative stress can potentially increase the ubiquitin independent degradation of IkappaBgamma by enhancing the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome, and how PA28alphabeta bound 20S proteasome is responsible for the ubiquitin independent degradation of free IkappaBalpha

Identification of specific inhibitors for a dual- specificity phosphatase SSH-2
Slingshot-2 (SSH-2), one of 61 dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), has been shown to be associated with the progression of cancer and Alzheimer's disease by other studies. This DUSP activates cofilin through dephosphorylation and serves to regulate several cell functions, including growth and movement. Finding a specific inhibitor for SSH-2 may have profound impact in medicine because of its disease association. This study executed a large-scale virtual screening experiment in an attempt to find specific inhibitors for SSH-2 from a small molecule, chemical database containing over 2 million compounds, called ZINC. Results from 23 DUSP screenings, specifically SSH-2, Cdc14B, Cdc25A, Cdc25b, DUSP18, JSP-1, KAP, MKP-3, MKP-4, MKP-5, MKP-6, MKP-8, MTMR2, PAC-1,PTEN, PRL-1, PRL-3, TMDP, VHR, VHY, VHZ, VH1 , and VH3, were used to identify specific inhibitors from the large ZINC database. Eleven compounds were identified as potential specific inhibitors for SSH-2 with a disparity mean of at least 8000 and standard deviation less than 7000. Preliminary testing on the effectiveness of three compounds, ZINC03377116, ZINC04307500, and ZINC05501214, from the list of 11 identified compounds was investigated in vitro against HeLa cells. Cells treated with ZINC03377116 and ZINC06601214 showed a decrease in actin filaments. This indicates that these compounds did not inhibit the activity of SSH-2. However, cells treated with ZINC05501214 showed an increase in actin stress fibers at low compound concentrations, suggesting that the activity of SSH-2 was inhibited

Cartilage tissue engineering with human chondrocytes from osteoarthritic knees and a semi-permeable membrane
Articular cartilage is a load-bearing tissue with a limited capacity for self-repair. One approach to cartilage repair is to use tissue engineered constructs to repair defects by replacement of the absent and damaged tissue. Current therapies only target focal defects and utilize chondrocytes from intact cartilage. In the case of larger defects, or an entire joint, a tissue engineered construct is a possible future therapeutic solution. Human chondrocytes from osteoarthritic (OA) knees are potentially an abundant cell source for creating large- scale human cartilaginous constructs. Another requirement for such constructs is attainment of mechanical function, which relates directly to the biochemical properties of the tissue. The application of a semi-permeable membrane can modulate the matrix content within the construct. The aims of this dissertation were to determine the utility of chondrocytes from OA knees as a cell source for large- scale human cartilage tissue engineering and the effects of a semi-permeable membrane on the matrix properties of cartilaginous constructs. Chondrocytes from OA cartilage were expanded with growth factors and serum to levels relevant to joint-scale cartilage tissue engineering. When chondrocytes were redifferentiated with human serum, they produced chondron-like structures and matrix molecules characteristic of native cartilage. Cohesive cartilaginous tissues were formed from these chondrocytes derived from OA cartilage. To study effect of a semi-permeable membrane on matrix properties, cartilaginous constructs were formed with calf chondrocytes in a perfusion bioreactor system. The content of matrix, in particular aggrecan, was dependent on membrane pore size and porosity, with larger amounts of matrix retained in the construct when a smaller pore size and lower porosity was utilized. A compartmental model was developed to describe the effects of the membrane on the distribution of matrix in the construct and culture medium. These studies demonstrate that chondrocytes from OA cartilage are a feasible cell source for human cartilage tissue engineering, and that a semi- permeable membrane can be used to modulate matrix content in cartilaginous constructs. For clinical applications, both methods could be implemented in concert, to create large-scale cartilaginous constructs with enhanced biochemical properties, and, ultimately, a treatment solution for resurfacing of damaged or OA joints

Generation of a luciferase-based reporter for CHH and CG DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					DNA methylation ensures genome integrity and regulates gene expression in diverse eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, methylation occurs in three sequence contexts: CG, CHG and CHH. The initial establishment of DNA methylation at all three sequence contexts occurs through a process known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), in which small RNAs bound by Argonaute4 (AGO4) guide DNA methylation at homologous loci through the de novo methyltransferase DRM2. Once established, DNA methylation at each of the three sequence contexts is maintained through different mechanisms. Although some players involved in RdDM and maintenance methylation have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. To aid the comprehensive identification of players in DNA methylation, we generated a transgenic reporter system that permits genetic and chemical genetic screens in Arabidopsis.
				
				
					
						Results
					A dual 35S promoter (d35S) driven luciferase (LUC) reporter was introduced into Arabidopsis and LUCL, a line with a low basal level of luciferase activity, was obtained. LUCL was found to be a multi-copy, single-insertion transgene that contains methylated cytosines in CG, CHG and CHH contexts, with the highest methylation in the CG context. Methylation was present throughout the promoter and LUC coding region. Treatment with an inhibitor of cytosine methylation de-repressed luciferase activity. A mutation in MET1, which encodes the CG maintenance methyltransferase, drastically reduced CG methylation and de-repressed LUC expression. Mutations in AGO4 and DRM2 also de-repressed LUC expression, albeit to a smaller extent than loss of MET1. Using LUCL as a reporter line, we performed a chemical screen for compounds that de-repress LUC expression, and identified a chemical, methotrexate, known to be involved in biogenesis of the methyl donor.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					We developed a luciferase-based reporter system, LUCL, which reports both RdDM and CG maintenance methylation in Arabidopsis. The low basal level of LUCL expression provides an easy readout in genetic and chemical genetic screens that will dissect the mechanisms of RdDM and methylation maintenance.

HIGH STABILITY CURRENT SUPPLY FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
With the advent of aberration corrected electron microscopy, the need for ultra stable power supplies for controlling the currents in magnetic lenses becomes one of the limiting factors in attaining atomic resolution. When we talk about resolution and depth of the field it is always assumed that all the components of the microscope are perfect and will focus the light/electron from any point on the object to a similar unique point in the image, but this is not the case because of the lens aberrations and diffraction. Unlike light optics, where lenses are used to refract and bend light rays for image formation, in electron optics magnetic lenses are used to do the same thing.  Magnetic force is used to change the direction of electrons in the same way that a lens changes the direction of light rays. Therefore one of the limiting factors of resolution in electron microscopy is variation of the current that creates the magnetic field. With the advancement in lowering aberrations in electron microscopic lenses the need for higher stability in the lens current supplies becomes paramount. In order to achieve resolution of 0.5 angstrom level or better we need current supplies that are stable up to 1 part in 10-8. In this work, the aim is to design a high stability current supply capable of producing 1 Amp of current within 0.01 parts per million (ppm) of stability for electron microscopy. In this thesis, an ultra stable current supply was designed and simulated. The stability of the current is 0.0086 ppm/OC, over 15 minutes which is within the range that is required for this design.

Near-zero modes in superconducting graphene
Vortices in the simplest superconducting state of graphene contain very-low-energy excitations whose existence is connected to an index theorem that applies strictly to an approximate form of the relevant Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations. When Zeeman interactions are taken into account, the zero modes required by the index theorem are (slightly) displaced. Thus, the vortices acquire internal structure, which plausibly supports interesting dynamical phenomena.

Detachment of Liquid-Water Droplets from Gas-Diffusion Layers
A critical issue for optimal water management in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells at lower temperatures is the removal of liquid water from the cell. This pathway is intimately linked with the phenomena of liquid-water droplet removal from surface of the gas-diffusion layer and into the flow channel. Thus, a good understanding of liquid-water transport and droplet growth and detachment from the gas-diffusion layer is critical. In this study, liquid-water droplet growth and detachment on the gas-diffusion layer surfaces are investigated experimentally to improve the understating of water transport through and removal from gas-diffusion layers. An experiment using a sliding-angle measurement is designed and used to quantify and directly measure the adhesion force for liquid-water droplets, and to understand the droplets? growth and detachment from the gas-diffusion layers.

Molecular Evolution of Silk Genes in Mesothele and Mygalomorph Spiders, With Implications for the Early Evolution and Functional Divergence of Silk
The evolution of adaptively significant gene families is an important subject in the field of evolutionary genetics. For spiders, the gene families encoding silk proteins have received considerable attention due to the high performance capabilities of the fibers they produce. However, silk gene research has largely focused on spiders of the infraorder Araneomorphae, leaving much of the phylogenetic diversity of spiders unsampled for their silk genes. Here, I sample silk genes from spiders of the suborder Mesothelae and infraorder Mygalomorphae, which are distantly related to araneomorph spiders. Phylogenetic analyses of the spidroin genes indicate that numerous duplications occurred in the spidroin gene family after opisthotheles (mygalomorphs plus araneomorphs) split from mesotheles. However, while mesotheles appear to possess a single spidroin gene, they possess numerous copies of genes homologous to Egg Case Proteins, which are currently only known from one araneomorph species. Together these results indicate that the common ancestor of extant spiders possessed a diversity of silk genes. In addition to higher level species sampling of silk genes, I sequence repetitive and carboxy terminal regions of spidroins from all species of the trapdoor spider genus, Aliatypus. Gene tree analyses and tests of selection suggest that contrasting evolutionary forces influenced the different regions of the spidroin gene. I also investigate the expression of silk transcripts from the tarsi and silk glands of tarantulas. Tarantulas exude silk-like secretions from their tarsi, which is hypothesized to increase surface adhesion. I discovered that while known spidroin silk genes are not expressed in the tarsi, novel silk-like genes are expressed in tarantula silk glands and tarsi. Gene families of adaptive significance may also show phylogenetic signal. Here, I sample hemocyanin gene family sequences from a phylogenetically diverse sample of spider species and infer gene trees and species trees. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that despite instances of lineage specific duplication and loss of hemocyanin paralogs, hemocyanins have phylogenetic utility for most spider groups. This dissertation shows the importance of research on gene family evolution, the roles of gene families in adaptation, and the utility of gene families in phylogenetics.

Molecules and fossils reveal punctuated
diversification in Caribbean "faviid" corals
AbstractBackgroundEven with well-known sampling biases, the fossil record is key to understanding macro-evolutionary patterns. During the Miocene to Pleistocene in the Caribbean Sea, the fossil record of scleractinian corals shows a remarkable period of rapid diversification followed by massive extinction. Here we combine a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny based on three nuclear introns with an updated fossil stratigraphy to examine patterns of radiation and extinction in Caribbean corals within the traditional family Faviidae.ResultsConcatenated phylogenetic analysis showed most species of Caribbean faviids were monophyletic, with the exception of two Manicina species. The time-calibrated tree revealed the stem group originated around the closure of the Tethys Sea (17.0&#8201;Ma), while the genus Manicina diversified during the Late Miocene (8.20&#8201;Ma), when increased sedimentation and productivity may have favored free-living, heterotrophic species. Reef and shallow water specialists, represented by Diploria and Favia, originate at the beginning of the Pliocene (5 &#8211; 6&#8201;Ma) as the Isthmus of Panama shoaled and regional productivity declined.ConclusionsLater origination of the stem group than predicted from the fossil record corroborates the hypothesis of morphological convergence in Diploria and Favia genera. Our data support the rapid evolution of morphological and life-history traits among faviid corals that can be linked to Mio-Pliocene environmental changes.

Applications of visual saliency to video processing
Our understanding of the human visual system has advanced significantly over the past quarter-century. With the availability of modern computers and development of sophisticated algorithms, it is now possible to efficiently predict human attention patterns for images and video. A saliency map can easily be generated, which provides a measure of how important each portion of a scene is, with respect to the human visual system. A region with a high saliency value is more likely to be fixated upon by a human than a region with a low saliency value. In this work, we explore the application of saliency to video processing. In our first project, saliency is applied to Frame Rate Up-Conversion. By enforcing motion vector refinement only for salient regions, we reduce processing time while maintaining a high level of visual quality for the up-converted video sequence. In our second project, we propose a new method for saliency detection which considers object scale using a scale-space model. Excellent results are demonstrated, including improved performance of our saliency-based Frame Rate Up-Conversion algorithm. Finally, an experiment is conducted on the salient power of the stereoscopic depth feature using two different datasets. While local contrasts in luminance, color, orientation and motion are known to be highly salient, less is understood about local contrasts in depth. Using a mirror stereoscope for 3D display to subjects and an eye-tracking system, we measure human fixations for 2D (no depth) and 3D scenes. We determine that contrast in stereoscopic depth repels human fixations for natural scenes, while attracting it for synthetic scenes. This conflict may arise from different stages of human attention (bottom-up vs. top-down), activated by the different scene content in the two datasets

[topic, latent, model, annotation, text, datum, document, image, source, multimedia]

A family of statistical topic models for text and multimedia documents
In this thesis, we investigate several extensions of the basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for text and multimedia documents containing images and texts, video and texts, or audio-video and texts. For exploratory analysis of large-scale text document collections, we present Independent Factor Topic Models (IFTM) which captures topic correlations using linear latent variable models to directly uncover the hidden sources of correlations. Such a framework offers great flexibility in exploring different forms of source prior, and in this work we investigate 2 source distributions: Gaussian and Laplacian. When the sparse source prior is used, we can indeed visualize and give interpretation to the sources of correlations and construct a simple topic graph which can be used to navigate large-scale archives. In extending IFTM to learn correlations between latent topics of different data modalities in multimedia documents, we present a topic-regression multi-modal Latent Dirichlet Allocation (tr-mmLDA) which uses a linear regression module to learn the precise relationships between latent variables in different modalites. We employ tr-mmLDA in an image and video annotation task, where the goal is to learn statistical association between images and their corresponding captions, so that the caption data can be accurately inferred in the test set. When dealing with annotation data that act more similar to class labels, the assumption in tr-mmLDA which allows caption words in the same document to be generated from multiple hidden topics might be overly complex. For such annotation data, we propose a novel statistical topic model called sLDA-bin, which extends supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) BM07 model to handle a multi-variate binary response variable of the annotation data. We show superior image annotation and retrieval results comparing sLDA-bin with correspondence LDA BJ03 on standard image datasets. We also extend the association model for the case of image -text and video-text to perform automatic annotation of multimedia documents containing audio and video, we find that unlike cLDA, tr-mmLDA and sLDA-bin can be straight- forwardly extended to include influence from additional data modalities in predicting annotation by incorporating the latent topics from the additional modality as another set of covariates into the linear and logistic regression module respectively

Genome-wide SNP discovery in walnut with an AGSNP pipeline updated for SNP discovery in allogamous organisms
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					A genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a valuable resource in genetic research and breeding and is usually developed by re-sequencing a genome. If a genome sequence is not available, an alternative strategy must be used. We previously reported the development of a pipeline (AGSNP) for genome-wide SNP discovery in coding sequences and other single-copy DNA without a complete genome sequence in self-pollinating (autogamous) plants. Here we updated this pipeline for SNP discovery in outcrossing (allogamous) species and demonstrated its efficacy in SNP discovery in walnut (Juglans regia L.).
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The first step in the original implementation of the AGSNP pipeline was the construction of a reference sequence and the identification of single-copy sequences in it. To identify single-copy sequences, multiple genome equivalents of short SOLiD reads of another individual were mapped to shallow genome coverage of long Sanger or Roche 454 reads making up the reference sequence. The relative depth of SOLiD reads was used to filter out repeated sequences from single-copy sequences in the reference sequence. The second step was a search for SNPs between SOLiD reads and the reference sequence. Polymorphism within the mapped SOLiD reads would have precluded SNP discovery; hence both individuals had to be homozygous. The AGSNP pipeline was updated here for using SOLiD or other type of short reads of a heterozygous individual for these two principal steps. A total of 32.6X walnut genome equivalents of SOLiD reads of vegetatively propagated walnut scion cultivar &#8216;Chandler&#8217; were mapped to 48,661 &#8216;Chandler&#8217; bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (BESs) produced by Sanger sequencing during the construction of a walnut physical map. A total of 22,799 putative SNPs were initially identified. A total of 6,000 Infinium II type SNPs evenly distributed along the walnut physical map were selected for the construction of an Infinium BeadChip, which was used to genotype a walnut mapping population having &#8216;Chandler&#8217; as one of the parents. Genotyping results were used to adjust the filtering parameters of the updated AGSNP pipeline. With the adjusted filtering criteria, 69.6% of SNPs discovered with the updated pipeline were real and could be mapped on the walnut genetic map. A total of 13,439 SNPs were discovered by BES re-sequencing. BESs harboring SNPs were in 677 FPC contigs covering 98% of the physical map of the walnut genome.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					The updated AGSNP pipeline is a versatile SNP discovery tool for a high-throughput, genome-wide SNP discovery in both autogamous and allogamous species. With this pipeline, a large set of SNPs were identified in a single walnut cultivar.

A whole blood protease assay
The measurement of protease activity in blood is important for the development of novel diagnostics and for biomedical research. Presently, most protease assays require a considerable amount of sample preparation, making them time-consuming, costly and less accurate. Sample preparation also increases the complexity of these assays, precluding them from point-of-care applications. The current dissertation explores the development of a simple and rapid electrophoretic assay for measurement of protease activity directly in microliters of whole blood. This assay utilizes charge-changing fluorescent peptide substrates that produce a positively charged fluorescent product fragment upon cleavage by the target enzyme. This fragment is then rapidly separated from whole blood by electrophoresis and quantified with a fluorescent detector. Charge-changing substrates were developed for detection of alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Kinetics and specificity studies were then performed in order to make comparisons with substrates from previous assays. Electrophoretic conditions were optimized in order to achieve lower detection limits. During this optimization, various electrophoretic gel formats were explored, such as agarose and polyacrylamide slab gels. A novel technique, called polyanion focusing gel electrophoresis, was developed in order to achieve even lower detection limits. In this method, we used to polyanionic poly-L-glutamic acid-doped polyacrylamide gels to focus the fluorescent cleavage product and markedly improve the detection limits of the assay toward clinically relevant levels of protease activity. For all of this study's five target proteases, this technique was able to demonstrate detection limits that were below the normal reference levels established in the literature. Using this assay, protease activity was measured in blood, plasma, and serum samples from rats, mice, or humans that have type II diabetes, pancreatic cancer, or that are undergoing physiological shock. In these small proof-of- concept studies, the assay has been able to consistently measure both normal baseline and abnormal levels, showing that this technology may be useful for the development of novel diagnostics. This straightforward technique now allows for the rapid measurement of clinically relevant levels of protease activity in microliter volumes of whole blood, providing a useful tool for the development of novel point-of-care diagnostics

Cell proliferation along vascular islands during microvascular network growth
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Observations in our laboratory provide evidence of vascular islands, defined as disconnected endothelial cell segments, in the adult microcirculation. The objective of this study was to determine if vascular islands are involved in angiogenesis during microvascular network growth.
				
				
					
						Results
					Mesenteric tissues, which allow visualization of entire microvascular networks at a single cell level, were harvested from unstimulated adult male Wistar rats and Wistar rats 3 and 10&#8201;days post angiogenesis stimulation by mast cell degranulation with compound 48/80. Tissues were immunolabeled for PECAM and BRDU. Identification of vessel lumens via injection of FITC-dextran confirmed that endothelial cell segments were disconnected from nearby patent networks. Stimulated networks displayed increases in vascular area, length density, and capillary sprouting. On day 3, the percentage of islands with at least one BRDU-positive cell increased compared to the unstimulated level and was equal to the percentage of capillary sprouts with at least one BRDU-positive cell. At day 10, the number of vascular islands per vascular area dramatically decreased compared to unstimulated and day 3 levels.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These results show that vascular islands have the ability to proliferate and suggest that they are able to incorporate into the microcirculation during the initial stages of microvascular network growth.

Contrasts in the phylogeography of two migratory lampreys in western Europe
The ways that organisms respond to climatic oscillations depend on a wide range of factors, including life-history, behaviour, thermal preferences and physiology, and ecology. To investigate these processes, we compared the phylogeographic patterns found in Lampetra fluviatilis and Petromyzon marinus in Europe. We reanalysed all molecular data available for the mitochondrial non-coding region subunit I for both species. For L. fluviatilis, we also analyzed new and existing data for ATPase subunits 6 and 8, which cover a wider geographic range. In L. fluviatilis, both gene diversity and nucleotide diversity are at least three times higher than in P. marinus in Europe. L. 
         fluviatilis shows population differentiation in Europe and displays a deeper haplotype network, with no predominance of an ancestral haplotype, which contrasts with a star-like pattern for P. marinus. Bayesian skyline plots for the two species fit exponential models and, with estimates of the times to the most recent common ancestor in each species, indicate that P. marinus has much younger populations in Europe, supporting the hypothesis of its relatively recent migration from North America. The differences in phylogeographic structures of these two species are discussed considering the likely effects of differences in their thermal preferences, migration abilities, and times available for diversification.

Amyloid precursor protein and axonal transport
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Beta-secretase cleavage of APP is the first step in the amyloidogenic cleavage pathway that is enhanced in AD and generates amyloid beta peptides, the primary component of amyloid plaques. It is not clear how this enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP can lead to AD pathology, but research has indicated that defects in axonal transport may contribute to disease progression. Signs of axonal transport defects develop in AD and animal models of amyloid pathology well before amyloid plaques deposit. It remains unknown how increased beta-secretase cleavage affects APP axonal transport and can lead to axonal defects. This thesis project shows that enhanced beta- secretase cleavage of APP impairs APP axonal transport in vitro and leads to axonal dystrophy in vivo, suggesting that disrupted axonal transport of APP might contribute to disease pathogenesis. First, I used a fluorescently-tagged version of the APP protein to show that 1) the familial AD (FAD) Swedish mutations at the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP increase beta-secretase cleavage and inhibit APP anterograde axonal transport, and 2) an opposing mutation at the beta-secretase cleavage site decreases beta-secretase cleavage and enhances APP anterograde axonal transport. Next, I used a gene-targeted mouse model to show that 1) FAD Swedish mutant APP expressed at endogenous levels can lead to axonal dilation in the cholinergic basal forebrain, and 2) axonal dystrophy develops in the absence of amyloid plaques. Taken together, these data suggest that amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, which is enhanced in AD, disrupts APP axonal transport and leads to axonal dystrophy before amyloid plaque formation, presenting a possible mechanism contributing to AD pathogenesis

Determining the Fidelity of Protein Synthesis in vivo Utlilizing Bacillus Subtilis ComX Pheromone
Cells maintain fidelity in protein synthesis through various mechanisms including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) that are able to discriminate tRNAs and their cognate amino acids.  Substrate specificity along with editing functions of aaRSs act to prevent or remove incorrect amino acids charged onto tRNAs.  Editing domains are highly conserved and found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; knocking out the editing function of an aaRS does not seem to affect cell viability.  To determine the biological relevance of the editing domains found on aaRSs, it is essential to determine the contribution of editing to protein fidelity in vivo.  Bacillus subtilis serves as an ideal model to study this phenomenon because it possesses a small gene-enocoded, 10 amino acid pheromone peptide, ComX.  ComX is processed, modified, and secreted by B. subtilis as a signaling molecule that can easily be purified.  The amino acid sequence of ComX can be altered to some degree while maintaining cellular activity enabling different strains that produce variants of ComX pheromone to be compared for levels of mistranslation.  Ultimately future experiments will reveal the impact that editing by an aaRS has on the fidelity of protein synthesis in vivo by quantifying the rates of mistranslation in strains of B. subtilis that express an editing-defective tRNA synthetase and comparing it to levels of mistranslation to wild type strains.

Studies on the toxicity and cisplatin loading of porous Si microparticles
This thesis describes the fabrication, chemical modification, toxicity studies, and drug loading of nanostructured porous silicon for the purposes of developing a drug delivery device applied to epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The first chapter is an introductory chapter, presenting the premise of the overall research problem, the statement of purpose, and a list of questions to be understood. The second chapter focuses on a review of the relevant literature and describes the chemical and physical properties of porous silicon, the concepts and issues of current drug delivery devices and materials, applications in ovarian cancer therapeutics, and how porous silicon can address the issues regarding localized and controlled drug therapies. The third chapter explores the use of porous silicon as a material that can be delivered intraperitoneally and addresses the limitations in toxicity that can arise. Due to the toxicity, the surface of the porous silicon nanostructure can be chemically modified and rinsed to control the rate of degradation into orthosilicic acid. This chapter defines the dose range of these particles that can be delivered IP as well as discusses the effect of modifying surface chemistry to reduce toxicity. In chapter four, the concept of loading porous silicon microparticles with a therapeutic is demonstrated. The particles are loaded with cisplatin, an anti-cancer drug through a reaction instigated by the intrinsic properties of the material, trapping the drug into the pores by coating the surface with a platinum metal. Release and high localized delivery towards human ovarian cancer cells compared to free drug is discussed. The last chapter of the thesis presents a new method for attaching LyP-1 targeting peptide to porous Si microparticles for delivery towards ovarian cancer. Still much work needs to be completed in this area with regards to the targeting of LyP-1 in ovarian tumors. However, in this chapter we have demonstrated proof-of- concept that the peptide can be attached via thiol - platinum chemistry on the cisplatin loaded microparticles. The appendices mainly focus on the use of porous Si / polymer composites formed by templating to utilize the unique properties of both materials. The optical reflectivity pattern of porous Si is imprinted into mono- disperse polymer beads in the first appendix, and the second addresses the use of a malleable polymer to attempt to demonstrate a change in optical properties of the composite structure due to mechanical deformation

Effect of dabrafenib on melanoma cell lines harbouring the BRAF
V600D/R
 mutations
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Conventional therapeutic agents are largely unsatisfactory into the treatment of malignant melanoma. Recently, an innovative approach based on inhibitors of the mutated BRAF gene (which represents the most prevalent alteration in melanoma patients) appears very promising from the clinical point of view. On this regard, a new compound, dabrafenib (GSK2118436), has been demonstrated to be effective in patients carrying the BRAFV600E/K mutations. We here tested dabrafenib for its capability to inhibit cell growth on primary melanoma cell lines, established from patients' tumour tissues and carrying the BRAFV600D/R mutations.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Three melanoma cell lines were tested: M257 wild-type BRAF, LCP BRAFV600R and WM266 BRAFV600D. The MTT assays were performed using standardized approaches. To evaluate the inhibition of MAPK pathway and the consequent inhibition of cellular proliferation, the phosphorylation of ERK was examined by Western Blot analysis performed on total protein extracts from cell lines after treatment with dabrafenib.
				
				
					
						Results
					Our experiments demonstrated an effective action of Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the inhibition of MAPK pathway in melanoma cell lines carrying BRAFV600D/R mutations.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					These results could be helpful to enlarge the number of melanoma patients who may benefit of a more effective targeted treatment.

The impact of the post-complex spike pause in cerebellum-dependent learning
The cerebellum plays a fundamental role in motor movement coordination and motor error correction. By using (and associating) sensory cues present during motor errors, the cerebellum learns to anticipate motor error mistakes and execute correct movements.Damage to the cerebellum, either by trauma or disease, can impair or eliminate this ability, resulting in poor coordination and an inability to adapt or correct motor movements. In order to assist these patients, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved during error correction and adaptation learning is needed.Many groups have worked to understand how this learning occurs. One identified area that requires more understanding is at the output of the cerebellum, the synapses made by Purkinje neurons on Deep Cerebellar Nucleus neurons. The climbing fiber input to the cerebellum is believed to serve as a teaching signal during associative, cerebellum-dependent forms of motor learning. In Purkinje neurons the climbing fiber generates a complex spike, and a post-complex spike pause, that interrupts Purkinje neuron pacemaker firing. Because Purkinje neurons forminhibitory (GABAergic) synapses onto DCN neurons, coordinated pauses in Purkinje neuron firing lead to transient periods of dis-inhibition at the DCN, allowing them to be active. We hypothesize that windows of dis-inhibition relay information about the presence of a motor error to the DCN, since the DCN neurons do not actually see the climbing fiber-evoked complex spike that the Purkinje neurons see.In addition to facilitating DCN neurons to activate their downstream targets (including the Red Nucleus and other motor targets), we propose that this relief from inhibition allows for learning-related plasticity mechanisms, like mossy fiber long term potentiation (LTP), to occur at the DCN. It is not entirely understood, however, how theclimbing fiber signal is coordinating changes in cerebellar circuitry during learning.The post-complex spike pause is the final component of the climbing fiber signal transmitted by Purkinje neurons to the DCN following a motor error. The pause itself may therefore play an important role in the motor learning process.In in vitro experiments described in Chapter 3, the post-complex spike pause is reliably prolonged by two different drugs acting by two distinct, and opposing, mechanisms. The same drugs delivered in vivo, during classical eye-blink conditioning experiments described in Chapter 4, facilitated the onset of learning in this paradigm: rats receiving the drugs learned the behavioral association faster than their controlcounterparts. These results elucidate an unappreciated aspect of the climbing fiber teaching signal, the post-complex spike pause, and support a model in which synchrony of postcomplex spike pauses drives learning-related plasticity in the deep cerebellar nucleus.

Targeting RNA with small molecules : dihydropyrimidinone derivatives as novel RNA-binding ligands
The high functionality and complex three dimensional structure of RNA offers promise for the development of a wide range of RNA-targeting therapeutics. Previous studies of known RNA-friendly molecules reveal properties which promote RNA-small molecule interactions, such as distinct edges containing multiple hydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, positively charged amino groups, opportunities for pi-stacking, and molecule rigidity. TAN 1057 is a natural dipeptide antibiotic thought to inhibit translation through interactions with ribosomal RNA. Modeling studies of the dihydropyrimidinone core of TAN 1057 show multiple potential interactions with each of the RNA bases. The synthesis of potential "RNA-friendly" small molecules was carried out using derivatives of the natural core of TAN 1057. Coupling of these derivative cores with various side groups containing "RNA-friendly" properties sought to promote further RNA-small molecule interactions. Three cores in addition to the natural core were synthesized and derivatized when possible, creating a small library of compounds to be tested against functional regions of RNA. Specifically, this work sought to target functional RNA within the hepatitis C virus and thymidylate synthase RNA, and structure activity relationships were explored

Quantitative diffusion magnetic resonance imaging of the brain : validation, acquisition, and analysis
Owing to its exquisitely sensitive contrast mechanism, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful non- invasive approach for studying the microstructural properties of the human brain in vivo. Magnetic resonance images are made sensitive to the microscopic displacements of water molecules that take place in brain tissue as part of the natural, physical diffusion process. Tissue water is used as an intrinsic probe, revealing important clues into the subtle architectural features of normal and pathologic brain tissue. Typical inferences include the intravoxel orientation distribution of neuronal fibers and changes in diffusion resulting from cell swelling in acute stroke. However, despite the many important advances made in the field of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging over the past decade, quantitative inference in the human brain remains somewhat limited due to the lack of direct quantitative validation against realistic biological architectures and practical limitations in data collection due to sub-optimal design parameters and artifacts caused by patient motion during scanning. In addition, current methods to resolve neuronal fiber orientations are unable to disambiguate fiber structures at different microscopic length (size) scales. In this dissertation I present a series of studies addressing each of these important limitations, starting with a general real-time image-based technique for motion correction in magnetic resonance images and ending with a series of studies on inferring complex fiber orientations from diffusion data, addressing issues such as quantitative histological validation, optimal acquisition, and improved multi-scale analysis

Prediction Intervals in Generalized Linear Mixed Models
Three well known methods for constructing prediction intervals in a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) are the methods based on pseudo-likelihood, Laplace, and Quadrature approximations.  All three of these methods are available in the SAS procedure GLIMMIX.  We propose a new method based on a mean squared error (MSE) approximation of the empirical best predictor.  Following the approach by Harville and Kackar (1984) for a linear mixed model (LMM), we decompose the prediction error into two terms for the purpose of deriving the MSE approximation.  Unlike in the LMM case, however, closed form expressions for the two terms in the subsequent MSE approximation are not available.  We confront the computational challenge by proposing a Monte Carlo algorithm for evaluating the plug-in estimators of these two terms.  For three illustrated examples, the negative binomial, the Poisson and the Bernoulli GLMMs, numerical results show our prediction interval methodology improves the coverage probability over the three methods available in GLIMMIX.  Moreover, our results show that with bootstrap adjustments, our method achieves coverage probabilities satisfactorily close to the nominal level.

Developing Novel Interface and Signal Amplification Strategies for Study of Biological Interactions by Surface Plasmon Resonance(SPR) and SPRimaing
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been widely used as a powerful analytical technique for the study of a broad range of biomolecular interactions. With the capability of real-time detection, SPR allows convenient and nondestructive measurement of analyte concentration and binding kinetics. To improve the performance of SPR biosensing, we have developed a series of novel methods that lead to ultrasensitive detection via signal amplification by coupling inline atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to a biospecific interaction. To adapt this enhancement method to the fragile lipid membrane-based system, initiator functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been used with in situ ATRP reaction, which allows sensitive measurement of lipid membrane binding proteins. In addition, conjugated nanoparticles AuNPs and Fe3O4 NPs have been employed to enhance protein detection sensitivity with SPRimaging. A novel Au-well microarray, fabricated based on spatial variation of metal thickness, is utilized to eliminate background resonance and provide better performance.   To mimic cell membrane recognition processes, a membrane bilayer has been assembled onto a nanoglassified surface, and a synthesized water-soluble deep cavitand was incorporated into the supported lipid membrane. The incorporated cavitand retains its host properties and real-time analysis of the host:guest properties is carried out by SPR and fluorescence microscopy. To further explore the biomolecule interactions on cell membrane, we have studied the polymer growth at the lipid membrane-water interface using functional guest initiator that triggers an ATRP process. A variety of functional polymers have been grown at the lipid membrane surface, demonstrating different hydrophilicity and protein binding properties.  Mass spectrometry in combination with SPR for comprehensive protein analysis has been explored to build a new technical platform. We have designed a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM) grafted surface, which demonstrates temperature-mediated hydrophobicity for enrichment of proteins based on hydrophobic interaction. SPR quantitatively measures the binding of proteins and peptides, and the biochip is directly interfaced with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS to characterize the bound analytes. It provides outstanding results in simple steps of on-plate desalting, offering news tools for effective proteomic analysis.

Emergency Physicians' Knowledge of Cannabinoid Designer Drugs
Introduction: The use of synthetic drugs of abuse in the United States has grown in the last few years, with little information available on how much physicians know about these drugs and how they are treating patients using them. The objective of this study was to assess emergency physician (EP) knowledge of synthetic cannabinoids (SC).
      
         Methods: A self-administered internet-based survey of resident and attending EPs at a large urban emergency department (ED) was administered to assess familiarity with the terms Spice or K2 and basic knowledge of SC, and to describe some practice patterns when managing SC intoxication in the ED.
      
         Results: Of the 83 physicians invited to participate, 73 (88%) completed surveys. The terms “Spice” and “K2” for SC were known to 25/73 (34%) and 36/73 (49%) of respondents. Knowledge of SC came most commonly (72%) from non-medical sources, with lay publications and the internet providing most respondents with information. Among those with previous knowledge of synthetic cannabinoids, 25% were not aware that SC are synthetic drugs, and 17% did not know they are chemically most similar to marijuana. Among all participants, 80% felt unprepared caring for a patient in the ED who had used synthetic cannabinoids.
      
         Conclusion: Clinically active EPs are unfamiliar with synthetic cannabinoids. Even those who stated they had heard of synthetic cannabinoids answered poorly on basic knowledge questions. More education is needed among EPs of all ages and levels of training on synthetic cannabinoids. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(5):467–470.

Novel Structure Similarity-Based Methods for Identifying Drug-Like Compounds
The prediction of biologically active compounds is of great importance for high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Many computational methods in this area focus on measuring the structural similarities between chemical structures. However, traditional similarity measures are often too rigid or they consider only global similarities between structures. This study introduces two new alternative search approaches that overcome most of these limitations. First, the maximum common substructure (MCS) approach provides a more promising and flexible alternative for predicting bioactive compounds. A new backtracking algorithm for MCS is proposed here and compared to global similarity measurements. Our algorithm provides high flexibility in the matching process and is very efficient in identifying local structural similarities. To apply the MCS-based similarity measure in predictive models of biological activity of compounds, the concept of basis compounds is introduced to enable researchers to easily combine the MCS-based and traditional similarity measures with modern machine learning techniques. Our experiments on real compound datasets demonstrate that MCS complements the wellknown atom pair descriptor-based similarity measure. By combining these two measures, we propose an SVM-based algorithm for predicting the biological activities of chemical compounds with high specificity and sensitivity.In similarity search and clustering applications of very large compound sets, most methods are limited in efficiency and scalability and cannot handle today's large compound datasets with several million entries. This is particularly true for MCS-based methods and the computation complexity renders MCS infeasible for large compound dataset. The second main topic of this study addresses this time performance issue by introducing a new method for greatly accelerating similarity search and clustering of very large compound sets using embedding and indexing techniques. The method, which can be used with MCS-based as well as traditional similarity measures, embeds compounds in a high-dimensional Euclidean space and searches this space using an efficient index-aware nearest neighbor search method based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. The method can also be used to accelerate cluster analysis of large compound sets. When applied to similarity search in compound datasets as large as PubChem, we found that the method was 40-200 times faster than sequential search methods, while maintaining comparable recall rates. It also made MCS-based similarity search tractable for large compound datasets. When applied to the clustering of such compound datasets, it helped to reduce the computation time from several months to only a few days.

Molecular Analysis of Microglial Activation and Macrophage Recruitment in Murine Models of Neuroinflammation.
Microglial activation and the recruitment of peripheral macrophages are the hallmarks of CNS inflammation (reviewed in Carson et al. 2007). These two populations of effector macrophages cannot be reliably distinguished by histology, as CNS-resident microglia express most common macrophage markers. Although CNS-resident microglia and peripheral macrophages are characterized by similar expression of surface markers, a large body of research using irradiation bone marrow chimeras and flow cytometry assays have shown that these cells types are functionally distinct (Hickey and Kimura 1999, Schmid et al. 2009, Byram et al. 2004). This dissertation primarily focuses on the identification of distinct molecular pathways that regulate the process of microglial activation and macrophage recruitment in murine models of CNS inflammation.Dysregulation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway has been implicated in a variety of CNS neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, ischemia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Clarkson et al. 2004, Kim et al. 2009, Morrison et al.  1995, Morrison et al. 1998, Virgili et al. 2006). However, the CNS intrinsic functions of polyamine biosynthesis have been not completely defined due to the existence of conflicting data generated from in vitro versus in vivo models of neuroinflammation. (Tjandrawinata et al. 1994, Szabo et al. 1994, Gilad et al. 2004, Soulet and Rivest. 2003). Using a murine model of acute, self resolving CNS inflammation, we demonstrate polyamine biosynthesis plays a dual role in the maintaining tissue homeostasis and sustaining CNS inflammatory responses. In-situ hybridization analysis of brain tissue from mice sacrificed post intracerebral LPS injection revealed that both, neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells rapidly upregulated the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA expression, the rate limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. Interestingly, inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis by intracerebral injections of DFMO (a suicide inhibitor of ODC), resulted in decreased LPS-induced expression of the macrophage chemoattaractant CCL2 as well as macrophage influx into the inflamed CNS. However, polyamine inhibition had no effects of microglial activation in response to CNS inflammation. In addition to dysregulated polyamine metabolism, a factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, is the propensity of the aged CNS to mount chronic inflammatory responses. Healthy aging has been long regarded as a key factor contributing to microglial immune responses (Bilbo S.D.  2009, Frank M.J et al. 2008). To understand the differential effects of aging on the immune responses of the resident microglia and the infiltrating macrophages, we used healthy 3 months (young adult), 8 months (mid-aged adult) and 15 months (aged adult) mice to induce CNS inflammation. Using flow cytometry we showed that CNS resident microglia in the healthy, non-inflamed aged brain assumed a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by upregulated expression of MHC class II, CD40 and B7.2. In addition, the aged CNS displayed a modest increase in the infiltration by peripheral macrophages in the absence of any inflammation. Interestingly, the recruitment of peripheral macrophages to the CNS in response to CNS inflammation was not altered as a function of age. However, aging differentially affected the microglial immune responses upon LPS-induced neuroinflammation. CNS resident microglia from the aged CNS responded with a more robust upregulation of the classical pro-inflammatory activation markers, namely, MHC class II, CD40 and B7.2. In addition, we also observed an age associated increase in the upregulation of markers of alternative activation TREM2, but not mannose receptor (MMR).  No such age-associated changes were seen in the immune response of the peripheral macrophages. Lastly, we have also examined the regulation of a family of receptors, the TREM-like transcripts (TLTs) in response to inflammatory signals (LPS+IFN&#947;). The TLTs, which are members of the TREM family of receptors have been identified as putative receptors expressed by various cells of the myeloid lineage. Using in vitro and in vivo models of microglial and macrophage activation, we showed that TLT1, TLT2, TLT4 and TLT6 are differentially regulated by LPS+IFN&#947; in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our data suggests that 1.	The processes of microglial activation and recruitment of macrophages during CNS inflammation are regulated by distinct molecular mechanisms.2.	The CNS may be in active control of the immune responses mounted. Continuous, bi-directional communication between the neurons and the glial population may be critical in the shaping of glial immune responses.

[deformation, metric, curvature, opcc]

Orthogonal Partial Conformal Change
If we start with a generic nonnegatively curved metric on a Riemannian manifold and apply a deformation to the metric, then nonnegative curvature is usually not preserved. From the perspective of systems of equations, the problem of finding a metric with a prescribed curvature tensor is a highly overdetermined system. However, if every zero curvature plane is tangent to a totally geodesic flat that is fixed by a deformation, then the problem of finding the prescribed metric becomes more manageable. In 2008 Petersen and Wilhelm exploited this idea and used it to develop a deformation called Orthogonal Partial Conformal Change (OPCC). Then they successfully combined it with other deformations to put a positively curved metric on the Gromoll-Meyer sphere.    Here we introduce new examples of manifolds that admit an OPCC deformation. In particular, we generalize a result obtained by Walschap on the canonical line bundle over the complex projective space. One peculiar characteristic of one of our OPCC deformations is that they are not verifiable via the machinery developed by Petersen and Wilhelm.

research letter: Species richness, habitable volume, and species densities in freshwater, the sea, and on land
Approximately 0.5–2.0 million eukaryotic species inhabit the seas, whereas 2.0–10.0 million inhabit freshwater or the land. Much has been made of this several-fold difference in species richness but there is little consensus about the causes. Here, I ask a related question: what is the relative density of species in marine and non-marine realms? I use recent estimates of global eukaryotic species richness and published estimates of the areal coverage and depth of habitat for freshwater, marine, and terrestrial biomes. I find that the marine realm harbors ~99.83% of the habitable volume on this planet. Eukaryotic species density of the marine realm is ~3600-fold (i.e., 3-4 orders of magnitude) less than that of non-marine environments. Species–volume relationships (SVRs) help reconcile actinopterygian fish diversity with global primary productivity and emphasize the interacting roles of abiotic and biotic complexity in shaping patterns of biodiversity in freshwater, the sea, and on land. Comparing SVRs of habitats within and across realms may help resolve the factors and interactions that influence species density.

Glucocorticoid receptor directs cardiogenic mesoderm specification in murine embryonic stem cells by induction of cardiogenic factors in endoderm
Heart failure is the number one cause of death in the developed world. The progression of the disease leads to the loss of cardiomyocytes that cannot be replaced endogenously. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be differentiated in vitro into cardiomyocytes. The identification of drug-like compounds that can enrich the differentiating ESC cultures with cardiomyocyte progenitors would be beneficial to generate and expand cardiomyocyte cultures for research and clinical applications, while also serving as probes to dissect the mechanisms that control differentiation. In order to identify novel signaling proteins and pathways involved in cardiogenesis, we developed a fluorescence-based reporter system to screen chemical libraries for cardiomyocyte- inducing molecules. This was screened against a library of known drugs and small molecule pathway modulators. Active compounds included hydrocortisone and the artificial glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (Dex), which induced 10-fold increase in cardiomyocytes, confirmed by an upregulation of cardiac markers Tbx5, MEF2c, cTnt, alphaMhc, as well as the endothelial cell marker CD31. Ligand activated GR seems to upregulate a cascade of events in Foxa2+ definitive endoderm that begins with Hnf4a induction and results in Sox17 -> Cer1 upregulation. Cer1 is a known Nodal inhibitor and has been shown to promote cardiogenesis by locally blocking Nodal in committed cardiac progenitors (Flk1+, MesP1+) and allowing them to proceed with the cardiac program. Dex does so without affecting meso-endoderm lineage choice. DHP seems to alter the balance between mesoderm and neurectoderm when added early to the cultures, in a time when mesoendoderm specification occurs. Later, once the mesoendoderm has been established, it promotes cardiogenesis by inhibiting Nodal/Activin signaling at the receptor level by a mechanism yet to be elucidated - recent data suggests this might be receptor type specific. It appears to mimic the effects of the natural cardiac inducer Cer-1 by blocking Nodal/Activin/TGFb- and BMP-signaling both in cardiac progenitors, resulting in an augmentation of the a cardiac restricted Flk1+, MesP1+ progenitor population and ultimately of cardiomyocytes. Our results should contribute to a better understanding of the important cross-talk between endoderm and mesoderm progenitors in the establishment and expansion of a cardiac progenitor population

[brain, perception, activity, chaos, neuron, complex, individual]

The Physiology of Perception
When a person glimpses the face of a famous actor, sniffs a favorite food or hears the voice of a friend, recognition is instant. Within a fraction of a second after the eyes, nose, ears, tongue or skin is stimulated, one knows the object is familiar and whether it is desirable or dangerous. How does such recognition, which psychologists call preattentive perception, happen so accurately and quickly, even when the stimuli are complex and the context in which they arise varies?
      Much is known about the way the cerebral cortex, the outer rind of the brain, initially analyzes sensory messages. Yet investigations are only now beginning to suggest how the brain moves beyond the mere extraction of features-how it combines sensory messages with past experience and with expectation to identify both the stimulus and its particular meaning to the individual.
      My own group's studies, carried out over more than 30 years at the University of California at Berkeley, suggest that perception cannot be understood solely by examining properties of individual neurons, a microscopic approach that currently dominates neuroscience research. We have found that perception depends on the simultaneous, cooperative activity of millions of neurons spread throughout expanses of the cortex. Such global activity can be identified, measured and explained only if one adopts a macroscopic view alongside the microscopic one.
      There is an analogy to this approach in music. To grasp the beauty in a choral piece, it is not enough to listen to the individual singers sequentially. One must hear the performers together, as they modulate their voices and timing in response to one another.
      Our studies have led us as well to the discovery in the brain of chaos- complex behavior that seems random but actually has some hidden order. The chaos is evident in the tendency of vast collections of neurons to shift abruptly and simultaneously from one complex activity pattern to another in response to the smallest of inputs.
      This changeability is a prime characteristic of many chaotic systems. It is not harmful in the brain. In fact, we propose it is the very property that makes perception possible. We also speculate that chaos underlies the ability of the brain to respond flexibly to the outside world and to generate novel activity patterns, including those that are experienced as fresh ideas.

Colloidal Nanoparticle Assemblies: Synthesis, Surface-modification, and Applications
Assembling nanoparticles into secondary structures not only allows the combination of properties of individual nanoparticles, but also takes advantage of the interactions between neighboring nanoparticles which result in new properties that cannot be found in the individual constituents. Moreover, the formation of secondary structures from primary nanoparticles is able to effectively address many challenges that are currently limiting the direct use of colloidal nanoparticles in practical applications.Two general processes for assembling hydrophobic nanoparticles to colloidal clusters were developed in my thesis work. The first method is direct self-assembly of hydrophobic nanoparticles on host nanostructures containing high density surface thiol groups. Hydrophobic nanoparticles of various compositions and combinations can be directly assembled onto the host surface through the strong coordination interactions between metal cations and thiol groups. The resulting structures can be further conveniently overcoated with a layer of normal silica to stabilize the assemblies and render them highly dispersible in water for biomedical applications.  As the entire fabrication process does not involve complicated surface modification procedures, the hydrophobic ligands on the nanoparticles are not disturbed significantly so that they retain their original properties such as highly efficient luminescence.  Multilayer structures can be achieved by repeating the mercapto-silica coating and nanoparticle immobilization processes. Another universal strategy for direct assembly of hydrophobic nanopaticles is based on emulsion method. Nanoparticles confined in an oil droplet are self-assembled into spherical clusters upon evaporation of the low-boiling-point organic solvent.  Hollow clusters can be formed when nanoparticles and polymers are confined together in the oil droplet. For the practical application of these clusters, I further developed a post-treatment method called protected calcination to achieve well-dispersed mesoporous cluster with clean surface.  Due to the crystalline nature of the primary nanoparticles, they do not grow significantly during calcination, allowing the preservation of high surface area and formation of packing pores in the clusters. The pore sizes can be conveniently controlled by changing the size and shape of building blocks during assembly.  The as-synthesized mesoporous colloidal nanocrystal clusters are ready applied in bioseparation and photo catalysis due to their unique properties, including clean surface, high specific surface area, narrow pore size distribution, adjustable pore size and great water dispersity. As an example, mesoporous TiO2 clusters are applied in the enrichment of phosphopeptides in phosphoproteome analysis. The superior features of these mesoporous structures have been fully tested by effective enrichment of phosphopeptides from digests of standard phosphoproteins, complex protein mixtures, natural non-fat milk and human serum samples. Phosphorylated proteins also can be effectively adsorbed on these mesoporous clusters. Moreover, the different pore sizes, controlled by changing the size of building blocks, allow selective enrichment of phosphorylated proteins with various sizes based on size exclusion mechanism.It is expected that these self-assembly strategies and post-treatment methods provide the research community a highly versatile, configurable, and reproducible process to prepare various multifunctional structures, which may have wide technical applications from photonics, separation, detection, multimodal imaging, energy storage and transformation, and catalysis.

Thermal Transport in Nanoporous Materials for Energy Applications
The present study investigates the complex relationship between nanostructures and microscale thermal transport in nanoporous thin films for energy applications. It experimentally and numerically demonstrates that the effective thermal conductivity of nanoporous materials can be tuned by controlling their nanoscale architectures including porosity, pore diameter, wall thickness, nanocrystal size, and crystallinity as well as surface passivation.This study reports measurements of the cross-plane thermal conductivity of nanoporous thin films with various architectures between 25 and 315 K. Physics-based models combining phonon transport theory and effective medium approximations were developed to interpret the experimental data. Ordered mesoporous titania and silicon thin films were prepared based on evaporation-induced self-assembly method. Pure silica zeolite films were produced by either <italic>in-situ</italic> growth or by spin coating a zeolite nanoparticle suspension followed by crystal growth upon heating. These synthesized thin films were systematically and fully characterized. They featured ordered nanopores with porosity, pore diameter, and film thickness ranging from 30% to 59%, 0.5 to 25 nm, and 120 to 370 nm, respectively. Their dense matrix was amorphous, polycrystalline, or consisted of an aggregate of nanocrystals. The thermal conductivity of all synthesized nanoporous films increased monotonically with temperature within the temperature range considered. At low temperatures, the nanoporous films behaved like amorphous or strongly disordered materials and their thermal conductivity was proportional to T<super>n</super> with n varied between 1 and 2.3. At high temperatures, the thermal conductivity increased slowly with temperature or reached a plateau due to strong phonon Umklapp scattering and the saturation of phonon modes. The presence of pores in <italic>amorphous</italic> mesoporous thin films had a purely geometrical effect by reducing the cross-sectional area through which heat can diffuse. By contrast, in <italic>crystalline</italic> mesoporous thin films the presence of pores also increased phonon scattering. In addition, the film thickness generally did not affect the measured thermal conductivity. Indeed, phonon scattering by pores and by nanocrystal grain boundary dominated over boundary scattering and were identified as the dominant scattering mechanisms for nanoscale energy transport in the synthesized nanoporous films.This study further establishes that the effective thermal conductivity k<sub>eff</sub> of crystalline nanoporous silicon was strongly affected not only by the porosity f<sub>v</sub> and the system's length L<sub>z</sub> but also by the pore interfacial area concentration A<sub>i</sub>. A modified effective medium approximation combining kinetic theory and the coherent potential approximation suggested that k<sub>eff</sub> was proportional to (1-1.5f<sub>v</sub>) and inversely proportional to the sum (A<sub>i</sub>/4+1/L<sub>z</sub>). This scaling law was in excellent agreement with the thermal conductivity of nanoporous silicon predicted by molecular dynamics simulations for spherical pores as well as for cylindrical pores and vacancy defects.Finally, this study demonstrated, using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, that surface passivation added another parameter for reducing the thermal conductivity of nanostructured materials. To do so, there should be strong acoustic vibrational modes coupling between surface and passivation atoms. For example, oxygen passivation reduced the thermal conductivity of nanoporous crystalline silicon. In addition, the effect of passivation reduced with temperature because of increasing contribution of Umklapp scattering.These results could help establish new strategies to control the thermal conductivity of nanoporous materials for a wide range of applications including thermoelectric devices, supercapacitors, dye-sensitized solar cells, and hydrogen storage devices.

On geometry along grafting rays in Teichmuller space
In this work, we investigate the mid-range behavior of geometry along a grafting ray in Teichm\"{u}ller space.    The main technique is to describe the hyperbolic metric $\sigma_{t}$ at a point along the grafting ray in terms of a conformal factor $g_{t}$ times the Thurston (grafted) metric and study solutions to the linearized Liouville equation.  We give a formula that describes, at any point on a grafting ray, the change in length of a sum of distinguished curves in terms of the hyperbolic geometry at the point.  We then make precise the idea that once the length of the grafting locus is small, local behavior of the geometry for grafting on a general manifold is like that of grafting on a cylinder.  Finally, we prove that the sum of lengths of is eventually monotone decreasing along grafting rays.

Force and shape coordination in amoeboid cell motility
Cell motility plays an essential role in many physiological and pathological processes, yet we still lack information about the spatio-temporal coordination between regulatory biochemical processes and mechanics of cell migration. This dissertation has investigated the mechanics of amoeboid cell migration through intensive analysis of the traction forces exerted and shapes adopted by single Dictyostelium discoideum cells migrating chemotactically, focusing on wild-type (WT) and contractility-defective cells lacking either protein myosin II (mhcA⁻) or the myosin II essential light chains (mlcE⁻). We have developed an improved traction force cytometry method to calculate cell traction stresses which considers the finite thickness of the substrate. We have shown that the strain energy exerted by locomoting cells on the substrate evolves quasi-periodically and correlates with cell length, and thus it can be used as a quantitative indicator of the cell motility cycle. The periodicity (T) of the oscillations in the traction forces correlates strongly with the average velocity of migration (V) of cells according to the hyperbolic law V T=lambda, where the constant lambda is independent of the strain analyzed and corresponds to the average distance a cell travels per cycle. Given the quasi-periodic character of both cell length and strain energy, we have performed a phase statistical analysis to obtain a spatio-temporal representation of the canonical motility cycle divided into four phases: protrusion, contraction, retraction, and relaxation. This analysis has elucidated the role that protein myosin II plays in enhancing the kinetics of the four stages of the cycle and in controlling the spatial distribution of the traction forces regulating that process. We have used principal component analysis to dissect the mechanics of locomotion of amoeboid cells into a reduced set of dominant components of cellular traction forces and shape changes. The dominant traction force component accounts for 40% of the strain energy performed by these cells, and its temporal evolution correlates with the quasi-periodic variations of cell length and strain energy exerted on the substrate. Finally, we have developed two analytic assays for the calculation of cell traction stresses in configurations of interest to further understand the mechanosensing machinery of cells

Spectral Zeta Functions of Laplacians on Self-Similar Fractals
This thesis investigates the spectral zeta function of fractal differential operators such as the Laplacian on the unbounded (i.e., infinite) Sierpinski gasket and a self-similar Sturm--Liouville operator associated with a fractal self-similar measure on the half-line.  In the latter case, C. Sabot discovered the relation between the spectrum of this operator and the iteration of a rational map of several complex variables, called the renormalization map.  We obtain a factorization of the spectral zeta function of such an operator, expressed in terms of the Dirac delta hyperfunction, a geometric zeta function, and the zeta function associated with the dynamics of the corresponding renormalization map, viewed either as a polynomial function on the complex plane (in the first case) or (in the second case) as a polynomial on the complex projective plane.  Our first main result extends to the case of the fractal Laplacian on the unbounded Sierpinski gasket a factorization formula obtained by M. Lapidus for the spectral zeta function of a fractal string and later extended by A. Teplyaev to the bounded (i.e., finite) Sierpinski gasket and some other decimable fractals.  Furthermore, our second main result generalizes these factorization formulas to the renormalization maps of several complex variables associated with fractal Sturm--Liouville operators.  Moreover, as a corollary, in the very special case when the underlying self-similar measure is Lebesgue measure on 0, 1, we obtain a representation of the Riemann zeta function in terms of the dynamics of a certain polynomial on the complex projective plane, thereby extending to several variables an analogous result by A. Teplyaev.

Transport Pathways and Enhancement Mechanisms within Localized and Non-Localized Transport Regions in Skin Treated with Low-Frequency Sonophoresis and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate
Recent advances in transdermal drug delivery utilizing low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) have revealed that skin permeability enhancement is not homogenous across the skin surface. Instead, highly perturbed skin regions, known as localized transport regions (LTRs), exist. Despite these findings, little research has been conducted to identify intrinsic properties and formation mechanisms of LTRs and the surrounding less-perturbed non-LTRs. By independently analyzing LTR, non-LTR, and total skin samples treated at multiple LFS frequencies, we found that the pore radii (rsubscript pore) within non-LTRs are frequency-independent, ranging from 18.2 to 18.5 Å, but significantly larger than rsubscript pore of native skin samples (13.6 Å). Conversely, rsubscript pore within LTRs increase significantly with decreasing frequency from 161 to 276 Å and to ∞ (>300 Å) for LFS/SLS-treated skin at 60, 40, and 20 kHz, respectively. Our findings suggest that different mechanisms contribute to skin permeability enhancement within each skin region. We propose that the enhancement mechanism within LTRs is the frequency-dependent process of cavitation-induced microjet collapse at the skin surface, whereas the increased rsubscript pore values in non-LTRs are likely due to SLS perturbation, with enhanced penetration of SLS into the skin resulting from the frequency-independent process of microstreaming.

Ion Channeling in Direct Dark Matter Detection
The channeling of the ion recoiling after a collision with a WIMP changes the ionization signal in direct detection experiments, producing a larger signal than otherwise expected. We give estimates of the fraction of channeled recoiling ions in NaI (Tl), Si, Ge, CsI, and solid Xe, Ar and Ne crystals using analytic models produced since  the 1960's and 70's to describe channeling and blocking effects. We find that the channeling fraction of recoiling lattice nuclei is smaller than that of ions that are injected into the crystal and that it is strongly temperature dependent. Channeling is a directional effect which depends on the velocity distribution of WIMPs in the dark halo of our Galaxy and could lead to a daily modulation of the signal. We compute upper bounds to the expected amplitude of daily modulation due to channeling using our estimates of the channeling fractions. After developing the general formalism, we examine the possibility of finding a daily modulation due to channeling in the data already collected by the DAMA experiment. We find that even the largest daily modulation amplitudes would not be observable for WIMPs in the standard halo in the 13 years of data taken by the DAMA collaboration. For these to be observable the DAMA total rate should be 1/40 of what it is or the total DAMA exposure should be 40 times larger. The daily modulation due to channeling will be difficult to measure in future experiments.

Climate change in the Pacific North America region over the past millennium : development and application of novel geochemical tracers
Decadal climate variability in the Pacific North America (PNA) region largely determines the fresh-water supply of the western United States and fisheries production of the northeast Pacific Ocean through tightly coupled ocean- atmosphere interactions. Documenting the historical manifestations of these interactions, over at least the past millennium, is an essential step towards anticipating the ramifications of future climate change on these resources. This dissertation aims to extend efforts at PNA paleoclimate reconstruction through the development of interannually resolved geochemical proxy records from annually laminated marine and lacustrine sediments. Comparison with instrumental climate measurements provides constraint on the driving mechanisms for observed geochemical variability in each record. The radiocarbon content (Delta¹⁴C) of benthic foraminiferal tests in the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) proves a sensitive tracer for decadal fluctuations in vertical density structure along the southern California margin that are forced by north Pacific ocean-atmosphere interactions and tropical- midlatitude teleconnections. Enumeration of cosmopolitan benthic foraminifera in the SBB over the past 2̃50 years suggests that, on decadal time scales, the overall size and distribution of the SBB benthic foraminiferal community is largely a function of benthic carbon oxidation rate --- a property previously linked to regional surface productivity. In the terrestrial realm, stable hydrogen isotope ratios (deltaD) of plant lipid biomarkers preserved in the sediments of Swamp Lake, Yosemite National Park, were measured over the 20th century and late medieval period (1160-1432 A.D). Plant lipid deltaD exhibits a complex relationship with environmental parameters but nevertheless reflects interannual to multidecadal changes in amount of wintertime precipitation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains over the 20th century. Consistent with this observation, multidecadal deltaD variability during the late medieval generally follows that of concomitant tree ring-derived hydrologic reconstructions and captures droughts of greater severity than any witnessed in the Sierra Nevada over the past 100 years. Comparison of the two isotopic records in terms of medieval vs. modern drought severity, however, requires further constraint on the driving mechanisms for long-term shifts in plant lipid deltaD. Overall, this dissertation documents the novel application of benthic foraminiferal Delta¹⁴C and plant lipid deltaD as a means for reconstructing decadal scale PNA climate from high-resolution sedimentary archives

Expansion of human pluripotent stem cells with synthetic oolymer PMVE-alt-MA
The differentiation potential of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) promises to treat degenerative diseases with cell replacement therapies. Current culture media and substrates are not only expensive, but are undefined for clinical use because of the various known and unknown animal components that are required to promote proliferation and differentiation. Chemically defined materials are ideal substitutes for hPSC culture. This study focused on the use of PMVE-alt-MA, a synthetic polymer that was previously identified by arrayed screening technology for ex vivo hPSCs maintenance. Synthetic hydrogels and microcarriers endowed with PMVE- alt-MA moieties were used to evaluate hPSC expansion, adhesion, proliferation, colony formation and maintenance. Flow cytometry and realtime PCR were used to characterize the expression of pluripotency markers in both hydrogel and microcarrier cultures. Protein adsorption to PMVE-alt- MA was found necessary for initial cell adhesion. Enzymatic dissociation with Accutase TM was optimized to passage the embryonic stem cell line Hues9 on 9.7% semi- IPN hydrogel for 8 passages and the result was comparable to Matrigel culture. However, polymer coatings on polyacrylamide hydrogel and microcarriers were found to be insufficient for stem cell self-renewal and attachment respectively. Embryoid bodies (EBs) with uniform size and shape were observed in microcarrier suspension but no difference was found in the differentiation pattern when compared to normal suspension EB formation. Our experimental results demonstrated the potential to use PMVE-alt-MA in hPSC expansion, as expected from the arrayed screening technology

Mapping molecular flexibility of spin labeled proteins on the nanosecond and longer time scales via CW lineshape analysis and osmolyte-perturbation EPR
Proteins in solution exhibit structural fluctuations on a wide range of characteristic time scales, from fast backbone motions in the picosecond to nanosecond range to slow conformational exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time domain.  These motions can play important roles in function, thus elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying function requires experimental techniques capable of measuring motions on these time scales. Site directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR) has been established as an important tool in protein science for studying structure, identifying dynamically disordered sequences, and monitoring conformational switching triggered by chemical or physical signals in soluble and membrane-bound proteins. However, it remains to be investigated whether fast backbone motions contribute to the spectra of the spin label side chain R1 in well-ordered sequences of regular secondary structure, and how slow conformational exchange between substates can be detected at equilibrium; these are goals of this dissertation. The results from this work support a model wherein variations in the EPR spectral lineshape of R1-labeled proteins measures the amplitude of fast but constrained backbone fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale, and show that these motions are correlated with the local packing density. In addition, it is shown that osmolyte perturbation SDSL (OP-SDSL) can be used to identify conformational equilibria between substates that have characteristic lifetimes > 100 ns. The newly-developed OP-SDSL strategy was employed along with continuous wave (CW) lineshape analysis to map molecular flexibility of sperm whale myoglobin in folded and partially folded states and of core-repacking mutants of T4 lysozyme. For myoglobin, the results reproduce and extend earlier NMR studies, thus validating the OP-SDSL method and highlighting advantages of the inherent EPR time scale. For T4 lysozyme, it is found that core repacking mutations that generate internal cavities can give rise to new conformational substates in solution, despite the fact that earlier studies show that the corresponding crystal structures of WT and mutants were essentially identical. The results also show that ligand binding to some of the engineered cavities dramatically shifts the populations of substates towards the native-like state. Collectively, the results of this research advance the SDSL-EPR methodology for facile mapping of protein flexibility over the important picosecond to millisecond time domain and demonstrate the utility of the technology for exploring the molecular basis of protein function.

Innovative Porous Media Approach in Modeling Biofilm Applications, Human Eye and Nanofluid Based Heat Pipes
Biofilm is a dominant form of existence for bacteria in most natural and synthetic environments. Depending on the application area, they can be useful or harmful. They have a helpful influence in bioremediation, microbial enhanced oil recovery, and metal extraction. On the other hand, biofilms are damaging for water pipes, heat exchangers, submarines and body organs. Formation of biofilm within a porous matrix reduces the pore size and total empty space of the system, altering the porosity and permeability of the medium. This change in the pore size distribution can be quantified by expressing the porous structure utilizing a proper geometric network. A multispecies biofilm model is used along with a cell network presentation to establish permeability and porosity distribution during the biofilm formation. Moreover, biofilm formation on the surface of adsorptive media such as granular activated carbon (GAC) has been extensively used to remove organic materials, nitrogen species, heavy metals and other contaminants in wastewater treatment. In this study, a multilayer mass transfer system consisting of the reactor's bulk fluid, diffusion layer, biofilm and GAC is modeled. It is shown that porosity alteration as a result of biofilm formation within the Carbon bed has a noticeable effect on the removal efficiency. In another part of this study a phenomenological model for the biofilm resistance against antibiotic activity is analyzed. The effect of different biofilm physical attributes when exposed to antibiotic treatment is investigated. Pertinent aspects affecting the biofilm resistance characteristics such as transport of the bulk fluid within the reactor, diffusive-reactive transport of the dissolved phase into the biofilm, convective- reactive transport of particulate phase, dynamic biofilm thickness, cell detachment, Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) production and persister cell formation are analyzed and incorporated in the presented model.The next bio-related aspect considered in the thesis deals with proper modeling of the human eye response to thermal disturbances. Human eye is one of the most sensitive parts of the body when exposed to a thermal heat flux. Since there is no barrier (such as skin) to protect the eye against the absorption of an external thermal wave, the external flux can readily interact with cornea. A comprehensive thermal analysis has been performed on the eye to properly represent the physiological aspects of the eye by modeling the iris/sclera section of the eye as a porous medium to account for the effect of blood circulation through the eye tissues as well as accounting for natural convection within the anterior chamber.The last part of the thesis deals with an analytical investigation of the thermal performance of cylindrical and flat shaped heat pipes utilizing nanofluids. The liquid pressure, liquid velocity profile, temperature distribution of the heat pipe wall, temperature gradient along the heat pipe, thermal resistance and maximum heat load are obtained and the existence of an optimum nanoparticle concentration level and wick thickness in maximizing the heat removal capability of the heat pipes was established.

NANOCOMPOSITE ENABLED SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
Dye Sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising candidate for next generation photovoltaic panels due to their low cost, easy fabrication process, and relative high efficiency. Despite considerable effort on the advancement of DSSCs, the efficiency has been stalled for nearly a decade due to the complex interplay among various DSSC components. DSSCs consist of a photoanode on a conducting substrate, infiltrated dye for light absorption and electron injection, and an electrolyte to regenerate the dye. On the photoanode is a high band-gap semiconducting material, primarily of a nanostructure morphology of titanium (II) dioxide (TiO2), dye molecules whose molar absorption is typically in the visible spectrum, are adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2. To improve the current DSSCs, there are many parameters that can be investigated.In a conventional DSSC, a thick semiconducting layer such as the nanoparticle TiO2 layer induces charge separation efficiently while concurrently increasing the charge transport distance, leading the cell to suffer from more charge recombination and deterioration in charge collection efficiency. To improve on this limitation, TiO2 nanowires (NW) and nanotubes (NT) are explored to replace the nanoparticle photoanode. One-dimensional nanostructures are known for the excellent electron transport properties as well as maintaining a relatively high surface area. Hence one of the focuses of this thesis explores at using different morphologies and composition of TiO2 nanostructures to enhance electron collection efficiency.Another challenge in conventional DSSCs is the limit in light absorption of solar irradiation. Dyes are limited to absorption only in the visible range, and have a low molar absorption coefficient in the near infrared (NIR). Tuning dyes is extremely complicated and may have more disadvantages than simply by extending light harvesting. Therefore our strategy is to incorporate quantum dots to replace the dye, as well as prepare a cell for the possibility of co-sensitization, thereby extending the absorption of light in the visible and NIR.The first phase of the thesis involves the synthesis and characterization of the materials used for the cell. We successfully synthesized TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes and characterized them for the use as the photoanode. Both one-dimensional structures proved to have low resistivity, chemical stability, and high density. We also synthesized lead (II) sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) and explored at modifying theirdiameter in order to properly control their light harvesting potential into the NIR region. The electron transport kinetics proved to be faster in one-dimensional nanostructure due to their high crystallinity order and reduced elastic scattering of the electrons during transport. Furthermore, quantum dots were synthesized such that their band-gap allowed for the absorption of NIR light. This result extended the harvesting potential of our solar cell and suggests the possibility for co-sensitization in DSSCs using dye molecules and quantum dots.Hence, the focus of this thesis work is to systematically explore a transformative way to fundamentally enhance charge transport and extend light absorption by in the incorporation of two sensitizing agents.

In Search of a Low Barrier Hydrogen Bond In Proton-Bridged Diamines
.ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONIn Search of a Low Barrier Hydrogen Bond in Proton Bridged DiaminesbySepideh YaghmaeiDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, December 2008 			Dr. Thomas H. Morton, Chairperson	The term "Low Barrier Hydrogen Bond" (LBHB) is sometimes applied to describe short, strong hydrogen bonds, in which a proton is held between two basic sites having the same proton affinity.   The occurrence of LBHBs in enzyme-catalyzed reactions and proton transfer mechanisms has been debated for many years.  Creating small molecule mimics of enzymes is a well-characterized approach to probing mechanistic enzymology.  In this thesis monoprotonation of diamines has been examined, and results from gas and crystalline phases are compared.  Monoprotonated diamines can crystallize in three general motifs:  salt-bridged, cyclic, or clustered.  Primary diamines tend to form salt-bridged structures, in which one NH hydrogen bonds to the anion while another NH forms a strong hydrogen bond to the neutral amino group of another molecule.  When both amines are tertiary, NH-N strong hydrogen bonds tends to predominate over the salt bridge to the anion.  In linear tertiary diamines, the observed motif depends on chain length.  The 1:1 salt between N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl- putrescine and triflic acid (I) forms a cyclic structure, while the corresponding salt of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylcadaverine (II) forms a dimeric cluster in a tête-bêche orientation.  According to x-ray structures of (I) and (II), the triflate anion is ~ 4 &#506; away from the proton between the nitrogen atoms. The distance between the nitrogens involved in hydrogen bonding are 2.66 &#506; (I) and 2.75 &#506; (II). In both cases the NHN bond angle is almost linear.  A more accurate NH distance in (I) was found by measuring the natural abundance 15N-proton dipolar coupling constants using solid state NMR (SSNMR). To eliminate NH coupling with aliphatic protons of (I) all the hydrogen atoms except the one between the nitrogens were labeled with deuterium. The SSNMR result of I-d20 indicates that the NH distance is 1.324 &#506;; therefore, the proton has its equilibrium position in the middle.  The zero point energy wavefunctions of the one and two-dimensional potential energy surface for the transfer of the proton between two nitrogen atoms in the cation of (I) predicts the NH distance to be 1.320 and 1.328 &#506; respectively.  The vibrations associated with NHN hydrogen bond (asymmetric and symmetric stretch and the bending modes) have been observed by IR, Raman and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS), but their assignment is tentative.

Vascular Biotransport Considerations in Signaling Cascades
The vasculature of our body sensitively responds to varied biomolecules. These biomolecules are critical in triggering downstream protein synthesis, mRNA transcription, and DNA synthesis, and hence vascular homeostasis. We take these studies as an opportunity to understand the orchestra of (1) charge properties, (2) mechanical topography, (3) fluid dynamics, and (4) molecular cues to obtain a systemic and integrative understanding of the vasculature. In this work, we introduce a novel in-situ streaming potential device to quantify the electrostatic contribution of morphological changes in confluent endothelial cells (ECs). We further study the effect of mechanical topographies of nan-patterned titanium on ECs. Both species mass transfer and mechanotransduction have been suggested as the underlying mechanisms for activating ECs. However, in recent years, the dominance of mechanotransduction at the endothelium has been qualitatively demonstrated through in-vitro experiments attempting to emulate the vasculature. Thus, it remains plausible that biomolecular mass transfer may be significant in vascular signaling pathways. This work shows that a more cautious analysis that delineates endothelial mechanotransduction from mass transfer remains warranted. Having said that, we propose a novel, in-vitro experimental methodology using membrane separations technology. The methodology is flexible and robust, in that it can be used with mass transfer-limited and reaction-limited processes and can address a number of controllable scenarios. Finally, we characterize the endothelial behavior in healthy and diseased ECs by characterizing the sub-endothelium and the underlying endothelial signaling pathways. The work presented here demonstrates the vast number of biotransport factors to be captured while studying the fascinating vascular endothelium. Understanding the mechanistic factors of ECs and the triggered signaling pathways is crucial to our search for novel therapeutics.

Luminescent organosilicon polymers and sol-gel synthesis of nano-structured silica
There remains a demand for inexpensive and reliable explosive sensors to be used in a field setting for identifying specific explosives. High explosives are considered to be organic and oxidizing, a relatively rare combination that makes them tractable for molecular recognition event. For this reason, fluorescent polymers have had favorable success in their use as sensors for high explosive. Here we report the use of fluorescent, silicon based copolymers, covalently linked to a silica TLC support. A thin layer of the polymer allows for a more efficient interaction with an analyte, thus yielding enhanced detection sensitivity. The attachment of the sensing polymers onto a chromatographic support allows for the separation of a mixture, as well as the identification of multiple explosives through the use of multiple sensing polymers. Hollow hard shell particles of 200 nm and 2 micron diameter with a 10 nm thick porous silica shell have also been synthesized using polystyrene templates and a sol-gel process. The template ensures that the hollow particles are monodispersed, while the charged silica surface ensures that they remain suspended in solution for weeks. When filled with perfluorocarbon gas, the particles behave as an efficient contrast agent for color Doppler ultrasound imaging in human breast tissue. The silica shell provides unique properties compared to conventional soft shell particles employed as ultrasound contrast agents: uniform size control, strong adsorption to tissue and cells immobilizing particles at the tissue injectionsite, a long imaging lifetime, and a silica surface that can be easily modified with biotargeting ligands or small molecules to adjust the surface charge and polarity

Analyses of expressed sequence tags in Neurospora reveal rapid evolution of genes associated with the early stages of sexual reproduction in fungi
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The broadly accepted pattern of rapid evolution of reproductive genes is primarily based on studies of animal systems, although several examples of rapidly evolving genes involved in reproduction are found in diverse additional taxa. In fungi, genes involved in mate recognition have been found to evolve rapidly. However, the examples are too few to draw conclusions on a genome scale.
				
				
					
						Results
					In this study, we performed microarray hybridizations between RNA from sexual and vegetative tissues of two strains of the heterothallic (self-sterile) filamentous ascomycete Neurospora intermedia, to identify a set of sex-associated genes in this species. We aligned Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from sexual and vegetative tissue of N. intermedia to orthologs from three closely related species: N. crassa, N. discreta and N. tetrasperma. The resulting four-species alignments provided a dataset for molecular evolutionary analyses. Our results confirm a general pattern of rapid evolution of fungal sex-associated genes, compared to control genes with constitutive expression or a high relative expression during vegetative growth. Among the rapidly evolving sex-associated genes, we identified candidates that could be of importance for mating or fruiting-body development. Analyses of five of these candidate genes from additional species of heterothallic Neurospora revealed that three of them evolve under positive selection.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Taken together, our study represents a novel finding of a genome-wide pattern of rapid evolution of sex-associated genes in the fungal kingdom, and provides a list of candidate genes important for reproductive isolation in Neurospora.

Local Density of States in Graphene
Graphene consists of an atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, and its low-energy electronic excitations are well described as massless Dirac fermions with spin half and an additional pseudospin degree of freedom. Impurities in graphene can have a significant effect on the local electronic structure of graphene when the Fermi level is near the Dirac point. We study the local electronic spectra and real-space and k-space local density of state (LDOS) maps of graphene with different impurities (diagonal and non-diagonal impurity potential) such as vacancies, substitutional impurities, and adatoms. In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, we use a linearization approximation for the energy dispersion and employ a $T$-matrix formalism to calculate the Green's function. We investigate the effect of an external magnetic field on the Friedel oscillations and impurity-induced resonant states. Using a multimode description for an scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, we calculate STM currents for the substitutional and vacancies case and find that strong resonances in the LDOS at finite energies lead to the presence of steps in the STM current and suppression of the Fano factor. We also describe in detail the theory of scanning tunneling spectroscopy in graphene in the presence of adatoms, magnetic or not, with localized orbitals of arbitrary symmetry, corresponding to any given angular momentum state.We show that quantum interference effectswhich are naturally inbuilt in the honeycomb lattice, in combinationwith the orbital symmetry of the localized state, allow scanning tunnelingprobes to characterize adatoms and defects in graphene.

Transition Metal Doped ZnO as Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor
Transition metal doped ZnO has been proposed to be a Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor with room temperature ferromagnetism. High quality Mn doped ZnO was grown on R-sapphire substrate. Results support intrinsic ferromagnetism, while µB/ion number was found to be larger than maximum permitted by Hund's law. Saturation strength and coercivity field was found to be manipulated by varying Mn doping concentration. Mn/Ag co-doping was found to alter saturation strength and coercivity field as well. Ag was investigated as substitution dopant to achieve high quality p-type ZnO. With optimization of growth parameters, phase segregation was suppressed and p-type was observed. Besides being p-type, Ag doped ZnO was found to exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism. This is the first high quality demonstration of Ag doped ZnO as DMS.

Oscillating hydrogel based bioreactors for chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells
Harnessing the differentiative potential of stem cells for use in tissue repair could be a powerful therapy for debilitating diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks of stem cell based therapeutics and tissue engineering is inefficient and homogeneous stem cell differentiation. Various physico-chemical cues such as mechanical strain, chemical components, and soluble factors have been shown to direct stem cell differentiation. This study developed a multifunctional polymer-based artificial ECM replicating the multifunctional characteristics of native ECM to understand the physico-chemical cues present in a 3D environment. Specifically, we have developed a synthetic hydrogel that acts as a scaffold and bioreactor providing dynamic mechanical cues and structural support to cells. A heating device was used to induce 5̃% volume strain by applying temperature oscillations to thermoresponsive hydrogels. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were encapsulated in PMEO₂MA-OEGMA-EGDA (MO) (10 and 20% Mw PEG: 3400) and PEGDA(15% Mw PEG: 10000) hydrogels and cultured with and without TGFBeta-1. Fluorescent particle tracking was used to measure realtime volume strains of acellular and cellular hydrogels under temperature oscillations and verified with swelling ratios. hMSCs produced cartilaginous ECM as evidenced from histological and biochemical analysis. Realtime PCR was used to characterize the expression of various chondrogenic markers, indicating optimal chondrogenic differentiation with 1 hour stimulated PEGDA (15% PEG) hydrogels and TGFBeta-1. Due to static mechanical strains induced by high crosslinking density and confined heating chambers, enhanced chondrogenic differentiation was limited for all gels. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential use of polymer-based synthetic bioactuators for stem cell differentiation

Nonlinear silicon photonics from the near to mid infrared
This dissertation presents experimental work investigating silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic waveguides for parametric nonlinear optic devices. An introduction is presented in Chapter 1, including background and motivation for exploring SOI as a platform for integrated photonics, as well as an overview of integrated nonlinear optic devices. Chapter 2 discusses on-chip slow light structures based on coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROW), potentially useful for enhancing nonlinearities for efficient chip-scale nonlinear optics. Although slowing light is limited by fabrication tolerance-induced disorder, a fundamental phenomenon is observed : the Anderson localization of optical waves. Chapter 3 of the dissertation discusses four-wave mixing in SOI waveguides. SOI waveguide fabrication is described in detail, including achieving low fiber-to-chip coupling loss and waveguide propagation loss. Two approaches for dispersion engineering are presented : with the design of waveguide dimensions and with a thin-film cladding. Parametric wavelength conversion by degenerate (single-pump) FWM in these dispersion-engineered waveguides is demonstrated and discussed. Chapter 4 concerns FWM with two pumps, an approach that promises functionalities not possible with a single pump such as multiple sideband generation with self -seeded higher-order pumps. In addition to demonstrating the generation of up to ten sidebands with dual pumps and subsequent self-seeded higher order pumps, we characterize trade-offs in maximum conversion efficiency due to nondegenerate two-photon absorption (TPA). The work presented in Chapter 5 takes a novel approach to SOI parametric devices by exploring a new spectral range, toward the mid-infrared (mid-IR), near 2 Mum and beyond. We measure FWM in silicon waveguides with a pump near 2 Mum, which itself is generated by the parametric conversion of a 1300 nm seed by a 1589 nm pump in a highly -nonlinear fiber (HNLF). Fundamentally, our results show promising nonlinear properties of silicon waveguides near 2 Mum, as the generation of a record-long wavelength from a first-order parametric conversion in a waveguide of 2388 nm is achieved. This result also demonstrates promise for a new class of mid-IR light sources constructed from sources and components that are telecom-compatible, and hence widely available

Investigation of proton focusing and conversion efficiency for proton fast ignition
Recent advances in generating high energy (> 50 MeV) protons from intense laser-matter interactions has opened up new areas of research, with applications in radiography, high energy density physics, and ion-proton beam fast ignition (FI). The ability to focus the proton beam has made these applications more attractive. Fast ignition (FI) is an evolved concept of conventional inertial confinement fusion (ICF). In proton FI, a collimated beam of protons is used to deliver the necessary ignition energy to the compressed Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel capsule instead of the original concept of a beam composed of relativistic electrons. In cone-guided FI, a cone is embedded into the side of the fuel capsule where the proton source foil is placed within the cone. The cone provides a clear path to the dense core and protects the proton source foil from radiation during the compression of the capsule. The proton source foil is a segment of a hemispherical shell target used to help focus the proton beam to the core to spark ignition. The viability of proton FI requires focusing of the generated proton beam to a 40 mum spot at the compressed fuel and a laser to proton conversion efficiency of ̃15%. Here, proton focusing and the laser to proton conversion efficiency are investigated using flat foils and hemispherical shell targets. Experiments were conducted on the 200 TW short pulse laser at Los Alamos Laboratory. The 1053 nm laser pulse delivered 70-80 J on target in 500-600 fs focused by an f/8 parabolic mirror. The generated proton beam from the target was examined by placing a mesh downstream of the target, which the proton beam would pass though and then imaged with a pack of radiochromic film (RCF). A 3D ray-tracing technique was developed to determine the focal position and focal spot size of the generated proton beam by tracing the proton trajectories from the image of the mesh collected by the RCF back through the mesh to the central axis. The focal position calculated from the ray- tracing technique for the flat foils resulted in a real focus, contrasting the convention wisdom of a virtual focus. Investigation of the proton expansion from flat foils established that initially the protons are accelerated normal to the surface, due to the fact that the electrostatic sheath field generated by the escaping hot electrons is only a few microns beyond the rear surface of the foil. As time progresses and more electrons are accelerated into the target by the laser irradiation, the sheath expands away from the rear surface of the foil, developing a bell-shaped curvature. The protons are then accelerated normal to the sheath field, which is at the leading edge of the expansion. Due to the bell-shaped curvature, protons that are accelerated further away from the central axis of the laser interaction experience gradients within the expansion causing the protons to gain radial velocity, which changes the angle of divergence of the protons. The radial velocity gained by the protons affects the trajectory of the protons, resulting in a calculated real focal position when trajectories are calculated the ray-tracing technique. The trajectories of the protons are further affected by the mounting technique. When the foils are mounted to washers for stability, electrons accelerated in the foil escaped into the washer creating a field along the interior wall of washer. The field affects the proton trajectories near the wall and decreases the laser to proton conversion efficiency. With the understanding gained from the flat foil targets, proton focusing is further investigated using freestanding hemispherical shell targets. Using the 3D ray-tracing technique, the calculated focal position is determined to be located inside the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1.7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemisphere, which is less than the distance of 1.7 R (where R is the radius of curvature of the hemispherical shell) determined from proton heating experiments. With the aid of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, using the code LSP (large-scale-plasma), it was determined that proton trajectories are not straight, but actually bend near the focal region. A hot electron pressure gradient in the expansion beam sets up a radial electric field, Er ? kTehot/R, where here R is the radial scale length of the beam and kTehot is the hot electron temperature. When the radial electric field surpasses the radial acceleration force, the proton trajectories are bent away from the focal axis. The first demonstration of the generation and focusing of a proton beam from a hemispherical shell in a FI geometry is presented, where the beam is generated from a curved focusing surface, which propagates and is channeled via surface fields through an enclosed cone structure. A segment of a hemispherical shell is placed within a novel cone-shaped target. The proton focusing and conversion efficiency are calculated for the structured targets and are compared to the freestanding hemispherical shells. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are presented for further understanding. It is clearly shown that the focusing is strongly affected by the electric fields in the beam in both open and enclosed (cone) geometries, bending the trajectories near the axis. It is also reported that in the cone geometry, a sheath electric field effectively channels the proton beam through the cone tip, substantially improving the focusing properties. The sheath electric field on the wall of the cone is generated by electrons that escape the hemispherical shell and travel into the surrounding structure. Focusing of the proton beam is improved by the sheath electric field on the wall of the cone; however, the laser to proton conversion efficiency is decreased due to the hot electrons escaping the shell reducing the amount of energy available to accelerate the protons

The role of desmin in the signaling response to mechanical stretch of skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle is unique among the tissues of the body in that it can readily change its structure when subject to different mechanical conditions. Muscles can adapt to overload or disuse by hypertrophy and atrophy, to alterations in use frequency by changing fiber type and mitochondrial numbers, and to alterations in length by subtracting or adding sarcomeres (the fundamental units of muscle). Thus skeletal muscles are able to sense various mechanical stimuli and respond appropriately. This dissertation delves into the question of how muscles sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Desmin is an intermediate filament specific to skeletal muscle, whose connections between the sarcolemma, z-disks, and nuclei make it ideally located to transmit and sense stresses. Previous studies have demonstrated that stretch-induced JNK signaling is greatly attenuated in skeletal muscle from desmin knockout mice. While one could conclude that JNK signaling is directly dependent on desmin's presence, desmin has also been shown to be essential for proper nuclear strain transmission. Thus JNK signaling could alternatively depend on proper nuclear mechanics. To clarify how desmin contributes to signaling, novel methods were used to allow observation of the desmin network during eccentric contraction. Desmin filament disassembly or remodeling during eccentric exercise could be the means by which the high stresses of the eccentric contractions are transduced into a biochemical signal ; however, no such changes in the desmin network were observed. Then, to investigate whether stretch of the nucleus was a requirement for stretch-induced JNK signaling, studies of nesprin-1 knockout mice were performed. The muscle fibers from these mice exhibited reduced strain transmission to the nuclei, as in the desmin knockout. Upon stretch, however, the JNK signaling levels in the wild-type and nesprin-1 knockout muscles were the same. Thus normal stretch-induced JNK signaling can occur in the absence of normal nuclear stretch. Moreover, stretch-induced JNK signaling appears to depend on desmin, although it remains unclear how desmin mediates JNK signaling

Planar micro-optic solar concentration
Solar radiation can be converted directly into electricity with materials exhibiting a photovoltaic response. Most photovoltaic arrays use crystalline silicon cells assembled in large modules which convert <20% of incident light into electricity. More recently, multijunction solar cells, comprised of multiple semiconducting layers, have exceeded 41% conversion. The drawback to these devices is the high cost associated with materials and fabrication, making them impractical as rigid panels. The field of concentrator photovoltaics pairs these costly devices with inexpensive collection optics which reduce the amount of active cell area. Most commercial systems rely upon simple lenses or mirrors focusing through secondary optics, yet these approaches lead to hundreds of individual components which must be assembled, aligned and interconnected. In this dissertation, I present an alternative concentration approach which replaces discrete optics with a segmented lens array and common slab waveguide. Sunlight collected by each small lens aperture focuses onto mirrors placed on the waveguide surface which reflect rays at angles that guide by total internal reflection. This configuration directs light from thousands of arrayed lenses into the same waveguide which connects to a single photovoltaic cell. We refer to this approach as planar micro-optic concentration because the waveguide remains uniform in cross-section and is compatible with large-scale microfabrication techniques such as roll-to-roll processing. In the following chapters, I discuss the concept and tradeoffs associated with waveguide coupling and propagation. I present optimized systems which demonstrated >80% optical efficiency at 300x geometric concentration. In addition, I develop a self-aligned fabrication process to assemble several small-scale prototypes using commercially-available components. These systems were experimentally measured at 52.3% optical efficiency. Lastly, I show how the waveguide geometry can be exploited to increase performance and add functionality within concentrator photovoltaic systems

[neurogenesis, cdk5, ad, hippocampal, role, pathway, bmp6, defective, study]

Molecular regulators of neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment, progressive neurodegeneration, and formation of amyloid-Beta (ABeta)-containing plaques. These neuropathological features are accompanied by deregulation of signaling cascades such as the cyclin-dependent kinase- 5 (CDK5) pathway. Recent studies have revealed that neurodegeneration in AD is also associated with alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis, which may play a critical role in cognitive impairments and memory loss. The main objectives of this dissertation were to investigate the cellular mechanisms of defective hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of AD, and to examine the role of Abeta and CDK5, downstream targets, and other potential candidate regulators in the mechanisms of defective neurogenesis in AD. To address these aims, in vitro and in vivo studies designed to inhibit CDK5 activity using pharmacological and genetic approaches demonstrated that CDK5 is critical for hippocampal neurogenesis. In an in vitro model of CDK5 hyperactivation, and in the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (tg) mice, markers of neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth were reduced. I identified the CDK5 substrate collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) as a critical regulator of the effects of hyperactive CDK5 on neuronal maturation in AD. CDK5-mediated hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 contributed to reduced neurite outgrowth by disrupting microtubule polymerization, and this effect could be rescued by down-regulating CDK5 or blocking CRMP2 phoshorylation. In addition to the role of the CDK5 pathway in neurogenesis in AD, other factors may be involved. In this context, defective hippocampal neurogenesis in AD patients and in APP tg mice was accompanied by increased expression levels of bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6). In vitro studies in NPCs showed that A&beta; increased BMP6 levels, and that BMP6 treatment reduced proliferation, supporting a role for BMP6 in hippocampal neurogenesis in AD. Lastly, we found that treatment of APP tg mice with a neurotrophic compound (Cerebrolysin) rescued hippocampal neurogenesis, and this effect was associated with down-regulation of the CDK5 signaling pathway. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the CDK5 and BMP signaling cascades play important roles in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Future therapeutic approaches could target these molecular pathways to rescue defective neurogenesis in AD

Oral curcumin for Alzheimer's disease: tolerability and efficacy in a 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study
Abstract
Introduction
Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound derived from the plant Curcuma Long Lin that has been demonstrated to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as effects on reducing beta-amyloid aggregation. It reduces pathology in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a promising candidate for treating human AD. The purpose of the current study is to generate tolerability and preliminary clinical and biomarker efficacy data on curcumin in persons with AD.

Methods
We performed a 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of Curcumin C3 Complex&#174; with an open-label extension to 48 weeks. Thirty-six persons with mild-to-moderate AD were randomized to receive placebo, 2 grams/day, or 4 grams/day of oral curcumin for 24 weeks. For weeks 24 through 48, subjects that were receiving curcumin continued with the same dose, while subjects previously receiving placebo were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 grams/day or 4 grams/day. The primary outcome measures were incidence of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) at 24 weeks in those completing the study. Secondary outcome measures included the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale, levels of A&#946;1-40 and A&#946;1-42 in plasma and levels of A&#946;1-42, t-tau, p-tau181 and F2-isoprostanes in cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma levels of curcumin and its metabolites up to four hours after drug administration were also measured.

Results
Mean age of completers (n = 30) was 73.5 years and mean Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score was 22.5. One subject withdrew in the placebo (8%, worsened memory) and 5/24 subjects withdrew in the curcumin group (21%, 3 due to gastrointestinal symptoms). Curcumin C3 Complex&#174; was associated with lowered hematocrit and increased glucose levels that were clinically insignificant. There were no differences between treatment groups in clinical or biomarker efficacy measures. The levels of native curcumin measured in plasma were low (7.32 ng/mL).

Conclusions
Curcumin was generally well-tolerated although three subjects on curcumin withdrew due to gastrointestinal symptoms. We were unable to demonstrate clinical or biochemical evidence of efficacy of Curcumin C3 Complex&#174; in AD in this 24-week placebo-controlled trial although preliminary data suggest limited bioavailability of this compound.

Computational methods and analyses in comparative genomics and epigenomics
As biological problems are becoming more complex and data growing at a rate much faster than that of computer hardware, new and faster algorithms are required. This dissertation investigates computational problems arising in two of the fields : comparative genomics and epigenomics, and employs a variety of computational techniques to address the problemsOne fundamental question in the studies of chromosome evolution is whether the rearrangement breakpoints are happening at random positions or along certain hotspots. We investigate the breakpoint reuse phenomenon, and show the analyses that support the more recently proposed fragile breakage model as opposed to the conventional random breakage models for chromosome evolution. The identification of syntenic regions between chromosomes forms the basis for studies of genome architectures, comparative genomics, and evolutionary genomics. The previous synteny block reconstruction algorithms could not be scaled to a large number of mammalian genomes being sequenced; neither did they address the issue of generating non-overlapping synteny blocks suitable for analyzing rearrangements and evolutionary history of large-scale duplications prevalent in plant genomes. We present a new unified synteny block generation algorithm based on A-Bruijn graph framework that overcomes these shortcomings. In the epigenome sequencing, a sample may contain a mixture of epigenomes and there is a need to resolve the distinct methylation patterns from the mixture. Many sequencing applications, such as haplotype inference for diploid or polyploid genomes, and metagenomic sequencing, share the similar objective : to infer a set of distinct assemblies from reads that are sequenced from a heterogeneous sample and subsequently aligned to a reference genome. We model the problem from both a combinatorial and a statistical angles. First, we describe a theoretical framework. A linear-time algorithm is then given to resolve a minimum number of assemblies that are consistent with all reads, substantially improving on previous algorithms. An efficient algorithm is also described to determine a set of assemblies that is consistent with a maximum subset of the reads, a previously untreated problem. We then prove that allowing nested reads or permitting mismatches between reads and their assemblies renders these problems NP-hard. Second, we describe a mixture model-based approach, and applied the model for the detection of allele-specific methylations

DNA methylation arrays as surrogate measures of cell mixture distribution
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					There has been a long-standing need in biomedical research for a method that quantifies the normally mixed composition of leukocytes beyond what is possible by simple histological or flow cytometric assessments. The latter is restricted by the labile nature of protein epitopes, requirements for cell processing, and timely cell analysis. In a diverse array of diseases and following numerous immune-toxic exposures, leukocyte composition will critically inform the underlying immuno-biology to most chronic medical conditions. Emerging research demonstrates that DNA methylation is responsible for cellular differentiation, and when measured in whole peripheral blood, serves to distinguish cancer cases from controls.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Here we present a method, similar to regression calibration, for inferring changes in the distribution of white blood cells between different subpopulations (e.g. cases and controls) using DNA methylation signatures, in combination with a previously obtained external validation set consisting of signatures from purified leukocyte samples. We validate the fundamental idea in a cell mixture reconstruction experiment, then demonstrate our method on DNA methylation data sets from several studies, including data from a Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) study and an ovarian cancer study. Our method produces results consistent with prior biological findings, thereby validating the approach.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our method, in combination with an appropriate external validation set, promises new opportunities for large-scale immunological studies of both disease states and noxious exposures.

Search for an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of NPY2R and metabolic syndrome traits
Metabolic syndrome, which characterizes an individual's risk for cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus, can be characterized by risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. These risk factors are predicted by traits like body mass index (BMI) and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP & DBP). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene coding for the type 2 neuropeptide receptor (NPY2R) may affect BMI, SBP, and DBP since NPY2R and its ligand, peptide YY (PYY) are involved in the suppression of appetite. 703 individuals of Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American biogeographical ancestry were genotyped for three candidate SNPs, rs6851222 (G-1606A), rs6857715 (C-599T), and rs1047214 (T+ 5895C), in the NPY2R promoter and open reading frame. No significant associations were found between these SNPs and BMI, SBP, and DBP (p>0.05). However, significant associations were found between haplotypes of these SNPs and these metabolic syndrome traits. In the aforementioned order of SNPs, haplotype GTT demonstrated a pleiotropic, positive directional effect on these three traits (BMI: p=0.000375, SBP: p=0.0187, and DBP: p=0.0318). Further study of this gene locus will help determine the relationship between these SNPs and the metabolic syndrome traits of body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure

A Uniform Logic of Information Dynamics
Unlike standard modal logics, many dynamic epistemic logics are not closed under uniform substitution. A distinction therefore arises between the logic and its substitution core, the set of formulas all of whose substitution instances are valid. The classic example of a non-uniform dynamic epistemic logic is Public Announcement Logic (PAL), and a well-known open problem is to axiomatize the substitution core of PAL. In this paper we solve this problem for PAL over the class of all relational models with infinitely many agents, PAL-K_omega, as well as standard extensions thereof, e.g., PAL-T_omega, PAL-S4_omega, and PAL-S5_omega. We introduce a new Uniform Public Announcement Logic (UPAL), prove completeness of a deductive system with respect to UPAL semantics, and show that this system axiomatizes the substitution core of PAL.

Methods and devices for fabricating and assembling DNA and protein arrays for high-throughput analyses electronic resource /
Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in substantial reductions in time and cost for large scale sequencing efforts. However, the routine sequencing of individual human genomes for personalized medicine and point-of-care clinical applications will require future-generation DNA sequencing technologies to achieve unprecedented multiplexing, sample throughput and cost reductions. There is also a need for tools and techniques for interrogating proteins in a sensitive, quantitative, multiplexed and high-throughput manner. To enable further miniaturization and parallelization for such analyses, I have developed new methods and technologies for fabricating and assembling high-density DNA and protein arrays. Microfabrication techniques were utilized to construct various platforms upon which DNA and protein conjugated microbeads can be assembled. Electric and magnetic fields are employed to accelerate the assembly process and achieve unprecedented filling efficiencies. I have also demonstrated the utility of such arrays as a platform for multiplexed protein detection. In addition, I have developed a method for fabricating DNA polymer brush arrays in microfluidic devices. These arrays may be useful for enhancing the sensitivity of microarrays and the yield, efficiency and order of solid-phase DNA amplification

Daily surface temperature readings and salinity determinations for the period 1945-1957 are presented for four California shore stations: Scripps Pier, La Jolla; Balboa; Port Hueneme and Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove. The data are a part of the collection which was initiated by Dr. George F. McEwen at Scripps Pier in 1916, Balboa in 1925, Port Hueneme in 1920 and Pacific Grove in 1920. Salinity values were based on density determination by hydrometer up to July, 1954. Since that time, salinity has been determined directly by titration. Temperatures have been listed as reported by the observer, some in hundredths of degrees centigrade, others in tenths. This collection also includes data collected at three U. S. Coast Guard stations: Point Arguello, North Farallon Island and Blunts Reef for the year 1957. The U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey sends to Scripps each month daily temperature and density values from four tide stations: Neah Bay, Washington; Crescent City, Avila and Santa Monica, California. Their density values, obtained by hydrometer, have been converted to salinities and, together with the daily temperature readings, have been retabulated for inclusion in this collection for the years 1955-1957 for Neah Bay and Crescent City, and for 1956-1957 for Avila and Santa Monica. In addition to the daily values, there are tabulated the monthly and annual means, extremes, range and standard deviations of temperature and salinity.

PNL1 and PNL2 : Arabidopsis homologs of maize PAN1
PNL1 and PNL2 are the closest Arabidopsis relatives of maize pan1. pan1 and the PNL family of 11 genes encode leucine-rich repeat, receptor-like kinases, however none of these putative kinases is predicted to have actual kinase function, due to one or more amino acid substitutions in residues necessary for kinase function. Because PAN1 plays a role in subsidiary cell formation in maize, it is hypothesized that PNL1 and PNL2 are involved in stomatal formation in Arabidopsis. YFP fusions of these proteins are shown here to localize to the epidermis, and PNL2-YFP localizes with brighter points at three-cell junctions and along the points of contact between a subset of epidermal pavement cells and the adjoining guard cell pair. Because no mutant phenotype has been observed for pnl1 and because pnl2 and pnl1; pnl2 double mutants have no reproducible phenotype, a PNL2 truncated overexpression construct with the inactive kinase domain replaced by YFP was produced to be evaluated as a dominant negative mutation. To date, only a preliminary analysis of plants carrying this construct has been performed, showing no stomatal phenotype, but the construct has a similar localization pattern to that of PNL2-YFP. An analysis has also been performed on genotyping data from the isolation of the pnl1; pnl2 double mutants showing that double mutants are underrepresented in a segregating population, suggesting that there are possible transmission problems that occur in double mutant pollen

Peripheral B cell tolerance mediated by follicular dendritic cell-displayed self-antigen
The main focus of this dissertation is examining the mechanisms of peripheral B cell tolerance (Chapter 2). Generating a diverse repertoire of B cells reactive against foreign pathogens, yet tolerant to self-tissue, is imperative for an effective immune system. Random gene rearrangement at the immunoglobulin loci results in the majority of newly formed B cells being self-reactive. At an initial checkpoint in the bone marrow, a large portion of self-reactive B cells are rendered unresponsive or are eliminated through apoptosis. A second, less well-defined checkpoint in B cell tolerance occurs in the periphery as developing transitional B cells mature in the spleen. Indeed, studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have a defect at this second crucial checkpoint. Within the follicle, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) retain immune complexes and opsonized foreign antigens by Fc and complement receptors, respectively, important for B cell selection during the germinal center response. However, the selection of self-reactive B cells by self-antigen on FDCs has not been addressed. To this end, a mouse model (Cd21cremDELloxp mice) that expresses self-antigen membrane-bound Duck Egg Lysozyme (mDEL) on FDCs to study the fate of mDEL-binding B cells was generated. The results from this model show that self-antigen displayed on FDCs mediates effective elimination of self-reactive B cells at the transitional stage. A portion of Chapter 2 will be on the design and generation of the appropriate mouse model to address the question of peripheral B cell tolerance in late-stage transitional and follicular B cells in the spleen. The remaining half of the chapter will present the results of peripheral B cell tolerance studies in Cd21cremDELloxp mice. Chapter 3 presents work on various aspects of the germinal center reaction including the tools used to study GC B cells, the proteins involved in forming a GC reaction, and exploring mechanisms of eliminating self-reactive B cells that may arise in a GC reaction

Investigations into the impact of transported particles on air pollution and climate using aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry
Atmospheric aerosols have a significant impact on human health and climate, yet the full scope of these influences are only beginning to be discovered and characterized. To understand these impacts, detailed in-situ measurements of the physical, chemical, and optical properties of aerosols are necessary. Aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) provides the ability to measure chemical, physical, and optical properties of single particles in real-time. This dissertation uses ATOFMS to explore both the properties and evolution of particles as they are transported over local to global distances. The results of numerous field studies are utilized to explore the changes to these particles as they travel through the atmosphere from their source to eventual deposition. Local to regional scale transport of particles was observed from a number of perspectives in this dissertation. Particles regionally transported from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to San Diego were identified chemically as ship and truck emissions and shown to overwhelm local sources during peak transport conditions. Ship emissions were studied in detail at the Port of Los Angeles by characterizing individual ship plumes at a site adjacent to the main channel. Mobile laboratory measurements demonstrated the variation in particle concentrations and composition on a local-to-regional level. On the intercontinental-to-global scale, Asian dust was observed in precipitation samples collected in the Sierra Nevada Mountains during orographic precipitation. The incorporation of the long range-transported dust might enhance precipitation, which may alter California's precipitation patterns and water supply. The outflow of particles from Asia to North America were measured on a remote island off Korea, and the sources and aging of particles in Chinese urban, Chinese dust, and Korean air masses were compared to marine air masses. Lastly, ATOFMS studies from sites across North America, Asia, Europe, and Africa were compared to determine similarities and differences in size-resolved chemical mixing state of particles across numerous types of sampling sites, with the objective being to provide information for global climate models to more accurately represent particles. Taken together these results provide an increased understanding of particle chemistry and transport on the scale of meters-to-continents

Soft ionization of thermally evaporated hypergolic ionic liquid aerosols
Isolated ion pairs of a conventional ionic liquid, 1-Ethyl-3-Methyl-Imidazolium Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide  (Emim+Tf2N?), and a reactive hypergolic ionic liquid, 1-Butyl-3-Methyl-Imidazolium Dicyanamide (Bmim+Dca?), are generated by vaporizing ionic liquid submicron aerosol particles for the first time; the vaporized species are investigated by dissociative ionization with tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light, exhibiting clear intact cations, Emim+ and Bmim+, presumably originating from intact ion pairs. Mass spectra of ion pair vapor from an effusive source of the hypergolic ionic liquid show substantial reactive decomposition due to the internal energy of the molecules emanating from the source. Photoionization efficiency curves in the near threshold ionization region of isolated ion pairs of Emim+Tf2N? ionic liquid vapor are compared for an aerosol source and an effusive source, revealing changes in the appearance energy due to the amount of internal energy in the ion pairs. The aerosol source has a shift to higher threshold energy (~;;0.3 eV), attributed to reduced internal energy of the isolated ion pairs.  The method of ionic liquid submicron aerosol particle vaporization, for reactive ionic liquids such as hypergolic species, is a convenient, thermally ?cooler? source of isolated intact ion pairs in the gas phase compared to effusive sources.

Kevlar/vinyl ester composites with SiC nanoparticles were fabricated using hand lay-up.  Vacuum and mech. press were used to suppress porosity, increase the fiber vol. fraction and assist infiltration.  The SiC nanoparticles were examd. using TEM and TGA, and were vacuum-baked at 200° to remove adsorbed moisture, as per TGA measurement.  γ-Methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as the coupling agent and its dosage was calcd. to achieve monolayer coverage.  Both mixing routes with (1) the nanoparticles pretreated with a dil. MPS soln. in an acid 5% (vol./vol.) water-ethanol mixt. and (2) the MPS sonicated as an integral blend with the filled vinyl ester, were attempted.  FTIR was used to study the silanol condensation between MPS and the SiC nanoparticles.  X-ray inspection and x-sectioning were performed on the nanocomposite panels.  The modulus from 3-point bend tests showed an increase for both mixing routes, whereas strength increased for route (2) but decreased for route (1).  The increases in modulus and strength are likely due to the better dispersion quality as obsd. under the optical microscope and AFM, lower resin viscosity, lower porosity, and a stronger coupling/bonding between the SiC nanoparticles and vinyl ester resin as a result of the MPS addn.  The decrease in strength in route (1) was likely caused by the siloxane layer between the SiC nanoparticles assocd. with the three reactive silanols per mol. of MPS.  A 19% increase in tensile strength was found in route (2) with 1 vol.% SiC addn., which confirmed the high potential of nanoparticles in enhancing the mech. properties of structural composites.

Efficient Algorithms for Human Genetic Variation Detection using High-throughput Sequencing Techniques
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are one type of genome sequencing techniques where short DNA segments, or reads, are sequenced or sampled from genome. Compared with the traditional genome sequencing techniques, they have advantages such as low-cost and they are able to parallelize the sequencing process to produce millions of reads. These technologies have been widely used in many important problems related to human genetic variations. We mainly target three human genetic variation problems with the reads generated by HTS.It is well-known that human individuals differ from each other by 0.1%. The majority of the differences is in the form of SNPs, or Single Nucleotide Polymophisms. Haplotypes, defined as the sequences of SNPs on each chromosome of a human genome, are important for problems such as imputation of genetic variants, relatedness of human individuals, etc. A difficulty in haplotype inference is the presence of sequencing errors and a natural formulation of the problem is to infer haplotypes which are most consistent with the data from a combinatorial perspective. Unfortunately, this formulation of the haplotype assembly is known to be NP-hard. We proposed a few techniques including dynamic programming, MaxSAT and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to solve the problem optimally from different perspectives. Structural variations and in particular Copy Number Variations(CNV) have dramatic effects of disease and traits. We first proposed an efficient algorithm to detect and reconstruct CNVs in unique genomic regions,where the sequencing reads generated from HTS are mapped to a reference genome and signatures indicating the presence of a CNV are identified. Then we extend the algorithm to a much more challenging problem where CNVs are in repeat-rich regions and the reads may be mapped to multiple mapping positions. To our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to both identify and reconstruct CNVs in repeat-rich regions.Recent advances in sequencing technologies set the stage for large population based studies, in which the DNA or RNA of thousands of individuals will be sequenced. A few multiplexing schemes have been suggested, in which a small number of DNA pools are sequenced, and the results are then deconvoluted using compressed sensing or similar approaches. These methods, however, are limited to the detection of rarevariants. We provide a new algorithm for the deconvolution of DNA pools multiplexing schemes. The presented algorithm utilizes a likelihood model and linear programming and is able to genotype both low and high allele frequency SNPs with microarray genotyping and imputation.

Effects of ductile phase volume fraction on the mechanical properties of Ti-Al₃Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (MIL) composites
The mechanical properties of Ti-Al₃Ti metal-intermetallic laminate (MIL) composites have been investigated with an emphasis on the effect of residual Al at the intermetallic centerline on failure mechanisms in order to ascertain the possible success or failure of using Ti-6Al-4V instead of Ti-3Al-2.5V. MIL composites consisting of alternating layers of Ti, Al, and the intermetallic phase Al₃Ti, were synthesized by reactive foil sintering in open air. Six initially identical stacks of alternating Ti-3Al-2.5V and 1100-Al foils were processed for different lengths of time, yielding specimens with different metal and intermetallic compositions. Samples were cut from each composite plate (in layer orientations parallel and perpendicular to the intended load direction) for mechanical testing in compression and four point bending, under quasi-static and high strain-rate loading conditions. Examination of the specimens and their fracture surfaces by optical and scanning electron microscopy was performed to establish a correlation between the failure mechanisms present, composite strength, and composition. Results indicated that regardless of loading direction, cracks always initiated in the intermetallic region, and crack propagation and failure were heavily influenced by the thickness of the residual aluminum layers. There is an ideal residual aluminum volume fraction that represents the amount of ductile reinforcement able to most effectively contain the oxides and impurities between intermetallic layers and thereby improve the mechanical properties of the MIL composite

Assessment, analysis, and applications of geomagnetic paleointensity for 0-2 Ma
Earth's magnetic environment is dominated by its mainly dipolar internally generated magnetic field. The ancient field has permanently magnetized surface rocks and sediments, and these materials yield information about the field direction and strength through time. I explore recently compiled databases of paleomagnetic field intensity to assess uncertainty and bias in the data, create time-varying models of paleomagnetic axial dipole moment, and constrain field generation processes. First, I examine the statistics of absolute paleointensity data for 0-1 Ma. Virtual axial dipole moments (VADMs) from lavas are on average about 10% higher and show greater dispersion than those from archeological materials. Combining data from all igneous sources reveals an apparent bimodality in the VADM's probability density function. An analysis of stochastic models of the geomagnetic field spectrum demonstrate that the bimodality likely arises from long term changes in field strength. Both absolute and relative paleointensity data and a new penalized maximum likelihood approach are used to construct PADM2M, a time-varying model for Paleomagnetic Axial Dipole Moment (PADM) over the past 2 million years. PADM2M has a lower mean than existing VADM reconstructions but has similar long-period variability. The average axial dipole moment over 0-2 Ma is 53 ZAm² with a standard deviation of 15 ZAm². The Brunhes chron average (62 ZAm²) is higher than for earlier epochs of the Matuyama chron (48 ZAm²). PADM2M is used to study rates of change over the past two million years revealing that for periods longer than about 25 ky there is a clear asymmetry in the statistical distributions for growth versus decay rates of the dipole strength. At 36 ky period, average growth rate is about 20% larger than the decay rate, and the field spends 54% of its time decaying, but only 46% growing. These differences are not limited to times when the field is reversing, suggesting that the asymmetry is controlled by fundamental physical processes underlying all paleosecular variation. Finally, I use these techniques to make regional models of axial dipole moment (RADMs) based on geographically clustered data. These have similar long period behavior, but some major differences, especially around geomagnetic excursions

Directly observable quantities for light fields in natural hydrosols
SIO Reference 58-46. The increasing accuracy of experimental determinations of the optical absorption aid scattering properties of oceans, lakes, and harbors has necessitated -xact knowledge of the possible interrelations between these properties. The classical two-flow analysis of the light field has been an important source of such relations. While it continues to be a source of useful simple models for engineering calculations, it has become inadequate to collate the data of basic experimental research. The two-flow theory is reformulated to meet these experimental needs. The reformulation is based on the exact equations for the light field in scattering-absorbing media. The main results give useful relations between the magnitudes of the down-welling and upwelling irradiances, their depth-rates of change, and the scattering and absorption properties of natural hydrosols. The reformulations are applicable in general to arbitrarily stratified plane-parallel media.

Augmentation of alignment and differentiation in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts through use of nano-to-microscale biochemical patterns
Interactions between cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix have been shown in previous studies to play an essential role in cell mobility, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, polarity, and apoptosis. Mimicking this extracellular microenvironment with nanoscale patterns is an approach in which we can manipulate cellular responses at a molecular level for use in future tissue engineering applications or in vitro models. The use of electron beam lithography was explored in this study to create micron and submicron protein patterns in an attempt to imitate the extracellular microenvironment as a cell might sense in an in vivo setting. Submicron patterns of 250 nm and 500 nm widths with 250 nm and 500 nm spacings respectively were successfully generated out of 10k molecular weight polyethylene glycol. The study examined the effects these submicron patterns exhibited over the alignment and differentiation of C2C12 skeletal myoblasts. 5 Mum patterns showed an apparent effect on both C2C12 alignment and early differentiation compared to the unpatterned substrate. Furthermore, the study found that 250 nm patterns were significantly more effective in directing myotube alignment compared to unpatterned and 500 nm patterned substrates. The 500 nm patterns were found to have the least noticeable effects on C2C12 alignment and differentiation. The study has shown that C2C12 myotube alignment can be guided by a variety of pattern dimensions with varying degrees of success. The results also suggest that existence of focal adhesions of sizes 250 nm or less may be responsible for aiding the alignment of myotubes along the patterns

Solid-state Photochemical and Photomechanical Studies of Nanostructures and Microstructures of Anthracene Derivatives
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONSolid State Photochemical and Photomechanical Studies of Nanostructures and Microstructures of Anthracene DerivativesbyLingyan ZhuDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, December 2011Dr. Christopher Bardeen, ChairpersonPhotoactuators are devices made of photoreactive materials, which undergo shape changes to generate mechanical motions upon irradiation. Research on photoreactive materials has attracted much attention; this dissertation mainly focuses on photoreactive molecular crystals, which provide us great freedom to modify photoresponse through organic derivatization. Various anthracene derivatives were synthesized and fabricated into nano- and micro-scale structures; multiple measurements, including Atomic Force Microscopy, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, X-ray diffraction, etcetera, were applied with three goals: (1) maximize the photoresponse; (2) develop new modes of photoresponse; (3) enhance the reversibility of the photoresponse.To maximize the photoresponse, we engineered the crystal structures and packing motifs of anthracene esters with diverse-sized substituents. The largest expansion of nanorods we obtained was 25% by length. We also tried to establish the relationship between the macroscopic photoresponse and the molecular-level structural changes, so that the photoresponse of molecular crystals may be predicted based on their crystal structures. A detailed study of the photochemistry of 9-tertbutyl-anthracene-carboxylic-acid-ester (9TBAE) shows that the solid-state photoproduct is a metastable intermediate, which slowly converts into another stable equilibrium form. This is a general phenomenon among anthracene esters. Thus, the metastable structure is the key for predicting the macroscopic photoresponse. Further studies are required to obtain the crystal structure of this crucial intermediate.Our proposal to develop new modes of photoresponse is through morphology control. Using the floating drop method, we managed to grow 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9AC) into single-crystalline microribbons, which generate reversible photo-induced twisting motions under uniform irradiation. The interfacial strain between the unreacted monomer and the photodimer regions within the ribbon is the driving force for the twisting. To enhance the reversibility of the photoresponse, we tried to use the steric effects to accelerate the dissociation of the photodimer. However, only one out of six derivatives of 9AC, 10-flouro-9-anthracenecarboxylic-acid, shows the reversible photoreactivity yet with much longer response time. Attempts to self-consistently rationalize observed trends in terms of excited state lifetimes or steric effects were only partly successful.  Balancing factors like electronic relaxation, steric interactions, and crystal packing presents a challenge for engineering photoactive solid-state materials based on molecular crystals.

Patient-Specific Computer Modeling of Blood Flow in Cerebral Arteries With Aneurysm and Stent
This thesis focuses on special arterial fluid mechanics techniques
developed for patient-specific computer modeling of blood flow in cerebral arteries with aneurysm and stent. These techniques are used in conjunction with the core computational technique, which is the space–time version of the
variational multiscale (VMS) method and is called “DST/SST-VMST.” The special techniques include using NURBS for the spatial representation of the surface over which the stent mesh is built, mesh generation techniques for both the finite-
and zero-thickness representations of the stent, techniques for generating refined layers of mesh near the arterial and stent surfaces, and models for representing double stent. We compute the unsteady flow patterns in the aneurysm and investigate how those patterns are influenced by the presence of single and
double stents. We also compare the flow patterns obtained with the finite- and zero-thickness representations of the stent.

The molecular mechanisms behind receptor signaling
Cell membranes are a crucial component to the life of a cell. The membrane defines boundaries, provides structural elements, and contains proteins that serve as sensor receptors to transmit external cues across the phospholipid bilayer, either from the environment to the cell's interior or from the cytosol to a particular sub- cellular compartment. One type of proteins found spanning these lipid bilayers are known as the integral membrane proteins (IMPs). Since the dysfunction of this class of proteins has been associated with multiple disease states, a large initiative has developed to target them for new pharmaceutical therapeutics. Unfortunately, many obstacles have slowed the progression of IMP research. Some of these deterrents include low IMP over-expression levels, detergent selection, and detergent extraction. The drawbacks to studying IMPs can account for the small percentage of IMP structures that have been deposited in the PDB. Here I describe the structural and functional studies of multiple receptors from different classes. The first study includes analysis of the chemokine CCL14 and the G protein-coupled receptor CCR5 and provides new information for the potential to use chemokines in CCR5 receptor targeted HIV-1 therapeutics. Other studies presented here include the structure determination of hIMP3, the NH₂-terminal domain of a glutamate receptor, and an adenoviral protein and can aid in the development of drugs related to human neurological diseases and cancer. To speed the progression of IMP studies, there is a current need for the improvement of existing methods and for the creation of new ones. Previous studies have been compiled here to summarize the creation of histidine kinase receptor chimeras and the benefits of engineering new receptor signal transduction circuits. Moreover, I discuss the Mistic-fusion system for use in boosting IMP expression levels while maintaining functionality of the fused receptor EnvZ. Lastly, I illustrate that by combining cell-free expression, the CDL-strategy, and the use of fast NMR analysis, the structure of hIMP3 was solved within a few months. By using new techniques and determining the structures of IMPs and their signaling partners, we can gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind receptor signaling

The Structure and Dynamics of Jupiter's Magnetosphere
Eight spacecraft have now visited the Jovian system and obtained a wealth of information about Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora, both of which have proved to be very different from what we observe at the Earth. These differences are due in part to unique features such as large magnetospheric scale sizes, an internal plasma source from the moon Io, and a rapid planetary rotation period. These features have important influences on Jupiter's magnetosphere structure and dynamics, which are the focus of the three studies described in this dissertation. The first study is a survey of magnetometer data from the Jovian magnetotail to search for signatures of magnetic reconnection, an important dynamic process in planetary magnetospheres. Reconnection is thought to be predominantly internally driven at Jupiter. We have identified 249 reconnection events from the magnetometer data, and have analyzed their spatial distribution and periodicity to establish where and how often reconnection occurs at Jupiter. Results, including the location of a statistical separatrix, are compared to previous studies of flow bursts and particle anisotropies. The second study establishes a new model for relating auroral features to sources in the middle and outer magnetosphere. At Jupiter the polar aurora mapping is highly uncertain because global field models are inaccurate beyond ~30 Jovian radii. The open/closed field line boundary is also not well defined because Jupiter's main auroral emissions are associated with the breakdown of plasma corotation rather than the polar cap. Therefore our mapping model, which uses a flux equivalence calculation rather than tracing global models, provides a more precise mapping of the polar aurora and allows us to identify the size and location of Jupiter's polar cap.  In the final study, we use a large scale kinetic simulation to examine the effects of centrifugal forces arising from Jupiter's rapid rotation and non-adiabatic field line stretching in the noon to dusk local time sector. We examine changes to the pitch angle and energy distributions and conclude that the changes arising from the non-adiabatic stretching effects could account for the field dipolarization and plasma sheet thickening observed between noon and dusk.

The Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Peptoid Heparin Inhibitors
The Design and Evaluation of Peptoid Heparin InhibitorsByBruce K. FordDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, August 2011Dr. Dallas Rabinstein, Chairperson     Heparin has found use as an anticoagulant in medicine for more than 70 years1 and also plays important biological roles in addition to its involvement in the inhibition of the coagulant cascade.  Since human blood has a tendency to clot in direct contact with plastics, intravenous lines are coated with heparin to inhibit coagulation during surgery, or in kidney dialysis and in other medical situations where blood is circulated extracorporeally, where it comes into direct contact with synthetic materials. Also heparan sulfate is added to the intravenous blood supply for the same purpose.  Following a medical procedure of this type, it is nessary to reverse the effects of the heparin and heparan sulfate.  Currently is the only substances available for this purpose.  Protamine is derived from natural sources and possesses imunogenic effects.     In this study, a series of peptoids, which are analogs of peptides, have been designed, synthesized2 and studied with the goal of producing molecules with high binding affinity to heparin.  The peptoids were produced through  a solid phase synthesis methodology using a two step submonomer procedure to create each peptoid monomer unit, which were then joined together to produce a library of 18 peptoid analogs.  These peptoids were designed and synthesized with amine bearing side chains strategically located along the peptoid sequence , resulting  in cationic peptoids at neutral pH.  The amine side chains were also converted to guanidium groups post synthesis of the peptoid oligomers to yield a second family of cationic peptoids that are analogs of arginine containing peptides.  Upon synthesis of these two related libraries of peptoids, they were studied using a variety of methods including Isothermal Titration Calormemitry, Heparin Affinity Chromatography, TOF-Maldi MS, and Circular Dichroism.     The results of these studies indicated that it is possible to synthesize high-binding affinity peptoids to heparin.  It is hoped that these peptoids, by binding tightly with heparin could potentially replace the too often immunogenic side effects of protamine currently in use in medicine today. References1.

Sperner Properties of the Ideals of a Boolean Lattice
The Boolean lattice has many applications in computer science.  The subsets of a Boolean lattice that are closed downward under the ordering relation are called ideals, and their study has a rich history.  Problems of combinatorial optimization that involve the ideals of a Boolean lattice include combinational circuit design, bandwidth and wire length.A graded poset P is such that every element has an unambiguous rank, or distance from the minimal element(s) of P in its Hasse diagram.  The k-Sperner number of a graded poset P is the size of the largest subset of P with no more than k members that form a linear-ordered chain under the order relation of P.  The k-Sperner number is a fundamental parameter of P in applications.  It is easy to find if P is strongly Sperner; i.e., if, for any k, the k-Sperner number is the sum of the number of members of the k ranks that are largest in cardinality.This is an algorithmic study of the Sperner properties of the ideals I(B) of a Boolean lattice B, which form a new lattice under set inclusion.  I(B) is shown to be strongly Sperner if B has at most 6 generators.  To do this, a new algorithm, the ideal exchange algorithm, was developed, proved correct, and used in conjunction with a flow algorithm to show that I(B) has a normal flow and is therefore strongly Sperner for the cases studied.  This problem is computationally intensive (a double exponential in the number of generators) and was solved by breaking it into subcases that were run in parallel on the computer system at the University of California in Riverside.

Crystallographic, Kinetic and Computational Studies on the Reaction Mechanism of Xanthine Oxidoreductase
Xanthine oxidoreductase is a molybdenum-containing enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation on sp2 hybridized carbon centers of a broad family of substrates including purines, aldehydes and various other heterocycles.  It catalyzes the sequential hydroxylation of physiological substrate hypoxanthine to uric acid.  Deposition of uric acid crystals in human joints with accompanying inflammation is the major cause of gout. The production of reactive oxygen species by xanthine oxidase is implicated in the pathology of various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. The current study mainly involves: (1) X-ray crystallography to elucidate the orientations of various substrates at the active site of bovine xanthine oxidase.  Our observation of a single dominant productive orientation of xanthine, alternative orientations of hypoxanthine, a single nonproductive orientation of guanine and the dominant nonproductive orientation of indole-3-aldehyde correlates well with different catalytic activities of xanthine oxidase with these substrates and suggests the existence of dynamic sampling of substrate orientations at enzyme active site.  (2) X-ray crystallography to reveal the orientations of inhibitors arsenite and quercetin at the active site of xanthine oxidase.  The binding modes of these inhibitors provide structural basis for the mechanism of inhibition and insights into inhibitor design for potential therapeutics.  (3) UV-visible spectroscopy to quantitatively characterize the kinetics and catalytic specificity in the reactions of sequential hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to uric acid.  We conclude that the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase is strictly specific toward C-2 over C-8, although 6,8-dihydroxypurine is an effective substrate as xanthine both of which can be converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase.  (4) Primary deuterium kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study on the wild-type enzyme and Gln197 mutants of R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase.  The small apparent KIE on kcat suggests that hydrogen transfer step is neither rate-limiting for the wild-type enzyme nor for the mutants.  We identify gain-of-function Q197A and loss-of-function Q197E mutants.  (5) Computation of pKa of Glu802/232 of xanthine oxidoreductase and kinetic characterization of E232Q mutant.  Our data suggest that Glu802/232 has an acidic pKa upon binding of xanthine or hypoxanthine which supports its catalytic role in facilitating proton tautomerization.

To show the subfactor property, we use the jellyfish algorithm for evaluating closed diagrams.  Lastly, we show uniqueness up to conjugation of "2221".

Probing correlated electron matter with infrared magneto- optics
This dissertation describes the characterization of complex electronic materials via infrared magneto- spectroscopy. It primarily focuses on the interplane electrodynamics of the high-transition-temperature cuprate superconductors, but is extended to include semiconductors and semimetals. Due to the complex interconnection between superconductivity and magnetism, the magnetic field provides an ideal method for tuning the phase coherence of the superconducting order parameter. One component of this work examines the low-frequency response of the cuprates in the vortex state and critically assesses several theoretical descriptions of the vortex lattice dynamics. A detailed sum rule analysis in magnetic field illuminates the role of phase coherence and kinetic energy change in the formation of the superconducting condensate. The magneto-optical data for a range of cuprates are then discussed in the context of recent magneto-oscillation measurements, addressing the plausibility of coherent antinodal quasiparticle pockets on the Fermi surface. Finally, an infrared study of the proposed topological insulator Bi2Se3 utilizes a novel experimental apparatus to uncover dramatic spectral weight redistribution and electron-phonon coupling in this highly thermoelectric material

[chromium, insulin, sensitivity, serum, subject, change]

Chromium supplementation in non-obese non-diabetic subjects is associated with a decline in insulin sensitivity
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The use of chromium supplements is widespread for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus but there are conflicting reports on efficacy, possibly reflecting discrepant effects across different populations. In the present studies, we test the hypothesis that chromium supplementation raises serum chromium levels and correspondingly improves insulin sensitivity.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					A double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted on 31 non-obese, normoglycemic subjects. After baseline studies, the subjects were randomized to placebo or chromium picolinate 500 &#956;g twice a day. The primary endpoint was change in insulin sensitivity as measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included fasting lipids, blood pressure, weight, body composition measured by DXA scan.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					After 16 weeks of chromium picolinate therapy there was no significant change in insulin sensitivity between groups (p=0.83). There was, however, a strong association between serum chromium and change in insulin resistance (&#946; = -0.83, p=0.01), where subjects with the highest serum chromium had a worsening of insulin sensitivity. This effect could not be explained by changes in physiological parameters such as body weight, truncal fat and serum lipids with chromium therapy.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Chromium therapy did not improve insulin sensitivity in non-obese normoglycemic individuals. Further, subjects who have high serum chromium levels paradoxically had a decline in insulin sensitivity. Caution therefore should be exercised in recommending the use of this supplement.
				
				
					
						Trial registration
					
					The study was registered on the NIH registry (clinicaltrials.gov) and the identifier is NCT00846248

The role of synaptogenic synaptic adhesion molecules in insulin secretion
The insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells, by virtue of their pattern of protein expression and the architecture of their secretory apparatus, share many features with neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). The work described throughout this dissertation arose from the observation that the beta cells' expression of the machinery necessary for GABAergic neurotransmission makes the beta-cell cellular "phenotype" very much resemble that of an inhibitory synapse. This observation led to the overarching hypothesis that key insights into the functional maturation of beta cells could be derived from existing knowledge of the development, differentiation and maintenance of GABAergic synapses in the CNS. beta cells contain synaptic-like microvesicles of which the origin, trafficking and role are poorly understood. Here, I demonstrate that the biogenesis of these vesicles in beta cells is driven by adaptor proteins that are important for the formation of vesicular GABA transporter-containing synaptic vesicles in the CNS. Additionally, high level expression of the vesicular GABA transporter is detected in both human and rat beta cells, and a novel glucose-regulated variant of this protein is described. These findings suggest that beta-cells and neurons share molecules and mechanisms important for mediating the neuron-specific GABAergic membrane trafficking pathways that underlie synaptic vesicle formation. The synaptogenic adhesion molecules, neuroligin and neurexin, drive synapse formation in vitro and regulate the differentiation of nascent synapses into either glutamatergic or GABAergic fully mature nerve terminals. Here, the expression of those neuroligin and neurexin family members important for the maturation of GABAergic synapses, and the expression of their intracellular, GABAergic binding partners, is demonstrated in beta-cells. Neuroligin expression is revealed to be important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and evidence is presented that it may drive the proper assembly of the insulin secretory apparatus. Neuroligin is found to affect insulin secretion through a neurexin- independent mechanism in rat beta-cells. Overall, these results indicate that knowledge of the pathways that guide GABAergic synapse formation and function will aid in our understanding of beta-cell development and functional differentiation, and may yield important targets for remedying some of the beta-cell dysfunction that occurs during the pathogenesis of diabetes

Molecular surveillance for drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in clinical and subclinical populations from three border regions of Burma/Myanmar: cross-sectional data and a systematic review of resistance studies
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Confirmation of artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance in Plasmodium falciparum along the Thai-Myanmar border has inspired a global response to contain and monitor drug resistance to avert the disastrous consequences of a potential spread to Africa. However, resistance data from Myanmar are sparse, particularly from high-risk areas where limited health services and decades of displacement create conditions for resistance to spread. Subclinical infections may represent an important reservoir for resistance genes that confer a fitness disadvantage relative to wild-type alleles. This study estimates the prevalence of resistance genotypes in three previously unstudied remote populations in Myanmar and tests the a priori hypothesis that resistance gene prevalence would be higher among isolates collected from subclinical infections than isolates collected from febrile clinical patients. A systematic review of resistance studies is provided for context.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Community health workers in Karen and Kachin States and an area spanning the Indo-Myanmar border collected dried blood spots from 988 febrile clinical patients and 4,591 villagers with subclinical infection participating in routine prevalence surveys. Samples positive for P. falciparum 18 s ribosomal RNA by real-time PCR were genotyped for P. falciparum multidrug resistance protein (pfmdr1) copy number and the pfcrt K76T polymorphism using multiplex real-time PCR.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					
						Pfmdr1 copy number increase and the pfcrt K76 polymorphism were determined for 173 and 269 isolates, respectively. Mean pfmdr1 copy number was 1.2 (range: 0.7 to 3.7). Pfmdr1 copy number increase was present in 17.5%, 9.6% and 11.1% of isolates from Karen and Kachin States and the Indo-Myanmar border, respectively. Pfmdr1 amplification was more prevalent in subclinical isolates (20.3%) than clinical isolates (6.4%, odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.1 - 12.5). Pfcrt K76T prevalence ranged from 90-100%.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Community health workers can contribute to molecular surveillance of drug resistance in remote areas of Myanmar. Marginal and displaced populations under-represented among previous resistance investigations can and should be included in resistance surveillance efforts, particularly once genetic markers of artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance are identified. Subclinical infections may contribute to the epidemiology of drug resistance, but determination of gene amplification from desiccated filter samples requires further validation when DNA concentration is low.

In-Air Auditory Psychophysics and the Management of a Threatened Carnivore, the Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus)
Management criteria for preventing biologically-significant noise disturbance in large terrestrial
      mammals have not been developed based on a sound, empirical understanding of their sensory
      ecology. Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) maternal denning areas on the coastal plain of Alaska’s North
      Slope hold large petroleum reserves and will be subject to increased development in the future.
      Anthropogenic noise could adversely affect polar bears by disrupting intra-specific communication,
      altering habitat use, or causing behavioral and physiological stress. However, little is known about
      the hearing of any large, carnivorous mammal, including bears; so, management criteria currently in
      use to protect denning female polar bears may or may not be proportionate and effective. As part of a
      comprehensive effort to develop efficient, defensible criteria we used behavioral psychoacoustic
      methods to test in-air hearing sensitivity of five polar bears at frequencies between 125 Hz and 31.5
      kHz. Results showed best sensitivity between 8 and 14 kHz. Sensitivity declined sharply between 14
      and 25 kHz, suggesting an upper limit of hearing 10-20 kHz below that of small carnivores. Low
      frequency sensitivity was comparable to that of the domestic dog, and a decline in functional hearing
      was observed at 125 Hz. Thresholds will be used to develop efficient exposure metrics, which will be
      needed increasingly as the Arctic is developed and effects of disturbance are intensified by
      anticipated declines in polar bear health and reproduction associated with climate change driven sea
      ice losses.

Compounds from Sorindeia juglandifolia (Anacardiaceae) exhibit potent anti-plasmodial activities in vitro and in vivo
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Discovering new lead compounds against malaria parasites is a crucial step to ensuring a sustainable global pipeline for effective anti-malarial drugs. As far as we know, no previous phytochemical or pharmacological investigations have been carried out on Sorindeia juglandifolia. This paper describes the results of an anti-malarial activity-driven investigation of the fruits of this Cameroonian plant.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Air-dried fruits were extracted by maceration using methanol. The extract was fractionated by flash chromatography followed by column chromatography over silica gel, eluting with gradients of hexane-ethyl acetate mixtures. Resulting fractions and compounds were tested in vitro against the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistant strain W2, against field isolates of P. falciparum, and against the P. falciparum recombinant cysteine protease falcipain-2. Promising fractions were assessed for acute toxicity after oral administration in mice. One of the promising isolated compounds was assessed in vivo against the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The main end-products of the activity-guided fractionation were 2,3,6-trihydroxy benzoic acid (1) and 2,3,6-trihydroxy methyl benzoate (2). Overall, nine fractions tested against P. falciparum W2 and falcipain-2 were active, with IC50 values of 2.3-11.6 &#956;g/ml for W2, and 1.1-21.9 &#956;g/ml for falcipain-2. Purified compounds (1) and (2) also showed inhibitory effects against P. falciparum W2 (IC50s 16.5 &#956;M and 13.0 &#956;M) and falcipain-2 (IC50s 35.4 and 6.1 &#956;M). In studies of P. falciparum isolates from Cameroon, the plant fractions demonstrated IC50 values of 0.14-19.4 &#956;g/ml and compounds (1) and (2) values of 6.3 and 36.1 &#956;M. In vivo assessment of compound (1) showed activity against P. berghei strain B, with mean parasitaemia suppressive dose and curative dose of 44.9 mg/kg and 42.2 mg/kg, respectively. Active fractions were found to be safe in mice after oral administration of 7 g/kg body weight.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Fractions of Sorindeia juglandifolia and two compounds isolated from these fractions were active against cultured malaria parasites, the P. falciparum protease falcipain-2, and in a rodent malaria model. These results suggest that further investigation of the anti-malarial activities of natural products from S. juglandifolia will be appropriate.

Directional phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the SR protein ASF/SF2
Constitutive and alternative splicing are necessary steps in mRNA processing that contributes to a diverse proteome, but errors in splicing machinery lead to numerous degenerative diseases and cancers. The SR proteins are essential splicing factors that control splice-site selection as well as the transport of processed mRNA for translation. The SR proteins consist of one or two RNA- binding domains and an RS domain rich in arginine-serine repeats. Processive poly-phosphorylation of the RS domain by splicing kinases such as SRPK1, and subsequent dephosphorylation by nuclear phosphatases such as PP1 regulate cellular localization and mRNA processing functions of SR proteins. In this thesis we focused on SRPK1-catalyzed phosphorylation and PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the prototypical SR protein, ASF/SF2. Our overall goals were to establish whether these two enzymes add and remove phosphates in a directional manner and determine specific sequence elements that control initiation and sequential modification of the RS domain of ASF/SF2. A novel LysC digestion phosphomapping technique was developed to observe the order of phosphorylation. We found that SRPK1 phosphorylates ASF/SF2 in a C->N direction preferring to initiate between S221-S225 of ASF/ SF2, but the kinase can adapt to other start sequences if the initiation box is made dysfunctional through mutation. Having established that SRPK1 is a directional kinase with a strong preference for phosphorylation initiation in the center of the RS domain, we then explored structural determinants within the enzyme and substrate that might control this novel mechanism of phosphorylation. Mutagenesis within the RS domain revealed that an uninterrupted RS/SR stretch is necessary for initiation preference. Using the SRPK1:ASF/SF2 complex as a guide for mutagenesis studies, we found that RRM2 (but not RRM1) and N'-RS1 of the RS domain of ASF/SF2 form important and cooperative contacts with SRPK1 that guide directional phosphorylation. Thus, while RS/SR content in the RS domain alone governs regiospecificity, directional phosphorylation is controlled by distal structural elements offered by RRM2 and the docking groove in SRPK1. To analyze how phosphates are removed from the RS domain of ASF/SF2, we studied the dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the nuclear protein phosphatase, PP1. PP1 was found to remove phosphates from the RS1 segment of ASF/SF2 in a single kinetic phase suggesting that a common rate- limiting step exists. Deletion analyses indicated that RRM1 protects against dephosphorylation. Through digestion mapping, we found that PP1 dephosphorylates ASF/SF2 in an N->C direction and that removal of RRM1 leads to random dephosphorylation. These data suggest that while RRM2 is important for the directional phosphorylation of ASF/SF2, RRM1 is important for the directional dephosphorylation. Overall, the data suggest that the opposing directional activities of SRPK1 and PP1 may foster the preferential modification of serines in the C-terminal end of RS1 in ASF/SF2, with possible biological relevance

Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording for Areal Densities Beyond 1Tbit/in^2
The magnetic recording industry is keeping up with the ultra high demand of high capacity hard drives by improving the areal recording densities of these devices. Such imposing advancement in utilization and performance is due to successive scaling in the geometrical dimensions of the device. This progression has been truncated by the fundamental limit known as the superparamagnetic limit which occurs when bits of digital data are aggressively decreased that ambient heat demagnetizes them, leading to loss of the stored data.To overcome this problem, the use of large magnetic anisotropy energy density alloys is compulsory, but the write fields that are required by these alloys are prohibitively large, rendering these media effectively unwritable. Fortunately, heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) enables the use of the smallest possible thermally stable grains, irrespective of the ultra-large intrinsic anisotropy. HAMR exploits the substantial drop of coercivity of ferromagnetic material to a level attainable by the magnetic writing head when the disk temperature is elevated close to its Curie level, consequently enhancing the areal density dramatically. In this thesis, a theoretical and experimental study underlying the design of a heating element based on ultra-high-efficiency near-field optics suitable for extending areal densities beyond 1Tbit/in2 is presented. Near-field apertures are fabricated using focused ion beam milling and characterized via near-field optical microscopy. A breakthrough in the localization of adequate amount of heat into a 30 nm spot size is reported. HAMR demonstration is presented utilizing a customized spinstand tester, and the associated issues are thoroughly addressed.

[saliency, tracking, discriminant, target, feature, algorithm, tracker, attention, background, mechanism]

Biologically plausible algorithms for motion saliency and tracking
Biologically plausible algorithms for motion saliency and visual tracking are proposed. First a spatiotemporal saliency algorithm, based on a center-surround framework, is introduced. The algorithm is inspired by biological mechanisms of motion-based perceptual grouping, and extends a discriminant formulation of center-surround saliency previously proposed for static imagery. Under this formulation, the saliency of a location is equated to the power of a pre-defined set of features to discriminate between the visual stimuli in a center and a surround window, centered at that location. The features are spatiotemporal video patches, and are modeled as dynamic textures, to achieve a principled joint characterization of the spatial and temporal components of saliency. The combination of discriminant center-surround saliency with the modeling power of dynamic textures yields a robust, versatile, and fully unsupervised spatiotemporal saliency algorithm,applicable to scenes with highly dynamic backgrounds and moving cameras. The related problem of background subtraction is treated as the complement of saliency detection, by classifying non-salient (with respect to appearance and motion dynamics) points in the visual field as background. The algorithm is tested for background subtraction on challenging sequences, and shown to substantially outperform various state of the art techniques. The biological plausibility of the framework is demonstrated by showing that it can predict human psychophysics data on salient moving stimuli. Second, a biologically inspired discriminant object tracker is proposed. It is argued that discriminant tracking is a consequence of top-down tuning of the saliency mechanisms that guide the deployment of visual attention. The principle of discriminant saliency is then used to derive a tracker that implements a combination of center-surround saliency, a spatial spotlight of attention, and feature based attention. In this framework, the tracking problem is formulated as one of continuous target-background classification, implemented in two stages. The first, or learning stage, combines a focus of attention mechanism and bottom-up saliency to identify a maximally discriminant set of features for target detection. The second, or detection stage, uses a feature based attention mechanism and a target-tuned top-down discriminant saliency detector, to detect the target. Overall, the tracker iterates between learning discriminant features from the target location in a video frame and detecting the location of the target in the next. The statistics of natural images are exploited to derive an implementation which is conceptually simple and computationally efficient. The saliency formulation is also shown to establish a unified framework for classifier design, target detection, automatic tracker initialization, and scale adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed discriminant saliency tracker outperforms a number of state-of-the art trackers in the literature. Finally, it is hypothesized that such saliency based tracking model is biologically plausible and could underlie tracking in primate visual systems. This hypothesis, denoted the {\it saliency hypothesis for tracking}, is tested for plausibility in three ways. First, results from a set of human behavior studies on the connection between saliency and tracking show that 1) successful tracking requires targets to be salient, 2) tracking success has a dependence on feature contrast, between target and background, that is remarkably similar to that of saliency, and 3) as for widely accepted models of saliency, tracking also involves a center-surround mechanism with the involvement of a localized background. Second, saliency based tracking is shown to be neurophysiologically plausible, by derivation of a tracking network that is fully compliant with the standard physiological models of V1 and MT, and with what is known about attentional control in area LIP. Finally, this network is shown to 1) replicate electrophysiological recordings from MT neurons in feature-based attention experiments, and 2) explain the results of the psychophysics experiments

Algebraic Tori and Essential Dimension
Interest in essential dimension problems has been growing over the past decade. In part, it is because the idea of essential dimension captures quite elegantly the problem of parametrizing a wide range of algebraic objects. But perhaps more, it is because the study of essential dimension requires most of the algebraic arsenal. What began as a problem in Galois cohomology and representation theory now has connections to versal torsors, stacks, motives, birational geometry, and invariant theory. This exposition will focus on just a small bit of this theory: algebraic tori and how they can be used to help us calculate the essential p-dimension for PGLn.

Goal-Directed Biped Stepping and Push Recovery with Momentum Control
Stepping is a fundamental skill involved in common bipedal activities such as walking, foot repositioning and step recovery. Generating these stepping activities requires characters that are controllable and responsive. This dissertation describes a goal-directed controller and a momentum supervisor for characters that perform both believable and robust steps under a variety of conditions. The desired step is controlled by generic task goals, namely step position and step duration, which allow characters to step in arbitrary directions with various speeds. These high-level goals guide desired changes of a character's center of mass and swing foot over the duration of the step. To produce realistic and flexible steps, the desired time-varying values for the center of mass and the swing foot are derived from parametric curve generators which are built on empirical evidence extracted from motion capture data of stepping. Controlling these two values along with regulation of angular momentum in vertical axis produces characters with coordinated full-body movements including natural arm swings during stepping. The system can guide a character with purposeful, directable steps to precisely follow user-specified foot placements and to carefully control the character's position and orientation. Moreover, the same system can be used to create protective steps to maintain the character's balance in response to a perturbation. A novel supervisory routine automatically chooses when and where to step with a straightforward goal: removing all linear and angular momenta induced by a push. In contrast to previous methods for push recovery using the inverted pendulum, the proposed momentum supervisor introduces a nice clean formulation to determine when and where to step and provides better prediction of a character's stability under perturbations by considering both linear and angular momenta of the character. In addition to responding to a perturbation, this dissertation also presents an approach for characters that anticipate impending perturbations with examples taken from human motion capture data. I focus on the motion interpolation sysnthesis technique which allows a character to anticipate by blocking or dodging a threat coming from a variety of directions and targeting any part of the body.

We present three studies of human visual reasoning exploring the extent to which novice and expert subjects are able to judge the quality of and understand cluster analysis and dimensionality reduction stimuli. We then investigate whether humans are able to learn how cluster analysis algorithms function simply through interacting with them rapidly across diverse data sets.

Development of a strain rate sensitive ice material model for hail ice impact simulation
A strain rate sensitive ice material model for hail ice impact simulation has been developed using previously measured ice compressive strength at impact strain rates. Simulations were conducted in Abaqus/Explicit and were compared to experimental tests of simulated hail ice impacts on a force measurement bar apparatus. The force history during the ice impact event studied shows agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data. The overall trend of peak force versus kinetic energy was also compared, showing a strong correlation. The scatter in the measured ice compressive strength data was incorporated in the modeling approach and was found to represent the scatter in the sphere impact experimental test data. Observations of the failure progression of simulated hail impact were made using high speed video images during impact tests. The simulation- predicted failure progression was found to qualitatively match with the failure behavior exhibited by actual ice spheres, thereby indicating that the model represents some of the basic physics and phenomena that govern ice impacts

Sensory-Motor Integration and Control
Two leading vertebrate animal models were used in studying sensory motor integration and control: 1 Red eared turtles-Trachemys scripta elegans, (Locomotion) and 2 Humans- Homo sapiens (Cognition). 1 Locomotion: Survival depends on locomotor circuitry being driven by a variety of sensory inputs, such that movements can be adapted dynamically to survive against life threatening changes in the environment. With the first study, an examination of the forelimb/hindlimb kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) motor patterns that underlie aquatic lateral turning behavior in red-eared turtles was made. Rotation-evoked turning provides a convenient experimental platform in which to investigate the brainstem commands that underlie locomotor form selection (e.g., forward swimming vs. back-paddling) in a limbed vertebrate. 2 Cognition: Many vertebrates are also capable of cognitively driven fine motor movements. Humans for example, use their hands to manipulate objects as a result of a complex blend of sensory-motor control mechanisms. A second study was conducted in order to determine how intentional cognitive processes might be strengthened and/or automatic responses may be weakened using the Simon task (Simon et al., 1973). The results support the conclusion that the reduction of the latency in responding to incongruent stimuli from training might be due to route suppression/gating of irrelevant location information. Fine motor movements can work separately, synergistically, or in parallel with locomotor production. Future studies can expand our current perspective by learning how these sub-systems function together.

PXN-2, a C. elegans homolog of the extracellular matrix peroxidase peroxidasin, is important for embryonic morphogenesis
Peroxidasin is a member of the myeloperoxidase family of proteins but has novel domains and localization relative to other peroxidases. Peroxidasin is thought to function as a secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) protein; however, the function of peroxidasin in vivo is still poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans is known to possess two homologues of peroxidasin, pxn-1 and pxn-2. Our lab has identified the first mutants in pxn-2. We present phenotypic evidence suggesting that peroxidasin functions in the specialized ECM, basement membrane. pxn-2 null mutants develop bulges and constrictions in the epidermis following two-fold stage and arrest at the three-fold stage, demonstrating pxn-2 is required for developmental elongation. Similar morphogenetic defects in other mutants are known to result from failures in forming or maintaining proper adhesion of epidermal cells to underlying muscle tissue. We have observed progressive detachment of body wall muscles from the epidermis in pxn- 2 and progressive dystrophy of the pharynx. These defects are consistent with a role for PXN-2 in strengthening basement membranes. PXN-2 is required for proper functioning of cholinergic synapses, though it does not play a large role in axon guidance. We have observed a role for PXN-2 in inhibition of axonal regeneration. We find that missense mutations affecting the peroxidase catalytic domain cause the strongest loss of function, suggesting that the peroxidase activity of pxn-2 may be required for the developmental and maintenance roles of PXN-2. We also demonstrate that pxn-1 acts non-redundantly to pxn-2 and suggest a potential antagonistic interaction between the homologues

Accretion, Sediment Deposition and Suspended Sediment Dynamics in Mugu Lagoon, a Southern California Coastal Estuary
Vertical accretion, the aggregation of material on a wetland surface, depends on organic matter accumulation and mineral sedimentation. We measured suspended sediment concentrations by total suspended solids (TSS), sediment deposition and vertical accretion rates in four marsh zones in the central basin of Mugu Lagoon, a salt marsh dominated by <italic>Salicornia pacifica</italic>. Mean TSS was 21±1 mg l<super>-1</super> (Mean±SE) between February and May 2012, which is within the middle of the range of other salt marshes. Mean sediment deposition ranged from 0.00 g m<super>-2</super> day<super>-1</super> to 1.29 g m<super>-2</super> day<super>-1</super>, which is in the low end of the range of other salt marshes. No net vertical accretion was observed between August 2011 and May 2012. Our results indicate that for high and high-mid marsh zones, sedimentation was highest adjacent to the creek. Interestingly, organic matter concentration in TSS varied with tide height, but mineral content did not. While more data are needed to confirm whether these trends occur over longer time periods, our study is one of the first to characterize spatial and temporal variation in sediment dynamics for a salt marsh dominated by <italic>Salicornia</italic> species.

These liquid fuels included ethanol, methanol, aviation fuel (JP-8), liquid synthetic fuel derived from natural gas, and a blend of JP-8 and synfuel. The study examined combustion during acoustic excitation conditions in a closed waveguide in which the droplet was situated at or near a pressure node, where the droplet experienced the greatest effects of velocity perturbations. A two-speaker configuration provided the means to produce a fairly symmetric acoustic  field in the waveguide. In the absence of acoustic excitation, values of the measured droplet burning rate constant, K, were generally consistent with available values for the different fuels explored. During acoustic excitation of a burning droplet situated in the vicinity of a pressure node, the flame orientation was consistent with the sign of an acoustic radiation force acting on the burning system, creating conditions where the flame deflection switched, depending on the relative location of the droplet with respective to the pressure node. The acceleration associated with the acoustic radiation force was estimated by measuring the degree of deflection that the flame underwent relative to an unforced flame. Although overall there were no significant variations in the measured K values with changing acoustic excitation, in some cases, locally increased K values were observed to be associated with larger measured acoustic accelerations. This study also examined the extinction characteristics and made preliminary estimations of the extinction strain rates of the different fuels.The non-reactive flow study investigated the mixing behavior and characteristics of dynamic flow structures of shear-coaxial nitrogen jets under varying flow conditions, with and without the presence of pressure and velocity perturbations due to acousticforcing transverse to the flow direction. The role of injector geometry was examined using two shear-coaxial injectors with different outer to inner jet area ratios,  and different inner jet post thickness to inner jet diameter ratios. Flow conditions under chamber pressures spanning high subcritical pressures (reduced pressure or chamber to critical pressure ratio, Pr, of 0.44) to nearcritical pressures (Pr = 1.05), with varying outer to inner jet momentum flux ratios (J = 0.1- 21), and maximum or minimum amplitude in the pressure perturbation at the jet axis location were considered. The inner and outer jet temperatures were independently controlled so that the inner and outer flows were in liquid and gaseous states at Pr = 0.44, respectively, and in transcritical and supercritical states at Pr = 1.05, respectively. Back-lighting the coaxial jets resulted in a silhouette of the dense inner jet, which appeared as a dark column. This distinguished it from the outer jet, and thus, enabled high speed images to capture its flow dynamics. Dark-core length pertains to the axial length of the unmixed portion of the inner flow; such measurements were used to indicate the extent of mixing under the different flow conditions and injector geometries. In general, for baseline flows at both Pr values, the dark-core length to inner jet diameter ratio decreased with increasing J and inner post thickness, and with decreasing area ratio. During a maximum pressure perturbation forcing condition, the ratio of forced to baseline flow dark-core length, which stayed constant, around unity, for J < 10 for the small area ratio, thick post injector flows, also underlined the influence of geometry on the mixing and response to external pressure disturbances. A basic application of proper orthogonal decomposition on the intensity fluctuation of the high-speed images enabled the extraction of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the dominant flow structures that existed in the flow field during exposure to acoustic forcing. With increasing J, the flow response to forcing depended on the injector geometry. A comparison of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the baseline flows and their corresponding acoustically forced flows revealed that for the J > 5 flows of the large area ratio, thin inner post injector, the baseline flow behavior was retained in the forced flow, thereby indicating a flow regime with strong instabilities and which was less sensitive to external pressure disturbances. On the other hand, the J > 5 flows of the small area ratio, thick inner post injector showed strong response at the forcing frequency.

[impurity, moral, ritual]

Impurity and gender in the Hebrew Bible : ideological intersections in the books of Leviticus, Ezekiel and Ezra
The central argument of my dissertation is based on two bodies of literature. The first area deals with the categorization of biblical impurity and is articulated most effectively by Jonathan Klawans. Klawans demonstrates that there are two ideologies of purity in the Hebrew Bible, ritual and moral. The state of ritual impurity pertains to the human body, is unavoidable, temporary and can be cleansed. Conversely, moral impurity is incurred through behavioral choice. Three grave sins cause moral impurity : murder, violation of sexual prohibitions, and apostasy. No purifying activities can reverse the impurity. Moral impurity, unlike ritual impurity, has severe consequences. Either the land will expel its inhabitants or violators will be subject to krt, being cut off from their people. I have also based my argument on source critical scholarship and linguistic studies that demonstrates that priestly writing predates the writing of the exilic prophet Ezekiel. I show that Ezekiel distorts priestly ideas about women and their blood by intentionally confusing the categories of ritual and moral impurity. Furthermore, in the still later book of Ezra- Nehemiah, the word ndh, a term that previously referred only to menstruation, a cause of ritual impurity, has now come to refer to the general contamination of moral impurity. In Ezra, this transition has occurred, perhaps, unbeknownst to its author. Thus, there is a correlation between the ideologies of impurity in the Bible (ritual and moral) and an increasingly negative portrayal of women and their bodies. For prophetic writers, moral impurity became an effective way to speak about the experience of exile (586/7-530). The deity literally expelled the people for their sins. To the detriment of women, a regularly occurring bodily function, which even the pre-exilic priestly writers viewed as normative, became the symbol of the people's gravest transgressions

Angiogenic potential of prostate tumor stem cells
There is currently no successful therapy available for prostate cancer that has progressed to the androgen- deprivation-resistant metastatic stage. It is believed that after androgen-deprivation ablation of the bulk of differentiated cells that make up the tumor, the hormone- deprivation resistant tumor regrows from a subpopulation of prostate epithelial cells. The role of these prostate tumor stem cells (PrTuSC) in neovascularization is of primary interest, due to the direct correlation of angiogenesis with metastasis. In vitro analyses examined the angiogenic potential of the PrTuSC cells isolated from early prostate tumors. These included an angiogenic antibody array assay of media conditioned by the cells to discover which angiogenic proteins they expressed. Proteins expressed at high levels in vitro were Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) and Interleukin-8 (Il-8). Next, the functional angiogenic properties of these proteins were verified by endothelial cell migration and proliferation assays. ELISA was done to quantify protein levels. Development of an in vivo methodology to study paracrine effects of TIMP-1 and Il-8 on neovascularization was undertaken. This methodology entails the implantation of alginate disks containing the cells and proteins of interest into the dorsal skin-fold window chamber of nude mice. The window chamber allows real time in vivo fluorescent microscopy of angiogenic response to the proteins. Both Il-8 and TIMP-1 promoted neovascularization in the window chamber

Phylogeography of the neotropical Anopheles triannulatus complex (Diptera: Culicidae) supports deep structure and complex patterns
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The molecular phylogenetic relationships and population structure of the species of the Anopheles triannulatus complex: Anopheles triannulatus s.s., Anopheles halophylus and the putative species Anopheles triannulatus C were investigated.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The mitochondrial COI gene, the nuclear white gene and rDNA ITS2 of samples that include the known geographic distribution of these taxa were analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian inference, Maximum parsimony and Maximum likelihood approaches.
				
				
					
						Results
					Each data set analyzed septely yielded a different topology but none provided evidence for the seption of An. halophylus and An. triannulatus C, consistent with the hypothesis that the two are undergoing incipient speciation. The phylogenetic analyses of the white gene found three main clades, whereas the statistical parsimony network detected only a single metapopulation of Anopheles triannulatus s.l. Seven COI lineages were detected by phylogenetic and network analysis. In contrast, the network, but not the phylogenetic analyses, strongly supported three ITS2 groups. Combined data analyses provided the best resolution of the trees, with two major clades, Amazonian (clade I) and trans-Andean&#8201;+&#8201;Amazon Delta (clade II). Clade I consists of multiple subclades: An. halophylus&#8201;+&#8201;An. triannulatus C; trans-Andean Venezuela; central Amazonia&#8201;+&#8201;central Bolivia; Atlantic coastal lowland; and Amazon delta. Clade II includes three subclades: Panama; cis-Andean Colombia; and cis-Venezuela. The Amazon delta specimens are in both clades, likely indicating local sympatry. Spatial and molecular variance analyses detected nine groups, corroborating some of subclades obtained in the combined data analysis.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Combination of the three molecular markers provided the best resolution for differentiation within An. triannulatus s.s. and An. halophylus and C. The latest two species seem to be very closely related and the analyses performed were not conclusive regarding species differentiation. Further studies including new molecular markers would be desirable to solve this species status question. Besides, results of the study indicate a trans-Andean origin for An. triannulatus s.l. The potential implications for malaria epidemiology remain to be investigated.

Conserved developmental transcriptomes in evolutionary divergent species
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               Evolutionarily divergent organisms often share developmental anatomies despite vast differences between their genome sequences. The social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum have similar developmental morphologies although their genomes are as divergent as those of man and jawed fish.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Here we show that the anatomical similarities are accompanied by extensive transcriptome conservation. Using RNA sequencing we compared the abundance and developmental regulation of all the transcripts in the two species. In both species, most genes are developmentally regulated and the greatest expression changes occur during the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity. The developmental regulation of transcription is highly conserved between orthologs in the two species. In addition to timing of expression, the level of mRNA production is also conserved between orthologs and is consistent with the intuitive notion that transcript abundance correlates with the amount of protein required. Furthermore, the conservation of transcriptomes extends to cell-type specific expression.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               These findings suggest that developmental programs are remarkably conserved at the transcriptome level, considering the great evolutionary distance between the genomes. Moreover, this transcriptional conservation may be responsible for the similar developmental anatomies of Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum.

Xenotransplantation of mitochondrial electron transfer enzyme, Ndi1, treats myocardial reperfusion injury
A significant consequence of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction leading to energetic deficits and cellular toxicity from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mammalian complex I, a NADH-quinone oxidoreductase enzyme, is a multiple subunit enzyme that oxidizes NADH and pumps protons across the inner membrane. Damage to complex I leads to superoxide production which further damages complex I as well as other proteins, lipids and mtDNA. The yeast, S. cerevisiae, expresses internal rotenone insensitive NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) which is a single 56kDa polypeptide that functions analogously to the 46 subunit mammalian complex I as the entry site of electrons to the respiratory chain. Heterologous expression of Ndi1 in mammalian cells results in protein localization to the inner mitochondrial membrane which can function in parallel with endogenous complex I to oxidize NADH and pass electrons to ubiquinone. Expression of Ndi1 in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes protected the cells from simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R), accompanied by lower ROS production and preservation of ATP levels and NAD+/NADH ratios. We next generated a fusion protein of Ndi1 and the 11aa protein transduction domain from HIV TAT. TAT-Ndi1 entered cardiomyocytes and localized to mitochondrial membranes. Furthermore, TAT-Ndi1 introduced into Langendorff-perfused rat hearts also localized to mitochondria. Perfusion of TAT-Ndi1 before 30 min no-flow ischemia and up to 2 hr reperfusion suppressed ROS production and preserved ATP stores. Importantly, TAT-Ndi1 infused before ischemia reduced infarct size by 62%; TAT- Ndi1 infused at the onset of reperfusion was equally cardioprotective. These results indicate that restoring NADH oxidation and electron flow at reperfusion can profoundly ameliorate reperfusion injury

Assessing Adverse Impact:  An Alternative to the Four-Fifths Rule
The current study examines the behaviors of four adverse impact measurements: the 4/5ths rule, two tests of significance (ZD and ZIR), and a newly developed AI measurement (Lnadj). Upon the suggestion of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program Manual about the sensitivity of the assessment of AI when the sample size is very large (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, 2002), Lnadj is a new statistic that has been developed and proposed as an alternative practical significance test to the 4/5ths rule. The results indicated that, unlike the 4/5ths rule and other tests for adverse impact, Lnadj is an index of practical significance that is less sensitive to differences across selection conditions that are not supposed to affect tests of adverse impact. Furthermore, Lnadj decreases Type I error rates when there is a small d value and Type II error rates when there is moderate to large d value.

Modeling of Protein Flexibility and Inter-Molecular Interactions: Applications to Computer-Aided Drug Design and Discovery
Computer-aided drug design (CADD) represents computational methods and resources that are used to facilitate the design and discovery of new therapeutic solutions. It has been applied at almost all stages in the drug discovery pipeline. CADD has the advantage of reducing the cost and time for the expensive and extensive laboratory-based experiment. In CADD, protein flexibility has long been recognized as a complicating factor. Proteins are in constant motions in their physiological environment and their conformational dynamics play important roles in various biological functions and regulating ligand binding. My research focuses on modeling of protein flexibility and inter-molecular interactions and their applications to CADD. Detailed projects include method development for analyzing protein conformational changes using Perl and applications of various computing tools to study protein dynamics and protein-ligand interactions. In addition, ligand-specific molecular model was constructed on cannabinoid CB1 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor, with protein flexibility considered. To discover novel antimicrobial agents against tryptophan synthase, another project was carried out using structure-based virtual screening method. Recently, nanoparticles have been applied to therapeutic use. To promote safer implementation of nanotechnology and reduce nanotoxicity for drug delivery, dynamics and interactions between human serum albumin and nanoparticles were studied.

Computer Simulation as a Tool to Enable Decision-Making in a Pandemic Influenza Response Scenario
Introduction:We sought to develop and test a computer-based, interactive simulation of a hypothetical pandemic influenza outbreak. Fidelity was enhanced with integrated video and branching decision trees, built upon the 2007 federal planning assumptions. We conducted a before-and-after study of the simulation effectiveness to assess the simulations’ ability to assess participants’ beliefs regarding their own hospitals’ mass casualty incident preparedness.
      Methods:Development: Using a Delphi process, we finalized a simulation that serves up a minimum of over 50 key decisions to 6 role-players on networked laptops in a conference area. The simulation played out an 8-week scenario, beginning with pre-incident decisions. Testing: Role-players and trainees (N=155) were facilitated to make decisions during the pandemic. Because decision responses vary, the simulation plays out differently, and a casualty counter quantifies hypothetical losses. The facilitator reviews and critiques key factors for casualty control, including effective communications, working with external organizations, development of internal policies and procedures, maintaining supplies and services, technical infrastructure support, public relations and training. Pre- and post-survey data were compared on trainees.
      Results:Post-simulation trainees indicated a greater likelihood of needing to improve their organization in terms of communications, mass casualty incident planning, public information and training. Participants also recognized which key factors required immediate attention at their own home facilities.
      Conclusion:The use of a computer-simulation was effective in providing a facilitated environment for determining the perception of preparedness, evaluating general preparedness concepts and introduced participants to critical decisions involved in handling a regional pandemic influenza surge.

Seismic and infrasonic source processes in volcanic fluid systems
Volcanoes exhibit a spectacular diversity in fluid oscillation processes, which lead to distinct seismic and acoustic signals in the solid earth and atmosphere. Volcano seismic waveforms contain rich information on the geometry of fluid migration, resonance effects, and transient and sustained pressure oscillations resulting from unsteady flow through subsurface cracks, fissures and conduits. Volcanic sounds contain information on shallow fluid flow, resonance in near-surface cavities, and degassing dynamics into the atmosphere. Since volcanoes have large spatial scales, the vast majority of their radiated atmospheric acoustic energy is infrasonic ($<$20 Hz). This dissertation presents observations from joint broadband seismic and infrasound array deployments at Mount St.\ Helens (MSH, Washington State, USA), Tungurahua (Ecuador), and Kilauea Volcano (Hawaii, USA), each providing data for several years. These volcanoes represent a broad spectrum of eruption styles ranging from hawaiian to plinian in nature. The catalogue of recorded infrasonic signals includes continuous broadband and harmonic tremor from persistent degassing at basaltic lava vents and tubes at Puù \={O}\̀={o} (Kilauea), thousands of repetitive impulsive signals associated with seismic long- period (0.5-5 Hz) events and the dynamics of the shallow hydrothermal system at MSH, rockfall signals from the unstable dacite dome at MSH, energetic explosion blast waves and gliding infrasonic harmonic tremor at Tungurahua volcano, and large-amplitude and long-duration broadband signals associated with jetting during vulcanian, subplinian and plinian eruptions at MSH and Tungurahua. We develop models for a selection of these infrasonic signals. For infrasonic long-period (LP) events at MSH, we investigate seismic-acoustic coupling from various buried source configurations as a means to excite infrasound waves in the atmosphere. We find that linear elastic seismic-acoustic transmission from the ground to atmosphere is inadequate to explain the observations, and propose that the signals may result from sudden containment failure of a pressurized hydrothermal crack. For the broadband eruption tremor signals, we propose that the infrasonic signals represent a low-frequency form of jet noise, analogous to the noise from man-made jet engines, but operating with larger spatial scales and consequently longer time-scales. For the persistent hawaiian tremor signals, we propose that bubble cloud oscillation in the upper section of a roiling magma conduit and vortex dynamics in the shallow degassing region act as broadband and harmonic tremor sources. We also consider infrasound propagation effects in a dynamic atmosphere and discuss their effects on recorded signals. This dissertation demonstrates that combined seismic and infrasonic data provide complementary perspectives on eruptive activity

Insights into the evolution of Darwin¿s finches from comparative analysis of the Geospiza magnirostris genome sequence
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					A classical example of repeated speciation coupled with ecological diversification is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin&#8217;s (Gal&#225;pagos) finches (Thraupidae, Passeriformes). Their adaptive radiation in the Gal&#225;pagos archipelago took place in the last 2&#8211;3 million years and some of the molecular mechanisms that led to their diversification are now being elucidated. Here we report evolutionary analyses of genome of the large ground finch, Geospiza magnirostris.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					13,291 protein-coding genes were predicted from a 991.0 Mb&#8201;G. magnirostris genome assembly. We then defined gene orthology relationships and constructed whole genome alignments between the G. magnirostris and other vertebrate genomes. We estimate that 15% of genomic sequence is functionally constrained between G. magnirostris and zebra finch. Genic evolutionary rate comparisons indicate that similar selective pressures acted along the G. magnirostris and zebra finch lineages suggesting that historical effective population size values have been similar in both lineages. 21 otherwise highly conserved genes were identified that each show evidence for positive selection on amino acid changes in the Darwin's finch lineage. Two of these genes (Igf2r and Pou1f1) have been implicated in beak morphology changes in Darwin&#8217;s finches. Five of 47 genes showing evidence of positive selection in early passerine evolution have cilia related functions, and may be examples of adaptively evolving reproductive proteins.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					These results provide insights into past evolutionary processes that have shaped G. magnirostris genes and its genome, and provide the necessary foundation upon which to build population genomics resources that will shed light on more contemporaneous adaptive and non-adaptive processes that have contributed to the evolution of the Darwin&#8217;s finches.

A Paleoenvironmental Analysis of Gastropods from the Middle Ordovician, Ibex Region, Utah
Gastropods, which evolved in the earliest Paleozoic, are one of the most diverse and ecologically dominant clades in the modern ocean.  The clade experienced its first global radiation event during the Ordovician, but gastropods were of minor ecological importance throughout the Paleozoic.  This study aims to identify the environmental and ecological controls on gastropod occurrence during the height of the Ordovician Radiation Event through a study of the paleoenvironmental context of gastropods from the Ibex Region of the Confusion Range in western Utah, Basin and Range Province.Gastropods, collected from Ibexian and Whiterockian Middle Ordovician strata (Wah Wah Formation, Juab Formation, Kanosh Shale and Lehman Formation), were identified and analyzed for depositional context and abundance, from which ecological dominance was interpreted.  Results demonstrate that gastropods are more diverse (with eleven taxa identified) than previous studies of the Ibex Region have stated.  Gastropods were most diverse in shallow environments and most abundant in harsh (low oxygen and/or high salinity) environments.  Gastropod occurrences were correlated to muddy substrates, regardless of depth.  The only environment in which gastropods were dominant was the hypersaline lagoon, preserved in the Lehman Formation.

The role of E2A in hematopoietic development : establishment of a multipotent progenitor cell line to identify genetic and epigenetic regulatory programs in hematopoiesis
Over 55,000 bone marrow transplants are performed every year to treat patients suffering from bone and blood cancers, anemia, and auto-immune disorders. The success of these transplants is highly correlated to a high number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and/or early progenitor cells injected into the patient. Obtaining high numbers of these early progenitors from donors is extremely difficult, making ex vivo expansion of these cells an attractive option. Currently, however, there is still much uncertainty as to how to expand these cells while maintaining their pluripotency. In our lab, we have shown that mouse E47 knockout progenitor cells can be expanded almost indefinitely while retaining their pluripotency when cultured on S17 stromal cells in the presence of IL-7, SCF and Flt-3. Here, we overexpress Id2 under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter to expand multipotent progenitors that retain differentiating ability both in vitro and in vivo. This is a novel and robust method for ex vivo expansion of HSCs. We then exploited the in vitro growth capacity and multipotent differentiation potential of these Id2-HPCs to study both the genetic and epigenetic regulation of B and myeloid development in mice. We analyzed gene expression patterns and genome-wide binding of histone modifications, namely H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, to generate a predictive model of cis -regulatory elements at active enhancers in multipotent Id2-HPCs, B cells, or myeloid cells. We also utilized the Id2-HPCs to study the temporal changes in gene expression, epigenetic modifications and transcription factor binding in the pre-pro-B to pro-B cell transition. This analysis has confirmed the role of E2A to directly bind to nearly half of the regulated genes in B-cell development and, in conjunction with H3K4me1 binding patterns, has allowed the prediction of novel enhancers that are activated by specific combinations of transcription factors in a temporal fashion

PhiC31 recombination system demonstrates heritable germinal transmission of

Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               The large serine recombinase phiC31 from broad host range Streptomyces temperate phage, catalyzes the site-specific recombination of two recognition sites that differ in sequence, typically known as attachment sites attB and attP. Previously, we characterized the phiC31 catalytic activity and modes of action in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               In this work, the phiC31 recombinase gene was placed under the control of the Arabidopsis OXS3 promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis harboring a chromosomally integrated attB and attP-flanked target sequence. The phiC31 recombinase excised the attB and attP-flanked DNA, and the excision event was detected in subsequent generations in the absence of the phiC31 gene, indicating germinal transmission was possible. We further verified that the genomic excision was conservative and that introduction of a functional recombinase can be achieved through secondary transformation as well as manual crossing.
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               The phiC31 system performs site-specific recombination in germinal tissue, a prerequisite for generating stable lines with unwanted DNA removed. The precise site-specific deletion by phiC31 in planta demonstrates that the recombinase can be used to remove selectable markers or other introduced transgenes that are no longer desired and therefore can be a useful tool for genome engineering in plants.

Bacteria Associated With Colitis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Human gastrointestinal (GI) tract inhabits huge amount of microorganisms which contribute to the immune response in the gut. An immune system disorder disease inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was believed to be associated with several factors including gut bacteria, immunological responses, and genetic characteristic. Yet, the etiology of the IBD is not clear. Experiments on animal models and human samples had supported that commensal bacteria play an important role in the IBD pathogenesis. To better understand the pathogenesis of IBD, in this dissertation, bacteria rRNA gene populations were examined and associations related to the disease were analyzed in mouse model and human samples. Evidences showed that several bacteria inculding Lachnospiraceae and Clostridium Ramosum were significant related to the colitis. It was not sure that those bacteria were the causal agents of the disorder in the immune system or their populations changed were the result of being targeted by the immune response disorder. Predominant bacteria in human mucosal tissue were examined in the disease sample comparing the healthy controls to address that the bacteria shift in the mucosal layer related to the IBD. Ruminococcus, also a member of Lachnospiraceae, was significant in the mucosal sample reduce in the disease subjects. A mucin-degrading bacteria Akkermansia was first found in this study related to the IBD. Faecalibacterium was only reduced specifically in Crohn's disease while keep similar lever in healthy control and Ulcerative colitis. Bacteria community two mouse model with different genetic background were investigate and different bacteria were presented in fecal and tissue samples.  Overall, consistent evidence in this study indicated bacteria levels of several species were reduced in the disease because of an immune response toward bacteria in this niche. This study provided a better clue to lead a greater understanding of the etiology of the IBD.

Adaptive Geometric Tessellation For 3D Reconstruction of Anisotropically Developing Cells In Multilayer Tissues From Sparse Volumetric Microscopy Images
The need for quantification of cell growth patterns in a multilayer, multi-cellular tissue necessitates the development of a 3D reconstruction technique that can estimate 3D shapes and sizes of individual cells from Confocal Microscopy (CLSM) image slices. However, the current methods of 3D reconstruction using CLSM imaging require large number of image slices per cell. But, in case of Live Cell Imaging of an actively developing tissue, large depth resolution is not feasible in order to avoid damage to cells from prolonged exposure to laser radiation. In the present work, we have proposed an anisotropic Voronoi tessellation based 3D reconstruction framework for a tightly packed multilayer tissue with extreme z-sparsity (2-4 slices/cell) and wide range of cell shapes and sizes. The proposed method, named as the `Adaptive Quadratic Voronoi Tessellation' (AQVT), is capable of handling both the sparsity problem and the non-uniformity in cell shapes by estimating the tessellation parameters for each cell from the sparse data-points on its boundaries. We have tested the proposed 3D reconstruction method on time-lapse CLSM image stacks of the Arabidopsis Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) and have shown that the AQVT based reconstruction method can correctly estimate the 3D shapes of a large number of SAM cells.

Synthesis and evaluation of a stabilized propellane analog of the proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A and total synthesis of mearsine and synthetic studies towards grandisine B
Naturally occurring salinosporamide A exhibits potent and selective inhibition of proteasome activity. Despite its efficacy as a reversible inhibitor of the 20S proteasome and possible clinical utility in the treatment of certain types of cancer, salinosporamide A still suffers from a lack of stability. We have developed a propellane analog of salinosporamide A that stabilizes the beta-lactone by virtue of its structure. Construction of the core structure - the fused lambda-lactam, beta-lactone rings - was efficiently achieved utilizing the Ugi 4- center 3-component reaction involving a lambda-ketoacid and a novel convertible isocyanide. The second part of my research pertains to the total synthesis of mearsine and synthetic studies towards the total synthesis of grandisine B. Grandisine B is a human delta-opioid receptor agonist which presents the possibility of pain modulation without the negative side effects of mu-type agonists such as morphine. We have developed a unified synthetic route to mearsine and grandisine B which has allowed for the synthesis of the former. Key to the synthetic strategy is a novel ketimine forming methodology involving alkylithium addition to a pyrrolidinomethyl- protected 2.2.2-bicyclic lactam

The H-factor as a novel quality metric for homology modeling
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Drug discovery typically starts with the identification of a potential target that is then tested and validated either through high-throughput screening against a library of drug compounds or by rational drug design. When the putative target is a protein, the latter approach requires the knowledge of its structure. Finding the structure of a protein is however a difficult task. Significant progress has come from high-resolution techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR; there are many proteins however whose structure have not yet been solved. Computational techniques for structure prediction are viable alternatives to experimental techniques for these cases. However, the proper validation of the structural models they generate remains an issue.
				
				
					
						Findings
					In this report, we focus on homology modeling techniques and introduce the H-factor, a new indicator for assessing the quality of protein structure models generated with these techniques. The H-factor is meant to mimic the R-factor used in X-ray crystallography. The method for computing the H-factor is fully described with a demonstration of its effectiveness on a test set of target proteins.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We have developed a web service for computing the H-factor for models of a protein structure. This service is freely accessible at http://koehllab.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/toolkit/h-factor.

Interference in a Modified Recognition Task: An Evaluation of the Changed-trace and Multiple-trace Hypotheses
The changed-trace and multiple-trace theories of interference are tested in a set of six experiments.  The changed-trace hypothesis attributes interference to a rewriting of an initial memory trace.  The multiple-trace hypothesis attributes interference to a competition between separate memory traces.  Experiments 1 and 2 replicated the modified recognition test used by Chandler (1989, 1991) and provide support for the changed-trace hypothesis due to the strong evidence of retroactive interference, but lack of evidence for proactive interference.  The rest of the experiments modify the basic paradigm by changing the type of stimuli (Experiments 3 and 4 introduce words as stimuli instead of images) and the number of presentations of stimuli (Experiments 5 and 6 increase the number of times the interfering stimuli are shown).  These changes resulted in evidence for both proactive and retroactive interference.  Proactive interference was found in the experiments that used a modified version of Chandler's methodology, supporting the multiple trace hypothesis.  If a memory trace is changed, proactive interference will not occur.  The lack of evidence for proactive interference in the original task could be due to a recency effect and a large difference in the strength of the original memory trace as compared to the strength of the memory trace for the interfering information.

Exploring guanidinoglycoside molecular transporters
Guanidinium-rich molecular transporters have been shown to deliver otherwise non-permeable biologically relevant cargo into cells. While many such transporters have been reported, the studies reported here focus on guanidinoglycosides, which have been shown to permeate the cell-membrane in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner. In attempt to promote a cooperative interaction with cell- surface heparan sulfate, dimeric guanidinoglycosides were synthesized and studied for their cellular uptake properties in various Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Flow cytometry studies revealed that conjugates prepared with the monomeric compounds showed reduced uptake in mutant cells expressing heparan sulfate chains with altered patterns of sulfation, whereas the dimeric constructs could distinguish the various mutants and maintain high levels of uptake. These findings suggest that uptake depends on the valency of the transporter and the sulfate content on the cell surface receptors, thereby providing reagents that could distinguish cell types based on the composition of their cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. To further investigate the viability of these transporters, their potential to escape endosomal vesicles and diffuse into the cytosol was examined using a FRET-based cellular assay in HeLa cells. Findings indicate that guanidinoglycosides appear to enter the cytosol at around half the rate of poly9arginine. Interestingly, confocal microscopy studies indicate co-localization of the two different transporters

Marine-derived heterocycles : structural, synthetic and biological investigations
This dissertation describes synthetic, structural and biological studies on three different groups of heterocyclic marine natural products. Chapter 2 describes the assignment of the absolute configuration of phorbasides A and B, cytotoxic macrolide glycosides from the marine sponge Phorbas sp. The synthesis of a series of ene-yne chlorocyclopropane model compounds is described; the circular dichroism spectrum for each model is presented and compared to the spectra obtained for the natural products. The relationship between configuration and structure of the extended ene-yne chromophore and the observed Cotton effect is discussed. Chapter 3 describes i) The characterization of three new antazirine analogues from the marine sponge Dysidea fragilis; ii) The total synthesis of (Z)-dysidazirine, a related 2H-azirine natural product isolated in 1988 from Dysidea fragilis, and iii) The synthesis of a series of dysidazirine analogues. The antifungal activity of all compounds against a panel of clinically-relevant pathogenic fungi is reported. The data is used to develop a basic Structure- Activity-Relationship for antifungal activity of long- chain 2H-azirine carboxylates. Implications for the mechanism of action of (Z)-dysidazirine are discussed. Chapter 4 details the first total synthesis of the cytotoxic polyketide macrololide enigmazole A, isolated from the marine sponge Cynachyrella enigmatica. Enigmazole A was synthesized in 22 steps (longest linear sequence) and 0.41% overall yield from known compounds. The development of a method for preparation of functionalized oxazol-2-yl zinc reagents by direct zinc insertion is described. Oxazol-2-yl zincates were found to undergo palladium catalyzed Negishi coupling and copper catalyzed acylation reactions. The application of this methodology to the preparation of the oxazole-containing side chain of enigmazole A is presented

[structural, effect, causality, test, treatment, chapter, coefficient, variable, robustness, choice]

Four essays in econometrics
This dissertation contains four self-contained essays in econometrics. In Chapter 1, we give natural definitions of direct and total structural causality applicable to both structural VARs and recursive structures representing time -series natural experiments. These concepts enable us to forge a previously missing link between Granger (G-) causality and structural causality by showing that, given a corresponding conditional form of exogeneity, G- causality holds if and only if a corresponding form of structural causality holds. We illustrate with studies of oil and gasoline prices, monetary policy and industrial production, and stock returns and macroeconomic announcements. Chapter 2 provides nonparametric tests for various hypotheses about the effects of a continuous treatment variable in a nonseparable structural equation. These hypotheses have direct policy implications. Specifically, we consider marginal effects and various average effects and test (i) whether these effects depend on the level of treatment; (ii) whether average effects are heterogeneous across different subpopulations defined by covariates; and (iii) whether marginal effects are subject to unobservable heterogeneity. Our tests are based on consistent procedures of Bierens (1982, 1990) and Stinchcombe and White (1998). We apply our tests to study interest rate elasticities of loan demand in microfinance and the impact of education on wages. In Chapter 3, we show that careful examination of the structure determining treatment choice and outcomes is central to proper choice of covariates. We demonstrate how causal diagrams can play a key role in this examination by using these methods to give a detailed analysis of the choice of efficient covariates.Chapter 4 is about a common exercise in empirical studies -"robustness check," where the researcher examines how certain "core" regression coefficient estimates behave when the regression specification is modified by adding or removing regressors. If the coefficients are plausible and robust, this is commonly interpreted as evidence of structural validity. Here, we study when and how one can infer structural validity from coefficient robustness and plausibility. We discuss how critical and non-critical core variables can be properly specified and how non-core variables for the comparison regression can be chosen to ensure that robustness checks are indeed structurally informative

Microglial Activation in Mice Overexpressing Human Wildtype Alpha-Synuclein
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Although the etiology of PD is largely unknown, it is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Alpha-synuclein, a protein involved in familial PD and a major constituent of the Lewy bodies found in sporadic PD, has recently been implicated as an initiator of microglial activation and neuroinflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of PD. The objective of this study was to determine if alpha-synuclein overexpression in the absence of overt neurodegeneration is sufficient to trigger microglial activation and the timeline of these inflammatory events. To test this hypothesis, I used the Thy1-aSyn mouse model, which overexpresses human wildtype alpha-synuclein under the Thy-1 promoter. These mice demonstrate early and progressive sensorimotor anomalies in behavioral tests sensitive to nigrostriatal dysfunction and olfactory deficits, showing a loss of dopamine at 14 months of age. Previous studies by our group revealed that there was phenotypically specific microglial activation in the substantia nigra and striatum of Thy1-aSyn mice at 6 and 14 months of age, which was associated with exclusively increased TNF-&#945; levels. This present thesis specifically examined neuroinflammation in Thy1-aSyn mice at 1 month of age to determine whether similar patterns of microglial activation are evident in earlier stages of development. By using Iba-1 immunohistochemistry, I found that there was a significant increase in microglial activation exclusively in the striatum of Thy1-aSyn mice compared to wildtype at 1 month of age. Microglial activation was accompanied by increased striatal TNF-&#945; mRNA expression measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunofluorescence confirmed that such changes in neuroinflammation occurred in the absence of dopaminergic terminal loss in the nigrostriatal pathway, and synaptophysin immunofluorescence evaluated the absence of synaptic loss in the striatum. Together, these data demonstrate that widespread overexpression of alpha-synuclein results in early microglial activation in the striatum that is associated with a distinct pro-inflammatory cytokine increase characterized by TNF-&#945; production. Thus, the results of this study suggest that alpha-synuclein overexpression itself is capable of activating early inflammatory events that may be associated with PD pathology.

Genome analyses of the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici reveal polymorphic and haustorial expressed secreted proteins as candidate effectors
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Wheat yellow (stripe) rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST) is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. To design effective breeding strategies that maximize the potential for durable disease resistance it is important to understand the molecular basis of PST pathogenicity. In particular, the characterisation of the structure, function and evolutionary dynamics of secreted effector proteins that are detected by host immune receptors can help guide and prioritize breeding efforts. However, to date, our knowledge of the effector repertoire of cereal rust pathogens is limited.
				
				
					
						Results
					We re-sequenced genomes of four PST isolates from the US and UK to identify effector candidates and relate them to their distinct virulence profiles. First, we assessed SNP frequencies between all isolates, with heterokaryotic SNPs being over tenfold more frequent (5.29 &#177; 2.23 SNPs/kb) than homokaryotic SNPs (0.41 &#177; 0.28 SNPs/kb). Next, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline to integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and effector-focused annotations to identify and classify effector candidates in PST. RNAseq analysis highlighted transcripts encoding secreted proteins that were significantly enriched in haustoria compared to infected tissue. The expression of 22 candidate effector genes was characterised using qRT-PCR, revealing distinct temporal expression patterns during infection in wheat. Lastly, we identified proteins that displayed non-synonymous substitutions specifically between the two UK isolates PST-87/7 and PST-08/21, which differ in virulence to two wheat varieties. By focusing on polymorphic variants enriched in haustoria, we identified five polymorphic effector candidates between PST-87/7 and PST-08/21 among 2,999 secreted proteins. These allelic variants are now a priority for functional validation as virulence/avirulence effectors in the corresponding wheat varieties.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and effector-directed annotation of PST isolates has enabled us to move beyond the single isolate-directed catalogues of effector proteins and develop a framework for mining effector proteins in closely related isolates and relate these back to their defined virulence profiles. This should ultimately lead to more comprehensive understanding of the PST pathogenesis system, an important first step towards developing more effective surveillance and management strategies for one of the most devastating pathogens of wheat.

"Hot" for Warm Water Cooling
Liquid cooling is key to reducing energy consumption for this generation of supercomputers and remains on the roadmap for the foreseeable future. This is because the heat capacity of liquids is orders of magnitude larger than that of air and once heat has been transferred to a liquid, it can be removed from the datacenter efficiently. The transition from air to liquid cooling is an inflection point providing an opportunity to work collectively to set guidelines for facilitating the energy efficiency of liquid-cooled High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and systems. The vision is to use non-compressor-based cooling, to facilitate heat re-use, and thereby build solutions that are more energy-efficient, less carbon intensive and more cost effective than their air-cooled predecessors. The Energy Efficient HPC Working Group is developing guidelines for warmer liquid-cooling temperatures in order to standardize facility and HPC equipment, and provide more opportunity for reuse of waste heat. This report describes the development of those guidelines.

A Novel Photopolymerizable Chitosan Collagen Hydrogel for Bone Tissue Engineering
Photopolymerizable hydrogels derived from naturally occurring polymers have attracted significant interest in bone and cartilage tissue engineering due to their mechanical and chemical similarities to extracellular matrices, biodegradability spatial and temporal control of polymerization, and ability to be cured in situ through a minimally invasive procedure. While hydrogels are used for a number of soft tissue regeneration, few studies have investigated the use of a photopolymerizable injectable hydrogel for bone tissue engineering applications. The objective of this thesis is to synthesize a novel hybrid chitosan/collagen hybrid hydrogel characterize its mechanical and chemical properties, evaluate its biological effect and investigate the use of such hydrogels for sustained growth factor release. It was found that these chitosan collagen hybrid scaffolds exhibited extensive incorporation of collagen and proper collagen fibril formation throughout the hydrogel and that incorporation of these fibrils resulted in increased stiffness as compared with pure chitosan hydrogels. Furthermore, incorporation of collagen did not result in observable differences in gelation time but did increase resistance to lysozyme based degradation. When utilized as a 2D substrate, the hybrid hydrogel enhanced and encouraged cellular attachment, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cells as there was observed an upregulation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity as well as increased mineralization. Similarly when cells were encapsulated within a 3D CSCol hydrogel matrix, mBMSCs spread on the surface of the hydrogel, proliferated and exhibited greater ALP activity and larger mineral deposits. In addition to use of CSCol hybrid hydrogels as 2D and 3D systems, it was proven that CS photopolymerizable hydrogels could be used for controlled growth factor release by co-encapsulating protein-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles. PLGA microparticles encapsulated within CS hydrogels exhibited controlled sustained release of a fluorescent bovine serum albumin protein conjugate. Collectively, this thesis provides the initial understandings of a photopolymerizable hybrid CSCol hydrogel as a potential injectable bone tissue engineering system.

                  Introduction
               
               Acute kidney injury (AKI) can evolve quickly and clinical measures of function often fail to detect AKI at a time when interventions are likely to provide benefit. Identifying early markers of kidney damage has been difficult due to the complex nature of human AKI, in which multiple etiologies exist. The objective of this study was to identify and validate novel biomarkers of AKI.
            
            
               
                  Methods
               
               We performed two multicenter observational studies in critically ill patients at risk for AKI - discovery and validation. The top two markers from discovery were validated in a second study (Sapphire) and compared to a number of previously described biomarkers. In the discovery phase, we enrolled 522 adults in three distinct cohorts including patients with sepsis, shock, major surgery, and trauma and examined over 300 markers. In the Sapphire validation study, we enrolled 744 adult subjects with critical illness and without evidence of AKI at enrollment; the final analysis cohort was a heterogeneous sample of 728 critically ill patients. The primary endpoint was moderate to severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 to 3) within 12 hours of sample collection.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Moderate to severe AKI occurred in 14% of Sapphire subjects. The two top biomarkers from discovery were validated. Urine insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, a key mechanism implicated in AKI, together demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (0.76 and 0.79 alone). Urine TIMP-2&#183;IGFBP7 was significantly superior to all previously described markers of AKI (P &lt;0.002), none of which achieved an AUC &gt;0.72. Furthermore, TIMP-2&#183;IGFBP7 significantly improved risk stratification when added to a nine-variable clinical model when analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model, generalized estimating equation, integrated discrimination improvement or net reclassification improvement. Finally, in sensitivity analyses TIMP-2&#183;IGFBP7 remained significant and superior to all other markers regardless of changes in reference creatinine method.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               Two novel markers for AKI have been identified and validated in independent multicenter cohorts. Both markers are superior to existing markers, provide additional information over clinical variables and add mechanistic insight into AKI.

[fault, zone, deformation, volcanic, north, pockmark]

Tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone, Northern Iceland
Rifted margins and plate boundary tectonics dominate the surface morphology of the ocean basins, in particular the processes that occur in rifted margins and transform fault zones remain poorly understood. Northern Iceland is an ideal area to investigate distributed extensional deformation and the evolution of transform fault zones because of the repeated rift jumps eastward back to the Iceland plume. Studying this continually evolving system allows us the opportunity to understand better the complicated nature of evolving transform faults. Using CHIRP subbottom, MCS, multibeam bathymetry, side-scan sonar, and towcam images we imaged the three basins that comprise the Tjörnes Fracture Zone : Eyjafjördur, Skjálfandi, and Öxarfjördur bays. In the Tjörnes Fracture Zone, there appears to have been an initial stage of distributed extension accommodation : graben faulting with normal faults accommodating the extension between the newly formed North Volcanic Zone and the southern extent of the Kolbeinsey Ridge. This appears to have been followed and overprinted by more traditional oceanic transform faulting, with the development of the Húsavík- Flatey Fault and then the Grímsey Lineament that was subsequently formed with the northward propagation of the North Volcanic Zone. Pockmarks are increasingly being commonly identified along margins, and our data allowed us to investigate controls over their occurrence, morphology and location in Skjálfandi Bay. In this area they have been observed in a band 15-22 km offshore, and in along the Húsavík-Flatey fault scarp near shore. Pockmarks along the fault scarp are easily attributed to fluid migration along the fault plan from depth, and we observed an increasing biota density and abundance within these pockmarks. This is likely due to either an increased nutrient flux from depth or increased detrital deposition within the pockmarks. Offshore pockmarks occur in a well- defined band determined by the interplay of the distribution of source material and the thickness of the overlying glacial sediments. The westward dipping layers at depth act as fluid flow pathways, resulting in linear pockmark chains on the seafloor. They are further modified by sea floor currents creating an asymmetric profile with the long axis orientated with the current moving clockwise around the basin. Through time as the North Volcanic Zone becomes more organized the extensional deformation was replaced by dextral strike-slip faults giving rise to the Húsavík-Flatey fault. The deformation along the Húsavík- Flatey fault is ongoing, albeit decreased from the maximum that occurred in the Miocene. This decrease in activity is the result of the North Volcanic Zone propagating past the Húsavík-Flatey fault and transferring a portion of the deformation to the Grimsey Lineament. Based on GPS data, the deformation is approximately equal between the Húsavík -Flatey fault and the Grimsey Lineament. This northward migration of the North Volcanic Zone is accompanied by the northward retreat of the Kolbeinsey Ridge imparting a clockwise rotation that reactivates the N-S normal faults as oblique slip sinistral strike-slip faults in the manner of bookshelf faulting

Search for new physics in a final state with same-sign dileptons, jets, and missing transverse energy at 7 TeV center of mass energy
We report on a search for new physics in a final state with two same sign leptons, missing transverse energy, and significant hadronic activity at a center of mass energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.98 inverse femtobarns. Data-driven methods are developed to estimate the dominant Standard Model backgrounds. No evidence for new physics is observed. The dominant background to the analysis comes from failures of lepton identification in Standard Model ttbar events. The ttbar production cross section in the dilepton final state is measured using 3.1 inverse picobarns of data. The cross section is measured to be 194 ± 72 (stat) ± 24 (syst) ± 21 (lumi) pb. An algorithm is developed that uses tracking information to improve the reconstruction of missing transverse energy. The reconstruction of missing transverse energy is commissioned using the first collisions recorded at 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV data. Events with abnormally large values of missing transverse energy are identified as arising from anomalous signals in the calorimeters. Tools are developed to identify and remove these anomalous signals

WPP, No.111: Glottal articulations of phonation contrasts and their acoustic and perceptual consequences
This study explores the properties of one type of phonation contrast - the tense vs. lax phonation contrasts of Yi (Loloish) languages – in terms of their glottal articulations, acoustic correlates, and perceptual salience. To determine the glottal articulations involved in the phonation contrasts, we adopted Functional Data Analysis to analyze entire EGG glottal pulse shapes. This method is found to capture differences in the abruptness of contact, a key property that is not captured by traditional EGG parameter measures. The primary contact patterns for phonation contrasts are very consistent across languages, speakers, and genders, and there is only one underlying articulatory pattern for these tense vs. lax contrasts. Overall, we found consistent correlations among the different kinds of measures, which means that speakers and listeners are able to establish a stable link between articulation, acoustic signals and perception.

Magnetic pinning of flux lattice in superconducting-nanomagnet hybrids
Strong superconducting pinning effects are observed from magnetic landscapes produced by arraysof circular rings with varying magnetic remanent states. The collective and the background pinningof superconducting Nb films is strongly enhanced by the stray magnetic field produced by an arrayof circular Ni rings magnetized to form “onion” (bidomain) states. On the other hand, whenthe same rings are magnetized into vortex (flux-closed) states, or are randomly magnetized, thesuperconducting pinning is much smaller. The greatest pinning is produced when thesuperconducting vortex lattice motion is along a direction in which there is a strong magnetic fieldvariation.

New Routes to Phosphametallocene Derivatives
While the syntheses of phosphaferrocene and diphosphaferrocene have been known for several decades, derivatization of these molecules has been limited.  Prior to our work, functionalization of the phosphametallocenes has been through two routes: electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and functionalization of phospholide ions that are later coordinated to an iron source.  The most common method, EAS, is limited to alpha carbon substitution and only with acetyl or benzoyl groups.A small number of 2,5-silyl substituted phosphametallocenes have been reported in literature, via coordination of substituted phospholide ions with Cp*FeCl or FeCl2.  However, the 2,5-silyl substituted phosphaferrocene and diphosphaferrocene have not been found to be useful precursors of phosphametallocene macrocyles.  Our group has explored other routes for making substituted phosphaferrocene molecules and this work is presented hereafter.  Using phospholide ions that are carbonyl substituted at the alpha position to react with iron (II) chloride in the presence of zinc chloride, we were able to prepare the corresponding 2,2'-difunctional-1,1' diphosphaferrocenes as mixtures of meso and rac diastereomers.  When the 2,5-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)phospholide was reacted under the same conditions however the product was found to be the tetrafunctional 1,1'-biphospholyl which lead us to believe that the reaction is occurring through a bis(eta1-phospholyl) iron intermediate. We were successful at synthesizing 2,5-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)phosphaferrocene, 2,5-dibenzoylphosphaferrocene, and the 2,2',5,5'-tetrapivaloyl-1,1'diphosphaferrocene by reacting iron (II) chloride with a 1:1 mixture of Cp*Li and the corresponding 2,5 substituted phospholide ion in the presence of zinc chloride.  We attributed the stability of the 2,5-substituted phosphametallocenes to a push-pull type stabilization, where the Cp* unit acts as an electron donor to the metal center and the phospholide plays the role of an electron acceptor.Our new protocol for making phosphaferrocene derivatives was used in the synthesis of a new 2-(azacymantrenylmethyl)phosphaferrocene ligand, and in the preparation of building blocks for phosphametallocene macrocycles 2,5-bis(hydroxylmethyl)phosphaferrocene and 2,5-bis(pyrrolylmethyl)phosphaferrocene.

Graphene-based Material Systems for Nanoelectronics and Energy Storage Devices
Graphene is an allotrope of carbon in two-dimensional crystal form that has extraordinary electrical and optical properties. In this dissertation, we present the use of graphene in applications for chemical sensors, photovoltaics and supercapacitors.	Firstly, carrier transport properties of single layer graphene films grown via chemical vapor deposition technique are tuned with functionalized molecules, polymers and inorganic nanoparticles. For example, cylindrical microdomains of polystyrene-4-polyvinylpyridine (PS-P4VP) block-copolymers (BCP) on graphene film provide spatial doping effects due to two distinct functional groups. Further, preferred interactions between CFx or fluorine radicals and BCP micro domains on graphene introduce localized doping of graphene film leading to controlling of Dirac point shift. Interaction between graphene and inorganic nanoparticles is studied by using CdSe quantum dots as a model system. Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy allowes us to demonstrate for the first time fast interfacial charge transfer for such systems in the picosecond and in the hundreds of femtosecond time domains, which also demonstrates high potential for photoelectrochemical cell.  Secondly, graphene field effect transistors (GFET) as single strand DNA sensors are fabricated and detection limit as low as 3×10-9 M is demonstrated. Assembled BCP film on GFET sensor improved the sensor's stability and selectivity. The orientation and periodicity of the resulting cylindrical microdomains of BCP can facilitate the selective sensing property. With protective layer of BCP, sensor's stability under ambient atmosphere is improved up to 4 months. Thirdly, two different types of carbon nanotubes (CNT)/graphene hybrids are synthesized and used in fabrication of supercapacitors. The first type hybrid is graphene and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes which is successfully grown via one step chemical vapor deposition method. Our custom seamless growth method for such hybrids provides an attractive pathway for the fabrication of novel 3-Dimensional hybrid nanostructures. The second type hybrid is graphene oxide (GO) and SWCNT composite ink (GO-SWCNT ink). SWCNTs are dispersed using a GO aqueous solution (2mg/ml) with sonication support to achieve a SWCNT concentration of 12mg/ml, the highest reported value so far without surfactant assistance. Paper based electrodes for supercapacitors are fabricated using GO-SWCNT composite ink via dip casting method. By employing different concentrations of SWCNT inside the ink, supercapacitors demonstrated different capacitance values. The highest value of specific capacitance reaches up to 295 F/g at a current density of 0.5A/g with a GO/SWCNT weight ratio of 1:5.  The cycling stability for the GO-SWCNT paper electrode supercapacitors indicates capacitance retention of 85% over 60,000 cycles. Finally, engineered interactions between nanomaterials, polymers, molecules and graphene/carbon nanotube can lead to the development of new types of devices for myriad applications.

[statistical, criterion, theory]

On Statistical Criteria: Theory, History, and Applications
A statistical criterion is a convention by which certain values are considered relatively probable and others considered relatively improbable. Statistical criteria play a crucial role in the theory of statistics and were originally introduced by Daniel Bernoulli and later independently proposed by Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher. This article discusses the theory and history of statistical criteria, in particular the density criterion and the distance criterion. Applications for statistical hypothesis generation and testing are discussed. The pedagogical value of statistical criteria is illustrated through a concise and simple explanation of statistical classiﬁcation. This article also contains discussions on Gauss’ least squares conjecture and Fisher ’s maximum likelihood.

Impacts of Hypersaline Conditions on the Biotransformation and Toxicity of the Pesticide Bifenthrin in Salmonid Species of the San Francisco Bay Delta
Pyrethroids are synthetic derivatives of pyrethrin insecticides whose urban usage and continuous municipal wastewater discharge results in "pseudo-persistent" levels in Northern California waterways. Climate change causes warmer global temperatures which diminishes snowfall and reduces freshwater input into the San Francisco Bay Delta (SFBD) resulting in increased salinity over time.  The SFBD and its drainage serve as spawning and rearing habitat for salmonid species and is under threat by multiple stressors including pesticide pollution. Endocrine disrupting effects of bifenthrin at low-level exposures were investigated in laboratory and field experiments. 96-Hour laboratory exposures to bifenthrin (1 ng/L to 10 ug/L) showed no changes in plasma levels of the estrogenic biomarker, vitellogenin (VTG) protein, nor changes of the sex steroids testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 17beta-estradiol (E2) levels in two salmonid species: <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> and <italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</italic>. Field exposures using storm water containing bifenthrin, also showed no significant change in VTG or sex steroid levels in both fish species, suggesting short-term low dose exposure to bifenthrin does not result in estrogenic activity in salmonids. To evaluate the impacts of hypersaline conditions on bifenthrin toxicity, a 14-day laboratory exposure was performed using two populations of O. mykiss acclimated to freshwater, 8 g/L, and 17g/L salinity and then exposed to 0, 0.1, and 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin.  The first population (Jess Ranch) was previously treated as embryos with high levels of E2 to obtain uni-gender populations, while the second population (Nimbus Hatchery) was cultured without hormone treatment. Only Jess Ranch fish exhibited significant mortality following exposure to 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin in freshwater. No significant difference was observed in VTG levels in either population. Jess Ranch Fish showed no significant difference in T, 11-KT, or E2 levels.  Nimbus fish only showed a significant increase in E2 following exposure to 1.5 ug/L bifenthrin in freshwater. In vitro biotransformation studies using livers were also performed. Saltwater acclimation significantly reduced conversion of bifenthrin to polar metabolites in Jess Ranch fish. This study suggests that embryonic exposure to estrogens can increase susceptibility to bifenthrin in freshwater fish and saline acclimation protects against acute lethality through an unknown mechanism.

The meaning of Mups : understanding the basis of activation in the vomeronasal organ
Animals use pheromones to communicate information such as social status and to elicit stereotypic behaviors such as intraspecies aggression, fear, reproduction, and suckling. The family of Major Urinary Proteins (Mups) in mice has been implicated as pheromones that promote individual recognition and male to male aggression. Mup variants 24 and 25 are sufficient to elicit stereotypic male to male aggression through activation of the vomeronasal organ, part of the accessory olfactory system. The neural mechanisms by which these pheromones elicit this behavior however are largely unknown. Through the engineering of point mutations and Mup chimeras we found that the amino terminus domain of these proteins is required for specific neuron activation in the vomeronasal organ. Furthermore, a chimeric Mup 25, which activates a subset of sensory neurons stimulated by native Mup 25, fails to initiate Mup 25-mediated aggression in behavioral assays. Overall, our results provide a possible mechanism for Mup-receptor interactions as well as insight into the mode of information coding in the vomeronasal organ

[expression, facial, linguistic, signer, face, asl, nonsigner, processing, affective]

Functional and neural organization underlying face and facial expression perception
Users of American Sign Language (ASL) must recognize certain non-affective facial expressions as linguistic markers that signal distinct lexical and syntactic structures. When perceiving visual linguistic input, ASL signers must be able to quickly identify and discriminate between different linguistic and affective facial expressions in order to process and interpret signed sentences. Thus, signers have a very different perceptual and cognitive experience with the human face compared to nonsigners. This dissertation examines, in three separate studies, how experience with American Sign Language leads to changes in the processing and neural organization for the perception of faces and facial expressions. Study 1 examines face processing in Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners and revealed that these groups do not differ in face recognition or gestalt face processing ability; however, ASL signers exhibit a superior ability to detect subtle differences in local facial features. Study 2 examines whether affective facial expression categorical perception (CP) also extends to ASL facial expressions, and whether lifelong experience with ASL affects CP for affective facial expressions. Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners performed ABX discrimination and identification tasks on morphed affective and linguistic facial expression continua. Significant CP effects were observed in hearing nonsigners for both affective and linguistic facial expressions. Deaf signers, however, showed a significant CP effect only for linguistic facial expressions. Study 3 examines facial expression perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found that activation within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for emotional expressions was right lateralized for hearing nonsigners and bilateral for deaf signers. In contrast, activation within STS for linguistic facial expressions was left lateralized only for signers and only when linguistic facial expressions co-occurred with verbs. Within the fusiform gyrus (FG), activation was left lateralized for ASL signers for both expression types, whereas activation was bilateral for both expression types for nonsigners. Taken together, the results demonstrate that linguistic processing of facial expressions leads to specific changes in the processing of and neural organization for human faces and facial expressions

Investigations into novel modes of reactivity and stereoselectivity for the cycloaromatization of conjugated enediynes and dienynes
This work begins with a review of practical cycloaromatization methodologies utilizing 1,3-dien-5-yne subunits. As a valuable addition to this body of literature, an ambient temperature dienyne cycloaromatization pathway resulting from the formal CH activation of an allylic methyl group and subsequent alkyne 1,2-insertion triggered by cationic cyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes (CpRu) has been discovered. This cyclization route is fundamentally different to previous studies with CpRu that resulted in the formal Hopf product and the new reactivity appears to be correlated with the bulk of the alkyne substituent. Mild levels of catalysis and selectivity have been observed for cis-1-allylic substituted dienynes, although trans-allylic dienynes were also found to be viable substrates for the stoichiometric reaction. Three transient ruthenium-dienyne complexes have been identified from the reaction of a TMS substituted dienyne, one of which is derived from the trans-1-allylic dienyne and the other two appear to be in equilibrium by ligand exchange as supported by VT NMR studies. Kinetic investigations have ruled out metal eta²-alkyne coordination as the reaction-triggering event as previously proposed in similar transformations. Two reaction pathways currently being considered are a 1,7-hydrogen shift mechanism and a metal C-H insertion mechanism. In continuation of previously described metal-triggered cycloaromatizations of dienynes and enediynes, we have investigated in situ stereoselective eta⁶-complexation of the products from these reactions by use of chiral substrates. Use of allylic or propargylic stereocenters led to diastereomeric ratios (d.r.) as high as 8:2. The highest stereoselectivities were found by use of a Cp* versus a Cp ligand and the relative stereochemistry for the major and minor products for both reactions were found to be consistent by X-ray structure characterization. Arene binding experiments have ruled out a mechanism in which the selective binding step occurs by complexation of the free arene. Finally we have uncovered a mode of cycloaromatization for enediynes unrelated to the Bergman mode. The reaction occurs predominately in CDCl3 and is promoted by 1,4-cyclohexadiene and HCl. Intermediacy of a cis,cisyne is suspected and the current mechanistic hypothesis involves a cascade of pericyclic reactions leading to product initiated by a 1,7-hydrogen shift from the dienyne

The Differential Expression of OCT4 Variants in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
OCT4 is a factor responsible for maintaining stemness. When expressed in embryonic stem cells, OCT4 induces self-renewal and pluripotency. However, OCT4 expression has also been linked to cancer progression in a variety of tumors. To determine which isoform is responsible for the modulation of head and neck cancer progression, the expression levels of OCT4A and OCT4B were measured. We found that while normal keratinocytes do not express OCT4, stem cells express OCT4A and cancer cells express OCT4B. Furthermore, the overexpression of OCT4A in a head and neck cancer cell line led to the activation of traits (such as increased proliferation) associated with poorer prognosis. We conclude that OCT4A may be the isoform responsible for the progression of head and neck cancer, and that it may serve as a marker of "cancer stem cells" thought to be the driving force behind metastasis and recurrence.

The Role of P300-Dependent MYC Acetylation in MYC Functions
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Role of P300-Dependent MYC Acetylation in MYC FunctionsbyMarina VorontchikhinaDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Cell, Molecular and Developmental BiologyUniversity of California, Riverside, December 2011Dr. Ernest Martinez, ChairpersonThe MYC oncoprotein regulates transcription of a multitude of downstream target genes triggering various biological outcomes, such as the induction of cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and oncogenic transformation. While MYC protein levels and activity are tightly controlled in normal cells, MYC is deregulated in most human malignancies. Since cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, it is vital to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying the modification and regulation of the MYC protein, whose overexpression contributes to the development of most malignant tumors. Posttranslational modifications are implicated in the regulation of MYC stability and function. For instance, several co-activators/histone acetyltransferases (HATs) have been shown to bind and acetylate the MYC protein affecting its turnover by the proteasome. Co-activator/HAT p300 interacts with MYC increasing its stability and transactivation functions. However, once p300 acetylates the oncoprotein at seven lysine residues, MYC becomes more unstable due to induced degradation via the proteasome pathway. While MYC acetylation has been established, the role of acetylation in MYC biological functions has not been determined. Here, I report that by using site-directed mutagenesis I have identified lysine 158 in MYC as the major residue acetylated by the p300. I also demonstrate that acetylation of K158 reduces MYC-activated apoptosis which could be related to MYC-dependent regulation of certain pro-apoptotic genes associated with mitochondrial function, as it was shown by Real-time quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Furthermore, I demonstrate that MYC transcriptionally activates p300 in mammalian cells and, by using Luciferase reporter assays, I further show that MYC and co-activator p300 synergistically activate the promoter of the Cyclin D2 (CCND2), a well-known cell cycle regulatory gene. Moreover, by utilizing immunoprecipitation methods, I establish a link between MYC acetylation by p300 and its interaction with the co-activator/HAT, TIP60. Other cell and molecular biology procedures, such as immunofluorescence and RNA interference, were used in this study as well. These findings begin to uncover a role of co-activator/HAT p300 in MYC biological functions and are important because they suggest potential new targets for the treatment of MYC-dependent cancers.

Functional Analysis of CDC13 Regulation in Budding Yeast
Telomeres are DNA-protein complexes that maintain the integrity of linear chromosomes.   Telomeres protect the chromosome ends from being recognized as a DNA double strand break by the DNA damage checkpoint, and prevent chromosome rearrangements. Hence, telomeres are crucial to defending against genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells.  The work presented in this dissertation will focus on the regulation of activities involving the essential telomeric DNA binding protein Cdc13. In S. cerevisiae, the single-strand telomere binding protein Cdc13 is important for protecting chromosome ends. Previous studies indicate a role for Cdc13 in both telomere end protection and recruitment of telomerase to the telomere.  The role of CDC13 in telomere end protection has been elucidated using the temperature sensitive allele, cdc13-1. In cdc13-1 mutants the C-rich telomere strand is lost when cells are grown at high temperatures. The accumulation of single-stranded DNA at the telomere leads to a DNA damage checkpoint response and loss of cell viability.  We describe a screen conducted to identify activities involved in telomere C-strand loss, in which we identified two novel alleles of RAD24. Rad24 is an alternate Rfc1 subunit, and functions to load the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp onto sites of DNA damage. In each rad24 allele, the transposon used in the screen is inserted within the RAD24 coding region and results in production of two amino terminal truncations of Rad24. Here, we show that an intact Rad24 amino-terminus is necessary for its checkpoint function. The rad24-2 allele increases the frequency of obtaining cdc13-1 cells capable of growth at high temperatures. This rad24-2 allele combined with acquired telomere amplification facilitates growth of cdc13-1 cells at high temperatures.  The next work presented is an analysis of a Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc13 on residue T308. Strains with a T308A mutation at that phosphorylation site had short telomeres, suggesting a role for the Cdk1- mediated phosphorylation of Cdc13 at T308 in telomerase recruitment. In the final work, we describe an analysis of the interactions between Cdc13 and the DNA polymerase &#945; complex.  The association of Cdc13 with Pol1, the catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase &#945; complex is proposed to recruit the conventional DNA replication to participate in C-strand synthesis of the new G-rich strand extended by telomerase. We demonstrate that the Pol1 and Cdc13 as well as Pol12 and Stn1 interact directly, and loss of these interactions using the pol1-236 and pol12-40 alleles results in elongated telomeres. Thus, the data shown here will provide insight on how Cdc13 functions both to protect chromosome ends and to facilitate telomere replication.

Designing and characterizing artificial transcription factors targeting critical embryonic stem cell self- renewal and pluripotency genes in somatic cells
It has been shown that overexpression of four genes (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, Klf4) is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. To date, there are few viable reprogramming strategies that do not modify the genome of target cells, and even fewer that do not involve introduction of exogenous DNA. Herein, we describe a novel approach to specifically regulate expression of critical self-renewal and pluripotency genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, with the ultimate goal of generating iPS cells. We have constructed DRPs (designed regulatory proteins), which consist of a number of peptide domains. They are made of 6 zinc-finger (ZF) domains, as well as a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a cell- penetrating peptide (CPP), and a transeffect domain (TD). As proof of concept, we have conducted experiments using DRP-GFP fusion constructs to analyze DRP delivery and localization, and we have used the Oct4-DRP in order to test binding and functionality. We have established effective, inexpensive, high-yield protocols to express and purify DRPs targeting any gene. Through protein experiments, we have shown that the GFP-DRP fusion protein is translocated into the cell. In cDNA plasmid transfection experiments, we have shown that an altered version of this construct localizes in the nucleus. We have also demonstrated in vitro binding of two Oct4 DRPs to their respective probe sequences. Most importantly, we have demonstrated functionality of our Oct4 DRP under cellular conditions in HEK293 cells by demonstrating a 4- fold increase of expression in a reporter gene assay, when compared with controls. Though there are still difficulties to be solved, our work lays the foundation for a novel method to regulate genes that are important for generating iPS cells, as well as pluripotency and self -renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells. Because use of DRPs does not leave any lasting changes to the target cells' genome, our approach may prove valuable for future therapeutic use

[acpp, therapeutic, cell, agent, peptide, contrast]

Activatable cell penetrating peptides and their use in clinical contrast agent and therapeutic development
Activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs) are polycationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) whose cellular uptake is minimized by a polyanionic inhibitory domain and then restored upon proteolysis of the peptide linker connecting the polyanionic and polycationic domains. Local activity of proteases able to cut the linker causes amplified retention in tissues and uptake into cells. This ACPP platform has been specifically designed to meet 3 major criteria for contrast and therapeutic agent development. The first criterion was to target a wide spread disease process and mechanism that is inherent to cancer progression, in this case, matrix metalloprotease activity. Secondly, the platform was designed with an amplification mechanism that can deliver multiple molecules per target; in this case the targets are cancer proteases. Thirdly, the ACPP platform is not limited to a single enzyme target, imaging modality, or therapeutic playload. We show the validation of the ACPP concept from tissue culture to systemic administration in tumor bearing mice. ACPPs have enhanced biodistribution compared to the CPP counterpart and they yield MMP dependent contrast in multiple tumors and in metastases. ACPPs can be conjugated to macromolecular weight carriers to further enhance the biodistribution profile by prolonging plasma half-life resulting in enhanced tumor uptake and providing clinically significant contrast as an 111-In radiotracer. The second part of the dissertation focuses on translation from imaging agents into therapeutic agents. We describe the challenges of cell penetration, drug conjugation, stability, and the resulting animal testing using doxorubicin conjugated dendrimers that yielded some promising results. Lastly, we describe the simple attachment of ACPPs to clinically approved therapeutic nanoparticles. This approach has resulted in ACPP based targeted doxorubicin liposomes that have significant anti-tumor activity compared to untargeted liposomes. We conclude that because of preclinical successes, ACPPs have significant potential in the development of a targeting portfolio of imaging and therapeutic agents that could one day be useful in the clinic

[foot, stress, prosodic, structure, phonotactic, phonological, language, theory, foot-conditioned, metrical]

Foot-conditioned phonotactics and prosodic constituency
There has been a recurrent debate in generative phonology concerning the inclusion of hierarchical prosodic structure in phonological representations. On one side, there are those who argue that prosodic structure plays an indispensable role in the conditioning of phonological phenomena, especially stress, intonation, and segmental phonotactics. On the other side of the divide are researchers who suggest that all such phenomena yield to empirically adequate non-structural analyses, which are independently favored by criteria of theoretical parsimony.This dissertation focuses on one aspect of the larger debate over prosodic organization: the existence of the metrical foot. In standard conceptions of phonological structure the foot is a prosodic constituent, falling between the syllable and the word, which mediates the assignment of word-level stress. The foot obviously has no role to play in non-structural theories of prosody. Such frameworks assume that stress assignment is not dependent on prosodic constituents, but is instead directly computed over segments or syllables on a metrical grid.The evidence brought to bear on the choice of prosodic theory has, by-and-large, been drawn from the typology of attested stress patterns. Both structural and non-structural theories of stress appear capable of modelling roughly the same range of stress systems. Consequently, many of the arguments for or against foot structure have centered on the ability of each theory to express the typology of stress assignment in a compact, elegant, and predictive way. This dissertation expands the terms of the debate by examining foot-conditioned phonotactics, and to a lesser extent foot-conditioned morphology, as a window on the nature of prosodic constituency in natural language.A major conclusion of this dissertation is that hierarchical prosodic structure must be admitted as part of phonological representations in order to capture the full range of prosodically-conditioned segmental phonotactics found in natural language. Three case studies form the heart of this claim. Specifically, I show that Huariapano, Uspanteko, and Irish all manifest foot-dependent phonotactics that cannot be insightfully analyzed without recourse to abstract metrical structure. Importantly, these arguments go beyond claims about relative theoretical elegance: non-structural analyses simply fail to account for the relevant phonological phenomena in an explanatory way.In arguing for a foot-based theory of stress assignment, I also make the case for a fairly traditional conception of the metrical foot. First, I contend that stress is always assigned on the basis of foot structure, and only to foot heads, though feet may be unstressed or `covert' as well. Second, I argue that feet are always maximally binary, even in languages where stress assignment itself is ambiguous between binary and unbounded footing. Third, I propose that any given language makes use of at most one system or `tier' of metrical organization (the <italic>uniformity of footing hypothesis</italic>). In particular, I demonstrate that the rhythmic phonology of Huariapano can and should be modeled within a single, unified system of foot structure, despite previous claims to the contrary. Along the way, I identify a novel source of phonological prominence effects: the augmentation of foot-initial syllables.The dissertation closes with an artificial grammar study exploring how language learners acquire foot-conditioned segmental phonotactics. Given the `hidden' character of abstract prosodic structure, foot-conditioned phonotactics pose an interesting learning problem. This is especially true given the recent rise of the view that all synchronic phonological knowledge is the result of inductive learning over phonetic regularities in the speech stream. The results of the artificial grammar study suggest that speakers of both English and Japanese were inclined to learn a stress-conditioned vowel phonotactic in terms of foot structure rather than stress <italic>per se</italic>. The experiment thus supports the claim that language learning is sensitive to a foot-based parsing bias that encourages the use of the foot as a general explanatory device in acquisition. These findings provide a possible explanation for why binary foot structure is found in languages lacking rhythmic, foot-based stress, and suggest that the foot may be a prosodic universal.

Evaluating genome architecture of a complex region via generalized bipartite matching
Abstract
            
            With the remarkable development in inexpensive sequencing technologies and supporting computational tools, we have the promise of medicine being personalized by knowledge of the individual genome. Current technologies provide high throughput, but short reads. Reconstruction of the donor genome is based either on de novo assembly of the (short) reads, or on mapping donor reads to a standard reference. While such techniques demonstrate high success rates for inferring 'simple' genomic segments, they are confounded by segments with complex duplication patterns, including regions of direct medical relevance, like the HLA and the KIR regions.
            In this work, we address this problem with a method for assessing the quality of a predicted genome sequence for complex regions of the genome. This method combines two natural types of evidence: sequence similarity of the mapped reads to the predicted donor genome, and distribution of reads across the predicted genome. We define a new scoring function for read-to-genome matchings, which penalizes for sequence dissimilarities and deviations from expected read location distribution, and present an efficient algorithm for finding matchings that minimize the penalty. The algorithm is based on a formal problem, first defined in this paper, called Coverage Sensitive many-to-many min-cost bipartite Matching (CSM). This new problem variant generalizes the standard (one-to-one) weighted bipartite matching problem, and can be solved using network flows. The resulting Java-based tool, called SAGE (Scoring function for Assembled GEnomes), is freely available upon request. We demonstrate over simulated data that SAGE can be used to infer correct haplotypes of the highly repetitive KIR region on the Human chromosome 19.

Photothermal Nanoblade Delivery of Wild-type Mitochondria into mtDNA Depleted Osteosarcoma Cells
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with deleterious mutations can cause severe inherited diseases due to defective energy metabolism. Studies have shown that mutated mitochondrial genomes alone are sufficient to cause diseased phenotypes in cells with wild-type nuclear genomes. This suggests that the transfer of mitochondria containing wild-type mtDNA into mutant cells may offer a way to rescue defective cell respiration. Several previous attempts to rescue diseased phenotypes using cell fusion have been either unsuccessful or irreproducible. Our development of a device called the photothermal nanoblade provides a new approach to rescue mtDNA defects. In this technique, a non-focused laser pulse is used to excite a titanium coating at the tip of a glass micropipette positioned adjacent to the membrane of a single cell.  The laser pulse creates an explosive vapor bubble in the surrounding aqueous cell medium that collapses in less than 1µs and which generates a shear force to cut an adjacent plasma cell membrane with high precision. Cargo, such as wild-type mitochondria, are then delivered through the hollow bore of the titanium tipped micropipette into the cell cytoplasm. This technique is, therefore, distinct from standard microinjection and can deliver large objects, such as mitochondria and intracellular bacterial pathogens, into recipient cells with minimal damage. The goal of this project is to improve the respiration defect of mtDNA-depleted osteosarcoma rho 0 cells by photothermal nanoblade delivery of wild-type mitochondria, and to validate by studying the resulting recovery in oxidative phosphorylation. We have isolated respiring yet uncoupled wild-type mitochondria from an engineered DsRedMito HEK293 line, and shown successful delivery into rho 0 cells with high efficiency, demonstrating the feasibility of photothermal nanoblade as a large cargo delivery tool. Data collected from multiple isolation-delivery experiments followed by media selection did not select a population with improved rho 0 respiration. A series of mitochondria characterization ruled out the possibility of mitochondrial autophagy, suggesting that chemiosmotic coupled isolated mitochondria could be the key to achieve cellular uptake of the delivered mitochondria.

Nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo: A new tool for efficient equilibrium simulation
Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium properties of matter. In complex condensed-phase systems, however, it is difficult to design Monte Carlo moves with high acceptance probabilities that also rapidly sample uncorrelated configurations. Here, we introduce a new class of moves based on nonequilibrium dynamics:  candidate configurations are generated through a finite-time process in which a system is actively driven out of equilibrium, and accepted with criteria that preserve the equilibrium distribution. The acceptance rule is similar to the Metropolis acceptance probability, but related to the nonequilibrium work rather than the instantaneous energy difference. Our method is applicable to sampling from both a single thermodynamic state or a mixture of thermodynamic states, and allows both coordinates and thermodynamic parameters to be driven in nonequilibrium proposals. While generating finite-time switching trajectories incurs an additional cost, driving some degrees of freedom while allowing others to evolve naturally can lead to large enhancements in acceptance probabilities, greatly reducing structural correlation times. Using nonequilibrium driven processes vastly expands the repertoire of useful Monte Carlo proposals in simulations of dense solvated systems.

Pancreatic enzyme secretion in spontaneously hypertensive rats
The overall objective of our studies is to determine the underlying mechanisms of cell and organ failure in hypertension. We proposed recently a new "autodigestion hypothesis" postulating that there may be elevated levels of unchecked degrading proteases in hypertensive patients, not present in healthy controls. These uncontrolled extracellular proteases cause receptor cleavage that destroys membrane receptors involved in arterial constriction/dilation and consequently the higher blood pressure. We investigate these mechanisms in a model of human hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). These rats have elevated protease activity in their plasma. The goal of the current study is to determine the source of the uncontrolled enzymatic activity and its leakage mechanism into the bloodstream. The enzymatic activity of SHR pancreas, since it is a major source of digestive enzymes, and plasma paired with normotensive (WKY rat) controls was measured with zymography. The results showed that SHR has significantly higher enzymatic activity than WKY in the venous blood, pancreas, and pancreatic venules (p<0.05). These enzymes were identified to be possibly trypsin and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, by introduction of an 18 hour fasting period with reduction of these digestive enzyme levels in the pancreas there is a small but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in SHR but not in its normotensive control. These results provide the first time a lead for the origin of uncontrolled enzymes in the SHR. The evidence suggests leakage of highly degrading enzymes from the pancreas into the circulation through its venules leading to receptor cleavage and hypertension

Evaluation of the Robustness of Modified Covariance Structure Test Statistics
Problems about whether a hypothesized covariance structure models is an appropriate representation of the population covariance structure of multiple variables can be addressed using goodness-of-fit testing in structural equation modeling. Many test statistics and their extensions have been developed for various specific conditions and some of them have been extensively used in practice. However, their expected performances might break down under violations of multivariate normality or sufficiently large sample sizes. This paper evaluates the robustness of four modified goodness-of-fit test statistics T<sub>SB(new)</sub>, T<sub>MV</sub>, T<sub>YB</sub> and T<sub>F</sub> in SEM. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that the robustness of covariance structure statistics vary as a function of the correctness of the model as well as distributional characteristics of observed data. Suggestions for application of these modified test statistics are given after taking both the literature and current simulation result into account. A surprising result was the failure of T<sub>MV</sub>, the Satorra-Bentler mean-scaled and variance-adjusted test statistic, to perform correctly even asymptotically in one condition.

Macroscopic implications from phase space dynamics of tokamak turbulence : relaxation, transport, and flow generation
Aspects of the macroscopic phenomenology of tokamak plasmas - relaxation, transport, and flow generation - are analyzed in the context of phase space dynamics. Particular problems of interest are: i) fluctuation entropy evolution with turbulence driven flows and its application to flow generation by heat flux driven turbulence, and ii) dynamical coupling between phase space structures and zonal flows and its implication for macroscopic relaxation and transport. In chapter 2, intrinsic toroidal rotation drive by heat flux driven turbulence in tokamak is analyzed based on phase space dynamics. In particular, the dynamics of fluctuation entropy with turbulence driven flows is formulated. The entropy budget is utilized to quantify tokamaks as a heat engine system, where heat flux is converted to macroscopic flows. Efficiency of the flow generation process is defined as the ratio of entropy destruction via flow generation to entropy production via heat input. Comparison of the results to experimental scaling is discussed as well. In chapter 3, dynamics of a single phase space structure (drift hole) is discussed for a strongly magnetized 3D plasma. The drift hole is shown to be dynamically coupled to zonal flows by polarization charge scattering. The coupled dynamics of the drift hole and zonal flow is formulated based on momentum budget. As an application, a bound on the self-bound drift hole potential amplitude is derived. The results show that zonal flow damping appears as a controlling parameter. In chapter 4, dynamics of both a single structure and multi- structures in phase space are discussed for a relevant system, i.e. trapped ion driven ion temperature gradient turbulence. The structures are dynamically coupled to zonal flows, since they must scatter polarization charge to satisfy the quasi-neutrality. The coupled evolution of the structures and flows is formulated as a momentum theorem. An implication for transport process is discussed as well. The transport flux is prescribed by dynamical friction exerted by structures on flows. The dynamical friction exerted by zonal flow is a novel effect and reduces transport by algebraically competing against other fluxes, such as a quasilinear diffusive flux

Compton Recoil Electron Tracking With the TIGRE Gamma-Ray Balloon Experiment
Conventional Compton telescopes use a single converter and a calorimeter that results in azimuthal uncertainty in the imaging analysis.  The University of California, Riverside's (UCR) Tracking and Imaging Gamma Ray Experiment (TIGRE) was designed to minimize the directional uncertainty of the incident photons by using the silicon converter simultaneously as a photon scatterer and an electron tracker to determine the recoil electron path.  TIGRE's initial flight was conducted in June, 2007 from Ft. Sumner in New Mexico.  This thesis discusses the instrument's design, calibration, flight, and data analysis for Compton events.  The time interval of the flight data selected for this analysis was 18,436 seconds.  The expected efficiencies of the TIGRE instrument in a balloon-borne stratospheric environment, obtained from MEGAlib, a version of the GEANT 4 high energy simulator, ranged from 0.09% to 0.87% in the (0.3 - 50) MeV energy range.  However, the New Mexico flight yielded only 6.5% of the predicted number of Compton candidates which was attributed primarily to the lower number of functional detectors available during the flight.  A repeat simulation with realistic telescope conditions provided the expected number of Compton events that matched the flight results within errors.	To take advantage of the tracking feature, one of the necessary procedures is to determine the Direction of Motion (DOM) of the electron track.  The Pearson Correlation was used to determine the DOM.  This method was successfully tested and verified by using a 90Sr calibration data-set.  Using this method, the flight data had 698 downward electron tracks and 862 upward electron tracks, but this result was not successful in reconstructing the Compton events.  The Compton angle, determined with the electron tracks, and the Compton angles, determined by the classic Compton formula, did not correlate.  The discrepancy came from the low quality NaI calorimeters, its timing window with the silicon and the anti-coincident detectors, and an accidental inclusion of a module clear code within the flight software.  The analysis work undertaken for this thesis allowed us to correct and update the telescope circuitry and software for the Australia balloon flight that was carried out in the spring of 2010 (the Australian flight results are not a part of this thesis).

The rearranging chromosomes of host-specific salmonella enterica serovars
Broad host range serovars of Salmonella enterica have a conserved chromosomal gene order, or arrangement type, similar to that of the close relative E.coli. In contrast, host-specific serovars nearly always have large-scale rearrangements with endpoints in rRNA, or rrn operons. As these rearrangements are an important but poorly understood evolutionary process, two hypotheses for what causes these rearrangements were tested. One hypothesis proposes that horizontal gene transfer of phages and pathogenicity islands imbalances DNA replication, and rearrangements then occur to restore balance. Another hypothesis suggests that aspects of the host-specific lifestyle, such as the ability to establish a chronic carrier state in the host, either reduces selective pressure to maintain gene order or increases the rearrangement frequency. The arrangement types that occur naturally were compared to the theoretical possibility, and the amount of imbalance of each arrangement type was estimated using a PERL script. Out of 1,440 theoretical arrangement types, only 5̃0 were found to occur naturally. While most natural arrangement types were well-balanced, the majority of theoretical arrangement types were very imbalanced. Furthermore, the most common types of rearrangements that were identified did not affect balance. The relative fitness of Salmonella strains having transposon-held duplications of varying size that introduced up to 23⁰ of imbalance was determined. The sizes of the duplications were similar to many of the horizontally transferred genetic elements in Salmonella. While no correlation was found between the amount of introduced imbalance and fitness, the duplication of some chromosomal regions was detrimental to fitness. The arrangement types of serovar Typhi strains isolated from human carriers over time were also analyzed. Strains isolated from the same carrier almost always had different arrangement types. Furthermore, various arrangement types were identified in colonies isolated from archived slants of these strains; however, rearrangements were not detected in colonies derived from standard culturing conditions. Finally rearrangements occurring over time did not improve balance. Taken together these results refute the hypothesis that imbalanced replication causes the rearrangements, while supporting the hypothesis that aspects of lifestyle are responsible for the rearrangements found in host-specific serovars of Salmonella enterica

Seismic Performance, Modeling, and Failure Assessment of Reinforced Concrete Shear Wall Buildings
Reinforced concrete structural (shear) walls are commonly used as lateral load resisting systems in high seismic zones because they provide significant lateral strength, stiffness, and deformation capacity. Understanding the response and behavior of shear walls is essential to achieve more economical and reliable designs, especially as performance-based design approaches for new buildings have become more common. Results of a case study of 42-story RC dual system building, designed using code-prescriptive and two different performance-based design approaches, are presented to assess expected performance. Median values and dispersion of the response quantities are, in general, well-below acceptable limits and the overall behavior of the three building designs are expected to be quite similar. However, the ability to define shear failure and collapse proved difficult and provided motivation to conduct additional studies.  For both design of new buildings and evaluation/rehabilitation of existing structural wall buildings, an accurate assessment of median (expected) and dispersion of wall shear strength and deformation capacity are needed. A wall test database (124 specimens) was assembled to investigate the influence of various parameters on wall shear strength and deformation capacity, and to recommend alternative relations for strength and deformation capacity depending on expected wall behavior. Test results indicated that ACI 318-11 underestimates the shear strength of the shear-controlled walls. Mean curvature ductility ratios were obtained as about 3 and 7 for shear- and flexure-controlled walls, respectively. The new relations will allow improved damage and failure assessment of buildings utilizing structural walls for lateral load resistance.  Failure assessment of RC shear walls also was conducted for the 15-story Alto Rio building which collapsed in the 2010 Chile earthquake. Possible reasons for collapse were identified using post-earthquake observed damage, structural drawings, and nonlinear static and dynamic response analyses. Analysis results indicate that collapse was likely influenced by various factors, including compression failure at the web boundary of T-shaped walls on the east side of the building, large shear demands at the filled-in corridor walls at the first level, and tensile fracture and splice failures at the west side of the building. Nonlinear modeling and analysis of the four-story RC building that was tested on E-Defense shaking table (2010) was investigated to assess current modeling approaches and assumptions, and to identify issues that require additional study. Including concrete tension strength, stiffness degradation, and strength degradation significantly improved the correlation between the analytical and test results.

Ag polyhedra can self-assemble into their conjectured densest
packings6. When passivated with adsorbing polymer, the
polyhedra behave as quasi-hard particles and assemble into
millimetre-sized three-dimensional supercrystals by sedimentation.
We also show, by inducing depletion attraction through
excess polymer in solution, that octahedra form an exotic

Quantitative Analysis of Histone Modifications: Formaldehyde Is a Source of Pathological N6-Formyllysine That Is Refractory to Histone Deacetylases
Aberrant protein modifications play an important role in the pathophysiology of many human diseases, in terms of both dysfunction of physiological modifications and the formation of pathological modifications by reaction of proteins with endogenous electrophiles. Recent studies have identified a chemical homolog of lysine acetylation, Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine, as an abundant modification of histone and chromatin proteins, one possible source of which is the reaction of lysine with 3′-formylphosphate residues from DNA oxidation. Using a new liquid chromatography-coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify all Nsuperscript 6-methyl-, -acetyl- and -formyl-lysine modifications, we now report that endogenous formaldehyde is a major source of Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine and that this adduct is widespread among cellular proteins in all compartments. Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine was evenly distributed among different classes of histone proteins from human TK6 cells at 1–4 modifications per 10superscript 4 lysines, which contrasted strongly with lysine acetylation and mono-, di-, and tri-methylation levels of 1.5-380, 5-870, 0-1400, and 0-390 per 10superscript 4 lysines, respectively. While isotope labeling studies revealed that lysine demethylation is not a source of Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine in histones, formaldehyde exposure was observed to cause a dose-dependent increase in Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine, with use of superscript 13C,superscript 2Hsubscript 2-formaldehyde revealing unchanged levels of adducts derived from endogenous sources. Inhibitors of class I and class II histone deacetylases did not affect the levels of Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine in TK6 cells, and the class III histone deacetylase, SIRT1, had minimal activity (<10%) with a peptide substrate containing the formyl adduct. These data suggest that Nsuperscript 6-formyllysine is refractory to removal by histone deacetylases, which supports the idea that this abundant protein modification could interfere with normal regulation of gene expression if it arises at conserved sites of physiological protein secondary modification.

Investigation of Solid Particle Number Measurement of Engine Emissions
As diesel PM regulation gets more stringent, the current gravimetric method which has been used for legal determination of PM mass for vehicle emissions will have difficulty accurately quantifying PM mass emissions. Progress in regulating diesel PM emissions by non-gravimetric means has been made in the Europe. The method, so called particle measurement program (PMP) protocol specifies counting solid particles larger than 23 nm. This method has already been adopted for Euro V and VI to regulate light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle emissions and it is also expected to be adopted to regulate emissions for aviation section. However, exclusion of sub-23 nm particles poses some potential issues. In this thesis, the PMP method was investigated with a focus on finding the nature of sub-23 nm particles which are excluded in the current PMP protocol.A PMP-compliant system, an AVL advanced particle counter (APC) and an alternative volatile particle removal system, a catalytic stripper (CS) were evaluated and compared for measuring solid particle number emissions in chapters 2 and 3. The evaluations and comparisons were conducted using sulfuric acid and hydrocarbon particles as model volatile particles in laboratory tests, and diluted exhaust from a diesel particle filter (DPF)-equipped heavy-duty diesel vehicle operated on a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer under steady speed conditions at two different engine loads. Thisstudy also compared particulate matter (PM) mass and particle number (PN) emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions, including two uphill (phases 1 and 2) and two downhill (phases 3 and 4) segments. The UDDS and on-road flow-of-traffic tests represent a broader engine operating conditions than those currently certified emissions testing cycles.For the laboratory test, both the APC and CS removed more than 99% of the volatile particles in terms of PN when using aerosols composed of pure sulfuric acid or hydrocarbons. When using laboratory test aerosols consisting of mixtures of sulfuric acidand hydrocarbons more than 99% of the particles were removed by the APC but the surviving particles were no longer entirely volatile, with 12-14% being solid.For the chassis dynamometer test, PN emissions of particles between 3 and 10 nm downstream of the APC were 2 and 7 times higher than the PN emissions of particles above 10 nm at the 74 and 26% engine load, respectively. At the 26% engine load, PNlevel of the 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were significantly higher than that in the dilution tunnel, demonstrating that the APC was making 3 to 10 nm particles. The PN emissions of 3 to 10 nm particles downstream of the APC were related to theheating temperature of the APC evaporation tube, suggesting these particles are artifacts formed by renucleation of semivolatiles. Considerably fewer particles between 3 to 10 nm were seen downstream of the CS for both engine loads due mainly to removal of semivolatile material by the catalytic substrates, although some of this difference could be attributed to diffusion and thermophoretic losses.Chapter 4 provides an evaluation of the nature of sub 23 nm particles downstream of the European PMP methodology with prescribed cycles and on-road flow-of-traffic driving conditions. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured using two PMP measurement systems in parallel. For this analysis, the focus is on the real-time results from multiple instruments. The results revealed that a significant fraction of particles downstream of both PMP systems for all tested cycles werebelow 11 nm. The fraction of sub 11 nm particles observed downstream of the PMP system decreased when the overall dilution ratio of one PMP system was increased from 300 to 1500, suggesting those sub 11 nm particles were formed through re-nucleation of semivolatile precursors. When the evaporation tube temperature was increased from 300 to 500°C, no difference in particle number concentrations was observed, suggesting incomplete evaporation of semivolatile particles did not contribute to those sub 11 nm particles. Particle emissions were about one order of magnitude higher during flow-of-traffic driving along a highway with a steep grade than during the prescribed driving cycles. During the same flow-of-traffic condition, a sudden jump of PMP operationally defined solid particle concentration was observed, while the accumulation mode particle concentrations in the constant volume sampling (CVS) tunnel measured by engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) only showed a slight increase. This discrepancy was attributed to the extensive growth of the re-nucleated particles downstream of the PMP systems.In chapter 5, the PMP system was evaluated over a standard laboratory testing cycle and uphill and downhill on-road, flow-of-traffic driving conditions. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower than the U.S. 2007 heavy-duty PM mass standard. The PM mass emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the uphill and downhill driving on-road driving conditions. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS and downhill on-road driving conditions were 3 times lower than the Euro VI heavy-duty PN limit for transient cycles, while the PN emissions from the uphill on-road driving conditions were 4 to 5 times higher than the Euro VI PN limit. The PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nm for the UDDS (with an average engine load of 38%) were comparable in magnitude to those for the phase 3 downhill segment (with an aveage engine load of 40%) of the on-road test, and were 25% lower than those for the phase 4 downhill segment (with an avearage engine load of 18%) of the on-road test. The variability of the PN emissions of particles larger than 23 nmranged from 10 to 40% for the UDDS and on-road tests, comparable to that found in the European PMP study.

E-cadherin gene re-expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by HDAC inhibitors
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin gene is frequently silenced in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and results in wnt-pathway activation. We analyzed the role of histone epigenetic modifications in E-cadherin gene silencing.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					CLL specimens were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) MS-275 and analyzed for E-cadherin expression with western blot and RT-PCR analysis. The downstream effects of HDACi treated leukemic cells were studied by analyzing the effect on wnt-pathway signaling. HDACi induced alterations in E-cadherin splicing were investigated by transcript specific real time PCR analysis.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Treatment of CLL specimens with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) treatment resulted in an increase of the E-cadherin RNA transcript (5 to 119 fold increase, n=10) in eight out of ten CLL specimens indicating that this gene is down regulated by histone hypoacetylation in a majority of CLL specimens. The E-cadherin re-expression in CLL specimens was noted by western blot analysis as well. Besides epigenetic silencing another mechanism of E-cadherin inactivation is aberrant exon 11 splicing resulting in an alternatively spliced transcript that lacks exon 11 and is degraded by the non-sense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that HDACi increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the E-cadherin promoter region. This also affected the E-cadherin exon 11 splicing pattern as HDACi treated CLL specimens preferentially expressed the correctly spliced transcript and not the exon 11 skipped aberrant transcript. The re-expressed E- cadherin binds to &#946;-catenin with inhibition of the active wnt-beta-catenin pathway in these cells. This resulted in a down regulation of two wnt target genes, LEF and cyclinD1 and the wnt pathway reporter.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					The E-cadherin gene is epigenetically modified and hypoacetylated in CLL leukemic cells. Treatment of CLL specimens with HDACi MS-275 activates transcription from this silent gene with expression of more correctly spliced E-cadherin transcripts as compared to the aberrant exon11 skipped transcripts that in turn inhibits the wnt signaling pathway. The data highlights the role of epigenetic modifications in altering gene splicing patterns.

This study focuses on the approximate analysis of soil- structure interaction problems, specifically on the application of classical modal analysis for coupled horizontal-rocking vibrations of plane structures resting on a linear elastic soil. Although the classical modal approach provides a non-rigorous solution, it is particularly meaningful as it offers physical insight into the nature of soil-structure interaction effects. After validating the numerical algorithm by comparison with earlier works, a comprehensive assessment of the classical modal approach is performed, based on the analysis of a nine-story building. The accuracy of the approximate solution is quantified by introducing two measures of error of the steady-state response. The source of the lack of accuracy of the approach is investigated by analyzing the off-diagonal terms of the modal damping matrix. The effects of interaction on the dynamic properties of the structure are clearly shown through a parametric study of the test structure, and they are interpreted by comparison with different limit cases. A better general understanding of the soil-structure interaction is provided by introducing an equivalent model, consisting of a single degree of freedom oscillator on an elastic soil. The equivalent model is used to approximate each system mode, once the modal properties of the structure on a fixed-base are known. New approximate analytical expressions for the system frequencies, modal damping ratios and participation factors for all modes are derived through the application of a perturbation analysis. The proposed expressions could be effective in performing preliminary analysis, validating other results, and being incorporated into codes or guidelines

Iron Cycling and Redox Evolution in the Precambrian
The chemical composition of the ocean changed dramatically with the oxidation of the Earth's surface, and this process has profoundly influenced the evolutionary and ecological history of life. The early Earth is generally thought to have been characterized by a reducing ocean-atmosphere system, while the Phanerozoic Eon (<542 million years ago) is known for a stably oxygenated biosphere conducive to the radiation of animals. However, the exact redox landscape of the Earth's oceans is poorly constrained. Similarly, the redox characteristics of surface environments during Earth's middle age (1.8 to 1 billion years ago) are poorly known. I will provide several lines of evidence that even the mixed layer of the surfical ocean was anoxic in the Archean. Oxygen must have been restricted to very localized regions of the regions--`oxygen oases'. Further, I will present evidence that anoxic and Fe(II)-rich conditions were both spatially and temporally extensive across diverse paleogeographic settings in the mid-Proterozoic ocean. This is a new view of Proterozoic redox conditions; it has been commonly assumed for the last decades that the mid-Proterozoic was home to a globally sulfidic (euxinic) or oxic deep ocean. Lastly, I will explore the underlying controls behind the transition from the reducing state that characterized most of the Precambrian to the oxidized state typical of the Phanerozoic. More specifically, I propose based, on a new record of how marine phosphate concentrations have changed through time, that a spike in phosphate levels in the ocean in late Precambrian was key in causing the switch to a more oxidizing ocean atmosphere system.

Iron(III)-doped, silica : biodegradable, self-targeting nanoparticles
Silica nanoparticles are currently being investigated for a number of medical applications. Silica is FDA approved for oral consumption; however, its use in vivo has been questioned because of its potential for bioaccumulation. In an attempt to remedy this problem, silica nanoshells have been made biodegradable by doping iron(III) into the nanoshells. Small molecule chelation and serum studies were performed to determine if the removal of iron(III) from the nanoshell structure would facilitate nanoshell degradation. It was determined that iron chelators such as EDTA, desferrioxamine, and Deferiprone cause the nanoshells to degrade upon removal of iron, as evidenced by UV-vis absorption spectral studies and SEM experiments. The submersion of Fe(III)-doped, silica nanoshells in fetal bovine serum and human serum also appear to degrade due to the removal or iron by serum proteins, which is easily seen in SEM images. In addition to biodegradability, being able to modify nanoparticles with targeting ligands is highly desirable for targeted drug delivery applications. This is often accomplished by the conjugation of a targeting moiety (protein, apatmer, polymer, etc.) to the surface of the nanoparticle. Conjugation of such compounds, however, can be difficult and complicate other desired surface chemical modification reactions. This issue is remedied by the incorporation of iron(III) into silica nanoshells. Iron(III) in the nanoshells can be bound by transferrin, a serum protein, and subsequently transported into a cell via a transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. The uptake of Fe(III)-doped, silica nanoshells via a transferrin receptor-mediated pathways was observed with the use of fluorescence and confocal microscopy and also using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. Based on the results of these studies, it can be concluded that the doping of iron(III) into silica nanoshells results in a self- targeting nanoparticle (a nanoparticle that does not require the covalent conjugation of a targeting moiety to its surface)

Engineering Magnetic Anisotropy in Nanostructured 3d and 4f Ferromagnets
Due to the increased demand for clean energy in recent years, there is a need for the scientific community to develop technology to harvest thermal energy which is ubiquitous but mostly wasted in our environment. However, there is still no efficient approach to harvest thermal energy to date. In this study, the theory of thermomagnetic energy harvesting is reviewed and unique applications of multiferroics (ferromagnetic plus ferroelectric) are introduced. Based on an efficiency analysis using experimentally measured magneto-thermal properties of 3d transitional and 4f rare earth ferromagnetic elements, the idea of using single domain ferromagnetic elements to obtain higher thermomagnetic conversion efficiencies is proposed. In order to fabricate a ferromagnetic single domain, the magnetic anisotropy of gadolinium (Gd) and nickel (Ni) is engineered at the nanoscale. Both thin films and nanostructures are fabricated and characterized with a focus on the change of magnetic anisotropy governed by shape, crystal structure, and strain. The fabrication processes include sputtering, e-beam lithography (writing and evaporation), and focused ion beam milling. Characterization techniques involving atomic/magnetic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction will also be discussed. Experimental results show that the magnetic domain structure of nanostructured Ni can be stably controlled with geometric constraints or by strain induced via electric field. The magnetic properties of nanostructured Gd, on the other hand, is sensitive to crystal structure. These results provide critical information toward the use of ferromagnetic nanostructures in thermomagnetic energy harvesting and multiferroic applications.

Graphene growth with giant domains using chemical vapor deposition
We report the first demonstration of the growth of giant graphene domains on platinum (Pt), which results in a uniform bilayer graphene film with domain sizes of millimetre scale. These giant graphene domains are attributed to the giant Pt grains attained in post-deposition annealed Pt thin films that exhibit a strong dependency on the Pt film thickness. Giant grains have been claimed to occur in other metallic materials under appropriate film thicknesses and processing conditions. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational large-scale uniform graphene synthesis for applications in nanoelectronics and sensing.

Gene expression of cell types present in the vascular wall during the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis
A key element of atherosclerosis, the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD), is chronic inflammation of the vessel wall. Identifying the gene expression of the cells present in the vessel wall during atherogenesis can clarify these events and provide new research possibilities. The work presented here characterizes a putative transcription factor that contributes to atherosclerosis, identifies candidate genes involved in the activation of endothelial cells, and defines the expression patterns of CAD GWAS candidate genes in mouse vascular cells.	Zhx2, a putative transcription factor, was identified as a gene controlling plasma lipid levels using congenic mice and fine-mapping. Liver-specific Zhx2 transgenic mice on a Zhx-null background exhibited a corrected plasma lipid profile, confirming Zhx2 as the gene controlling the plasma lipid phenotype. Male Zhx2-null mice had atherosclerotic lesions nine times smaller than mice with a wild-type Zhx2 allele, a large effect that could not be fully explained by their plasma lipid profiles. Treatment of macrophages with the pro-inflammatory factor LPS elicited a strong increase in Zhx2 transcript, suggesting involvement in the inflammatory response.  A bone marrow transplant of Zhx2-null hematopoietic stem cells into Zhx2 wild-type mice resulted in a more than 4-fold reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size, supporting a role for Zhx2 in the chronic immune response accompanying atherosclerosis.	Endothelial cells are a central component in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, and the study of their expression profile could provide valuable data. Since the cell culture of mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) has been challenging, we identified an alternate method for the isolation of RNA from these cells. Microarray analysis of these transcripts identified 14 differentially expressed genes in pre-lesioned MAECs, eight of which have not been previously described in atherosclerosis. This method has also made it feasible to collect RNA samples from distinct cell types present in the vessel wall during atherosclerosis. Recent genome wide association studies on CAD have identified loci representing 56 candidate genes. We used quantitative PCR to identify the expression levels of these genes in each atherosclerotic cell type and report the results.

Quantum magnetic phenomena in 0-D through 3-D MnIII₃-based single-molecule magnets
Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) offer a molecular approach to nanoscale magnetic materials. These molecules, below their blocking temperature, function as single-domain magnetic particles and exhibit the classical macroscale property of a magnet-magnetization hysteresis. In addition, SMMs straddle the classical/quantum interface in also displaying quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) and quantum phase interference. Potential applications of SMMs include high-density information storage and qubits for quantum computing. There are numerous synthetic and technical challenges to this end, the most significant of which involves maximization of the barrier to magnetization reversal (Ueff) and understanding the factors that control QTM. To meet these goals, closely- related families of Mn'III-based complexes have been synthesized, in which the ground state spin values, uniaxial anisotropies, and magnetization reversal barriers were varied as a result of systematic changes in the coordinating ligands and co-crystallizing cations. Detailed single-crystal magnetization hysteresis and high- frequency EPR studies on these complexes provide unprecendented insight towards the mechanism and selection rules for QTM in these complexes, as applicable to all SMMs. SMMs have also been widely touted as a 'bottom-up' approach to the construction of molecular magnetic materials, though very few examples adequately demonstrate this concept. Families of higher-nuclearity Mn₃III-based complexes have thus been synthesized, for which dimeric structures, infinite 1-D chains, 2-D grids, and porous 3-D frameworks have been achieved. Through systematic synthetic variations, these complexes exhibit magnetic properties that span the range from isolated SMMs, to weakly coupled SMMs, to correlated single-chain magnets (SCMs). The porous 3-D structures also possesses unique multi-functional properties such as the observation of slow magnetization relaxation and the selective adsorption of gases such as CO₂ and H₂

METAL NANOPARTICLES FUNCTIONALIZED WITH METAL-LIGAND COVALENT BONDS
Metal-organic contact has been recognized to play important roles in regulation of optical and electronic properties of nanoparticles. In this thesis, significant efforts have been devoted into synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles with various metal-ligand interfacial linkages and investigation of their electronic and optical properties. Ruthenium nanoparticles were prepared by the self-assembly of functional group onto bare Ru colloid surface. As to Ru-alkyne nanoparticles, the formation of a Ru-vinylidene (Ru=C=CH-R) interfacial bonding linkage was confirmed by the specific reactivity of the nanoparticles with imine derivatives and olefin at the metal-ligand interface, as manifested in NMR, photoluminescence, and electrochemical measurements. Interestingly, it was found the electronic coupling coefficient (&beta)for strongly depend upon such metal-ligand interfacial bonding.Next, such metal-ligand interfacial bonding was extended to ruthenium-nitrene &pi bonds on ruthenium colloids, which were investigated by XPS. The nanoparticles exhibited a 1:1 atomic ratio of nitrogen to sulfur, consistent with that of sulfonyl nitrene fragments. In addition, the nanoparticle-bound nitrene moieties behaved analogously to azo derivatives, as manifested in UV-vis and fluorescence measurements. Further testimony of the formation of Ru=N interfacial linkages was highlighted in the unique reactivity of the nanoparticles with alkenes by imido transfer.Extensive conjugation between metal-ligand interfacial bond results in remarkable intraparticle charge delocalization on Ru-alkynide nanoparticles, which was manipulated by simple chemical reduction or oxidation. Charging of extra electrons into the nanoparticle cores led to an electron-rich metal core and hence red-shift of the triple bond stretching mode, lower binding energy of sp hybridized C 1s and dimmed fluorescence of nanoparticles. Instead, chemical oxidation resulted in the opposite impacts on these properties. By taking advantage of such extensively conjugated metal-ligand bonding and effective intraparticle charge delocalization of ruthenium nanoparticles, Ru=carbene nanoparticles functionalized with multiple moieties by olefin metathesis reactions was further exploited for metal ion sensing. When the nanoparticles were co-functionalized with 1-vinylpyrene and 4-vinylbenzo-18-crown-6, upon the binding of metal ions into the crown ether cavity, the emission intensity of the nanoparticle fluorescence from the conjugation of vinylpyrene was found to diminish, with the most significant effects observed with K<super>+</super> ions. In the case of ruthenium nanoparticles co-functionalized with pyrene and histidine derivative moieties through Ru=carbene &pi bonds. The selective complexation of the histidine moiety with transition metal ions led to marked diminishment of the emission intensity from conjugation of pyrene. Of all the metal ions tested, the impacts were much more drastic with Pb<super>2+</super>, Co<super>2+</super> and Hg<super>2+</super> than with Li<super>+</super>, K<super>+</super>, Rb<super>+</super>, Mg<super>2+</super> Ca<super>2+</super> and Zn<super>2+</super> ions.These were ascribed to the selective binding of 18-crown-6 to potassium ions or complexation of histidine derivative to transition metal ions, where the metal ions led to polarization of the nanoparticle core electrons to the metal surface and hence impeded intraparticle charge delocalization. Functionalization of semiconductor with metal nanoparticles could be exploited to remarkably enhance their photo catalytic performance. Before this exploration, in the last chapter, the impacts of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystalline structure on the photocatalytic activity were then examined by using the reduction of methylene blue in water. It was found that in the presence of anatase and brookite crystalline phase, TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube arrays exhibited the highest photo catalytic activity. This is ascribed to synergistic coupling of the anatase and brookite crystalline domains, which led to effective charge separation upon photoirradiation.

Statistical Behavior of Quasi-Steady Balanced Reconnection in Earth's Magnetosphere
Magnetic reconnection between Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind results in several modes of response, including the impulsive substorm and the quasi-steady mode known as steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). SMC events are theorized to result from balancing the dayside and nightside reconnection rates. The reasons the magnetosphere responds with different modes are not fully known. This dissertation comprises statistical data analysis of the SMC mode to investigate the solar wind conditions and magnetospheric properties during these events. A comprehensive list of SMC events is selected from 1997-2011. 	In the first of three studies, an association between SMCs and solar wind stream interfaces (SI) is identified in the declining phase of Solar Cycle 23. SMC occurrence peaks 12-24 hours after an SI if the solar wind is geoeffective. The subset of SI-associated SMCs occurs during fast solar wind velocity, in contrast to previous results, but the driving electric field imposed on the magnetosphere (E<sub>y</sub>) is the same for SI-associated and unassociated SMC events. Therefore the magnitude and steadiness of E<sub>y</sub> is the most important solar wind parameter for an SMC to occur.	The second study shows that magnetotail convection is significantly different for SMC events, compared to quiet intervals and isolated substorms. Fast flows transporting enhanced magnetic flux are deflected toward the dawn and dusk flanks during SMC. Flow diversion is due to a broad high pressure region in the inner magnetosphere. The interval preceding SMC events is found to set up the magnetotail conditions that assist balanced reconnection. In particular inner magnetosphere pressure before SMCs is enhanced from substorm levels but not as high as SMC levels. The final study shows that nearly all SMCs are preceded by a substorm expansion. In rare cases when an SMC occurs without a preceding substorm, we hypothesize that the distant x-line is able to balance a weak solar wind driver. 	These results help explain how quasi-steady magnetospheric convection occurs. A southward turning of the solar wind and positive E<sub>y</sub> leads to dayside reconnection and a substorm onset occurs. Plasma injections from the near-Earth nightside x-line increase the pressure in the inner magnetosphere. If positive E<sub>y</sub> continues to drive dayside reconnection, the nightside x-line will stabilize to match it. Tail flux is diverted towards the flanks by pressure gradients and returns to the dayside. This convection pattern keeps the magnetosphere in its balanced reconnection mode.

Tracking the mechanical dynamics of human embryonic stem cell chromatin
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					A plastic chromatin structure has emerged as fundamental to the self-renewal and pluripotent capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Direct measurement of chromatin dynamics in vivo is, however, challenging as high spatiotemporal resolution is required. Here, we present a new tracking-based method which can detect high frequency chromatin movement and quantify the mechanical dynamics of chromatin in live cells.
				
				
					
						Results
					We use this method to study how the mechanical properties of chromatin movement in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are modulated spatiotemporally during differentiation into cardiomyocytes (CM). Notably, we find that pluripotency is associated with a highly discrete, energy-dependent frequency of chromatin movement that we refer to as a &#8216;breathing&#8217; state. We find that this &#8216;breathing&#8217; state is strictly dependent on the metabolic state of the cell and is progressively silenced during differentiation.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We thus propose that the measured chromatin high frequency movements in hESCs may represent a hallmark of pluripotency and serve as a mechanism to maintain the genome in a transcriptionally accessible state. This is a result that could not have been observed without the high spatial and temporal resolution provided by this novel tracking method.

Nuclear Factor kappa B is central to Marek's Disease herpesvirus induced neoplastic transformation of CD30 expressing lymphocytes in-vivo
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Marek&#8217;s Disease (MD) is a hyperproliferative, lymphomatous, neoplastic disease of chickens caused by the oncogenic Gallid herpesvirus type 2 (GaHV-2; MDV). Like several human lymphomas the neoplastic MD lymphoma cells overexpress the CD30 antigen (CD30hi) and are in minority, while the non-neoplastic cells (CD30lo) form the majority of population. MD is a unique natural in-vivo model of human CD30hi lymphomas with both natural CD30hi lymphomagenesis and spontaneous regression. The exact mechanism of neoplastic transformation from CD30lo expressing phenotype to CD30hi expressing neoplastic phenotype is unknown. Here, using microarray, proteomics and Systems Biology modeling; we compare the global gene expression of CD30lo and CD30hi cells to identify key pathways of neoplastic transformation. We propose and test a specific mechanism of neoplastic transformation, and genetic resistance, involving the MDV oncogene Meq, host gene products of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-&#954;B) family and CD30; we also identify a novel Meq protein interactome.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Our results show that a) CD30lo lymphocytes are pre-neoplastic precursors and not merely reactive lymphocytes; b) multiple transformation mechanisms exist and are potentially controlled by Meq; c) Meq can drive a feed-forward cycle that induces CD30 transcription, increases CD30 signaling which activates NF-&#954;B, and, in turn, increases Meq transcription; d) Meq transcriptional repression or activation of the CD30 promoter generally correlates with polymorphisms in the CD30 promoter distinguishing MD-lymphoma resistant and susceptible chicken genotypes e) MDV oncoprotein Meq interacts with proteins involved in physiological processes central to lymphomagenesis.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					In the context of the MD lymphoma microenvironment (and potentially in other CD30hi lymphomas as well), our results show that the neoplastic transformation is a continuum and the non-neoplastic cells are actually pre-neoplastic precursor cells and not merely immune bystanders. We also show that NF-&#954;B is a central player in MDV induced neoplastic transformation of CD30-expressing lymphocytes in vivo. Our results provide insights into molecular mechanisms of neoplastic transformation in MD specifically and also herpesvirus induced lymphoma in general.

Phosphate Sensing in Root Development
Inadequate availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the rhizosphere is a common challenge to plants, which activate metabolic and developmental responses to maximize Pi acquisition.  The sensory mechanisms that monitor environmental Pi status and regulate root growth via altered meristem activity are unknown.  We show that PHOSPHATE DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (PDR2) encodes the single P5-type ATPase of Arabidopsis thaliana.  PDR2 functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is required for proper expression of SCARECROW (SCR), a key regulator of root patterning, and for stem cell maintenance in Pi-deprived roots.  We further show that the multicopper oxidase encoded by LOW PHOSPHATE ROOT1 (LPR1) is targeted to the ER and that LPR1 and PDR2 interact genetically.  Since the expression domains of both genes overlap in the stem cell niche and distal root meristem, we propose that PDR2 and LPR1 function together in an ER-resident pathway that adjusts root meristem activity to external Pi.  Our data indicate that the Pi-conditional root phenotype of pdr2 is not caused by increased Fe availability in low Pi; however, Fe homeostasis modifies the developmental response of root meristems to Pi availability.

Microbial responses and coral reef resilience to organic matter inputs
Little attention has been given to the small-scale mechanisms relevant to microbial processes that determine the resilience of individual corals to the stress of organic matter (OM) inputs. Such mechanisms may be a critical link for predicting larger scale patterns of reef resilience. The research presented here aims to develop methods necessary to elucidate these processes and to explore the in situ responses of microbial assemblages on coral reefs experiencing persistent OM enrichment. A new method using trypsinization of coral mucus before staining for epifluorescence microscopy is described. It is then applied to a coral reef ecosystem influenced by sewage effluent to discover that corals exposed to effluent had the same number of bacteria present as reference corals; however, the size structure of the community was significantly different. Investigating the responses of microbial communities (from both the water column and corals) to OM inputs from coastal milkfish (Chanos chanos) pens, we found that the percentage of the water bacterial community attached to particles increased by more than 50- fold near the pens. This suggested a physiological or life -strategy change may be induced by such enrichment. A clonally replicated coral transplantation experiment examined the response of naïve coral-associated bacterial communities to high and low levels of pen effluent exposure. We found that the communities on corals exposed to high levels of effluent had drastically altered community compositions after five days and the abundance of bacteria in the coral mucus-tissue slurries were ̃100- fold higher controls at low effluent and reference sites. We also observed a surprising resilience of these communities in that their composition and total abundance recovered by day 22. A combination of novel imaging technology (high speed laser scanning confocal microscopy on live coral) and controlled aquaria experiments were developed and used to investigate a microscale mechanism by which such resilience may occur: that corals may release ("shed") bacteria into the surrounding water as a mechanism for controlling bacterial abundance on their surface. We observed this phenomenon in real time, and quantified an increase in the rate at which corals shed bacteria as a response to OM enrichment

Quantum dynamics and magneto-structural correlations in molecule based magnets
The synthesis and study of magnetic nanostructures is of both intense scientific and technological interest. A single-molecule magnet (SMM) is a molecular nanomagnet that can be magnetized as a result of having a large spin ground state that experiences appreciable magnetoanisotropy, which leads to a thermodynamic barrier between "spin-up" and "spin-down" orientations. The monodisperse nature (same size, shape and anisotropy) of SMMs permits detailed studies of the magnetization and quantum dynamics of nanomagnets. The discovery of SMMs permitted, for the first time, detailed study of quantum effects associated with nanomagnets. The magnetic and quantum properties of these complexes is heavily dictated by molecular and crystal symmetry, and paramount to employing these systems as devices is a need to thoroughly understand and control environmental factors that govern their magnetization and quantum dynamics. To some extent this can be achieved by changing or eliminating co- crystallized solvate molecules and interchanging coordinated peripheral ligands. Magnetic and thermodynamic studies were carried out on a high symmetry system that exhibits a large spin ground state (S =51/2), a preferred orientation in an applied magnetic field, and slow magnetization relaxation dynamics. Strong competing magnetic exchange coupling between paramagnetic copper and manganese ions, in conjunction with high symmetry, gives rise to appreciable spin-frustration and geometric- frustration. These correlated effects lead to slow magnetization relaxation behavior. Detailed magnetization and thermodynamic studies were performed on a series of tetranuclear nickel complexes that exhibit fast magnetization tunneling and magnetic ordering. Magnetic ordering is a collective process that should drastically suppress or terminate quantum tunneling processes. It is revealed that even in an ordered state, the molecules within the crystal lattice act as single domains, thus, molecules quickly switch between magnetic ordering and single-domain quantum tunneling. A series/family of multifunctional tetranuclear manganese SMMs (magnetic and photoluminescent) were synthesized that systematically differ in co-crystallized solvate molecules and peripheral organic ligands to study magneto-structural correlation effects and quantum tunneling of magnetization. The goal is to couple emissive excited states to the magnetic moment of the SMM, which may allow, for the first time, detailed study of quantum dynamics on a 10⁻⁹-10⁻¹²s time scale

Although the high prevalence of circulating and unique recombinant forms of HIV-1, which can only be generated in the setting of dual infection, indicates that dual infection is not rare, relatively few cases of it have been documented. Hypothesizing that existing methods to detect dual infection were insufficiently sensitive, we developed and validated a novel technique utilizing 454 ultra-deep sequencing to detect low minority viral populations. We then applied this method to determine the prevalence of dual infection in a well-characterized study cohort and investigated the identified dual infection cases for clinical, virologic, and immunologic correlates of dual infection. At approximately 40% of the cost and 20% of the laboratory and analysis time of previous methods, ultra- deep sequencing identified three times more dual infection cases than previously documented in this study cohort. Dually infected participants had significantly faster viral load increases than monoinfected controls and displayed multiple patterns of viral recombination and CTL escape

Brain Dimorphisms and Sex:  A Review
Inthis article we review evidence from studies of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which bears on the question of whether differences in sexual behaviour are reflected by differences in central nervous system (CNS) structure. Neural structures in fish demonstrate the existence of both inter- and intra-sexual dimorphisms related to dimorphic behaviours, as well as environmentally triggered changes in the size of neural structures. Seasonal changes in neural structure in amphibians have demonstrated a strong correlation between sexually dimorphic brain structures and sex-specific behaviours. While in reptiles there are some examples of sexually dimorphic CNS structures, C.uniparens demonstrates that differences in brain morphology are not necessary to display sexually distinct behaviour. Birds demonstrate the clearest sex related brain-behaviour differences; the song control nuclei exhibit substantial differences in size between the sexes varying in magnitude in relation to the amount of sexual dimorphism in song production. There are sexually dimorphic areas in the mammalian brain, in areas associated with sexual and maternal behaviour, which  are correlated with differences in hormonal environments during ontogeny. No single phyletic trend is obvious, though this could be the consequence of a small number of taxa examined or the different aims of the studies. It appears that sexuality has not necessarily evolved linearly from a particular primitive vertebrate ancestor but is manifested variously in different vertebrate classes, most likely as the result of distinct environmental pressures.

The role of regulatory light chain phosphorylation in left ventricular function
Myosin regulatory light chain associates with the motor protein myosin and plays an important but poorly understood role in regulating behavior of cardiac muscle. Mutations to regulatory light chain, including those which affect its phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase, have been linked to cardiomyopathies. This protein, as well as several others, are linked together by complex structural interactions to form the myofilament system of cardiac muscle. These interactions make it difficult to extend in-vitro results using isolated regulatory light chain to physiologically relevant conditions. The purpose of this work was to formulate and test predictions regarding the effects of light chain phosphorylation on the function of the mammalian left ventrical. An approach combining experiments and computational models was developed and implemented to describe effects of light chain phosphorylation on function of the intact heart

A Hybrid Density Functional Theory for Solvation and Solvent-Mediated Interactions
Recent years have witnessed a renewed interest in statistical mechanics of solvation directed toward a better understanding of hydration and water-mediated interactions from a molecular perspective. A good understanding of aqueous solvation is essential not only in solution thermodynamics but also for studying functions and interfacial properties of nanostructured materials in a solution environment. Such knowledge is also indispensable for understanding biological processes in vivo and in vitro. While conventional theories of solvation are mostly based on a continuous representation of the solvent, due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the properties of solvent molecules near solute surface, the materials fabrication and self-assembly of functional biomacromolecules often rely on costly and time-consuming "trial-and-error" approaches. The objective of this Ph.D. research is to provide a theoretical framework for efficient investigation of the microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of flexible and rigid molecules in solution through a unified density functional theory (DFT) and a hybrid method incorporating molecular simulations. Toward that end, I have applied the DFT to the study of the microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of polymers and polyelectrolytes in in confined geometry. I have tested the numerical performance of the DFT with molecular simulations and scaling analysis and examined the effects of packing densities, the curvature of confinement, the degree of polymerization, the salt concentration and valence on the properties and microscopic structure of confined polymers and polyelectrolytes. In addition, I developed a hybrid method combining the molecular simulations and used the DFT to study the microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of complex systems. While molecular simulation can provide the microscopic structure, the DFT can connect the microscopic structure to the thermodynamic properties through accurate free energy functional. This efficient hybrid method was extend to the study of colloidal interactions and potential of mean force underlying "lock-and-key" interactions in a solution environment and to ion solvation in water. The numerical performance of hybrid method is very good comparing to molecular simulations, while the new method drastically reduces the calculation time. Furthermore, I studied the solvent distribution and behavior near a solute ranging from microscopic to macroscopic scales, which is closely related to the understanding of hydrophobic phenomena and fabrication of superhydrophobic materials. Lastly, the solvation free energy of nanoparticles and the shape effect on the nanoparticle solvation were investigated through morphological thermodynamic with negligible computational costs. Accomplishments from this work contribute toward a better understanding of solvation and solvent-mediated interactions in complicated molecular systems and will have broad impacts on both fundamental research and engineering applications.

Computational studies of the breathing motion of the metal -organic framework DMOF-1
The breathing behavior of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an exciting new phenomenon in which a framework significantly changes unit cell shape depending on adsorbent, change in pressure, or temperature. There are few force fields capable of computationally describing MOF breathing behavior, and they exist only for MIL-53. In this study, fully flexible force fields were created for the MOF "DMOF-1" (Zn₂(BDC)₂(DABCO)), which is known to breathe with the addition of benzene and isopropyl alcohol, and upon post-synthetic modification with amines. Over the course of the study, three flexible force fields were examined: a non-bonded force field, a restrained force field, and a fully-bonded force field. The non-bonded and restrained force fields represented the Zn-ligand bonds by electrostatic interactions, and did not reasonably simulate the DMOF-1 breathing behavior. The fully-bonded force field explicitly described the Zn-ligand interactions and was found to quantitatively reproduce experimental data of DMOF-1 and of DMOF-1 with benzene, and qualitatively reproduce DMOF-1 with isopropyl alcohol. The aminated DMOF-1 series DMOF-1-AM1 to DMOF-1-AM4 was not as successfully modeled, however. The fully-bonded force field incorrectly predicted the DMOF-1-AM1 and DMOF- 1-AM2 structures to be in a large pore configuration. This highlights a potential issue with force field transferability between different breathing systems for DMOF-1, a current problem with flexible MOF force fields. At present, it is not clear whether the difficulties in transferability to the aminated framework are due to insufficient representation of to the amine chains or a more fundamental problem describing the framework flexibility

[temperature, thermal, technique, sensor, dtm, accurate]

Accurate temperature sensing and efficient dynamic thermal management in MPSoCs
Constant increase in performance demands, more aggressive technology scaling and higher transistor integration capacity result in continuously increasing power density and temperature in multi-processor System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. Dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques try to avoid thermal violations by enabling the chip to control its temperature at runtime. To do this, accurate runtime temperature information is necessary, which is typically obtained from on-die thermal sensors. Sensor accuracy can be significantly affected by factors such as sensor degradation and failure, limitations on the number of sensors and their placement, dynamic change of hotspot locations, etc. To improve the accuracy of temperature sensing, which directly affects the efficiency of DTM, two techniques are proposed. Accurate direct temperature sensing is a design time technique for optimum allocation and placement of on-chip thermal sensors. It targets the inaccuracies due to sensor placement and can reduce the number of thermal sensors by 16% on average. Accurate indirect temperature sensing is a runtime technique which targets the sources of inaccuracy which cannot be addressed at design time. Based on inaccurate readings from a few noisy sensors, this method accurately estimates the temperature at any location on the die. It also reduces mean absolute error and standard deviation of the errors by up to an order of magnitude. DTM efficiency can be improved by predicting changes in temperature and proactively controlling them, which reduces DTM's response time and performance overhead. We propose a temperature prediction technique called Tempo to accurately evaluate the thermal impact of DTM actions. Compared to previous temperature prediction techniques, Tempo can reduce the maximum prediction error by up to an order of magnitude. Heterogeneous MPSoCs which integrate various types of cores are particularly at a disadvantage from a thermal perspective, due to the inherent imbalance in power density distribution. We present PROMETHEUS, a thermal management framework which systematically performs proactive temperature-aware scheduling for heterogeneous (and homogeneous) MPSoCs. PROMETHEUS framework provides two alternative temperature-aware scheduling techniques: TempoMP which uses online optimization for optimal power state assignment to the cores, and a more scalable technique TemPrompt, which is based on a heuristics and has a lower overhead

[haplotype, pfcrt, pfmdr1, angola, falciparum]

Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Angola show the StctVMNT haplotype in the pfcrt gene
Abstract



Background

Effective treatment remains a mainstay of malaria control, but it is unfortunately strongly compromised by drug resistance, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum, the most important human malaria parasite. Although P. falciparum chemoresistance is well recognized all over the world, limited data are available on the distribution and prevalence of pfcrt and pfmdr1 haplotypes that mediate resistance to commonly used drugs and that show distinct geographic differences.



Methods


Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood samples collected in 2007 at four municipalities of Luanda, Angola, were genotyped using PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the P. falciparum pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes were assessed and haplotype prevalences were determined.



Results and Discussion

The most prevalent pfcrt haplotype was S
tctVMNT (representing amino acids at codons 72-76). This result was unexpected, since the S
tctVMNT haplotype has previously been seen mainly in parasites from South America and India. The CVIET, CVMNT and CVINT drug-resistance haplotypes were also found, and one previously undescribed haplotype (CVMDT) was detected. Regarding pfmdr1, the most prevalent haplotype was YEYSNVD (representing amino acids at codons 86, 130, 184, 1034, 1042, 1109 and 1246). Wild haplotypes for pfcrt and pfmdr1 were uncommon; 3% of field isolates harbored wild type pfcrt (CVMNK), whereas 21% had wild type pfmdr1 (NEYSNVD). The observed predominance of the S
tctVMNT haplotype in Angola could be a result of frequent travel between Brazil and Angola citizens in the context of selective pressure of heavy CQ use.



Conclusions

The high prevalence of the pfcrt 
SVMNT haplotype and the pfmdr1 86Y mutation confirm high-level chloroquine resistance and might suggest reduced efficacy of amodiaquine in Angola. Further studies must be encouraged to examine the in vitro sensitivity of pfcrt 
SVMNT parasites to artesunate and amodiaquine for better conclusive data.

Activity-dependent ubiquitination of GluR1 mediates a distinct AMPAR endocytosis and sorting pathway in hippocampal neurons
The accurate trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to and from excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus is a critical component of mammalian learning and memory. In conjunction, recent research suggests that dysfunction of AMPAR trafficking in the hippocampus may be an underlying mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. Previous work has shown that ubiquitination of integral membrane proteins is a common post-translational modification used to mediate endocytosis and endocytic sorting of surface proteins in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that mammalian AMPARs may become ubiquitinated to regulate their synaptic stability in neurons. Here we report that mammalian AMPARs become ubiquitinated in response to their activation. Using a mutant of GluR1 that is unable to be ubiquitinated at lysines on its carboxy-terminus, we demonstrate that these ubiquitination sites are required for internalization of surface AMPARs and their trafficking to the lysosome in response to the AMPAR agonist AMPA, but not for internalization of AMPARs in response to NMDA receptor (NMDAR) agonist NMDA. Through over-expression or RNAi-mediated knockdown, we identify that a specific E3 ligase, Nedd4-1, is necessary for this process. Finally, we show that ubiquitination of GluR1 by Nedd4-1 is much more prevalent in aged neurons. Together, these data show that ubiquitination of GluR1-containing AMPARs by Nedd4-1 mediates their endocytosis and trafficking to the lysosome. Furthermore, these results provide insight into how hippocampal neurons regulate AMPAR trafficking and degradation with high specificity in response to differing neuronal signaling cues, and suggest that changes to this pathway may occur with age

New insights into the origin, transport and behavior of noble gases : examples from Monterey Bay, Costa Rica, Iceland, and the Central Indian Ridge
The study of volatiles in both subaerial and submarine terrestrial samples is central to understanding the compositions of, and interactions between, the mantle- crust-atmosphere system. This dissertation focuses on the origin, transport and behavior of noble gases at four different geologic settings - a) the San Andreas Fault Zone (SAFZ), a transform plate boundary, b) the Costa Rica margin, a convergent plate boundary, c) Iceland, a ridge- centered hotspot, and d) the Central Indian Ridge, a mid- ocean ridge segment near an off-axis hotspot. Following a brief introduction to the utility of noble gases as geochemical tracers (Chapter I), the helium characteristics of submarine fluid seepage in a strike- slip setting associated with the SAFZ are discussed in Chapter II. Cold seep sites at Extrovert Cliff (Monterey Bay) were chosen for deployment of submarine flux meters and continuous sampling of fluids over several weeks. We assess the origin of dissolved noble gases in the seep fluids, and determine the cause of any temporal variations of the volatile characteristics. Chapter III focuses on the He-CO₂ isotope and abundance systematics of submarine cold seep fluids emanating at the Costa Rica fore-arc. We evaluate the origin of dissolved helium and carbon in the fluids, and we estimate the total flux of carbon through fluid venting at mound structures at the fore-arc in order to better constrain the carbon mass balance for the Central America convergent margin. Chapter IV examines the He-Ne systematics of geothermal fluids and the He-Ne-Ar isotope and relative abundance characteristics of subglacial glasses from the neovolcanic zones and older parts of the crust in Iceland. We investigate the processes contributing to the apparent decoupling of the He and Ne isotope systematics observed previously on the Reykjanes Peninsula and question whether this phenomenon is common to other parts of the neovolcanic zones. Chapter V investigates the postulated interaction between the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) and the Réunion hotspot, located 1̃100 km off-axis to the west. The CIR passed over the hotspot 34 Ma ago, and the goal of this study is to test if CIR basalts still record a Réunion-like helium isotope signature

Electronic and Spintronic Properties of Graphene
In this thesis, I summarize our studies investigating the electronic properties and spintronic properties of transition metal doped graphene over the last six years. In chapter 2, I will be talking about the device fabrication steps including our graphene exfoliation, graphene identification, ebeam lithography steps and electrode metallization. The measurement setup, including our molecular epitaxy system (MBE) and AC lock-in measurement, will also be discussed in detail. To utilize graphene as an electronic base material, it is important to understand the interface between contact electrodes and graphene. Transition metals (TMs) have been widely used as a contact material for graphene devices but the charge transfer mechanism between TMs and graphene was not well understood. A specially designed MBE system was built to deposit TM atoms onto graphene devices and to measure the magnetotransport properties in situ. In chapter 3, I will be discussing our experimental studies on the charge transfer, scattering, and effects of cluster formation on graphene. These results are important for improving the performance of graphene electronic devices.For graphene spintronics, one of the most important questions is the spin relaxation mechanism in graphene. It is theoretically predicted to have a long spin lifetime of over 1 ms. However, spin lifetimes observed are only about 200 ps. The big difference between these two values is an important scientific question to address in order to achieve long spin diffusion length. In chapter 4, I utilized molecular beam epitaxial growth to systematically study the spin lifetime in graphene. It is demonstrated that Coulomb scattering (charged impurities) is not the dominant spin relaxation mechanism.

Genome-wide association study identifies a maternal
copy-number deletion in PSG11 enriched among
preeclampsia patients
AbstractBackgroundSpecific genetic contributions for preeclampsia (PE) are currently unknown. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) aims to identify maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy-number variants (CNVs) involved in the etiology of PE.MethodsA genome-wide scan was performed on 177 PE cases (diagnosed according to National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute guidelines) and 116 normotensive controls. White female study subjects from Iowa were genotyped on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays. CNV calls made using a combination of four detection algorithms (Birdseye, Canary, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP) were merged using CNVision and screened with stringent prioritization criteria. Due to limited DNA quantities and the deleterious nature of copy-number deletions, it was decided a priori that only deletions would be selected for assay on the entire case-control dataset using quantitative real-time PCR.ResultsThe top four SNP candidates had an allelic or genotypic p-value between 10-5 and 10-6, however, none surpassed the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. Three recurrent rare deletions meeting prioritization criteria detected in multiple cases were selected for targeted genotyping. A locus of particular interest was found showing an enrichment of case deletions in 19q13.31 (5/169 cases and 1/114 controls), which encompasses the PSG11 gene contiguous to a highly plastic genomic region. All algorithm calls for these regions were assay confirmed.ConclusionsCNVs may confer risk for PE and represent interesting regions that warrant further investigation. Top SNP candidates identified from the GWAS, although not genome-wide significant, may be useful to inform future studies in PE genetics.

A New Approach to Forming a Typology of  Kinship Terminology Systems: From Morgan and Murdock to the Present
This paper addresses typological relationships among kinship terminologies determined from structural differences in the way kin terms are organized as systems of concepts.  Viewing a terminology as a system of concepts makes evident the generative logic of a terminology that starts with properties shared across several terminologies and eventually includes properties specific to a single terminology.  These structural properties lead to a typology in which structural differences between terminologies form the branch points.  The typology highlights two primary dimensions along which terminologies may be distinguished: (1) structural differences between terminologies and (2) variation in the morphology of the lexemic form of kin terms.  Variation in the former relates to change constrained in the cultural domain and change in the latter relates to change constrained in the linguistic domain.

Fractal Realism: The Folding Together of Literature, Technical Media, and Cognition in the Twentieth Century
Media theorists as far back as Marshall McLuhan and as recent as Friedrich Kittler and Jonathan Crary have asserted that since the photograph's and gramophone's invention in the nineteenth century, technical apparatuses have increasingly come to extend and simulate the humans senses. My dissertation argues that the convergence of these technical media with automated technical apparatuses begins a recursive cycle. The technical apparatus encodes itself through various technical media, and as a result, produces new technical media. This cycle of encoding and re-encoding is cognitive, and constitutes what I call a nonhuman cognitive system. I trace this evolution of this nonhuman cognition from early cybernetic devices like Vannevar Bush's Differential Analyzer to the contemporary digital computer.This evolution of technical bodies is still closely intertwined with human ones, because the technical media enabling the nonhuman cognition's evolution also encode images, sounds, and narratives for human cognitions. The so-called realism that technical media enable (i.e., a greater degree of verisimilitude to what humans actually see, hear, feel, etc.) is actually what I call fractal realism. It is fractal because humans and nonhumans use different cognitive schemes for mediating or encoding their reality, and so fracture their world as both cognitions work on it. It is fractal as well, because the nonhuman cognitions rely on statistical measures rather than narrative chains of cause-and-effect to order their encodings, just as fractal sets are defined by their statistical self-similarity. Under fractal realism, mediation is not a means of conveying information between parties but rather the conversion of one medium into the pattern of another medium. I argue that we understand mediation as, what Gilbert Simondon calls, a transductive process.Given the tight link of cognition and mediation, I parallel the account of the nonhuman cognition's evolution with an examination of how its statistical mode infiltrates and affects media as humans understand them. We can then see fractal realism as a new genre that cuts across realism and postmodernist literature and cinema.

[rat, nucleus, layer, thalamus, cell]

Substructure within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the pigmented rat
Much can be learned about the functional organization of the visual system by examining its anatomy. In traditionally-studied cat and primate species, certain morphological types of retinal ganglion cells project to specific thalamic and then cortical layers, separated by eye in each region. In addition, physiology shows that information is segregated by functional cell type; each layer is a complete or near-complete map of some aspect of the world such as form and motion. This results in a system that can easily distribute specialized information without disrupting the larger visuo-spatial map. While the layers of the macaque retino-recipient thalamus are easily discernible due to the correlation between cytoarchitecture and function, the rat geniculate appears to have no such patterning. As the rat is a favorable research model, it is important to understand how its brain is set up to tackle the same visual problems as that of higher mammals. The purpose of this project was to describe substructure within the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, with the goal of learning more about how the anatomical organization might give insight into function. To visualize the anatomy, I intra-occularly injected retrograde tracer to map retinal termini throughout the nucleus. Based on three-dimensional reconstructions of termination zones from each eye, I identified multiple ipsilaterally-recipient zones within the largely contralateral thalamic nucleus. These ipsilateral subregions are more reminiscent of the layering in the primate thalamus than previously described in the rat. Furthermore, the nucleus appears to be well segregated by eye, suggesting that, like in these other species, the rat thalamus passes on information without binocular mixing. My findings also support the hypothesis that, unlike in the primate, rat cell bodies throughout the layers appear to be cytoarchitecturally homogeneous. While we can glean insight into the function of macaque thalamic layers by looking at cell-body statistics such as size and density, no such patterns can be seen in the rat. Among other possibilities, this could mean that rat projection neurons have similar morphologies, or that functional cell types are intermingled and not spatially organized as they are in other species

Functional Domains of Neuron-to-Astrocyte Gq GPCR Communication
The physiological role of astrocytic Gq-protein coupled receptors (Gq GPCRs) has now drawn more attention in the field of neuroscience, as it is now clear that astrocytes sense neuronal signals through activation of their Gq GPCRs. Astrocytes are thus considered excitable and their role in synaptic transmission is under intense investigation. Interestingly, in basal conditions without any user-evoked stimulation, astrocytes exhibit spontaneous Gq GPCR activity driven by mechanisms that still remain mysterious. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these astrocytic Gq GPCR signaling domains in physiological conditions will certainly benefit our knowledge regarding neuron-to-astrocyte communication. Therefore, the main goal of this dissertation is to study the underlying mechanisms of astrocytic Gq GPCR signaling domains in two parts: 1) To identify the factors governing spontaneous astrocytic Gq GPCR activity, and 2) To identify the lowest threshold of neuronal action potential-mediated synaptic transmission capable of evoking an astrocytic Gq GPCR response, and then to determine if the response occurs as a microdomain or a whole-cell event. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate that spontaneous astrocytic Gq GPCR signaling domains are driven by mechanisms unrelated to action potential-triggered neurotransmitter release, but are dependent on spontaneous miniature neurotransmitter release. It also appears that multiple types of astrocytic Gq GPCRs play essential roles in the generation of spontaneous Gq GPCR activity. In Chapter 3, our results suggest that astrocytes respond to neuronal afferent stimulation at intensities much lower than previously described. Moreover, the evoked Gq GPCR domains are qualitatively different from the spontaneous ones. Consistent with the findings from Chapter 2, the evoked events appear to involve multiple types of astrocytic Gq GPCRs. These data suggest that astrocytes respond to neuronal activity in a manner much more sensitive than previously thought. We also explored the role of beta-Arrestin2 in regulating two forms of synaptic plasticity-long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In Chapter 4, we report normal LTP, but a markedly impaired LTD in beta-Arrestin2 knockout mice, suggesting a novel role of beta-Arrestin2 in cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. This finding could potentially provide a base for developing treatments for dementia-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

A Study of the Mechanism for Pollen Tube Growth
Through this PhD thesis work, the mechanism for pollen tube growth is studied using combined modeling and experimental approaches. In chapter 1 of this thesis, we proposed mathematical models for ROP1 activity oscillation at apex of pollen tubes. Our combined theoretical and experimental studies suggested that ROP1 activity oscillation depends on downstream ROP1 signaling events, F-actin assembly and calcium accumulation, which positively and negatively feedback regulate ROP1 activity, respectively. Our findings suggested a key role for calcium in the negative feedback regulation of ROP1 activity. In chapter 2 of this thesis, we proposed and experimentally validated a model coupling both active ROP1 polarity establishment and pollen tube morphogenesis. We revealed that exocytosis is the key process linking ROP1 GTPase polarity establishment, cell wall pectin distribution and polarized cell growth. Through exocytosis mediated positive feedback loop, RopGAP mediated global inhibition and lateral diffusion of ROP1 GTPase on plasma membrane, active ROP1 GTPases polarity can be established and maintained. Once maintained, active ROP1 controls cell wall mechanics via control of pectin exocytosis and thus determines the shape of pollen tubes. Experimentally, we also validated the model through both genetic (ren1-1 mutant) and chemical (Latrunculin B treatment) perturbation of pollen tube morphogenesis process. In Chapter 3 of this thesis, we studied the mechanism of endocytosis in pollen tubes. We revealed that two interconvertible phosphoinositides, PI(4,5)P2 and PI4P, function in different steps of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in pollen tubes. Whereas accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 is required for the initial steps of membrane invagination, PI4P is required for the later steps of closing and/or fission of invaginated membrane. Given previous findings that both the accumulation and the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 are required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and animal cells, a balance between PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 may provide a common mechanism underlying clathrin-dependent endocytosis in various eukaryotic systems.

A Parametrix Construction for Low Regularity Wave Equations and Spectral Rigidity for Two Dimensional Periodic Schroedinger Operators
This dissertation consists of two parts. In the first half, we construct a frame of complex Gaussians for the space of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ functions.  When propagated along bicharacteristics for the wave equation, the frame can be used to build a parametrix with suitable error terms.  When the coefficients of the wave equation have more regularity, propagated frame functions become Gaussian beams. In the latter half, we consider two dimensional real-valued analytic potentials for the Schroedinger equation which are periodic over a lattice $\mathbb{L}$. Under certain assumptions on the form of the potential and the lattice $\mathbb{L}$, we can show there is a large class of analytic potentials which are Floquet rigid and dense in the set of $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{L})$ potentials. The result extends the work of Eskin et. al, in "On isospectral periodic potentials in $\mathbb{R}^n$, II."

It is well known that one of the biggest challenges toward good ZnO-based optoelectronic devices is the difficulty of reliably fabricating p-type ZnO due to the self-compensating effect from native defects(for example, oxygen vacancy Vo and zinc interstitial Zni) and/or H incorporation. There has already been a great deal of efforts on the fabrication of p-type ZnO films by doping group I (Na, Ag) and group V elements (N, P, As, Sb) as p-type dopants. In contrast, there have been only a few reports on p-type ZnO nanowires (doped with N, P and Na). Recently, researchers are interested in developing optoelectronic devices based on ZnO nanowires such as biosensors, ultraviolet detectors, ultraviolet light emitting diodes and electrically driven nanowire lasers. The growth of p-type ZnO nanowires with good stability will be an essential step for the applications of nanowires in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. In this dissertation, firstC n-type ZnO nanowire array and its application have been discussed. ZnO has very high electronic carrier mobility and electron affinity, making it a very possible candidate as an effective dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) semiconductor. The great properties of vertically aligned ZnO-nanowire array, such as large surface area and fast electron-transport rate, make it a very promising option for the photoanode of DSSCs. Nanowires provide electrons injected from optically excited dye a direct effective path to collecting electrode via the semiconductor conduction band, offering the potential for much faster charge transport than nanoparticle cells. In order to make homojunctional devices based on ZnO nanowire, a great deal of efforts has been made on the growth of p-type ZnO nanowire. Ag, a group Ib element, was predicted to be an acceptor in ZnO when incorporated into substitutional Zn sites and researchers experimentally demonstrated reliable fabrication of p-type ZnO thin films doped with Ag on sapphire substrate and also demonstrated the possibility of achieving Ag-doped p-type ZnO nanowires. Also Sb as an effective dopant for reproducible p-type ZnO thin films has been shown in our group. In chapter 3 of this dissertation, the synthesis and characterization of single-crystalline Ag-doped p-type ZnO nanowires and also Sb-doped p-type ZnO nanowire arrays have been discussed. In chapter 4 of this dissertation, ZnO homojunction photodiodes based on Sb-doped p-type nanowire array have been discussed. In chapter 5 of this dissertation, LED devices based on Sb-doped p-type nanowire array have been discussed. In chapter 6 of this dissertation, electrically pumped ZnO nanowire-waveguided lasing based on Sb-doped p-type nanowire array has been discussed. In chapter 7, the gain calculation for ZnO has been made and a brief discussion about the comparison between the calculation results and the experimental results has also been made.  In chapter 8, Lists of conclusions are made for this dissertation.

The effects of background adaptation and food availability on habitat preference of Corythoichthys flavofasciatus
Habitat preferences are intrinsically linked to factors that facilitate the survival of a species. The relationship between these factors determines how well a species does in its environment. Often habitat choice is related to the availability of food, presence of predators, and proximity to other viable habitats, amongst other variables. How these variables interact depends on fluctuations in the trophic web of which they are a part.Corythoichthys flavofasciatusis a species of pipefish that occurs in the fringing and back reefs of Mo’orea, French Polynesia. It feeds on zooplankton and occurs primarily on dead coral heads that are covered in algal turf. This study aimed to understand the relationship between zooplankton abundance, habitat quality, and substrate types on the habitat preferences of this pipefish. A field survey of the abundance of zooplankton in different habitats was used to determine if more food was available in habitats that were dominated by dead coral. Results suggest that more zooplankton are found above algal turf than live coral. A survey looking at pipefish abundance and amount of coral available in the habitat suggests that pipefish abundance correlates weakly to the amount of algal turf in the environment. An experiment quantifying color change in light and dark morphs of pipefish was conducted to determine if pipefish were capable of background adaptation, depending on substrate color. The results suggest that these observations were not statistically significant but warrant further research, using larger sample sizes. The findings of this study provide insight into the ecological role of pipefish in coral reef habitats.

Occupational Electric Shocks, Electromagnetic Fields and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
This dissertation examines the association of neurodegenerative diseases and electric occupations and evaluates electric shocks and magnetic fields exposures.  First, we conducted a meta-analysis of occupational electromagnetic fields (MF) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) to systematically explore methodological differences between studies.  Second, we developed an electric shocks job exposure matrix (JEM) to characterize occupations exposed to electric shocks.  Finally, we examined the association between occupational electric shocks, MF and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mortality.    We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies on occupational MF exposure and NDD.  We found weak associations of occupational MF exposures with both AD and MND, but not with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis.  Risk of developing MND was associated with electric occupations, while AD risk was associated with estimated MF levels.  Nonetheless, there is extensive result variation related to aspects of study design, with dissimilarity in this variation across diseases.  Our results do not support MF as the explanation for the observed electric occupation and MND association.  Misclassification of disease, particularly for AD, and imprecise exposure assessment affected most studies.    To evaluate a consistent association between jobs in "electric" occupations and ALS, we developed a comprehensive JEM that includes electric shocks and MF.  Electric shocks were based on two data sources along with expert judgment. Main occupational groups experiencing the electric shocks were precision production, craft and repair occupations. Specific jobs with high electric shock exposure were electrical apprentices, mechanic and repairer helpers, hoist and winch operators and electrical power installers.  Examples of job titles with low electric-shock exposures were administrative support occupations, data-key entry operators, and waiters and waitresses.    The relationship between occupational electric shocks, MF and ALS was investigated using cases identified in 1991-1999 U.S. mortality data.  For each ALS death, 10 sex-, age-, year- and region-matched controls were selected.  We linked the usual occupation reported on the death certificate to a JEM with electric shocks and MF.  Increased odds ratios were observed for ALS among those in electric occupations (OR=1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.47). For electric shocks, ALS mortality odds ratios were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.79) for high exposure and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) for medium exposure compared to low exposure.  For MF, ALS mortality odds ratios were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.19) for high exposure and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.23) for medium exposure as compared to low. However, ALS mortality increased only in electric occupations with medium and low electric shocks exposures. Current results support an association between electric occupations and ALS, but provide no evidence that this association is explained by occupational exposure to electric shocks or MF.

CaMKKbeta/AMPK Negatively Regulates Adiposity
Lipid synthesis and storage in adipose tissues contribute to energy homeostasis, which is inversely regulated by activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  Here, I report that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKbeta) negatively regulates lipogenesis in adipocytes through its phosphorylation of AMPK.  Specifically, the glucagon-activated CaMKKbeta/AMPK cascade inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity through the phosphorylation of ACC both in vitro and in vivo.  Fasting increases, whereas refeeding decreases, the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in CaMKKbeta+/+, but not in CaMKKbeta-/- mice.  Under ad libitum feeding, the increased expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)-mediated lipogenic gene is concurrent with decreased phosphorylation of AMPK-regulated ACC in white adipose tissue (WAT) of CaMKKbeta-/- mice.  In line with the inhibitory role of CaMKKbeta in lipid synthesis and storage, CaMKKbeta-/- mice exhibit increased body weight, adiposity, and adipocyte hypertrophy, although their appetite is comparable with the CaMKKbeta+/+ littermates.  Additionally, metformin, an AMPK activator, does not increase the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in WAT of CaMKKbeta-/- mice.  Thus, the CaMKKbeta/AMPK signaling is an important molecular event in physiological and pharmacological (e.g., metformin) regulation of adiposity.

[tumor, cell, endothelium, extravasation]

In Vitro Model of Tumor Cell Extravasation
Tumor cells that disseminate from the primary tumor and survive the vascular system can eventually extravasate across the endothelium to metastasize at a secondary site. In this study, we developed a microfluidic system to mimic tumor cell extravasation where cancer cells can transmigrate across an endothelial monolayer into a hydrogel that models the extracellular space. The experimental protocol is optimized to ensure the formation of an intact endothelium prior to the introduction of tumor cells and also to observe tumor cell extravasation by having a suitable tumor seeding density. Extravasation is observed for 38.8% of the tumor cells in contact with the endothelium within 1 day after their introduction. Permeability of the EC monolayer as measured by the diffusion of fluorescently-labeled dextran across the monolayer increased 3.8 fold 24 hours after introducing tumor cells, suggesting that the presence of tumor cells increases endothelial permeability. The percent of tumor cells extravasated remained nearly constant from1 to 3 days after tumor seeding, indicating extravasation in our system generally occurs within the first 24 hours of tumor cell contact with the endothelium.

Growth and phase velocity of self-modulated beam-driven plasma waves
A long, relativistic particle beam propagating in an overdense plasma is subject to the self-modulation instability.  This instability is analyzed and the growth rate is calculated, including the phase relation.  The phase velocity of the wake is shown to be significantly less than the beam velocity.  These results indicate that the energy gain of a plasma accelerator driven by a self-modulated beam will be severely limited by dephasing.  In the long-beam, strongly-coupled regime, dephasing is reached in a homogeneous plasma in less than four e-foldings, independent of beam-plasma parameters.

[synchrony, kelp, population, distance, environmental, scale, spatial, process]

Synchrony in dynamics of giant kelp forests is driven by both local recruitment and regional environmental controls
Populations of many species display spatially synchronous fluctuations in abundance. Synchrony is most commonly attributed to three processes: factors that influence recruitment (e.g., dispersal, early survival), large-scale environmental variability, and spatially autocorrelated trophic interactions. However it is often difficult to link population synchrony to a specific dominant process, particularly when multiple synchronizing forces are operating. We utilized a new satellite-based data set of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) canopy biomass to examine population synchrony in southern California kelp forests on spatial scales ranging from 50 m to 300 km and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 11 years. We examined the relationship between synchrony and distance for adult kelp populations, kelp recruits, sea urchin abundance (a major grazer of kelp), and environmental variables known to influence kelp population dynamics. Population synchrony in giant kelp decreased with distance between populations: an initial rapid exponential decrease between 50 m and 1.3 km was followed by a second, large-scale decrease between distances of 1.3 km and 172 km. The 50-m to 1.3-km spatial scale corresponded to the scales of synchrony in the abundance of sea urchins and young kelp recruits, suggesting that local drivers of predation and recruitment influence small-scale synchrony in kelp populations. The spatial correlation patterns of environmental variables, particularly wave height, were similar to the synchrony–distance relationship of kelp populations from 1.3 km to 172 km, suggesting that regional environmental variability, i.e., the Moran effect, was the dominant process affecting synchrony at larger spatial scales. This two-step pattern in the relationship between kelp biomass synchrony and distance was apparent in each of the 11 years of our study. Our results highlight the potential for synthesizing approaches from both landscape and population ecology in order to identify the multiple processes that generate synchrony in population dynamics.

Discovering the Multi-Faceted Roles of Ubiquitylation within the Human Malaria Parasite, Plasmodium falciparum
Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases, infecting 300-500 million and killing up to one million people globally every year. It is the world's leading cause of death in children and prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of South America, adversely impacting economic development in many impoverished countries. Though treatments for malaria do exist, the rising drug-resistances gained by the elusive malaria parasites counteract the efficacy of current treatments and beckon the need for new anti-malarials and new drug targets. One limiting factor for the development of new antimalarials is our poor understanding of the basic biology of the <italic>P. falciparum<italic>, the most lethal of the parasite species that cause human malaria. To better understand the parasite biology, we investigate the importance of post-translational modification, specifically ubiquitylation, in regulating <italic>Plasmodium<italic> biology. On a genome-wide scale, we identify the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> "ubiquitome", which is the population of proteins that are likely to be modified by ubiquitin. We have found that the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> ubiquitome takes up a large portion of the entire <italic>Plasmodium<italic> protein population, which suggests that ubiquitylation is an important aspect of the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> biology. Furthermore, our findings show that the roles of ubiquitin in the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> has both conserved and also parasite-specific functions, such as invasion, hemoglobin metabolism, and liver stage-specific purposes. To fuller expand our understanding of the ubiquitylation pathway in the malaria parasite, we investigate the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, as well as a newly identified duplicated ERAD-like system. In eukaryotic cells, the ERAD pathway serves to recognize misfolded proteins within the ER lumen and label them with ubiquitin for proteasome degradation. Here, we characterize the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> ERAD system with a combination of localization studies, <italic>in vitro<italic> biochemical assays, and knockout experiments. Altogether, our findings indicate that the putative ubiquitylating components of the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> ERAD system localizes to the their expected regions (the ER and cytosol), has ubiquitylating properties and is likely essential to the parasite, leaving the possibility for exploiting the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> ERAD system for antimalarial targeting.Lastly, we characterize the duplicated ERAD system and validated that it targets the <italic>Plasmodium<italic>-specific organelle called the apicoplast. The apicoplast is a four membrane-bound organelle that is essential for the parasite's survival. The functions of the apicoplast (i.e. isoprenoid biosynthesis and fatty acid synthesis) are mostly fulfilled by ~500 nucleus-encoded proteins that are transported to the outermost apicoplast compartment via the secretory pathway. However, how these proteins import into the apicoplast through its multiple membranes remain unclear.  Here, by using bioinformatics analysis, cloning techniques, recombinant proteins, biochemical assays and fluorescent microscopy, we have biologically characterized the ERAD-like core ubiquitylating components, showing that they are capable of ubiquitylation, and localize them to the apicoplast. Our data indicates that the ERAD-like system likely has similar translocative properties as the traditional ERAD system of the ER and functions to transport apicoplast-targeted proteins across apicoplast membranes. Because of both the essentiality and specificity of the apicoplast to the malaria parasite, we propose that this apicoplast ERAD-like system would make a solid candidate for anti-malaria drug targeting. Overall, our investigation validates the importance of ubiquitylation within the <italic>Plasmodium<italic> biology and also highlights a few potential antimalarial drug targets that are specific to the deadly parasite.

Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation From Radical-Initiated Reactions of Alkenes: Development of Mechanisms
The products and mechanism of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formations from 1-alkenes, internal alkenes, and 2-methyl-1-alkenes (OH radical reaction only) with OH and NO<sub>3</sub> radicals (in the presence of NO<sub>x</sub> for OH radical reactions) were investigated in an environmental chamber, and quantitative chemical mechanisms with gas-partiticle partitioning corrections were developed for some systems to estimate SOA yields. Aerosol products chemical compositions were analyzed using a thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometer, and volatile compounds were quantified using a gas chromatograph with flame-ionization detector. Nitrate products were analyzed using a high-performance liuid chromatograph with UV-vis detector for yield measurements and <super>1</super>H NMR for identification. The major products observed in OH radical-initiated reactions with linear alkenes were <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, cyclic hemiacetals, dihydrofurans, and dimers formed from dihydroxycarbonyls. Trihydroxynitrates and trihydroxycarbonyls were observed for 2-methyl-1-alkene reactions in addition to the products listd above, but dimers were not observed due to reduction of driving force of the formation. The yields of <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxynitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and trihydroxynitrates were measured to calculate the relative ratios for forming primary, secondary, and tertiary <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxyalkyl radicals by OH radical addition to the double bond, calculated as 1.0:1.9:4.3, and the branching ratios for forming <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxynitrates from reactions of primary, secondary, and tertiary <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO, calculated as 0.12, 0.15, and 0.25. The branching ratios of <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxynitrate formations were lower than that of alkylnitrate formations due to hydrogen bonding between hydroxy and peroxy groups in hydroxyperoxy radical-NO complexes. The effect is enhanced with the addition of NH<sub>3</sub> for 1-alkene reactions. SOA yields estimated with a developed model agreed well with the measured SOA yields for 2-methyl-1-alkene reactions, but the agreement was limited for 1-alkenes to the region where gas-particle partitioning does not affect due to difficulty in vapor pressure estimation of the products. The major products observed in NO<sub>3</sub> radical-initiated reactions with linear alkenes include <italic>&beta;</italic>-hydroxynitrates, carbonylnitrates, dihydroxynitrates, and hydroxyl and oxo dinitrooxytetrahydrofurans which have not been observed previously. The products through the pathway of isomerizing <italic>&delta;</italic>-hydroxycarbonyls to cyclic hemiacetals were observed in all linear alkene and 2-methyl-1-alkene reactions, and second-generation products were observed in NO<sub>3</sub> radical-initiated reactions.

Systematics of Reduviidae with Emphases on Reduviinae, Triatominae and Physoderinae
Reduviidae (assassin bugs), the largest clade of predatory non-holometabolous insects (~6,800 species), display a range of prey specializations and members of one subfamily, the Triatominae, feed on vertebrate blood and are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. A combination of phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic revisions of several target taxa are conducted to improve our knowledge of reduviid systematics. The emphasis is on resolving the highly polyphyletic Reduviinae, shedding light on the prevalence of trypanosomes in a species of endemic Triatominae in Southern California, revising a genus of Malagasy Reduviinae and the Indo-Pacific group of Physoderinae, a group once thought to be sister to the Triatominae.A higher-level phylogeny of Reduviidae (178 taxa, 18 subfamilies) is reconstructed to investigate the relationships among subfamilies using five gene regions, with extensive sampling of the polyphyletic Reduviinae. Results indicate that Reduviinae fall into 11-14 separate clades and Triatominae may be paraphyletic. The evolution of blood-feeding may thus have occurred once or twice independently among predatory reduviids. Fossil-calibrated divergence time estimates show that Reduviidae originated in the Middle Jurassic (~178Ma), but the majority of extant lineages only emerged in the Late Cretaceous (~97Ma). Ancestral state reconstructions indicate bark-association as the ancestral microhabitat for Higher Reduviidae.A survey on the infection rate of Triatoma protracta with T. cruzi in Southern California show relatively high rates (19-36%) with geographical variability but no clear temporal differences. A taxonomic revision of the Malagasy endemic reduviine Durevius is provided and 2 new species described.A phylogenetic analysis of Physoderinae (57 taxa) based on 57 morphological characters (50 discrete, 7 continuous) indicate that the Neotropical Physoderinae are sister to all remaining Physoderinae except Porcelloderes. The morphologically diverse Malagasy physoderines are not monophyletic. Physoderine diversity in the Oriental and Australasian regions is here revised based on the most extensive collection of specimens (902) assembled to date. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the generic classification of Old World Physoderinae is revised. Three new genera are created, 15 new species described, 11 new combinations created, and 14 synonyms established. Diagnoses and identification keys for Old World genera are provided and species illustrated.

Magnetically Responsive Photonic Structures
Magnetically responsive photonic crystals (MRPCs), whose colors can be controlled by external magnetic field, have drawn lots of attention during the past two decades. They are highly desirable for the potential applications, such as sensors and tunable color displays. However it remains difficult to fabricate MRPCs with convenient control, fast response, excellent reversibility and easy integration into advanced devices. In my thesis work, I have focused on the development of novel magnetically responsive photonic structures with rapid and full reversibility. First, superparamagnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) colloidal nanocrystal clusters (CNCs) have been synthesized and employed as building blocks to construct colloidal photonic crystals. The one dimensional periodic chainlike structure whose diffraction can be moved across the entire visible spectral region can be achieved by the application of an external magnetic field.  The precise control, fast response and the fully reversible optical properties show great potential in applications such as responsive color displays or sensors. The assembled structures have been studied by using a method that combines magnetic assembly with sol-gel processes to physically fix individual photonic chains. The resulting nanochains exhibit magnetically responsive photonic properties and long-term structural/optical stability. Greatly improved magnetically responsive photonic structures with widely tunable optical properties and long-term stability can be achieved by porous silica coating on the CNCs surface by a novel water based etching method.A new mechanism of stabilizing the magnetic photonic crystals against packing force while keeping the tunability will be shown in the thesis. By taking advantage of agarose gel as a matrix to prevent the photonic structures inside from aggregation, the system shows remarkable stability against an external magnetic field. Other features such as fast, reversible, and tunable optical response to external magnetic fields are well kept in this system.  In addition, a bistable color-reflective magnetic tunable photonic film with thermally erasable property will be presented. This film exhibits excellent cycling stability and durability over a long period. The simple fabrication process, easy control over the color change, the superior stability over cycling and prolonged field exposure, and the low cost and energy saving properties allow broad potential applications including outdoor displays.

Adaptations of temporal dynamics
The human mind rapidly parses high-dimensional dynamic input into useful representations. Identifying the source of relevant sensory information in time is critical to the formation of informative perceptions. One source of information to aid perceptual processing is the temporal regularity of sensory input. Knowledge of what regularities are utilized and how they are utilized is critical to understanding how perception functions in a dynamic world. The objective of this dissertation is to explore the adaptations of perception to temporal regularities in the environment. Chapters 1 and 2 use short term priming paradigms to examine the temporal segregation of perceptual information. Chapter 1 shows that inverted versus upright faces have different time courses of priming, suggesting that familiarity plays a role in temporal segregation. Furthermore, for faces, there are individual differences in priming dynamics related to perceptual identification ability. Chapter 2 examines the influence of occurrence and co-occurrence statistics in the same task. Several incremental reductions of stimulus frequency at different levels of representation all slow priming compared to higher occurring word stimuli. Word associations as a measure of co-occurrence, produce waxing and waning priming effects, with a small effect of the order of the associative relationship. Priming based on direct measures of linguistic co-occurrence produces priming dynamics that are similar to associative priming. Words which are expected to repeat provide a small increase in priming compared to priming by repeating a word. These priming effects are interpreted as the result of habituation. The findings in Chapters 1 and 2 generalize the habituation account of priming effects to faces, demonstrate its dependence on the occurrence rates of stimuli, and show that temporal co-occurrence regularities for particular items only result in small changes to the basic dynamics. Chapter 3 uses a spatial cueing paradigm to test if we adapt to diagnostic spatial-temporal relationships. Participants implicitly learn and generalize diagnostic cue-target relationships with long delays between cues and target. Diagnostic relationships are also learned for short cue-target delays when no shift of expectation is required. As a whole, these experiments find that temporal regularities pertaining to familiarity and general occurrence relationships are strongly reflected in the dynamics of perception, and that directional associations or expectations between individual stimuli deviate only slightly from general dynamics

This study investigates the biomechanics, behavior, and distribution of urchin species in Mo’orea, French Polynesia to understand how they withstand hydrodynamic forces. Field surveys examined the flow distribution of four species:E. mathaei, Tripneustes gratilla, Diadema savignyiandEchinotrix calamaris. Flow tests were conducted on twoEchinometra mathaeisubspecies to measure spine angle under no flow and heavy flow conditions. Short spine urchin species were found in significantly higher flows than were long spine urchin species. Experimental findings revealed thatE. mathaeitype B temporarily adopts a more streamlined shape in response to increasing flow velocity, whileE. mathaeitype A does not. Understanding the streamlining behavior and other strategies for surviving hydrodynamic conditions is necessary in order to examine these organisms’ role in their environment.

Investigating the biosynthesis of halogenated meroterpenoid natural products from marine actinomycetes
The marine sediment-derived Streptomyces spp. CNQ-525 and CNQ-766 were recently characterized by the Fenical laboratory as a new group of marine sediment-derived actinomycetes, tentatively named the MAR4s. These bacteria are prolific producers of hybrid isoprenoids, including the meroterpenoid (polyketide-terpene) antibiotics that are rarely encountered from bacteria. Structural inspection of the meroterpenoid antibiotics belonging to the napyradiomycin family of chlorinated dihydroquinones suggests that the biosynthetic cyclization of their terpenoid subunits is initiated via a chloronium ion, which exists as hypochlorous acid. The vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases that are known to catalyze such reactions are distributed in fungi and marine algae and have yet to be characterized from bacteria. The MAR4 strain Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525 was used as a source for identifying novel halogenating enzymes. The cloning and sequence analysis of the 43-kb napyradiomycin biosynthetic cluster yielded an unprecedented arrangement of biosynthetic genes including a FADH₂-dependent halogenase and three putative vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases. Heterologous expression of the CNQ-525-based nap biosynthetic cluster in a surrogate host produced at least seven napyradiomycins, including the new analog 2- deschloro-2-hydroxy-A80915C. These data revealed the molecular basis behind the biosynthesis of these novel meroterpenoid natural products, and also resulted in the first identification of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases from a prokaryote. Preliminary biochemical data suggests both NapH1 and NapH3 from the napyradiomycin biosynthetic cluster are vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidases and inactivation of the napH1 gene resulted in the first in vivo verification of a vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase. The phthalazinone meroterpenoid azamerone was isolated by the Fenical-Jensen lab from the marine sediment-derived bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNQ-766. Given the structural novelty of azamerone and its relation to the chlorinated meroterpenoids, a variety of feeding experiments with 13C and 15N-labeled molecules were used to explore the formation of its phthalazinone core. These experiments confirmed that azamerone's phthalazinone core is derived from a naphthoquinone precursor such as in the chlorinated dihydroquinones and progresses through a diazo intermediate

[vulnerability, form, relation, body]

Winter, snow : an inquiry into vulnerability
This thesis attends to vulnerability as both essential and contingent; a quality that is universal yet inheres in bodies as result of relations - the weave of worlds. Navigation, structured by the drive to certain forms of relationality, is both product and producer in the cartographic becoming of being. Despite careful steerage, we may consider the possibility that resonance enables one to be 'taken up' into forms of relationality aside from will. The moment when worlds collapse into bodies; the weight of sadness, the glimpse which cannot be shaken. Drawing from fieldwork with chronically homeless and recently housed individuals in Boston, I hope to elucidate how vulnerability is manifest in bodies as a quality derived from the relativity of component parts, or from those exteriorities to which one may be proximate. Vulnerability is therefore a measure of 'exposure' - a state of being 'open to'. The orientation and degree of this openness may be pre-determined by prior forms of relations which configure the realm of potential, in turn constituting the horizons of being and the routes we navigate. Resonance carries forth, structuring the forms we attend to, feeding desires or re- fashioning them in light of new attentions. Thus, this thesis hopes to demonstrate how vulnerability, as a state of being brought into relation with that which is exterior, is a necessary foundation of all being; the nature of this vulnerability is shaped by the paths we travel

Performance Assessment for Geological Disposal of Graphite Waste Containing TRISO Particles
This paper presents a deterministic performance assessment for spent fuel from deep-burn modular hightemperature reactors (DBMHRs) in the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. Typical DBMHR designs utilize fuel elements manufactured from graphite. The fuel itself is made of TRISO particles containing the fissile material. The performance of the DBMHR spent fuel (DBSF) was evaluated in terms of the annual dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual (RMEI) under various hydrogeological conditions. Part of this evaluation was an analysis of the graphite waste matrix and of the TRISO particles under repository conditions, the result of which indicates that the lifetime of the graphite matrix greatly exceeds that of the TRISO particles and that it is the graphite, not the TRISO particles, that serves to sequester the radionuclides within the fuel matrix. Under all 14 cases considered, DBSF is seen to comply with the annual dose standards set in Part 197 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, for exposure via groundwater contamination under current climatic conditions. Parametric studies for the effect of waste matrix lifetime on annual dose received by the RMEI indicate that repository performance is sensitively linked to waste matrix durability because most radionuclides including actinides are likely to be released congruently with the graphite matrix.

[sulfite, oxidase, reaction, plant, enzyme, study]

Spectroscopic and Kinetic Studies of Arabidopsis thaliana Sulfite Oxidase
The sulfite oxidases are a family of enzymes characterized by the nature of their molybdenum centers.  There are three classes of sulfite oxidizing enzymes: vertebrate sulfite oxidases, plant sulfite oxidase and bacterial sulfite dehydrogenases.  All these proteins catalyze the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate - as part of sulfite detoxification in plant and animals and during chemolithotrophic growth in bacteria.  While sharing a common overall reaction, each family has distinct characteristics both in the overall structure and in the reaction mechanism.  Here we have set out to examine the reaction mechanism of sulfite oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a protein that is unique compared to the other sulfite oxidizing enzymes.  Previous work, utilizing continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR), has shown that a unique signal is seen in plant sulfite oxidase.  The nature of this signal has been studied here using two different pulsed EPR techniques, two-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and two-dimensional hyperfine sublevel correlation (2D-HYSCORE).  In these studies we show that this signal is due to the formation of a sulfate-bound Mo(V) intermediate, a finding of major mechanistic implication since it implies that plant sulfite oxidases are catalytically active while previous studies have shown that vertebrate and bacterial sulfite oxidase become trapped in this form yielding a catalytic dead end.  We also show here kinetic evidence of superoxide production by this enzyme during its oxidative half-reaction with oxygen, a reaction not shared with the other sulfite oxidizing enzymes.  Through rapid-reaction kinetic studies, we show that this reaction involves two sequential one-electron transfers, each generating an equivalent of superoxide.  Finally, we have examined the reaction of plant sulfite oxidase with dimethylsulfite and shown that a substrate lone pair attack at the equatorial oxo group of the molybdenum center must be responsible for initiation of catalysis.  The interpretation of these results and their implications are discussed in the context of a modified reaction mechanism to explain the behavior of this protein during the oxidative half-reaction.

Exploring the Dynamics of Fluorescence Staining of Bacteria with Cyanine Dyes for the Development of Kinetic Assays
Bacterial infections continue to be one of the major health risks in the United States. The common occurrence of such infection is one of the major contributors to the high cost of health care and significant patient mortality. The work presented in this thesis describes spectroscopic studies that will contribute to the development of a fluorescent assay that may allow the rapid identification of bacterial species. Herein, the optical interactions between six bacterial species and a series of thiacyanine dyes are investigated. The interactions between the dyes and the bacterial species are hypothesized to be species-specific. For this thesis, two Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli (E. coli) TOP10 and Enterobacter aerogenes; two Gram-positive bacterial strains, Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus subtilis; and two Bacillus endospores, B. globigii and B. thuringiensis, were used to test the proposed hypothesis. A series of three thiacyanine dyes--3,3'-diethylthiacyanine iodide (THIA), 3,3'-diethylthiacarbocyanine iodide (THC) and thiazole orange (THO)--were used as fluorescent probes. The basis of our spectroscopic study was to explore the bacterium-induced interactions of the bacterial cells with the individual thiacyanine dyes or with a mixture of the three dyes. Steady-state absorption spectroscopy revealed that the different bacterial species altered the absorption properties of the dyes. Mixed-dye solutions gave unique absorption patterns for each bacteria tested, with competitive binding observed between the bacteria and spectrophotometric probes (thiacyanine dyes). Emission spectroscopy recorded changes in the emission spectra of THIA following the introduction of bacterial cells. Experimental results revealed that the emission enhancement of the dyes resulted from increases in the emission quantum yield of the thiacyanine dyes upon binding to the bacteria cellular components. The recorded emission enhancement data were fitted to an exponential (mono-exponential or bi-exponential) function, and time constants were extracted by regressing on the experimental data. The addition of the TWEEN surfactants decreased the rate at which the dyes interacted with the bacterial cells, which typically resulted in larger time constants derived from an exponential fit. ANOVA analysis of the time constants confirmed that the values of the time constants clustered in a narrow range and were independent of dye concentration and weakly dependent on cell density.

Thin film growth technology develops rapidly with the requirement of understanding the mechanical and electronic interaction and how they will control the Morphology of the film. Self-assembly of the organic molecules on metal substrate provide a bottom-up path toward building up desires conformation for nanotechnology application. In this study, STM and Photoelectron Spectroscopy have been used to investigate monolayer or sub-monolayer thin film grown on Cu(111) substrate. To be more specific, The films I investigate are monolayer MoS2 formed by strong covalent bonding between Mo and S atoms, Anthracene thin film formed by weak van der Waals interaction and Anthraquinone (AQ) honeycomb network form by hydrogen bonding and other long range surface mediated interaction. My research interest is using STM, XPS and ARUPS to investigate what is the role of these interactions during the growth of the thin film and how to control the film morphology by controlling these interactions.

Biosynthesis of scytonemin, a cyanobacterial sunscreen
Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is increasing the level of harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the earth's surface. The environmental impacts of this radiation are largely unknown; however UV-induced DNA damage may lead to effects on primary productivity in plants and the prevalence of skin cancer. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with an evolutionary history that precedes the development of atmospheric ozone protection. These factors make cyanobacteria a valuable resource for the study of adaptations to UV radiation, including the production of UV absorbing secondary metabolites. One of these metabolites is scytonemin, a yellow-brown pigment found in the sheaths of many cyanobacteria. Its unique dimeric indolic-phenolic structure, powerful UV-A absorbing properties, and biological activity in biomedical assays prompted our study of its biosynthesis. This thesis involved a multidisciplinary investigation of the biosynthesis of scytonemin. Preliminary evidence for genes involved in scytonemin biosynthesis were identified through bioinformatic analyses and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR using the N. punctiforme ATCC 29133 genome. These genes are shown to be a part of a transcriptional gene cluster that is upregulated after exposure to UV radiation. Examination of this gene cluster across cyanobacterial lineages reveals unique genetic characteristics in individual clusters, and further suggests ancient evolutionary history for its biosynthesis. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry technique was utilized in a novel method to understand the biosynthetic precursors used for scytonemin biosynthesis through stable isotope incubation studies. The MALDI-TOF technique also allowed a unique glimpse into the near-real-time induction and rate of scytonemin biosynthesis. The final study reported in this thesis reveals the function of a gene uniquely present in the scytonemin gene cluster of N. punctiforme ATCC 29133. This gene is shown to encode a protein with in vitro oxygenase activity, similar to the well characterized mushroom tyrosinase

The role of adaptor protein Tks4 in invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion
Invasive cancer cells gain the ability to degrade and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM). The invasiveness of these cells can be correlated with the presence of dynamic membrane structures called invadopodia or podosomes. Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions that display focal proteolytic activity towards the ECM. We identified a new protein that is closely related to the critical invadopodia protein, Tks5/ FISH, which we named Tks4. We hypothesized that Tks4 is also a key component in the formation of invadopodia. The Tks4 protein contains an amino-terminal Phox homology domain, four SH3 domains, multiple proline-rich motifs, and several Src phosphorylation sites. We found that Tks4 is localized to invadopodia in a variety of cell types, including Src-transformed fibroblasts and melanoma cells. Using Src-transformed fibroblasts as a model system, we found that Tks4 is required for both the formation and function of invadopodia. Depletion of Tks4 resulted in the formation of a "pre-invadopodia" structure, where many of the required structural and accessory proteins are appropriately localized. However, these pre-invadopodia structures failed to degrade the ECM, in large part because the matrix-degrading proteinase MT1-MMP was not properly localized and/or activated. We next showed that Tks4 is a critical component in melanoma cell invasion and metastasis. Knockdown of Tks4 in human melanoma cells resulted in decreased degradation of extracellular matrices and decreased proliferation in 3-dimensional (3D) collagen-I matrix, as well as a significant reduction of metastases using an in vivo experimental lung metastasis assay. This decreased invasive capacity of Tks4-knockdown melanoma cells correlates with the decreased surface expression of MT1-MMP. We found that Tks4 regulates the cell surface localization of MT1-MMP via an RxxxxK motif in its cytoplasmic tail. Based on these results, we propose a model in which Tks4 regulates MT1-MMP localization, and therefore the function of invadopodia. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating invadopodia formation and controlling the activity of MT1- MMP may provide novel targets for the development of anti- cancer therapeutics

Design and fabrication of advanced surface microstructures : surface modification of cardiovascular stent wires via RF plasma processing
MP35N (Co-Ni-Cr-Mo alloy) is an important stent implant material for which many aspects, that include nano- structured surfaces, are yet to be understood. We have created radially emanating metallic nanopillar structures on the surface of stent alloy wires using RF plasma. The exposure of a stent alloy wire, 250 ,mum diameter Co-Ni- Cr-Mo alloy (MP35N), to parameter-controlled RF environment resulted in dense surface microstructural textures consisting of high-aspect-ratio dendritic nanopillars/nanowires. Local compositional analyses by EDS and XPS show increased values of Mo contents on the outer edges of protruding nanopillars, indicating a possibility of the higher Mo content phase contributing to the differential plasma sputter etching on the MP35N surface and resultant nanowire formation. A comparative investigation on single phase alloy versus multi-phase alloy seems to point to the importance of phase- segregation for successful nanowire formation by RF plasma treatment. Some specific single phased materials such as Fe-Ni and Fe-Cr alloys or Pt metal wire did not form the structures similar to those with a more complex MP35N under similar RF processing conditions. This study demonstrates the creation and characterization of unique nano-structured surfaces on stent alloy wires using this RF plasma process; where such nano-structured surfaces can be useful for favorably influencing cell behaviors

Applying ESI-GEMMA towards the Study of Large Protein Complexes
Electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) is a soft ionization technique capable of characterizing large protein complexes.  Particles are separated by their mobility in air and their size is determined as electrophoretic mobility diameter (EMD).  This data can be converted to molecular weight information by modeling the particles as spheres and taking into account their average density.  Here we adapt ESI-GEMMA towards the study of 1.5 MDa E2 protein cages and 9 MDa vault nanoparticles.  Recombinant vaults with N- and C- terminal tags of varying mass were used as standards to calibrate the GEMMA data specifically for the study of vault complexes.  We used this improved calibration to evaluate the composition and integrity of different vault preparations.  Additionally, we quantified the capacity of vaults to be loaded with protein drugs and monitored the stability of these formulations over time.

Genomic signals of selection within and phylogenetic relationships among Strongylocentrotid sea urchins
The availability of complete genomes allows for direct and powerful tests of the different processes underlying molecular evolution and quantification of their relative contributions. Here, I evaluate the relative contributions of natural selection and random genetic drift in shaping the evolution of the genome of Strongylocentrotid sea urchins using the assembled genome of the purple sea urchin, <i>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</i> and by sequencing the entire genome of eight additional closely related species. I use a phylogenomic approach taking advantage of the data provided by 3,848 nuclear genes to obtain a robust and well-resolved phylogeny of the group. I observe that synonymous codon usage is biased in <i>S. purpuratus</i> and that there are five distinct clusters of codon usage. I find evidence that natural selection acts on slightly advantageous mutations through changes in synonymous codon usage bias, involving translational efficiency and/or accuracy as well as mRNA folding stability. Finally, using the comparative genomics of the group and the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions between species I detected strong evidence for broadly acting purifying selection and extensive signals of positive Darwinian selection (27.6% of genes). Sea urchins have long served as model organisms and have provided key insights into our basic understanding of biology and will continue to continue furthering our understanding of the role of natural selection on shaping the genome in the future.

Pacific Ocean Pleistocene and Holocene surface temperature variability and implications for climate change
As humanity embarks on a global experiment in climate warming associated with increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, we require a thorough understanding of the mechanisms, dynamics, and spatial extent of current and past environmental change on a range of timescales. In the past 1.5 million years (Pleistocene and Holocene), glacial-interglacial cycles emerge as the dominant pattern of orbital-scale global temperature change with millennial-scale oscillations superimposed. The ~100-ka glacial cycles are especially well recognized in the oceanographic and geologic records, though the climate-ocean dynamics and feedback mechanisms responsible for these glacial cycles are often a source of debate. Past sea-surface temperature (SST) is an especially useful indicator of past environmental conditions and a multitude of paleotemperature indicators exist. I make use of a number of geochemical signals for SST including the magnesium-calcium ratio of biogenic calcite, oxygen isotopes, and the alkenone unsaturation index from lipid ketones in order to better understand the mechanisms and dynamics of the current and past climate system.The California Current and the tropical Pacific are two of the major features that influence climate in California, the tropics, and across the globe through direct effects (e.g., upwelling, sea surface temperature changes) and atmospheric teleconnections. This dissertation examines past oceanic and atmospheric change in these two critical regions and linkages with high-latitude climate, insolation, and radiative greenhouse gas forcing. The coastal California chapter addresses questions regarding the regional and local strength of the California Current, upwelling intensity, and precipitation variability in the Holocene. Tropical Pacific chapters deal with the spatial distribution of tropical Pacific sea-surface temperatures as a reflection of oceanographic change and a driver of global climate. Each of these regions offers lessons for understanding climate variability from the late Pleistocene to the present and future climates.

Fabrication and Characterization of Organic Solar Cells
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells have recently drawn tremendous attention because of their technological advantages for actualization of large-area and cost effective fabrication. Two important criteria of these cells are efficiency and cost. The research in this dissertation focuses on the enhancement of these criteria with two different approaches. In the first approach, power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices is enhanced by introducing Deoxyribonucleic acids DNA into the device structure.  DNA provide exciting opportunities as templates in self assembled architectures and functionality in terms of optical and electronic properties. In the first method, we investigate the effects of DNA and metalized DNA sequences in polymer fullerene bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. These effects are characterized via optical, quantum efficiency and current-voltage measurements. We demonstrate that by placing on the hole collection side of the active layer, DNA and Pt-DNA sequences lead to an increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by %16 and %30, respectively. Furthermore, we studied the electrical charge characteristics of our DNA layer by using capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements to explain the increase in hole collection which shows that spray coated DNA formed a negative layer which can increase the hole collection in the cathode side. In the second approach, device cost is tried to reduce by replacing the most expansive material, indium thin oxide (ITO) thin films, with graphene thin films. Large area graphene films were grown with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. It is observed that, its pristine form, the electrical and surface properties of these films are not sufficient enough for the organic photovoltaic applications. These properties are enhanced with a surface treatment of Argon (Ar) plasma and nitric acid bath. The results of these treatments show that the surface becomes hydrophilic and surface resistance can be decreased by %25. Then, it is demonstrated that the PCE of the graphene based solar cells can be reached up to one tenth of the ITO based devices. The research conducted in this dissertation offers promising potential of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells as a clean and affordable source of energy source in the near future.

Finite Field Arithmetic and its Application in Cryptography
The groundbreaking idea of public key cryptography and the rapid expansion of the internetin the 80s opened a new research area for finite field arithmetic. The large size of fields incryptography demands new algorithms for efficient arithmetic and new metrics for estimatingfinite field operation performance. The area, power, and timing constraints on hand-heldand embedded devices necessitate accurate models to achieve expected goals. Additionally,cryptosystems need to protect their secrets and hide their internal operation states againstside-channel attacks. Fault-injection attacks or random errors reduce the security of a cryptosystemand can help a cryptanalyst to extract a system's secrets.This dissertation covers various aspects of finite field arithmetic to provide predictable,efficient, and secure elements for cryptography. We provide architecture for an elliptic curveprocessor (ECP), which is essentially a finite field processor. We also provide finite fieldmultipliers over polynomial and optimal normal bases for pipeline and parallel architectures.To further analyze the behavior of finite field multipliers, we formalize timing, area, andenergy consumption over binary extension fields. To ensure robustness of the multiplicationoperation, we provide concurrent error detection (CED) schemes for polynomial and normalbase multipliers and provide the probability of error detection.

Infrared Spectroscopy of Graphene in Ultrahigh Magnetic Fields
Graphene – a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms – possesses unusual zero-gap band structure with linear band dispersions, accommodating photon-like, massless electrons that have exhibited a variety of surprising phenomena, primarily in DC transport, in the last several years. In this thesis dissertation, we investigate graphene’s AC or infrared properties in the presence of an ultrahigh magnetic field, produced by a destructive pulsed method. The linear dispersions of graphene lead to unequally spaced Landau levels in a magnetic field, which we probe through cyclotron resonance (CR) spectroscopy in the magnetic quantum limit. Specifically, using magnetic fields up to 170 T and polarized midinfrared radiation with tunable wavelengths from 9.22 to 10.67 μm, we experimentally investigated CR in large-area graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition. Circular-polarization-dependent studies revealed strong p-type doping for as-grown graphene, and the dependence of the CR fields on the radiation wavelength allowed for an accurate determination of the Fermi energy. Upon annealing the sample to remove physisorbed molecules, which shifts the Fermi energy closer to the Dirac point, we made the unusual observation that hole and electron CR emerges in the magnetic quantum limit, even though the sample is still p-type. We theoretically show that this non-intuitive phenomenon is a direct consequence of the unusual Landau level structure of graphene. Namely, if the Fermi energy lies in the n = 0 Landau level, then CR is present for both electron-active and hole-active circular polarizations. Furthermore, if the Fermi level lies in the n = 0 Landau level, the ratio of CR absorption between the electron-active and hole-active peaks allows one to accurately determine the Fermi level and carrier density. Hence, high-field CR studies allow not only for fundamental studies but also for characterization of large-area, low-mobility graphene samples.

In addition, we showedthat silica shell addition through microwave synthesis is more effective than conventional heatingmethods, such as a hot plate. The approach that we propose may be useful in preparing multifunctionalnano-probes, particularly for radiolabeling, which requires fast preparation times.

Ethylene Insensitivity in Maize: Analysis of Ethylene Receptors and the Ethylene Response in Maize
The biological role of ethylene, H2C=CH2, was first identified as a plant hormone responsible for leaf drop from the observation that plants relatively close to gas lamps lost their leaves. Later, it was then known as an important gaseous hormone for climacteric fruit ripening. Further research revealed that ethylene not only regulates entry into several types of plant developmental cell death and senescence programs, but also mediates plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. For example, ethylene has been implicated in promoting kernel abortion under shading stress in maize. Ethylene production is controlled by the nutritional and stress status of a plant. Despite the broad range of ethylene's effects on development, the primary steps in ethylene action are assumed to be similar in all cases: They all involve the binding of ethylene to a receptor, followed by activation of one or more signal transduction pathways leading to the cellular response. Ultimately, ethylene exerts its effect primarily through alterations in the pattern of gene expression.Although the hormonal control of root growth and development has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the role that ethylene plays in cereal root development. To understand how the ethylene biosynthetic machinery is spatially regulated in maize roots and how changes in its expression alter root growth, the expression of ACC synthase (encoded by ZmACS2, ZmACS6, and ZmACS7 in maize) was observed in the root cap and in cortical cells whereas the expression of ACC oxidase (encoded by ZmACO15, ZmACO20, ZmACO31, and ZmACO35 in maize) was detected in the root cap, protophloem sieve elements, and the companion cells associated with metaphloem sieve elements. The results suggest that expression of ZmACS6 is important in regulating growth of maize roots in response to physical resistance.	To date, many studies on ethylene insensitivity have focused on the function of the Arabidopsis dominant-negative mutant ethylene receptor gene (etr1-1) in Arabidopsis or other species. To understand more about the effect of ethylene on cereal crops, maize dominant-negative ethylene receptors (e.g. Zmetr2 and Zmers1) were generated by altering a conserved cysteine residue in one of the transmembrane domains in the N-terminal region of the receptor. Taking the advantage of its short generation time, Zmetr2 and Zmers1 were first studied in Arabidopsis. The results suggest that Cys65 in maize ZmERS1 and ZmETR2 plays the same role that it does for Arabidopsis receptors. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the mutant maize ethylene receptors are functionally dependent on subfamily 1 ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis to exert their dominance, indicating substantial functional conservation between maize and Arabidopsis ethylene receptors despite their sequence divergence.The etr1-1 mutant confers a state of ethylene insensitivity constitutively during the lifetime of a plant. Therefore, the effect of etr1-1 on plant growth and development is limited in that it does not reveal what roles ethylene might play in specific cell types or developmental stages separate from its global influence on the plant. To study the role of ethylene in specific organs or at certain developmental stages in maize, expression of the maize dominant-negative ethylene receptor, Zmetr2, was driven by organ-specific promoters, i.e., from PEPC (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) and RbcS (Rubisco small subunit), for leaf-specific expression, and SH1 (Shunken1), for kernel-specific expression in transgenic maize. Such an approach allows the examination of the effects of creating a state of ethylene insensitivity in specific organs to determine the role of ethylene under normal growth conditions or conditions of stress.

Enhancement of Topological Insulators Surface Conduction
The quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase exhibits spontaneous quantized (charge/spin) conductance in the absence of external magnetic field, as a result of strong spin-orbit coupling. However, due to the large bulk contribution in 3D TIs, it is difficult to observe these new states. Here we first demonstrate a selective control of two surfaces conductions (top/bottom) in epitaxially grown Bi2Te3 thin films by gate-dependent Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations. By sweeping the gate voltage, the Fermi level of the top surface is selectively tuned while the bottom surface conduction remains unchanged due to strong electric-field screening effects arising from the high dielectric constant of Bi2Te3. In addition, the total bulk conduction can be modulated from n- to p-type with a varying gate bias. We further investigate BixSb2-xTe3 as it provides lower bulk contribution and enhanced two surface conductions. These Sb-doped materials provide us a good opportunity to see the quantum spin Hall result.

radioactive Sr2+ and Cs+, and thus provide a mechanism of attenuation. In order to investigate
mineral evolution and structural incorporation of cations in simplified experiments,
aluminosilicate solids were precipitated homogeneously at room temperature from batch
solutions containing a 1:1 molal ratio of Si to Al and 10-3 molal Sr and/or Cs, and aged for 30 or
548 d. Syntheses were done with solutions in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 and with gaspurged
solutions. Experimental products were characterized by bulk chemical analyses,
chemical extractions, XRD, SEM/TEM, TGA, solid-state 27Al NMR, and Sr EXAFS. Chemical
analysis showed that solids had a 1:1 Al:Si molar ratio, and that Sr was sequestered at higher
amounts than Cs. After 30 d of aging in purged solutions, XRD showed that zeolite X (faujasitetype)
was the only crystalline product. After aging 30 and 548 d in solutions equilibrated with
atmospheric CO2, a mixture of sodalite, cancrinite, and minor zeolite X were produced. Surface
areas of solids at 30 d were much lower than published values for zeolite phases synthesized at
high temperature, although particle aging produced more crystalline and less aggregated phases
with higher bulk surface areas. Characterization of products by 27Al NMR indicated only
tetrahedrally coordinated Al. Measured isotropic shifts of primary resonances did not change
substantially with precipitate aging although the primary mineral phase changed from zeolite X
to sodalite/cancrinite, indicating local ordering of Al-Si tetrahedra. Analysis of reaction products
by Sr EXAFS suggested Sr bonding in hexagonal prisms and six-membered rings of the
supercages of zeolite X that may be more site-specific than those of monovalent cations. For
samples aged for 548 d, interatomic distances from Sr-EXAFS are consistent with partial Sr dehydration and bonding to framework oxygen atoms in sodalite cages or in large channels in
cancrinite. Incorporation of Sr into both faujasite and sodalite/cancrinite phases is favored over
Cs during room temperature synthesis, possibly because of increased cation site competition
between Cs+ and Na+. Results of this study help to constrain cation incorporation into
sodalite/cancrinite mineral assemblages that form at caustic waste-impacted field sites and may
aid in the predictive modeling of contaminant release.

[soa, toluene, formation, nox, radical, oxidation, mechanism, product, peroxy, yield]

Computational Simulation of Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) Formation from Toluene Oxidation
Toluene is one of the most prevalent aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere and has large secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields compared to many other aromatic VOCs.  Recent photo-oxidation studies highlight that toluene oxidation produces more SOA than observed previously, particularly at low levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  This study focuses on: 1.) the development of a gas-phase chemical mechanism describing toluene oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (OH); 2.) the prediction of SOA formation from toluene oxidation products; and 3.) the impact of NOx level on SOA formation.  The oxidation mechanism, which includes multiple pathways after the initial OH attack, has been incorporated into the Caltech Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (CACM).  Toluene concentrations simulated in chamber experiments by the updated CACM as a function of time are typically within 5% of observed values for most experiments.  Predicted ozone and NO2 concentrations are typically within 15% of the experimental values.  The gas-phase mechanism indicates the importance of bicyclic peroxy radical reactions in determining the product distribution and thus the likelihood of SOA formation.  A gas-aerosol partitioning model is used in conjunction with the gas-phase mechanism to simulate SOA formation. Predicted SOA concentrations are typically within 15% of the experimental values.  Under low NOx conditions, simulation shows that more than 98% of SOA mass is contributed by bicyclic products from reactions between bicyclic peroxy radicals and other peroxy radicals. Increasing NOx levels cause bicyclic peroxy radicals to react with NO or nitrate radical, leading to fragmentation products that are less likely to form SOA.  SOA yield dropped from 19.26% with zero initial NOx to 13.27% with 100 ppb initial NO because of the change in the amount of toluene consumed.  Composition of NOx also has an impact on SOA yield and formation, showing that NO has a greater impact on SOA yield and formation than NO2.

Multimodal evidence
We often have a variety of evidence available for a given hypothesis. For example, the efficacy of pharmaceuticals is studied with diverse experiments on animals, humans, and cells. I call evidence like this multimodal; a "mode" is a particular way of learning about the world: a technique, apparatus, or experiment. Philosophers have appealed to multimodal evidence to make robustness claims to advance various forms of scientific realism and to resist skeptical worries. The depth of such arguments, though, has advanced little since Whewell. What are the conditions under which such arguments are compelling? I raise methodological and epistemological arguments, and use examples from biology and medicine, to identify demanding constraints for successful appeals to multimodal evidence

Study of the Mass and Spin-Parity of the Higgs Boson Candidate via Its Decays to Z Boson Pairs
A study is presented of the mass and spin-parity of the new boson recently observed at the LHC at a mass near 125 GeV. An integrated luminosity of 17.3  fbsuperscript -1, collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, is used. The measured mass in the ZZ channel, where both Z bosons decay to e or μ pairs, is 126.2±0.6(stat)±0.2(syst)  GeV. The angular distributions of the lepton pairs in this channel are sensitive to the spin-parity of the boson. Under the assumption of spin 0, the present data are consistent with the pure scalar hypothesis, while disfavoring the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis.

Star formation in damped Lyman-alpha systems and the outskirts of Lyman break galaxies
In this thesis we begin to unify two pictures of the high redshift universe: absorption line systems such as damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) that provide the fuel for star formation, and compact star forming regions such as Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) which form the majority of stars. Wolfe & Chen (2006) find that the in situ star formation in DLAs is less than 5% of what is expected from the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, but they do not constrain DLAs associated with bright star-forming regions such as LBGs. In this work we search for spatially-extended star formation in the outskirts of LBGs at z3̃. To this end, we create a sample of z3̃ LBGs in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) by using photometric redshifts enabled by the introduction of an extremely deep u-band image. By stacking these galaxies, we find spatially extended low surface brightness emission around LBGs in the V-band image of the UDF, corresponding to the z3̃ rest-frame far- ultraviolet light, which is a sensitive measure of star formation rates (SFRs). We connect this emission around LBGs to the expected emission from DLAs, and the results suggest that the SFR efficiency in such gas at z3̃ is between factors of 10 and 50 lower than predictions based on the KS relation. This decreased efficiency is likely due to the lower metallicity of DLA gas. In addition, we measure the metallicity evolution of DLAs out to z5̃, and find a continued decrease of metallicity with increasing redshift and a metallicity "floor'' around one thousandth of the solar value. We also compare the metallicity distribution and chemistry of DLAs and halo stars, and find that they are not inconsistent. Lastly, we study the photometric variability of stars in the Galactic center in order to further our understanding of the massive young stars forming in the presence of a super massive black hole. All together, these results improve our understanding of star formation and provide constraints for models and simulations of galaxy formation and evolution that will yield a more complete understanding of star formation across cosmic time

Task Allocation for Event-Aware Spatiotemporal Sampling of Environmental Variables
Monitoring of environmental phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts the challenges of both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena, coupled with demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples=m2 over transects exceeding 1000 m2. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such a transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. A new approach, Networked Infomechanical System (NIMS), has been introduced to combine autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enabling sufficient spatiotemporal sampling density over large transects to meet a general set of environmental mapping demands.

Modeling pulsed-laser melting of embedded semiconductor nanoparticles
Pulsed-laser melting (PLM) is commonly used to achieve a fast quench rate in both thin films and nanoparticles. A model for the size evolution during PLM of nanoparticles confined in a transparent matrix, such as those created by ion-beam synthesis, is presented. A self-consistent mean-field rate equations approach that has been used successfully to model ion beam synthesis of germanium nanoparticles
in silica is extended to include the PLM process. The PLM model includes classical optical absorption, multiscale heat transport by both analytical and finite difference methods, and melting kinetics for confined nanoparticles. The treatment of nucleation and coarsening behavior developed for the ion beam synthesis model is modified to allow for a non-uniform temperature gradient and for interacting liquid and solid particles with different properties. The model allows prediction of the particle size distribution after PLM under various laser fluences, starting from any particle size distribution including as-implanted or annealed simulated samples. A route for narrowing the size distribution of embedded nanoparticles is suggested, with simulated distribution widths as low as 15percent of the average size.

[lens, optical, fluidic, zoom]

Bio-inspired fluidic lens for biomedical applications
My research interests and experiences have focused on bio- inspired fluidic lens, which is a lens that can change its curvature just like the crystalline lens of the human eye. The curvature tuning capability allows for a theoretical limit of 300 diopters of tuning without having any moving lenses. With this key feature, the lens can be made very small but yet has a tremendous amount of tuning capability. This is very different from traditional optical lenses, which are made out of rigid material where the curvature cannot change. Hence, the only way for traditional optical systems to change its power is by changing the location of the lenses. This forces the traditional optics to be much larger, much longer, and much bigger with limited functionality. With bio-inspired fluidic lenses, the lenses are much smaller and compact with more optical function. My main contribution is in developing the fabrication process for the fluidic lens and the optical design techniques that will improve the image quality. With only one single fluidic lens, I designed a miniature optical system that can function as a regular camera, micro-mode camera, or even a microscope. With two fluidic lenses, I designed a miniature optical zoom camera that has very large optical zoom (17 mm total track and >4X optical zoom). The working distance can be as short as 2 cm, which is difficult to design with traditional lens technology. The unique functions of the optical systems are made possible with the unique function of bio-inspired fluidic zoom lens. Finally, the unique technology of this optical device has particular interest in biomedical applications, such as minimally invasive surgery, retinal camera, etc. Several functions of biomedical applications are demonstrated. Most importantly, a demonstration gallbladder removal surgery was performed solely relying on the images acquires with the miniature zoom lens developed with fluidic lenses

The role of spatial context in rat vision
I ask whether rats have pattern vision. Is the rat's visual system influenced by the spatial context surrounding a feature? Specifically, is the processing of an oriented target feature influenced by the relative orientation and relative position of nearby visual features?. In chapter 1, I provide an introduction to the early visual system and the role of contextual processing. I review the influence of spatial context at the level of neural responses, anatomy, theory, and psychophysics. In chapter 2, I describe the experimental paradigm we developed in the lab. The methods were sufficient to train rats on a range of visual tasks, including training them to detect small faint oriented visual targets in the presence of nearby flanking stimuli (̀flankers'). In chapter 3, I ask whether the geometric relationship between the flankers and the target influences the rats' ability to detect an oriented target. Indeed, of all the spatial configurations I tested, one condition was harder than the rest: when all the stimuli where collinear. This finding shows that rats are influenced by spatial context when detecting a faint target. In chapter 4, I ask whether a difference in the contrast of target and flanker will reverse the impairment observed in collinear stimuli. Evidence from human behavior and neural responses suggests that performance might improve when targets are faint and the surrounding contrast is strong. In no case did the presence of flankers improve the rat's ability to detect a target. A model is fit to the behavioral data to explain the animal's impairment and bias. In chapter 5, I include a pilot study to validate the feasibility of physiological recordings that isolate surround processing in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the visual thalamus of rats. In one experiment, changes in surround contrast and luminance did not reliably influence the neural response to the target, suggesting that contrast normalization in the LGN is not substantial for briefly flashed targets with flankers. I also characterize basic response properties of LGN neurons in the awake and anesthetized rat. The differences in the response properties validate the importance of recording from neurons in awake animals

A high-density genetic map of Arachis duranensis, a diploid ancestor of cultivated peanut
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an allotetraploid species whose ancestral genomes are most likely derived from the A-genome species, A. duranensis, and the B-genome species, A. ipaensis. The very recent (several millennia) evolutionary origin of A. hypogaea has imposed a bottleneck for allelic and phenotypic diversity within the cultigen. However, wild diploid relatives are a rich source of alleles that could be used for crop improvement and their simpler genomes can be more easily analyzed while providing insight into the structure of the allotetraploid peanut genome. The objective of this research was to establish a high-density genetic map of the diploid species A. duranensis based on de novo generated EST databases. Arachis duranensis was chosen for mapping because it is the A-genome progenitor of cultivated peanut and also in order to circumvent the confounding effects of gene duplication associated with allopolyploidy in A. hypogaea.
				
				
					
						Results
					More than one million expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences generated from normalized cDNA libraries of A. duranensis were assembled into 81,116 unique transcripts. Mining this dataset, 1236 EST-SNP markers were developed between two A. duranensis accessions, PI 475887 and Grif 15036. An additional 300 SNP markers also were developed from genomic sequences representing conserved legume orthologs. Of the 1536 SNP markers, 1054 were placed on a genetic map. In addition, 598 EST-SSR markers identified in A. hypogaea assemblies were included in the map along with 37 disease resistance gene candidate (RGC) and 35 other previously published markers. In total, 1724 markers spanning 1081.3 cM over 10 linkage groups were mapped. Gene sequences that provided mapped markers were annotated using similarity searches in three different databases, and gene ontology descriptions were determined using the Medicago Gene Atlas and TAIR databases. Synteny analysis between A. duranensis, Medicago and Glycine revealed significant stretches of conserved gene clusters spread across the peanut genome. A higher level of colinearity was detected between A. duranensis and Glycine than with Medicago.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The first high-density, gene-based linkage map for A. duranensis was generated that can serve as a reference map for both wild and cultivated Arachis species. The markers developed here are valuable resources for the peanut, and more broadly, to the legume research community. The A-genome map will have utility for fine mapping in other peanut species and has already had application for mapping a nematode resistance gene that was introgressed into A. hypogaea from A. cardenasii.

Gene Function Prediction Based on Sequence or Expression Data
One of the primary goals of bioinformatics is the identification of the function       of genes. The most reliable way of doing this is through experimentation. However,        this is a very slow and expensive process. While this is necessary in       the beginning and will continue to be necessary for special cases,       it becomes impractical when       one considers the number of different genes encoded in the genomes of every living       organism.  A faster way is to instead identify the function of genes       by comparing them to the smaller set of genes with known function. This       comparison may be based on many different kinds of data, including sequence       similarity and gene expression data.          The goal of this dissertation is to provide tools to aid in the identification       of the function of unknown genes. To that end, we first present       a study in which gene expression data was used to annotate many unknown       genes by clustering the expression data. We then present a tool for       clustering gene expression data while also identifying short areas       of high sequence similarity (motifs) among members of the clusters.       Finally, we present a tool for identifying the functionally relevant       sub-sections of protein sequences. These sub-sections can then be used to find       proteins containing similar sub-sections, even though the rest       of the protein may be quite different. This tool can thus find       more distantly related proteins sharing functionally relevant features.

Development of Molecular Probes for the Detection of Infectious Viruses and Screening of Anti-Viral Agents
Viruses pose a serious threat to public health and safety. Rapid and efficient detection of viruses is crucial for the prevention of disease spread and timely clinical management. Traditional methods for detection of viral infection that rely on viral isolation and culture techniques continue to be the golden standards used for detection of infectious viral particles. However, improved methods for rapid and reliable detection and quantification of viruses are required for public health assessment.  New techniques relying on visualization of live cells can shed some light on understanding virus-host interaction for early stage detection and potential drug discovery.  One such technology is the use of Molecular beacons (MBs), which produce fluorescence upon target binding and offer a simple, separation free scheme for sensitive detection of infectious viruses.  In this study, we developed several FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based MBs combined with fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the fluorescent hybrids with viral RNA as an indication of viral infection. To prevent nucleolytic degradation, MBs were designed containing 2'-O-methyl RNA bases with phosphorothiote linkages and a cell-penetrating Tat peptide was attached to facilitate non-invasive intracellular delivery. To demonstrate the flexibility of this technique to be adapted into a high-throughput screening method, a flow cytometry (FC) based system was utilized and the simplicity of using a flow based scheme for rapid identification of virus infected cells was demonstrated. Confluent cell monolayers were infected with virus dilutions followed by incubation with MB probes and fluorescent intensity was monitored using fluorescence microscope as well as flow cytometry. The sensitivity of the assay to detect less than 1% infected cells in a mixed cell population was shown. The illumination of fluorescent cells increased in a dose-responsive manner and enabled direct quantification of infectious viral doses. Fluorescent signal from virus infected cells was discernible as early as 15 min thereby enabling rapid detection. The specificity of the MBs to differentiate between different subtypes of viruses was also demonstrated. The specific nature of these probes enable their utility for rapid diagnosis of viral infection and provides an better understanding of the multiple steps involved in the viral infection process, which will be valuable for the prevention and control of disease.Another approach to detect the presence of infectious viruses was explored by probing the viral protease activity in vivo. Proteases are involved in many essential cellular processes and are used as the key virulence factors for pathogenic infection. These properties make proteases a prime target for detailed investigation to better understand the disease development process and to identify targets for drug treatment. The approach was to generate a quantum dot (QD)-modified, protease-specific protein module that can be utilized as a FRET based nano-biosensor for probing viral protease activity in vivo.  The site-specific incorporation of an acceptor fluorophore was accomplished using a cysteine residue and conjugation of QDs was facilitated by the presence of a hexa-histidine tag. Simple purification of the QD-FRET substrate was achieved by the presence of an elastin like protein (ELP) and intracellular delivery of the substrates was enabled by the use of a flanking Tat peptide. The effectiveness of the FRET substrate to probe intracellular viral protease activity was studied by measuring the whole-cell fluorescence ratio between the QD and the acceptor fluorophore. The utility of the assay system was validated for high-throughput screening of viral protease inhibitors.

Variability in detection and quantification of interferon beta-1b-induced neutralizing antibodies
AbstractBackgroundInterferon-beta (IFNB) therapy for multiple sclerosis can lead to the induction of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against IFNB. Various methods are used for detection and quantification of NAbs.MethodsBlood samples from 125 IFNB-1b&#8211;treated patients, which were tested NAb negative or NAb positive after conclusion of a clinical study, were retested three years after first being assessed in four different laboratories that offer routine NAb testing to practicing neurologists. The myxovirus protein A (MxA) induction assay, the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay (two laboratories), or the luciferase assay were used. Intra- and inter-laboratory agreement between assays with respect to NAb detection and NAb titer quantification were evaluated.ResultsHigh agreement for NAb detection (kappa coefficient, 0.86) and for titer levels was observed for the intra-laboratory comparison in the laboratory using the MxA induction assay performed three years ago and now. A similarly high agreement for NAb detection (kappa coefficient, 0.87) and for titer quantification was noted for the MxA assay of this laboratory with one of two laboratories using the CPE assay. All other inter-laboratory comparisons showed kappa values between 0.57 and 0.68 and remarkable differences in individual titer levels.ConclusionsThere are considerable differences in the detection and quantification of IFNB-induced NAbs among laboratories offering NAb testing for clinical practice using different assay methods. It is important that these differences are considered when interpreting NAb results for clinical decision-making and when developing general recommendations for potentially clinically meaningful NAb titer levels.

Distinct mechanisms of axonal globule formation in mice expressing human wild type ¿-synuclein or dementia with Lewy bodies-linked P123H ß-synuclein
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Axonopathy is critical in the early pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Axonal swellings such as globules and spheroids are a distinct feature of axonopathy and our recent study showed that transgenic (tg) mice expressing DLB-linked P123H &#946;-synuclein (P123H &#946;S) were characterized by P123H &#946;S-immunoreactive axonal swellings (P123H &#946;S-globules). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate &#945;-synuclein (&#945;S)-immunoreactive axonal swellings (&#945;S-globules) in the brains of tg mice expressing human wild-type &#945;S and to compare them with the globules in P123H &#946;S tg mice.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					In &#945;S tg mice, &#945;S-globules were formed in an age-dependent manner in various brain regions, including the thalamus and basal ganglia. These globules were composed of autophagosome-like membranous structures and were reminiscent of P123H &#946;S-globules in P123H &#946;S tg mice. In the &#945;S-globules, frequent clustering and deformation of mitochondria were observed. These changes were associated with oxidative stress, based on staining of nitrated &#945;S and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). In accord with the absence of mitochondria in the P123H &#946;S-globules, staining of nitrated &#945;S and 4-HNE in these globules was weaker than that for &#945;S-globules. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the PARK8 of familial PD, was detected exclusively in &#945;S-globules, suggesting a specific role of this molecule in these globules.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Lysosomal pathology was similarly observed for both &#945;S- and P123H &#946;S-globules, while oxidative stress was associated with the &#945;S-globules, and to a lesser extent with the P123H &#946;S-globules. Other pathologies, such as mitochondrial alteration and LRRK2 accumulation, were exclusively detected for &#945;S-globules. Collectively, both &#945;S- and P123H &#946;S-globules were formed through similar but distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Our findings suggest that synuclein family members might contribute to diverse axonal pathologies.

Planar cell polarity pathway and axon guidance in the developing spinal cord
The ability of the mammalian central nervous system to interpret the environment accurately, integrate information efficiently, and generate appropriate responses depends on the precise wiring and organization of billions of neurons into functional networks. The establishment of neural circuits to enable the eventual flow of sensory information requires that axons navigate across vast (on a cellular scale) distances. For somatosensory neurons, guidance takes place during development when axons must grow to the brain via a series of intermediate targets, each step of which involves the detection and response to numerous extracellular cues. Therefore, to develop a comprehensive understanding of how neurons form appropriate connections requires that axonal responses to these molecular guidance cues be clearly defined. This dissertation presents studies of axon guidance in a model cellular system, the somatosensory commissural neurons of the spinal cord. I have characterized the role of Wnt-Frizzled signaling in these neurons, and found that the non-canonical Wnt-Fzd signaling, known as the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway, is fundamental to commissural axon guidance. Further, by analysis of animal models of PCP dysfunction, Celsr3 null and Vangl2 mutant mice, I show that PCP is required for anterior guidance of commissural axons toward the brain. Equally important, I describe the mechanism by which the PCP pathway mediates axon growth decisions through the use of primary spinal neuron and eukaryotic cell cultures and biochemical techniques. I present evidence to show that modifications of PCP surface receptors, Fzd3 and Vangl2, at the cell membrane are critical to PCP signaling and constitute a spatio-temporal response to Wnt molecules secreted from the ventral spinal cord. Together, these data reveal a novel role for the PCP pathway in axon guidance. It is hoped that the results of these studies will provide a more general model for the role of membrane receptor modifications in the establishment of neuronal circuitry

Observational Studies of Drizzle in Marine Stratocumulus
The most expansive and persistent clouds, reducing the net radiation balance on a annually averaged global basis by 15 W/m^2, are the low&ndash;lying marine stratocumulus (MSc) which hover over the eastern subtropical oceans. Despite their climatic importance, key processes and feedbacks within the MSc regime have yet to be fully quantified or understood. The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of MSc processes and their impact on the marine boundary layer (MBL). Specifically, using in situ aircraft cloud microphysical measurements, this research pays particular attention to the process of drizzle, the sedimentation of liquid water. Data utilized in this study primarily come from the Artium Flight Phase Doppler Interferometer (F/PDI) and the Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) during four days of the Marine Stratus Experiment (MASE) in July 2005 in the northeastern Pacific near Monterey, California. Results presented in this dissertation are especially unique because of the broad and continuous range in which the F/PDI samples (&sim;2&ndash;100 &mu;m diameter), a size range measured by no other instrument alone with the same resolution and accuracy. The upper portion of this size range, &sim;30 to 100 &mu;m, is of particular importance to the initiation and evolution of drizzle but traditionally, has been difficult to measure well. The first goal of this research was to characterize in&ndash;cloud drizzle during the four MASE days by exploring the horizontal and vertical structure of drizzle. Drizzle statistics indicate two microphysical regimes exist, a high drizzle regime, associated with patches of heavy drizzle occurring in clusters, and a low drizzle regime, associated with more uniform, light-to-no drizzle. Heavy drizzle regimes exhibit significant drop growth by collision-coalescence while low drizzle regimes exhibit drop growth primarily from condensation. The second goal of this research is to quantify the effects of drizzle on the MBL via the process of evaporation. The observations indicate a large range of BL cooling exists among the four study days. Sub-cloud profiles of evaporative cooling show variability in the location of peak and total depth of cooling. Variability is also found to exist in the horizontal. Lastly, cloud top (CT) processes which may be responsible for the initiation of drizzle during the heavy drizzle days are investigated. We utilize drop size distribution (DSD) measured from CIP/PDI and derived from box model simulations to calculate CT collision rates. We found the observational collision rates follow a power law with the observed slope, <italic>m</italic> , varying at CT between well-developed and less-developed drizzling MSc. No correlations between <italic>m</italic>  and other observed cloud properties were found. Drop size distributions simulated from a box model of collision-coalescence suggest that while collision rates can be impacted by properties such as turbulence and cloud drop residence time, realistic values were insufficient to reproduce observed CT collision rates.

Electrochemical implications of defects in carbon nanotubes
The electrochemical behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing both intrinsic and extrinsically introduced defects has been investigated through the study of bamboo and hollow multi-walled CNT morphologies. The controlled addition of argon, hydrogen, and chlorine ions in addition to atomic hydrogen and magnesium vapor was used for varying the charge and type of extrinsic defects. To quantify changes in the CNTs upon treatment, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques were employed. It was indicated from Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronopotentiometric experiments that the electrochemical response of hollow type CNTs could be tailored more significantly compared to bamboo type CNTs, which have innately high reactive site densities and are less amenable to modification. Total defect density and edge- plane-like defect concentrations monitored through Raman spectroscopy were used to correlate changes in the electrochemical response of the CNT electrodes as a function of treatment. The implementation of CNT electrodes in a prototypical electrolytic capacitor device was then explored and characterized. Dependencies on source current and redox couple concentration were evaluated, as well as changes in the total capacitance as a function of treatment. Cyclability studies were also performed as a function of source current magnitude to evaluate the longevity of the faradaic currents which typically decrease over time in other similar capacitors. This thesis then concludes with an overall summary of the themes and findings of the research presented in this work

Dynamics of genetic adaptation in Escherichia coli K12 MG1655
Bacteria replicate quickly enough that adaptive changes can be observed on a timescale of weeks to months. Laboratory adaptive evolution experiments with bacteria, especially of Escherichia coli, have been used to study population dynamics and evolutionary processes. Recent advances in DNA sequencing now make it possible to identify all of the acquired mutations and interrogate the adaptive process at the molecular level. The first two research studies in this dissertation analyze mutations acquired by E. coli during prolonged growth on glycerol minimal media. In the first study I measured fitness differences between independently-evolved lineages and between mutations acquired by the same gene in different lineages by head-to-head competitions. This allowed small fitness differences to be detected between independently- evolved strains and between mutations to the same genes. This also detected epistatic interactions between several mutations. Overall these results provide the basis for understanding how the mutations individually and cooperatively affect fitness. The second study examines adaptive mutations to glycerol kinase (GlpK), which were acquired by almost all glycerol-adapted lineages. The relative ability of the GlpK mutations to increase fitness was used to identify the enzyme function responsible for improving phenotype, which was found to be sensitivity to the inhibitor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. However, the GlpK mutants also induce autocatabolite repression which reduces glpK transcription, attenuating the ability of the mutations to increase glycerol metabolism. This likely occurs to prevent methylglyoxal toxicity. Additionally, the GlpK mutations altered growth on several sugars, but it is unclear what mechanism could be involved suggesting it is a novel function. This study demonstrates how adaptive mutations can be studied to identify constraints on expressed phenotype and to identify novel protein interactions. The goal of the third study was to integrate genes for cellulose-degrading enzymes into the E. coli genome, and to use adaptive evolution to select for strains that improve use of the genes that allow growth on cellulose. This was both a metabolic engineering and basic research project, to produce a potentially useful strain and to study the molecular dynamics involved in integrating a novel metabolic function into the existing metabolic and regulatory network

Enhancing adoptive T cell transfer therapies: Novel treatments through IL-12 CD8 T cell priming and adjunctive use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor
Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy is the infusion of a large number of autologous tumor specific immune cells that have the ability to proliferate, traffic and mediate tumor eradication.  Tumor specific cells are obtained by expansion of endogenous tumor specific lymphocytes ex vivo, or by the in vitro redirection of lymphocyte specificity through genetic engineering. The addition of a preparative lymphodepletion prior to ACT has dramatically improved the efficacy and responsiveness of adoptively transferred cells through increased access to homeostatic cytokines and elimination of suppressive T regulatory cell populations. Although associated with serious toxicities, administration of high doses of the T cell growth factor, IL-2, has further expanded the ability of adoptively transferred cells to proliferate and persist in vivo. However, despite the initial proliferation and effector function of these tumor specific T cells, a majority of patients fail to achieve complete remission. This can occur as a result of multiple mechanisms including immunoediting of the tumor, the initial differentiation state of transferred cells, or an eventual induction of T cell tolerance.  This thesis describes the utilization of two different strategies in order to prolong the proliferative and functional anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred tumor specific T cells. The first strategy addresses whether the in vitro expansion and priming of tumor specific T cells with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 could enhance ACT in an in vivo melanoma model. Previous research in our group indicated that administration of a Toll like receptor (TLR)-7 agonist, imiquimod, enhanced dendritic cell priming of tumor specific T cells. We hypothesized that pro-inflammatory cytokine signals as a result of TLR7 administration, such as IL-12, could have a direct effect on adoptively transferred T cells without the systemic toxicities seen by imiquimod administration. We were able to demonstrate that in vitro IL-12 priming and expansion of tumor specific T cells prior to adoptive transfer dramatically improved polyfunctional cytokine secretion and anti-tumor activity without severe systemic toxicities in comparison to priming with only IL-2. Furthermore, we were able to show that this increased anti-tumor activity relied upon enhanced IL-2 signaling, and abrogated the need for high doses of systemically administered IL-2. The second strategy we employed utilized the administration of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, LBH589, in combination with ACT. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to increase the expression of TNF superfamily associated death receptors, MHC molecules and costimulatory ligands in multiple cell lines. The ability to pharmacologically immunomodulate a tumor with LBH589 provided a strong rationale for its adjunctive use with adoptively transferred tumor specific T cells. In an in vivo subcutaneous melanoma model, we were able to demonstrate that LBH589 mediated enhanced tumor regression. However, we were surprised to learn that LBH589 was modulating T cell function, even in the absence of tumor. LBH589 treated groups had significantly decreased T regulatory cell populations and significantly increased the proliferation and polyfunctional phenotype of tumor specific T cells over time. Furthermore, the potent effector phenotype of these T cells was characterized by an enhanced expression of the IL-2 receptor, CD25, and the TNF superfamily co-stimulatory ligand, OX-40.In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates two distinct strategies to enhance adoptive cell transfer in a pre-clinical model. These strategies clearly highlight the necessity of highly functional and proliferative T cells with an ability to continuously traffic and secrete multiple effector cytokines. Our findings also reinforce that responsiveness to the growth factor IL-2 through continued and enhanced expression of the IL-2 receptor, CD25, provides a critical determinant of antitumor activity. Both strategies enhanced ACT by two distinct mechanisms and highlights the need to further investigate the molecular basis of HDAC activity in activated effector T cells during an antitumor response and whether this is compatible with pro-inflammatory signals such as IL-12.

High-throughput Synthesis and Metrology of Graphene Materials
Realistic implementation of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNT) in energy devices and nano-electronics requires these carbon nanomaterials to have engineered architectures with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms as building blocks. Graphene-CNT hybrid structures will provide attractive material properties of both CNTs and graphene with the capability to develop into a variety of geometries. The first part of this dissertation presents a scalable approach for synchronous fabrication of multiple component carbon hybrids. Large and uniform graphene-CNT hybrid films are successfully synthesized via simultaneous CVD growth of graphene layers and CNTs on copper foil substrates. The graphene-CNT hybrids have tuneable nano-architectonics, which is essential for application-oriented design of hierarchical graphene structures. The unique mechanism of synchronized CVD growth of CNT and graphene contributed significantly to the composure of the final carbon structure. We also demonstrate the potential of Block Copolymer (BCP) self-assembly as a nano-fabrication and patterning tool.  Block copolymers are employed as templates to fabricate desired arrays of catalyst particles for CVD growth. Thoughtful choices of constituent blocks, polymerization degree, and volume fractions in BCPs, enable us to modulate the size and the separation distance of micro/nano-domains in the coplymer templates. Such versatility provides us with a powerful tool to control the diameter and separation distance of grown CNTs in the pillared architectures, and eventually allows us to tune the surface area in the resulting carbon hybrids.The metrology part of this work focuses on the utilization of fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM) for quick visualization of doping in large-area graphene layers. Reactive ion plasma etching allows us to generate patterns of p-type CVD-grown graphene layers doped with fluorine. We specifically employ the dye 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) as the fluorescent agent. The emission of DCM is quenched to different extents by p-doped and non-doped regions of graphene. This provides the fluorescence-imaging contrast, which is critical for visualization/mapping of the doped regions in high-throughput metrology techniques. To determine the method's resolution and scalability strengths, we increased the complexity of the doping pattern and successfully reproduced the mapping results. Upon that, we conducted a comparative investigation on steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence parameters of dye-coated pristine graphene and fluorinated graphene, using bare glass as the control sample. Fluorometry results support the increasing trend observed in the quenching level of DCM dye, from control sample to doped graphene to pristine graphene. The variation in fluorescence quenching by graphene after it is doped is also predicted by theory, as discussed in this work. Due to its simplicity, high speed, and small footprint, segmented FQM can be employed to address the chronic need for a microscopy based graphene metrology capable of "seeing" the features that are processed.

Constructing perfect phylogenies and proper
triangulations for three-state characters
Abstract


In this paper, we study the problem of constructing perfect phylogenies for three-state characters. Our work builds on two recent results. The first result states that for three-state characters, the local condition of examining all subsets of three characters is sufficient to determine the global property of admitting a perfect phylogeny. The second result applies tools from minimal triangulation theory to the partition intersection graph to determine if a perfect phylogeny exists. Despite the wealth of combinatorial tools and algorithms stemming from the chordal graph and minimal triangulation literature, it is unclear how to use such approaches to efficiently construct a perfect phylogeny for three-state characters when the data admits one. We utilize structural properties of both the partition intersection graph and the original data in order to achieve a competitive time bound.

Pleiotrophin gene therapy for peripheral ischemia: evaluation of full-length and truncated gene variants.
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a growth factor with both pro-angiogenic and limited pro-tumorigenic activity. We evaluated the potential for PTN to be used for safe angiogenic gene therapy using the full length gene and a truncated gene variant lacking the domain implicated in tumorigenesis. Mouse myoblasts were transduced to express full length or truncated PTN (PTN or T-PTN), along with a LacZ reporter gene, and injected into mouse limb muscle and myocardium. In cultured myoblasts, PTN was expressed and secreted via the Golgi apparatus, but T-PTN was not properly secreted. Nonetheless, no evidence of uncontrolled growth was observed in cells expressing either form of PTN. PTN gene delivery to myocardium, and non-ischemic skeletal muscle, did not result in a detectable change in vascularity or function. In ischemic hindlimb at 14 days post-implantation, intramuscular injection with PTN-expressing myoblasts led to a significant increase in skin perfusion and muscle arteriole density. We conclude that (1) delivery of the full length PTN gene to muscle can be accomplished without tumorigenesis, (2) the truncated PTN gene may be difficult to use in a gene therapy context due to inefficient secretion, (3) PTN gene delivery leads to functional benefit in the mouse acute ischemic hindlimb model.

A Novel Mechanism of Apoptosis Resistance: The Interaction of Cell Surface Galectin-3 and CD45 Promotes Survival of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Cells
Galectin-3 (gal-3) is a member of the galectin family of immunoregulatory lectins and has anti-apoptotic function. As an anti-apoptotic protein, gal-3 is upregulated and thought to contribute to apoptosis resistance in numerous types of cancer. One cancer in which gal-3 expression is upregulated is diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a cancer of germinal center and post-germinal center (activated) B cells. However, it is unknown whether the expression of gal-3 by DLBCL cells contributes to apoptosis resistance, and if it does, the mechanism by which gal-3 acts to promote DLBCL cell survival is also unknown. In this work, I have investigated whether and how gal-3 confers apoptosis resistance to DLBCL cells. I have found that gal-3 binds to the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 on DLBCL cells, and that removal of gal-3 from CD45 with the polyvalent glycan inhibitor GCS-100 was sufficient to render DLBCL cells susceptible to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Mechanistically, gal-3 binding to CD45 modulated activity of the intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45; gal-3 binding to CD45 decreased phosphatase activity, while removal of gal-3 with GCS-100 increased phosphatase activity. Moreover, the increased activity of the CD45 phosphatase upon removal of gal-3 was required for DLBCL cells to undergo apoptosis. This suggests that gal-3 binding to CD45 is an upstream, reversible "apoptotic block" in DLBCL cells. Importantly, while the CD45 phosphatase of gal-3+ DLBCL cells could be activated by the removal of cell surface gal-3 from CD45 with GCS-100, the CD45 phosphatase of gal-3- DLBCL cells could not be activated by GCS-100 treatment. In fact, when evaluated as a prognostic factor in DLBCL, gal-3 expression correlated with better patient survival, possibly because gal-3+ DLBCL cells had "activatable" CD45 phosphatase, while the phosphatase activity of gal-3- DLBCL cells could not be enhanced. Together, these results identify a novel role for cell surface gal-3 and CD45 in DLBCL cell survival, and suggest novel therapeutic targets to sensitize DLBCL cells to apoptosis.

SHuffle, a novel Escherichia coli protein expression strain capable of correctly folding disulfide bonded proteins in its cytoplasm
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Production of correctly disulfide bonded proteins to high yields remains a challenge. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is the popular choice, especially within the research community. While there is an ever growing demand for new expression strains, few strains are dedicated to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation. Thus, new protein expression strains must be engineered and the parameters involved in producing disulfide bonded proteins must be understood.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We have engineered a new E. coli protein expression strain named SHuffle, dedicated to producing correctly disulfide bonded active proteins to high yields within its cytoplasm. This strain is based on the trxB gor suppressor strain SMG96 where its cytoplasmic reductive pathways have been diminished, allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. We have further engineered a major improvement by integrating into its chromosome a signal sequenceless disulfide bond isomerase, DsbC. We probed the redox state of DsbC in the oxidizing cytoplasm and evaluated its role in assisting the formation of correctly folded multi-disulfide bonded proteins. We optimized protein expression conditions, varying temperature, induction conditions, strain background and the co-expression of various helper proteins. We found that temperature has the biggest impact on improving yields and that the E. coli B strain background of this strain was superior to the K12 version. We also discovered that auto-expression of substrate target proteins using this strain resulted in higher yields of active pure protein. Finally, we found that co-expression of mutant thioredoxins and PDI homologs improved yields of various substrate proteins.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This work is the first extensive characterization of the trxB gor suppressor strain. The results presented should help researchers design the appropriate protein expression conditions using SHuffle strains.

Mesozooplankton trophic variability in a changing ocean
Mesozooplankton (animals >200-mum) are critical components of the marine food web, sensitive to climate change via bottom-up and top-down forcing. Trophic structure is a key determinant of energy flow to mesozooplankton, influencing species composition and total biomass yield. In my dissertation, I investigate mesozooplankton trophic flexibility in response to spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions. I begin by investigating patterns in mesozooplankton biomass and grazing in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. Strong relationships were not apparent between mesozoo- and microplankton standing stocks or physical flows. The lone significant correlation between mesozooplankton nighttime biomass and peak microplankton concentrations suggests that aggregation can be an important factor influencing plankton trophic coupling. Biomass comparisons with the 1992 US JGOFS EqPac study show an 80% decadal increase, which is not reflected in contemporaneous primary production (PP) estimates, and parallels a trend documented in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, suggesting a large-scale forcing mechanism. A shift in mesozooplankton average trophic position (TP) could explain the disproportionate effect on zooplankton relative to phytoplankton. The rest of my dissertation focuses on processes in the California Current Ecosystem. I investigate aggregation patterns in 8 euphausiid species and establish that patchiness is dependent upon body size, likely induced by predators, and secondarily modified by environmental factors. I then conducted experimental studies to investigate mesozooplankton trophic flexibility. Feeding behaviors of two regionally important species, Calanus pacificus and Euphausia pacifica, differed, but TPs of both increased as PP decreased. For the total mesozooplankton community, trophic structure was inferred from phytoplankton grazing estimates and energetic requirements for metabolism and growth. In water parcels only 50km from the coastline, herbivorous grazing could not support metabolic requirements. Lastly, I investigate trophic flexibility of C. pacificus and E. pacifica during the 1998/1999 ENSO event. Compound- Specific Isotope Analysis of Amino Acids allowed me to differentiate between changes in bulk tissue ¹⁵N due to baseline and trophic enrichment. Using linear mixed- effects models, I show altered baseline ¹⁵N in both zooplankton species, and a trophic shift between years for E. pacifica. This trophic shift could be due to the more generalist feeding behavior of E. pacifica

Insights Into Toxin Binding to Tubulin as a Potential Trigger in Parkinson's Disease Using Molecular Modeling
Despite years of research, little is known about the specific cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), though genetic and environmental factors have been implicated.  Evidence suggests that microtubule disruption may be involved; however this mechanism is not yet fully elucidated, and factors implicated in PD have not been conclusively related to microtubule function.  This is the framework of this thesis.We have expanded on a suggested PD cascade involving microtubule disruption triggering oxidization of dopamine, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aggregation of alpha-synuclein, and death of neuronal cells.  We have provided computational and relational evidence demonstrating how factors implicated in PD may relate to microtubule disruption and reactive oxygen species (ROS).   We selected 6 potentially PD-related compounds: rotenone, MPTP/MPP+, toluene, saccharin, and aspartame, and compared them to 4 tubulin inhibitors: colchicine, vinblastine, soblidotin, and taxol; identifying ~62% chemical similarity between rotenone and colchicine and ~78% similarity between aspartame and soblidotin.  We performed molecular docking calculations for the potentially PD-related compounds at the binding sites of the tubulin inhibitors on tubulin dimers and found that all potentially PD-related molecules demonstrated lowest (strongest) binding affinities on the colchicine site of tubulin.  Rotenone and aspartame demonstrated significant binding affinities of  10.7 and -8.7 kcal/mole, comparable to affinities of compounds on their known receptors (-15.0 to -9.2 kcal/mole).As compounds would need to enter the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enact damage that could trigger PD, we illustrated that all potentially PD-related compounds evaluated meet criteria for potential to cross the BBB, and that all but one (aspartame) have been proven to enter the bloodstream.  We hypothesized that aspartame, believed to not enter the bloodstream after digestion, may potentially be absorbed sublingually. We compared aspartame to known sublingual drugs and noted comparable logP and molecular weight values. Lastly, we demonstrated via molecular docking probable methods of aggregation of alpha synuclein (á-syn) fibrils and probable mechanisms of two á-syn aggregation inhibitors, curcumin and geldanamycin.  We have thus provided a collective body of evidence to help substantiate the hypothesis that PD may be triggered by tubulin inhibition leading to excessive ROS production, triggering a PD cascade.

Nematode Ecological Study Of A Wetland Restoration-In-Progress At Bolsa Chica, California: Implications For Biomonitoring
The meiofauna is abundant and diverse, occupying key roles in sediment food webs and nutrient cycling, and responds rapidly to environmental changes. Nematodes and copepods usually constitute the major components of the meiofauna. As well as being a large part of the meiofauna, nematodes are the most abundant and most diverse invertebrates in many sediments and soils. They occupy a wide variety of ecological roles in sediments, and their community structure provides important clues to the structure of benthic foodwebs, as well as to responses of sediment ecosystems to environmental changes such as pollution and changes in tidal range. Despite the advantages of using nematodes for biomonitoring, they are used less frequently than other groups due to some major limitations, including the so-called "taxonomic impediment". Some aspects of this impediment are illustrated via the description of new free-living nematode species. One limitation is the scarcity of expert marine nematode taxonomists and the concentration of these experts mainly in Europe. The present study is the first to investigate Californian coastal nematodes to address environmental concerns in California, specifically the restoration-in-progress of the Bolsa Chica wetland. In common practice, nematode studies usually refrain from analyzing species-level differences between sites and communities, settling instead for genus or family level identifications by way of more feasible compromise. This choice is made perforce by the challenges of working with nematodes, and meiofauna in general. Part of the present study examined whether this choice is justified in the case of free-living marine nematodes. New molecular methods present opportunities to improve biomonitoring. Whole DNA extracts from a sediment core can be subjected to massively parallel pyrosequencing of taxonomically distinctive DNA loci, producing in one procedure a comprehensive list of the great majority of interstitial invertebrates living in that sediment across most animal phyla. Determining how the detailed and relatively robust phylogenies created with these new molecular tools can be incorporated in the study of biodiversity is an important research area, as biodiversity is the main facet of biomonitoring.

A role for motor neurons in the development and function of the spinal circuitry governing locomotion
Locomotion is a ubiquitous behavior demonstrated by the majority, if not all animals. However, the methods by which various animals propel their bodies through water or air, or traverse the land are widely divergent. A common element of locomotion is the motor neuron, the final step of the nervous system that connects to and activates the necessary muscles to achieve locomotion. Motor neuron activity is coordinated both by descending input from the brain and by local interneuron circuitry. The neuronal circuits that govern locomotion are known as central pattern generators, and the roles of the various classes of interneurons during locomotion are known. Motor neurons are the output cell of these neuronal circuits, but additional roles for motor neurons in the development and function of locomotor circuitry have not been explored in great detail. Based on the genetic programs governing motor neuron differentiation and their central role in transmitting interneuron control into muscle activation and limb movement, we hypothesized an active role for motor neurons in specifying and training locomotor circuitry during development. To test this hypothesis, we studied locomotion patterns in mouse mutants with changes in motor neuron transcription factor or axon guidance molecule expression. In addition, we developed computational analysis methods to quantify subtle differences in motor output from wild-type and mutant spinal cords. The results delineate a novel role for motor neurons in the development and function of the circuitry governing locomotion and suggest novel principles regarding circuit formation and neuronal diversity in the central nervous system

Acoustic shadow-zone arrivals at long range in the North Pacific Ocean
Deep acoustic shadow-zone arrivals were first observed on horizontal, bottom-mounted receiving arrays in the North Pacific Ocean in the late 1990s. These receptions revealed significant acoustic energy penetrating an estimated 500- 1000 m into geometric shadow zones below cusps (caustics) of predicted timefronts, much more than predicted by diffraction theory. Two vertical line array receivers deployed in close proximity in the North Pacific as part of the SPICEX experiment, together virtually spanning the water column, show the vertical structure of the shadow- zone arrivals for transmissions from broadband 250-Hz acoustic sources moored at the sound channel axis (750 m) and slightly above the surface conjugate depth (3000 m) at ranges of 500 and 1000 km. Chapter II compares a daily average of acoustic timefronts with parabolic equation simulations based on a sound-speed profile measured nearly concurrently with the acoustic data acquisition. Simulations incorporating a range-independent sound-speed profile confirmed the presence of deep shadow-zone arrivals. Receptions from off-axis sources also revealed acoustic energy scattering back up toward the axis at the end of the timefront, referred to as axial shadow-zone arrivals. Simulations incorporating sound-speed fluctuations consistent with the Garrett-Munk internal- wave energy spectrum at full strength accurately predict the vertical extent of and energy contained in both axial and deep shadow-zone arrivals. Chapter III extends the analysis to include acoustic receptions from June to November 2004. Incoherent monthly averages of acoustic timefronts indicate that lower cusps associated with acoustic rays with shallow upper turning points (UTPs), where sound-speed structure is most variable and seasonally dependent, deepen from June to October as the summer thermocline develops. Surface-reflected rays, or those with near-surface UTPs, exhibit less scattering due to internal waves than in later months, when the UTP deepens. Data collected in November exhibits dramatically more vertical extension than previous months. The depth to which the timefronts extend as the seasons change is a complex combination of deterministic changes in the depths of the lower cusps as the range-average profiles evolve and of the amount of scattering, which depends on the depths of the UTPs and the mean vertical gradients at those depths

Sustained axon regeneration induced by co-deletion of PTEN and SOCS3
A formidable challenge in neural repair in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is the long distances that regenerating axons often need to travel in order to reconnect with their targets. Thus, a sustained capacity for axon regeneration is critical for achieving functional restoration. Although deletion of either phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) individually promoted significant optic nerve regeneration, such regrowth tapered off around 2 weeks after the crush injury. Here we show that, remarkably, simultaneous deletion of both PTEN and SOCS3 enables robust and sustained axon regeneration. We further show that PTEN and SOCS3 regulate two independent pathways that act synergistically to promote enhanced axon regeneration. Gene expression analyses suggest that double deletion not only results in the induction of many growth-related genes, but also allows RGCs to maintain the expression of a repertoire of genes at the physiological level after injury. Our results reveal concurrent activation of mTOR and STAT3 pathways as key for sustaining long-distance axon regeneration in adult CNS, a crucial step towards functional recovery.

The calcification of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria : a potential defense mechanism against infections
Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are gram-positive cocci that are notorious for causing various skin infections. Since the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains, the increasing incidence of bacterial infections has become worldwide concern. Therefore, continued investigation on mechanisms that may play a role in fighting bacterial infections is critical. It is our working hypothesis that the calcification of live S. aureus bacteria by the previously discovered serum calcification factor may be involved in a vertebrate's immunological response against bacterial infections. Previous in vitro studies performed in our lab demonstrated that dead S. aureus bacteria are calcified in serum 1. The goal of our study was to further understand the role of bacterial calcification in the defense against infections. To accomplish this, we developed a serum-free calcifying system where all parameters were defined. This system allowed us to investigate the consequences of calcifying living bacteria, a phenomenon that was not previously explored. Without any serum factors, we are able to understand the repercussions solely due to the calcification of the bacteria. The results show that mineralization affects the viability and growth rate of the bacteria. Our studies also show that live S. aureus bacteria are likely to be calcified in blood by a mechanism that targets the size exclusion characteristics of the cell wall, a feature unique to bacteria. Future studies have been proposed to better understand the role of bacterial calcification in vivo

Silicon Photonics for chemical sensing and spectroscopy, diagnosis and therapy
Silicon Photonics has been attracting a lot of research interests in past few years. However, almost all literature results are demonstrated in the optical communication window. We believe that optical communication is not the only area where silicon photonics will have an impact. In this talk, a number of new applications of silicon photonics, ranging from chemical sensing and spectroscopy to diagnosis and therapy, will be introduced. First, I will introduce a new class of photonic devices based on periodic stress fields in silicon that enables second-order nonlinearity and achieves quasi-phase matching in silicon simultaneously - periodically-poled silicon (PePSi). This adds the periodic poling technology to silicon photonics and allows the excellent crystal quality and advance manufacturing capability of silicon to be harnessed for devices based on the linear electro-optic effect or other second-order nonlinear effects. As an example of utility of the PePSi technology, efficient mid-wave infrared generation can be realized though difference frequency generation for applications such as gas sensing and spectroscopy. Second, I will present a new type of tunable dispersive device, which overcomes the limitations of operational bandwidth, total dispersion and large spatial footprint by leveraging the large modal dispersion of a multimode waveguide in combination with the angular dispersion of diffraction gratings to create chromatic dispersion on multimode fibers and silicon waveguides. I will characterize the devices' dispersion, and demonstrate its ability for single-shot, time-wavelength absorption spectroscopy. Third, the application of using porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) for in vivo cancer diagnosis and therapy will be presented. PSiNPs are attractive carriers for targeted drug delivery in nanomedicine. For <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, the biodegradation property of PSiNPs provides a pathway for their safe clearance from the body. Particles sizes of 80 - 120 nm are of particular interest, however, the biodegradability rate of such particles is often too fast, which limits particles' in vivo half-life and potentially reduces their delivery efficiency. In this part, I will also present a study on the effect of both thermal oxidation and silica coating on the stability of PSiNPs in phosphate buffered saline solution (a close mimic of a basic biological fluid).

Cancer, cell fate, and transcription : regulation of the p53 transcriptional response by structurally diverse core promoters
The aim of my dissertation research was to understand the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response to stress by the tumor suppressor protein p53 and their influence on cell fate decisions. This was accomplished by several complementary experimental approaches that compared two p53-mediated transcriptional programs, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Since p53 is central to the cellular response to stress signals, it is important to define the events that are involved during p53 activation of cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic genes. p53 target promoters are structurally diverse and display pronounced differences in RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) occupancy even in unstressed cells, with higher levels observed on cell cycle arrest genes (p21) compared to apoptotic genes (Fas/ APO1). This occupancy correlates well with their ability to undergo rapid or delayed stress-induction. To understand the basis for such distinct temporal assembly of transcription complexes, the role of core promoter structures in this process was examined. My studies revealed that the p21 core promoter directs rapid, TATA box dependent assembly of RNAP II pre-initiation complexes (PIC), but permits few rounds of RNAP II re-initiation. By contrast, PIC formation at the Fas/APO1 core promoter is very inefficient but supports multiple rounds of transcription. A downstream element within the Fas/APO1 core promoter is essential for its activation and binds NF -Y. It is known that NF-Y acts as a bi-functional transcription factor that regulates the expression of Fas/ APO1 in vivo. Thus, two critical parameters of the stress- induced p53 transcriptional response are the kinetics of gene induction and duration of expression through frequent re-initiation. These features are intrinsic, DNA-encoded properties of diverse core promoters and may be fundamental to anticipatory programming of p53 response genes upon stress. Analysis of the p21 and Fas/APO1 promoters by in vitro transcription resulted in the identification of three pharmacologic agents that should aid in further dissecting transcriptional mechanisms employed by p53 target genes and other genes regulated by RNAP II. Three kinase inhibitors (hypericin, rottlerin, and Sp600125), previously not associated with inhibiting transcription, were discovered to block transcription initiation efficiently

Combined exposure to Maneb and Paraquat alters transcriptional regulation of neurogenesis-related genes in mice models of Parkinson's disease
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease where environmental factors act on genetically predisposed individuals. Although only 5% of PD manifestations are associated with specific mutations, majority of PD cases are of idiopathic origin, where environment plays a prominent role. Concurrent exposure to Paraquat (PQ) and Maneb (MB) in rural workers increases the risk for PD and exposure of adult mice to MB/PQ results in dopamine fiber loss and decreased locomotor activity. While PD is characterized by neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, we previously showed that accumulation of &#945;-synuclein in the limbic system contributes to neurodegeneration by interfering with adult neurogenesis.
				
				
					
						Results
					We investigated the effect of pesticides on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in two transgenic models: Line 61, expressing the human wild type SNCA gene and Line LRRK2(G2019S), expressing the human LRRK2 gene with the mutation G2019S. Combined exposure to MB/PQ resulted in significant reduction of neuronal precursors and proliferating cells in non-transgenic animals, and this effect was increased in transgenic mice, in particular for Line 61, suggesting that &#945;-synuclein accumulation and environmental toxins have a synergistic effect. We further investigated the transcription of 84 genes with direct function on neurogenesis. Overexpresion of &#945;-synuclein resulted in the downregulation of 12% of target genes, most of which were functionally related to cell differentiation, while LRRK2 mutation had a minor impact on gene expression. MB/PQ also affected transcription in non-transgenic backgrounds, but when transgenic mice were exposed to the pesticides, profound alterations in gene expression affecting 27% of the studied targets were observed in both transgenic lines. Gene enrichment analysis showed that 1:3 of those genes were under the regulation of FoxF2 and FoxO3A, suggesting a primary role of these proteins in the response to genetic and environmental cues.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We report that adult neurogenesis is highly susceptible to multiple &#8220;risk factors&#8221; for PD, including &#945;-synuclein accumulation, LRRK2 G2019 mutation and exposure to environmental toxins. We identified specific groups of genes that are responsive to each stressor, while uncovering a novel function for Fox transcription factors in PD.

Experimental Tests of Rapid Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in a Plant-Herbivore System
Examples of rapid evolution, occurring within a few dozen generations or less, have recently increased substantially. Evolution on these timescales suggests the possibility that rapid evolution could reciprocally interact with short-term ecological dynamics, a process termed `<italic>Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics</italic>'. My dissertation experimentally tests these interactions in an aphid (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic>) and an undomesticated mustard host (<italic>Hirschfeldia incana</italic>). 	Aphid clonal lineages were collected from a local population, and found to differ by up to 17% in intrinsic growth rate. This variation was used to conduct experimental evolution. Experiment 1 quantified how aphid rapid evolution impacts concurrent aphid population dynamics in the greenhouse. I manipulated the amount of genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate by manipulating the genetic composition of aphid populations, which altered rates of evolution.  Significant changes in clonal frequencies (or gene frequencies) occurred within a few weeks. Evolving populations grew significantly faster, up to 34%, and reached higher densities compared to non-evolving control populations. 	I then tested whether rapid evolution significantly impacts population dynamics in the wild. Evolving populations grew significantly faster, up to 42%, and reached up to 67% higher densities compared to non-evolving controls even in the face of environmental variation. Yet evolution only had this impact in the natural uncaged treatments highlighting that ecological context alters the strength of eco-evolutionary dynamics. 	Finally, the last experiment tested the full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle of dual causality between ecological dynamics (density) and evolutionary dynamics in the greenhouse. Initial aphid density altered the rate and outcome of evolution.  Density also quantitatively and qualitatively altered how rapid evolution impacts population growth rate sometimes accelerating or decelerating growth. This experiment also revealed that rapid evolution and intraspecific density have similar relative impact sizes on population growth rate. 	My dissertation experimentally quantified strong reciprocal causal interactions between rapid evolution and population dynamics on short-timescales in both greenhouse and in the field in a plant-herbivore system for the first time. Such interactions strongly countermand the assumption that evolution is too slow to influence population dynamics and suggests that ecological and evolutionary predictions would be improved if these interactions were integrated into predictive models.

Toll-like receptor 7 tolerance in anti-neuroinflammation in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that results in demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). This disease has a chronic progressive or a relapsing course that is partially recapitulated in murine models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that mediates the innate and adaptive immune responses. TLR tolerance is a phenomenon in which repeated stimulation of a TLR will lead to hyporesponsiveness. To test the potential for TLR7 hyporesponsiveness to limit CNS inflammation, SJL/J mice immunized with proteolipid protein (PLP)139-151 were treated with the synthetic TLR7 agonist 9-benzyl-8-hydroxy-2-(2-methoxyethoxy) adenine (SM360320, designated here as 1V136). Daily low-dose 1V136 treatment significantly decreased disease severity. Concordantly, the number of spinal cord (SC)-infiltrating immune cells was significantly reduced in 1V136-treated mice. A microglia-enriched cell population tested for response to TLR agonists confirmed that 1V136 treatment induces hyporeponsiveness to subsequent TLR7 stimulation. Splenocytes from 1V136-treated mice exhibited a specific decrease in interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)- gamma secretion. Serum samples from 1V136-treated mice showed no difference in the humoral immune response. In summary, chronic treatment with 1V136 can induce innate immune system hyporesponsiveness and inhibit a normal adaptive immune response. The direct effects of 1V136 on the CNS may contribute to a reduction in the clinical severity of a murine model of MS

This can result in an afferent pupillary defect, which must be evaluated for on physical examination. Unfortunately, these at-risk patients are often challenging to examine properly due to surrounding edema.

Selection and comparative analysis of novel prostate carcinoma dissemination variants : roles in metastasis of tumor-derived pro-uPA and neutrophil-derived MMP-9
In order to identify molecules and processes involved in carcinoma cell dissemination, novel prostate carcinoma variants have been isolated from the PC-3 parental cell line, which differ substantially in their ability to spontaneously metastasize. Comparative analyses of the resultant low and high disseminating variants, i.e., PC-lo /diss and PC-hi/diss, have demonstrated that the variants differ specifically in their capacity to complete early metastatic events. Concomitantly, the PC-lo/diss and PC-hi /diss cells exhibit respectively low and high angiogenic potential and differential abilities to escape from the primary tumor mass and invade extracellular matrix components in vitro and in vivo. Since extracellular proteolysis is required for tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, levels of proteolytic enzymes were compared between the PC-lo/diss and PC-hi/diss variants, with an emphasis on matrix metallo- and extracellular serine proteases. These analyses highlighted elevated levels of the serine protease uPA and plasmin-generating capacity of PC-hi/diss cells. To mechanistically analyze the role of uPA in early dissemination of tumor cells, we prevented pro-uPA activation with function-blocking mAb- 112 or inhibited the activity of uPA-generated plasmin with aprotinin in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. Inhibition of uPA activation substantially reduced PC-hi/ diss spontaneous metastasis in chick embryo and orthotopic murine models. Furthermore, both angiogenesis and invasion were sensitive to mAb-112 and aprotinin treatments, indicating that uPA and uPA-generated plasmin exert their effects early in the metastatic cascade by facilitating primary tumor escape and local invasion of PC-hi/diss cells and by promoting tumor angiogenesis. While no major differences in tumor-cell derived matrix metalloproteinases were observed between the PC-3 variants, PC-hi/diss cells exhibited increased capacity to recruit host MMP-9 delivering neutrophils to primary tumors in avian CAM and murine orthotopic xenograft models. Inhibition of neutrophil influx into primary CAM tumors was achieved by neutralizing the potent neutrophil chemoattractant, IL-8. This treatment coordinately decreased levels of angiogenesis and metastasis, both of which could be rescued by exogenous TIMP-free neutrophil MMP-9, but not by MMP-9 complexed to TIMP-1. These findings highlight a significant angiogenic role for TIMP- free MMP-9 and indicate that aggressive tumor cells can efficiently recruit host MMP-9 delivering leukocytes to facilitate tumor progression. Overall, the comparative analyses of the novel PC-3 dissemination variants described herein demonstrate the importance of both tumor and inflammatory derived proteases in tumor dissemination. Furthermore, tumor-derived uPA and neutrophil-derived MMP- 9 regulate levels of angiogenesis concomitant with levels of metastasis, strongly implicating angiogenic blood vessels in directly facilitating tumor cell intravasation and dissemination

A signal-detection-based investigation into the nature of recognition memory
Recognition memory is the ability to consciously appreciate that an item or event was previously presented or experienced. Signal detection theory has long provided one influential interpretation of recognition memory, and numerous investigations conducted over the last 50 years have sought to clarify the particulars of this account. Analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) data can distinguish between two versions of signal detection theory, specifically, the equal and unequal variance models. The equal variance signal detection model is intuitively appealing, but the unequal variance signal detection model usually provides a better fit of the ROC data. Chapter 1 describes two experiments that provide a novel test of the unequal variance assumption. This new method of analysis required subjects to directly rate their memory strength on a fine-grained scale, and then the mean and standard deviations of the target and lure ratings were directly computed. Results from the new method support the unequal variance signal detection model. Though the unequal variance signal detection theory of recognition memory provides a useful way to conceptualize recognition, there is another long-standing theory of recognition known as dual process theory that seems to contradict it. This theory holds that two processes (familiarity and recollection) contribute to recognition decisions. A critical point of contention between standard dual process models and signal detection theory concerns the nature of the recollection process, specifically, whether it is continuous or categorical. Dual-process theories generally assume that recollection is categorical, but signal detection theory requires it to be continuous. Chapters 2 and 3 provide direct evidence that recollection is a continuous process. In Chapter 2, two versions of a source memory experiment were conducted. The continuous view of recollection was supported because the relationship between confidence and accuracy on this recollection-based task was graded. The results detailed in Chapter 3 further validate recollection as a continuous process. The method involved an associative recognition test, which purportedly tests recollection in the absence of familiarity. In this task, word pairs were studied and then at test, the pairs were either intact or rearranged. When the word pairs were strengthened, we observed the typical result of an increasingly curvilinear ROC. Evidence from various procedures converged to suggest that recollection is a continuous process. The three chapters support the unequal variance signal detection theory of recognition memory and the idea that two continuous processes aggregate to yield a continuous memory strength variable

Ion emission and expansion in laser-produced tin plasma
Laser produced Sn plasma, in its role as an efficient extreme ultraviolet (EUV) x-ray source, is being studied extensively in support of next generation manufacturing of integrated circuits by nanolithography. The ability to diagnose and manipulate the properties of ions emitted from the laser produced plasma (LPP) must be achieved in order for the technology to meet stringent performance requirements. Here we study the emission and expansion of ions from Sn LPP, in parameter space relevant to the EUV x -ray source application. Several particle and radiation plasma diagnostics, in addition to analytical and numerical analysis, are all used to elucidate the complex relationships between the target properties, irradiation conditions, and resultant plasma and ion properties. Two specific laser systems of current interest to the application, at wavelengths of 1.064 micrometers and 10.6 micrometers are both utilized, which allows for direct comparisons of the effects of laser wavelength on ion properties. Details of the available experimental apparatus, including the Nd:YAG and CO₂ laser systems, are discussed first. Following, the design and realization of a custom charged particle plasma diagnostic, hereafter referred to as the ion probe, is described. The successful development of the ion probe enabled measurements of the energy distribution for each charge state of each ion species in expanding plasma, which is a new diagnostic capability. Measurements of mass ablation from Sn plasma produced by a 1.064 micrometer laser are discussed next, specifically the scaling of mass ablation rate with laser intensity. These measurements are useful in the design of mass-limited targets, and also are used to infer mechanisms of laser energy absorption and heat conduction within the plasma. In addition to the ion probe, an EUV spectrometer and a calibrated EUV calorimeter were both utilized as diagnostics to measure the mass ablation rate by complementary methods. Laser intensity was scanned from 3x10¹¹W/cm² to 2x10¹² W/cm², encompassing parameter space of the EUV x-ray source application to the low end of parameter space of the laser fusion application. Accordingly, previous theoretical results relevant to the laser fusion application can be applied in the data analysis. Experiments at two different laser wavelengths to extensively study the dynamics of ion expansion into vacuum are discussed next. In one set of experiments, the ion probe was used to measure energy distributions for all charge states of Sn ions at laser intensities of 3x10¹¹W/ cm² to 2x10¹², from 1.064 micrometer and 10.6 micrometer lasers, respectively. At the longer laser wavelength, higher charge state ions are observed. At both laser wavelengths, the peak ion energies increase approximately linearly as a function of charge state, and all ion energies greatly exceed the initial thermal electron temperature. In a second set of experiments, the distance from the target surface over which the charge state distribution evolves in vacuum is investigated. A Faraday cup translated along the path of plasma expansion is utilized in these measurements. It was found that at the longer laser wavelength, the charge state distribution is decaying to lower charge states over distances up to hundreds of millimeters from the target surface, whereas at the shorter laser wavelength the charge state distribution reaches a frozen-in state within a few tens of millimeters from the target surface. These experimental results are used to infer mechanisms of ion acceleration and recombination in the expanding plasma. In the last section, analytical models of ion expansion into vacuum relevant to the experimental results are first discussed. More detailed analyses are then carried out through numerical simulations. First, a zero-dimensional code following the time evolution of plasma temperature and the population of each ion species is discussed and used to verify some qualitative features observed in the experiments. A more complex one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrodynamics code utilizing the zero-dimensional code as one step in its algorithm is then used to simulate ion properties throughout the spatial expansion into vacuum. Due to the significant number of assumptions made in both codes, only qualitative features of the experiments are reproduced

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 contributes to gut microbe homeostasis in a model of infectious colitis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with increased expression of zinc-dependent Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). A stark dysregulation of intestinal mucosal homeostasis has been observed in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. We therefore sought to determine the contribution of MMP-9 to the pathogenesis of Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis and its effects on gut microbiome homeostasis.
				
				
					
						Results
					Wild-type and MMP-9&#8722;/&#8722; mice aged 5&#8211;6&#8201;weeks were challenged with C. rodentium by orogastric gavage and sacrificed either 10 or 30&#8201;days post-infection. Disease severity was assessed by histological analysis of colonic epithelial hyperplasia and by using an in vivo intestinal permeability assay. Changes in the inflammatory responses were measured by using qPCR, and the composition of the fecal microbiome evaluated with both qPCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Activation and localization of MMP-9 to the apical surface of the colonic epithelium in response to C. rodentium infection was demonstrated by both zymography and immunocytochemistry. The pro-inflammatory response to infection, including colonic epithelial cell hyperplasia and barrier dysfunction, was similar, irrespective of genotype. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of terminal restriction fragments revealed a different fecal microbiome composition and C. rodentium colonization pattern between genotypes, with MMP-9&#8722;/&#8722; having elevated levels of protective segmented filamentous bacteria and interleukin-17, and lower levels of C. rodentium. MMP-9&#8722;/&#8722; but not wild-type mice were also protected from reductions in fecal microbial diversity in response to the bacterial enteric infection.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These results demonstrate that MMP-9 expression in the colon causes alterations in the fecal microbiome and has an impact on the pathogenesis of bacterial-induced colitis in mice.

Biomimetic Synthesis of Noble Metal Nanoparticles and Their Applications as Electro-catalysts in Fuel Cells
Today, proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) are attractive power conversion devices that generate fairly low or even no pollution, and considered to be potential to replace conventional fossil fuel based power sources on automobiles. The operation and performance of PEMFC and DMFC depend largely on electro-catalysts positioned between the electrode and the membranes. The most commonly used electro-catalysts for PEMFC and DMFC are Pt-based noble metal nanoparticles, so catalysts share close to 50% of the total cost of the fuel cell. The synthesis of such nanoscale electro-catalysts are commonly limited to harsh conditions (high temperature, high pressure), organic solvent, high amount of stabilizing agent, to achieve the size and morphological control. There is no rational guideline for the selection of stabilizing agent for specific materials, leading to the current "trial and error" approach in selecting stabilizing agent.This dissertation initially explores a new way to select material-specific stabilizing agents for the synthesis of the noble metal nanoparticles. With the help of phage display (PD) technique, a rational biomimetic approach can be used to select biomolecule (peptide) that specifically recognizes the surface of targeted material (use Pt as a case-study for this dissertation), and the selected peptides can be used as stabilizing agent to synthesize monodispersed Pt nanoparticles with tunable morphologies under mild synthetic conditions (atmospheric room temperature, aqueous solution). With fairly easy processing,  the nanoparticles can be used as high surface area cathode electro-catalyst in fuel cells.With the as-synthesized Pt nanoparticles, bimetallic nanoparticles containing Pt can be prepared for more electro-catalytic applications, such as the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode of fuel cells, and the oxidation of methanol at the anode in DMFC. The materials synthesized include heterogeneously structured Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles, and homogenerously alloyed PtRu nanoparticles. The Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles, with Pd shell thickness controlled with atomic-layer precision, show almost 3-fold enhancement in catalytic activity for the ORR as well as better catalytic performance in oxidation of methanol, compared with commercially available catalysts. A specialized electrochemical tool, rotating disk electrode, is used to study the fundamental kinetics and their quantified catalytic activities in ORR. The seed-mediated synthesis of hyperbranched PtRu nanoparticles demonstrates the possibility of low-temperature synthesis of well-alloyed material, and shows the enhanced catalytic activity in methanol oxidation compared with commercial catalysts, with its special formation mechanism studied.

Nicotinic regulation of hippocampal development
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a class of ligand-gated ion channels that are found throughout the central nervous system where they participate in higher order cognitive functions as well as neurological disorders. The nAChRs reach peak levels during early postnatal life. The hippocampus, a forebrain structure essential for memory, expresses high concentrations of nAChRs, which are important in the maturation of GABAergic signaling. This dissertation explores the role of nAChRs in shaping the functional organization and maturation of the developing hippocampus. In early development nAChRs containing the alpha7 subunit (alpha7-nAChRs) are found postsynaptically on interneurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor acts through glutamatergic signaling to upregulate alpha7-nAChRs levels on a subset of interneurons, namely those that innervate pyramidal neurons. Levels of alpha7-nAChRs are unaffected on interneurons that inhibit other interneurons and pyramidal cells. To study the role of activity in nicotinic synapse development, septal explants were placed alongside hippocampal slices in organotypic cultures. The septal explants send out cholinergic and GABAergic processes which invaded the hippocampal slice to form functional synapses, allowing the study of nicotinic signaling in synapse formation in culture. The alpha7-nAChR and GABAAalpha1 receptors are found colocalized at the tips of filopodia where they receive convergent cholinergic and GABAergic innervation. When alpha7-nAChRs are blocked, filopodia become more motile and cholinergic synapses are lost, suggesting that the formation or stabilization of nicotinic synapses is activity-dependent. Nicotine rapidly induces spines in hippocampal slice culture by acting through beta2-containing (beta2*) nAChRs on the presumptive postsynaptic cell. Activation of alpha7- nAChRs is necessary to recruit presynaptic contacts and postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors to dendrites. Similar processes exist in vivo. Direct infusion of nicotine into the hippocampus induces spines, while young animals lacking both alpha7- and beta2*-nAChRs show a reduced number of spines. Susceptibility to nicotine is restricted to early development; nicotine is unable to induce spines in older animals. Together these results show that nAChRs have diverse functions in the developing nervous system, helping to form both cholinergic and noncholinergic synapses. The location and regulation of nAChRs receptors are, therefore, likely to have a long-lasting impact on hippocampal connectivity

Synthesis of novel polymeric nanoparticles for hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug delivery
Modern medicine has achieved extraordinary results with the use of nanotechnologies. The combination of the two disciplines created the modern field of nanomedicine, in which drug delivery is one of the most prominent branches. Several aspects are involved in drug delivery; this work will focus on the drug delivery vehicle. In particular three aspects will be investigated: building material, internal structure and material compatibility. In a first project DNA was proposed as an innovative building material. DNA nanoparticles were made from self-folding of long concatameric repeats of a single strand sequence. Nanoparticles with different sequences created a library that was bio- panned against dendritic cells (DC). Particles from the enriched library were sequenced and individually tested for affinity towards DC. The use of DNA as building material offers several advantages. For instance DNA binding drugs (such as Doxorubicin) can be easily incorporated, and immunostimulatory sequences (such as GpC) and any other encoding sequence can be integrated within the concatamers. In addition, any other molecule or small particle of interest can be conjugated to a short complementary sequence and hybridized on the outer layer of the DNA nanoparticle. DNA nanoparticles' payloads are limited to hydrophilic drugs. In addition to an hydrophobic payload, some therapies require a high loading and steady release. To achieve such results a gradient structure was created within the core of a polymeric nanoparticle. Physical and chemical gradient were considered. A chemical gradient was created by combining a low molecular weigh polycaprolactone (PCL) to a higher molecular weigh poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PCL and PLGA have different degradation rate and hydrophobicity. The particles created by combining the two polymers showed properties (such as loading) dependent on the two polymers' proportion into the composition. The chemical gradient nanoparticles are characterized by high loading and steady release of hydrophobic drugs. A new technique was examined to encapsulate hydrophilic oligonucleotides into hydrophobic nanoparticles. PMAL-C8, a zwitterionic polymer, interacts with oligonucleotides of different length and improves their loading into the hydrophobic core. The nanoparticles created were successfully used in transfection experiments, showing the bioavailability of the loaded oligonucleotides

The postsynaptic adhesion molecule FLRT3 regulates synapse development by trans-synaptic interaction with the latrophilin family of orphan presynaptic GPCRs
Latrophilins (LPHNs) are a small family of orphan G- protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) known to mediate the massive synaptic exocytosis caused by the black widow spider venom alpha-latrotoxin, but their endogenous ligands and function remain unclear. Here we identify the FLRT (Fibronectin and Leucine-rich Repeat Transmembrane) family of transmembrane proteins as novel endogenous ligands for latrophilins using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that FLRT3 and LPHN3 ectodomains interact with high affinity in trans. We show that FLRT3 is expressed by specific subpopulations of hippocampal neurons and localizes to postsynaptic sites. Interference with endogenous LPHN complexes using soluble recombinant LPHN3 reduces the density of excitatory synapses in cultured neurons and loss of FLRT3 reduces afferent input strength and synapse number in dentate granule cells in vivo. Our results identify a novel function for the ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)-linked LPHN3 protein in mediating trans-synaptic adhesion with FLRTs and demonstrate that FLRT3 is required for normal synapse development

Small Molecule Regulation of Alternative Splicing
Alternative splicing aberrations can cause disease or promote its progression, including the development of cancer.  Reversal of pathologic splicing events is a potential therapy for those cases.  Efficient methods for identification and characterization of small molecule modulators of specific splicing events are required to develop therapeutics.  The cardiotonic steroids, long prescribed for congestive heart failure, alter splicing of many exons.  Two methods are described to define their mechanism of action.  First, an unbiased analysis of transcriptome-wide changes in alternative splicing predicted loss of function of two specific splicing factors, SRp20 and Tra2-beta.  Both proteins are depleted by the cardiotonic steroid digitoxin, and their restoration blocks digitoxin induced splicing changes.  This general method can be applied to any identified drugs in future screens.  Second, a candidate approach was taken to identify which of the known cardiotonic steroid effectors is required for induced splicing changes.  An inhibitor to protein phosphatase 1, tautomycin, antagonizes digitoxin induced changes, through a yet to be determined mechanism.BIN1 exon 12a inclusion is associated with progression of metastatic melanoma.  Using a high throughput approach, cDNA expression and small molecule libraries were screened for regulators of exon 12a splicing.  Specific RNA-binding proteins including hnRNP-K, hnRNP-LL, Tra2-beta and PCBP1/4 were identified as repressors while hnRNP-R is an enhancer of 12a splicing.  Furthermore, expression of cell signaling effectors such as Map3k3 and -11, as well as CLK2 and FAST can modulate 12a inclusion levels.  hnRNP-K, which has conflicting roles in the development of cancer, represses 12a splicing through an exonic RNA element.  Small molecules that modulate exon 12a include modulators of prostaglandin activity, the antibiotic puromycin, and the psychoactive MAOA inhibitor harmaline.  Interaction between these molecules and the identified genetic regulators of 12a splicing could elucidate the mechanism by which BIN1 splicing changes to promote tumorigenesis.

Chemical and Physical Investigation of Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation
The overall objective of this dissertation is to advance the understanding of anthropogenic influences on SOA formation with a major focus on SOA formation from the photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons. This study advances the poor understanding of aromatic SOA formation through multi-generational reactions by investigating the significance of major intermediate species - specifically phenolic compounds and glyoxal. Phenolic compounds are identified to play a significant role in aromatic SOA formation (approximately 20% of aromatic SOA formed via the phenolic route, under low NOx conditions). The formation of bicyclic hydroperoxides, currently assumed in aromatic reaction mechanisms, is supported by chemical analysis utilizing a soft-ionization technique. SOA formation from glyoxal uptake onto aerosol, however, is shown to have a negligible effect on SOA formation from the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons (RH less than 80%) in an environmental chamber, contrary to the current belief based on simpler systems. Therefore, glyoxal is excluded as an intermediate species of aromatic SOA at least in the experimental conditions of this study. Another facet of the body of work details development and application of a new real-time aerosol density measurement system. A recently proposed empirical relationship between SOA density and elemental composition (O/C and H/C) is evaluated against the extensive database of this study, extending the applicability of the empirical relationship towards aromatic compounds. In addition, SOA formation from diesel exhaust photooxidation is investigated by the combination of the real-time density measurement and other physical/chemical analysis, demonstrating that mass-based measurement techniques are critical in interpreting the physical processes during diesel SOA formation, i.e., evaporation of semi-volatile organics from fractal-like primary organic aerosol, as well as condensation of secondary organic compounds onto fractal-like particles. Finally, real-time density measurement is applied to the photooxidation of CH3I, which produces fractal-like iodine oxide particles (IOP); density measurement is critical for determination of mass-based aerosol formation yields. Nearly all reacted iodine is found in particle phase when there is sufficiently high O3, which was reasonably modeled in the absence of NOx. A discrepancy between observed and modeled IOP formation in the presence of NOx suggests incomplete understanding in iodine chemistry involving NOx.

"I Can't Lie to Your Face": Minimal Face-to-Face Interaction Promotes Honestry
In the current research, we consider how gender composition may impact the likelihood of deception in contexts with asymmetric information where one party has the opportunity to strategically deceive another party for the opportunity to gain economically. We predict that the combined processes of social categorization and social projection should make people more likely to presume trust from same-gender others than different-gender others. Because anonymous interactions promote the tendency to construe situations instrumentally, we hypothesize that people will take advantage of presumed trust from same-gender others by being more likely to deceive them than different-gender others under conditions of anonymity. Finally,we argue that when rationalizing their deceptive behavior, liars should be more likely to attribute mistrust to same-gender others than different-gender others. We turn to the Cheap Talk Game paradigm (Gneezy, 2005) for our research setting and find support for our hypotheses across three different vignettes and a laboratory study using a behavioral measure of deception.

Functional Roles of Biosurfactants in Bacterial and Environmental Processes
Biosurfactants are amphipathic molecules exuded by bacteria that play critical roles in a variety of bacterial and environmental processes due to their interfacial interactions. The involvement of biosurfactants in these processes has vast potential to enhance bioremediation and expedite swarming motility, to name a few, and research into this arena is pivotal. Surface tension reduction by surface active agents can induce swarming motility lending competence of plant growth-promoting soil inocula. Bioavailability of inaccessible petroleum hydrocarbons can be promoted by biosurfactant presence by a myriad of mechanisms. Many new biosurfactants are still being found from microbes living in petroleum concentrated soils and novel habitats such as natural asphalt seeps should be considered. The Crowley lab first revealed bacteria in the Rancho La Brea tar pits where they have adapted degradative enzymes to grow on aromatic hydrocarbons and produce biosurfactants to enhance the bioavailability of these petrochemicals. Extracted bacterial cells were enriched on monoaromatics and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene). Isolates were screened for biosurfactant production with a variety of techniques using a novel medium. Thirty percent of the isolated bacteria were able to produce biosurfactants and were exclusively enriched on BTEX compounds. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia RB91B, Pseudomonas sp. RB91F, and Shewanella sp. RB91G were shown to produce biosurfactants that could lower surface tension down to 52 ± 0.6, 35 ± 3.1, and 54 ± 0.7 mN/m, respectively. Leading off from Chapter Two, the most potent biosurfactant was used along with a phenanthrene-degrading bacterium, to assess if mineralization of 14C-phenanthrene was affected and what possible mechanisms are involved. Pseudomonas sp. RB91F was shown to produce a polymeric surface active agent comprised of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid that could lower surface tension down to 36 ± 0.4 mN/m at a CMC of 925 mg L-1 and could emulsify kerosene, n-hexane, toluene, xylene, and gasoline. Degradation by Delftia tsuruhatensis RB91H was enhanced by the polymeric bioemulsifier produced by Pseudomonas sp. RB91F depending on amended CMC levels. At each CMC level, unique mechanisms appear to be dominant based on cell surface hydrophobicity, growth on bioemulsifier, as well as micellar transport and sequestration. The Orwin lab discovered a Variovorax paradoxus strain capable of swarming motility that may produce a biosurfactant within its wetting agent. Using specially designed extraction and purification techniques, the wetting agent was assayed for surface activities and any biosurfactant present was characterized. The results strongly suggest that V. paradoxus EPS produces a lipopeptide biosurfactant that can lower surface tensions to 30 ± 0.5 mN/m at a CMC of 215 mg L-1. The biosurfactant has a molar mass of 679.3 m/z and is currently being structurally characterized to determine if it's a novel surface active agent. The data seems to suggest that variowettin is related to the serrawettin class of lipopeptide wetting agents produced by members of the Serratia genera. This dissertation, therefore, identifies environmental isolates with biosurfactant-producing capabilities that have a range of critical functions to enhancing bacterial and environmental processes.

Comparative functional genomics of energy metabolism and insulin resistance in mammalian systems
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent human disease often preceded by a period of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. In both pathologic states, tissues involved in energy storage and metabolism demonstrate impaired physiological responses to insulin. Several cell and animal models have been developed to study the action of insulin and its effects in key metabolic tissues. In order to identify commonalities and differences between these model systems and relate these back to human disease, we have undertaken a unique functional genomics approach. Gene expression microarrays allow the simultaneous measurement of thousands of transcripts. To demonstrate normal physiology in a variety of systems, we apply expression profiling to characterize the effects of insulin in the tissues of C57/BL6 mice, lean Zucker rats, and lean human subjects. We further compare these results with previously published data in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Comparative analysis across several organisms provides novel insights into the transcriptional responses of three key tissues: skeletal muscle, adipose, and liver. In addition, we apply a similar approach to study models of insulin resistance. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we revisit TNF- alpha-induced resistance and compare this with several whole-organism models. In order to interpret the volumes of data collected from these experiments, however, we need a reliable and efficient tool to effectively manage this data. Interpretation of high-throughput expression data is a bioinformatics problem requiring careful integration of statistics, mathematical modeling, computational infrastructure, and biology. As gene expression and promoter microarrays become increasingly prevalent, there is a greater need for precise and accessible analytical tools. These tools not only need to encapsulate mathematically robust methods, but also be simple enough so that statistical details can be sufficiently separated from biological interpretation. Utilizing a Bayesian framework, we have developed such an approach, dubbed VAMPIRE, and implemented it as a web-based, database- driven application. The tools presented here represent a unique solution to the interpretation of gene expression data. These advances have subsequently allowed us to piece together a comprehensive picture of the physiological responses to prolonged hyperinsulinemia, and to suggest novel targets for further study of type 2 diabetes

Golgi Phosphoprotein 4 (Gpp130) Is A Sensitive And Selective Cellular Target Of Manganese Exposure
While chronic environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) is associated with neurocognitive and fine motor deficits in children, relatively little is understood about cellular responses to Mn spanning the transition between physiologic to toxic levels of exposure. Here, we investigated the specific, sensitive, and temporal response of Golgi Phosphoprotein 4 (GPP130) to Mn in AF5 GABAergic neuronal cells, and whether GPP130 degradation occurs in brain cells in vivo in rats subchronically exposed to Mn.  Results show that GPP130 degradation is specific to Mn in AF5 cells, and does not occur following exposure to cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, or zinc.  GPP130 degradation occurs without measurable increases in intracellular Mn levels and at Mn exposures as low as 0.54 µM.  Furthermore, GPP130 protein was detected in only ~15 - 30 % of striatal and cortical brain cells in control animals, and Mn-exposed animals exhibited a significant reduction in both the number of GPP130-postive cells, and the overall cellular levels of GPP130 protein,  demonstrating the in vivo relevance of this Mn-specific response within the primary target organ of Mn toxicity. These results may provide insight into important specific mechanism(s) of cellular Mn regulation and toxicity within the brain, including the selective susceptibility of cells to Mn cytoxicity.

Identification and Mechanism of Small Molecule Inhibitors of RNA Interference
RNA interference (RNAi) is induced both artificially to knockdown gene expression and naturally during virus infection as a host defense mechanism. Although genetic studies have provided a biochemical framework for RNAi, little is known if key steps in the RNAi pathway can be inhibited by small molecules. This dissertation describes a cell-based small molecule screen to assay for the suppression of naturally occurring RNAi in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells induced by viral RNA replication. This screen resulted in the identification of twenty lead compounds in the primary screen that were narrowed down to five RNAi inhibitors (RINs) in the secondary screen by Northern blot analysis. Genetic and biochemical approaches were taken subsequently to determine the targets of these RINs in the RNAi pathway. In Drosophila melanogaster, RNAi begins with the dicing of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the nuclease Dicer-2. This is followed by the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that contains a single-stranded siRNA bound to the RNaseH-like Argonaute-2 (Ago2) and cleaves the target mRNA that is complementary to the siRNA. The first set of experiments in this study divided the five RIN compounds into two groups. Although all of the RIN compounds were highly potent in the suppression of RNAi triggered in S2 cells by long dsRNA, artificial initiation of RNAi by synthetic siRNA was also inhibited by RINs 4 and 5, but not by RINs 1-3. These findings indicate that RINs 1-3 target the upstream steps of the RNAi pathway while RINs 4 and 5 target the downstream steps. Further biochemical experiments demonstrated that RINs 1 and 2 inhibited the dicing of long dsRNA into siRNAs and that RIN5 blocked cleavage (slicing) of target mRNA mediated by an siRNA-programmed RISC. These results demonstrate for the first time that both dicing and slicing in the core RNAi pathway can be targeted for inhibition by small molecules. The last set of experiments determined if the RIN compounds were able to suppress the RNAi-mediated antiviral immunity triggered by infection initiated by virion inoculation. Both Flock house virus (FHV) and Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) replicated to much higher levels in S2 cells following treatment with each RIN compound and RINs 3, 4 and 5 dramatically enhanced the cytopathic effect of both positive-strand RNA viruses. The B2 protein encoded by FHV is a virus suppressor of RNAi (VSR) indispensable for infection of S2 cells. In the absence of RNAi suppression, the B2-deficient mutant of FHV (FHV<em>f</em>´B2) is rapidly cleared in S2 cells following challenge inoculation with viral particles unless RNAi is suppressed in S2 cells, for example, by Ago2 depletion. Treatment of S2 cells with each of the five RIN compounds enhanced the accumulation of FHV<em>f</em>´B2. Notably, FHV<em>f</em>´B2 replicated to similarly high levels in Ago2-depleted S2 cells and S2 cells treated with RIN5. Moreover, both RINs 2 and 5 enhanced the accumulation and virulence of FHV in adult flies and RIN treatment of Caenorhabditis elegans also partially inhibited RNAi induced by a B2-deficient replicon of FHV or exogenous dsRNA.In summary, the experiments detailed in this body of work established a cell-based screen for the identification of small molecule antagonists of RNAi. These experiments also provided a pipeline of experiments to establish where and how the identified compounds affect the RNAi pathway.

Purkinje cell dendritic spine density from correlated three dimensional light and electron microscopy
Dendritic spines are primary sites of excitatory postsynaptic inputs in the CNS and changes in their number, size, and shape are linked to cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Spines influence diffusion of chemical signals along dendrites, which contributes to transmission and information processing within signal transduction pathways. Spines have also been thought to act as a trapping mechanism to slow intracellular diffusion in dendrites. Previous studies revealed a wide range in Purkinje cell spine density, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the cell morphology of this particular neuron. Differences in spine density reported in previous studies may be due to variations in animal species, imaging method, or sample preparation. It is challenging to count spines because they fall between the resolution gaps in light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) ; they are too small to resolve completely using LM and too large for EM without 3D reconstruction. In this investigation, correlated LM/EM imaging was used on identical rat Purkinje dendrites to compare spine density and address discrepancies in spine quantification at these two different microscopic scales. Dendritic segments were chosen from several areas within the dendritic tree to limit sampling bias and explore effects of dendritic segment diameter, distance from soma, and branch order on spine density estimations. Spine density was 40% lower in LM compared to EM. This is likely due to improvements in resolution in EM techniques. Additionally, little to no relationship was found between spine density and diameter, distance from soma, or branch order

Systematic Studies of the Parasitoid Wasp Genus Cales (Chalcidoidea: Aphelinidae): Combined Molecular and Morphological Approaches to Classification and Evolution
Calesinae is a small group of chalcidoid wasps that, for species with known host associations, are parasitoids of whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Prior to this study, Cales diversity included one species in the Neotropical region (Cales noacki, introduced from South America into citrus growing regions of North America, the Mediterranean and tropical Africa for biological control of woolly whitefly), and two species from Australia (Cales spenceri and Cales orchamoplati). The morphological study emphasizes the likely plesiomorphic Australian species, and includes a description of a new species from New Zealand reared from the whitefly Asterochiton pittospori. Cales shares many characteristics with Aphelinidae, though additional studies of character systems across Chalcidoidea are needed to determine the likely sister taxon.	Studies of the Neotropical Cales fauna reveal far greater diversity than previously thought. Twenty-one new species are described, and a neotype is designated for C. noacki, which is redescribed based on specimens molecularly determined to be conspecific with the neotype. The Neotropical Cales fauna is very morphologically conserved, so species cannot always be determined based on morphology alone. Therefore, species boundaries are established using combined evidence from morphology, biogeography, 28S-D2-5 rDNA and a 390bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene. A molecular phylogeny and separate identification keys to male and female species are provided.	The molecular phylogenetic studies of Cales revealed that two molecularly distinct but morphologically cryptic species were introduced into California for control of woolly whitefly in citrus. The most common of the two was determined to be C. noacki, which molecularly matched specimens from Chile, and the second was newly described as Cales rosei, which did not molecularly match any of the specimens collected from Central or South American. We employ multivariate analyses of fore wing shape combined with biological control importation and release records to infer the likely source locality for C. rosei. The analyses support a Chilean origin of C. noacki. In addition, the wing shapes of molecularly-determined C. rosei specimens most closely matched biological control specimens collected near Buenos Aires, Argentina, indicating that this is the likely source locality for this species.

The integration of language with perceptual systems
Recent theories on language and concepts suggest that when comprehending the sentence, the deafening jets soared over the UCSD campus, we activate perceptual systems that have previously been used for hearing and seeing related events. There is a growing body of research in support of the idea that perceptual features interact with meaning comprehension, but the current research is not sufficient to describe how and why this interaction occurs. The work presented here investigates the processing mechanisms behind the integration of language and perceptual systems. The studies focus first on property terms such as deafening, shiny and rough, that describe experiences in different perceptual modalities, and then on motion verbs such as soar and tumble. The results verify that information about perceptual modality and motion direction is available during comprehension. Furthermore, the results suggest that the stages of processing at which perceptual features of language are accessible and used are variable. In the semantic domain of motion for example, the results show perceptual motion information in language is processed at a high cognitive level and is influenced by context. The conclusions that fall out of the varied results are that language meaning has perceptual components as initially suggested, but also that language meaning might be co-opted by perceptual processes. We must not confuse these two related possibilities when investigating the perceptual nature of meaning

Catestatin in heart and brain
Chromogranin A (CgA) and its processed, bioactive peptides are known effectors numerous biological pathways. Initially, CgA was studied as an important prohormone peptide of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. Previous studies have shown CgA's necessity in the exocytosis and the release of peptides stored within dense -core secretory granules. Catestatin is a product of CgA processing and serves as a major inhibitor of CgA by antagonizing CgA's effects. This thesis investigated the expression of CgA and catestatin in tissues outside the adrenal gland. We were particularly interested in the tissues outside the adrenal medulla that incur collateral damage as a result of increased sympathetic tone. Specifically, we investigated the processing and expression of chromogranin A into its inhibitory peptide, catestatin in the heart and brain. We found not only a differential processing pattern between the adrenal, heart, and brain tissue, but also an age-dependent processing pattern

Mechanisms of the anti-inflammation action of pulsatile laminar flow : role of AMPK in epigenetic modifications
Pulsatile laminar flow (PS) mediates various anti- inflammatory and anti-proliferative functions in endothelial cells (ECs) through the upregulation of atheroprotective molecules such as Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). However, the mechanisms involved in the repression of inflammatory responses by mechanical stimuli have not been elucidated. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), 24-hr PS (12 ± 4 dynes/cm²) inhibited the gene expression of inflammatory and adhesion molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) and E-selectin (SELE). Using Compound C, an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) specific inhibitor, I found that the inhibition of gene expression by PS was dependent on the activity of AMPK. In assessing the functional consequences of the PS-inhibition of adhesion molecule expression, I found that PS attenuated monocyte attachment to ECs and that this effect was reversed under Compound C treatment, suggesting the requirement of AMPK in the reduction of monocyte attachment by PS. Recent studies suggest a key role for epigenetics in the pathogenesis of human disease, especially those involving inflammatory responses, and have established epigenetic pathways as fundamental determinants of endothelial gene expression. In concert with the finding on PS-induced gene repression, I have shown that PS induced the recruitment of the corepressor enzyme histone deacetylase-5 (HDAC5) to the MCP-1 and VCAM proximal promoters and that this recruitment was associated with a histone hypoacetylation status on these promoters. Furthermore, these PS-regulated epigenetic changes were demonstrated to be AMPK-dependent. In examining the relationship among shear stress, epigenetic dynamics, and inflammatory responses, I have demonstrated that PS exerts anti-inflammatory effects on ECs through downregulation of inflammatory gene expression and functional responses, and via recruitment of corepressors with subsequent histone modifications. Furthermore, I have established that these responses are dependent on the AMPK signaling pathway. This study has contributed to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms in vascular cells, especially on the roles of intracellular mediators and epigenetic elements in the PS- induced downregulation of inflammatory processes, which are implicated in the early development of atherosclerosis

Crosslinking studies in natural products biosynthesis
Many pharmaceuticals on the market today belong to a large class of natural products called nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). Responsible for their biosynthesis are multimodular enzymes, called nonrbisomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). They employ the carrier protein to mediate proper processing of biosynthetic intermediates by tethering monomeric units as they are condensed and modified by other catalytic enzymes in the synthetase. Biochemical and genetic investigations of these enzymes have uncovered the key principles of NRP synthesis ; however, little progress has been made in the manipulation of this biosynthetic machinery for the production of novel therapeutic agents due to what little is known about the protein interactions governing NRP biosynthesis. As a result, new approaches are needed to uncover the structural and mechanistic features involved in the selective communication between these enzymes. We have developed novel chemical probes capable of facilitating structural and mechanistic studies of the dynamic intra- and intermodular interactions within NRPSs. Employing bioorthogonal probes compatible with carrier protein modification, we designed a crosslinking assay for examining protein interactions between cognate partner NRPSs. In this study, we demonstrated that the probes capable of crosslinking NRPS modules with compatible communication (COM) mediating domains under copper free conditions serve as unique diagnostic tools for exploring protein interactions in NRPS systems. We also synthesized a mechanism-based probe of the epimerase (E) domain, adding another chemical tool to our arsenal of crosslinking probes. This study showed that chlorovinylglycine acts as an irreversible inactivator of the E domain utilizing a condensation assay dependent on E domain activity. Given that the bioorthogonal crosslinking probes as well as the mechanism-based probe of the E domain rely on the carrier protein for functional activity, these probes serve as ideal chemical tools for engaging in structural studies to decipher the molecular mechanism and chemical biology underlying the discrete domains within not only NRPS systems but also other carrier protein- mediated biosynthetic assembly lines

The comparative genomics of salinispora and the distribution and abundance of secondary metabolite genes in marine plankton
This dissertation is based on a bioinformatics approach to study microbiology, ecology, evolution, marine biology and secondary metabolites. Comparative genomics was applied to identify the similarities and differences between two marine Actinobacteria Salinispora tropica and S. arenicola. The first step in this analysis was to identify orthologous genes between the two species and create a gene-by-gene alignment of the genomes in order to identify synteny of orthologs. The second step was to identify all secondary metabolite gene clusters and mobile genetic elements followed by a thorough analysis of the evidence for horizontal gene transfer. The first two steps reveal that the main differences between these species lie on genomic islands that harbor secondary metabolites and mobile genetic elements. The Salinispora genomes were used as the basis for comparison against other Actinobacteria to identify possible marine adaptation genes. Several marine adaptation genes were identified based on two fundamental approaches, a comparative genomic approach and a study of gene annotation previously linked to marine adaptation. These two approaches, coupled with phylogenetic analyses, identified genes that show a close relationship to marine bacteria and appear to be involved in marine adaptation. During this study, a gene that encodes a mechanosensitive channel was identified as having been lost in Salinispora relative to almost all other terrestrial Actinobacteria. This gene is likely a contributing factor to the inability of Salinispora to grow when seawater based media is replaced with DI based growth media. In this dissertation, I also describe a method to identify sequence tags related to polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. I applied this method to study a metagenome of surface water collected in the California current and metatranscriptomes of a dinoflagellate bloom in surface water of the coast of California and water beneath sea ice in Antarctica. This study revealed an abundance of protist-associated secondary metabolite genes and evidence that extensive sequencing efforts will be required to detect rare functional genes such as those involved in secondary metabolism

Biological and molecular characterization of lifeguard : an inhibitor of the Fas apoptotic pathway
Apoptosis or programmed cell death participates in several biological processes, including embryonic development, tissue remodeling, tumor surveillance and immune system regulation. The Fas pathway is among the most studied apoptotic pathways. Its misregulation can contribute to many diseases including autoimmunity and cancer. Lifeguard (LFG) is a membrane protein isolated as an inhibitor of the Fas apoptotic pathway. LFG has wide tissue distribution with highest expression in the brain, predominantly in neurons of hippocampus and cerebellum. In order to study the biological role of LFG, we used two different models; mice with reduced LFG expression by siRNA lentiviral transgenesis and LFG null mice. Phenotypic characterization of these mice indicated that loss of LFG affected several organs, such as lungs, kidneys, spleen, thymus and brain. The work presented here reports the investigation of LFG's role in the CNS (1), in the immune system (2) as well as the molecular and biochemical characterization of LFG (3). 1. We focused in the study of LFG's biological role in the brain, especially in cerebellum, where the phenotype was most severe. LFG affected cerebellar size in early development, internal granular layer size, and Purkinje cell differentiation, morphology and susceptibility to apoptosis. In the last decade there has been increasing evidence for an involvement of the Fas apoptotic pathway in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we have started to test the hypothesis that LFG could have a neuroprotective role against stroke, by inhibiting Fas induced apoptosis. 2. We also investigated the role of LFG in the immune system, especially in T cell development. Based on LFG's expression pattern and on the phenotypical characterization of the T cell subpopulations in the thymus of siLFG mice we hypothesized that LFG is a survival factor whose expression is upregulated after the major selection checkpoints in T cell development. 3. We demonstrated that LFG blocks the Fas apoptotic cascade at the level of caspase 8 activation. We also showed that LFG is ubiquitinated and it interacts with the E3 Ubiquitin ligase AIP4. Finally, deletion mutant studies revealed that the last intracellular loop and transmembrane domain of LFG are essential for its antiapoptotic function

Gene expression of growth factors and receptors in vestibular schwannoma
Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are known to carry mutations on the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene. However, the mechanism by which vestibular schwannomas occur is not well understood. The gene expression of several growth factors and receptors implicated in oncogenesis were evaluated in greater auricular nerve control tissue and vestibular schwannoma tissue taken from patients with sporadic VS and those with NF2-related VS using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and normalized with standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene, human cyclophylin. Result demonstrated significant upregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR-1), glial cell line derived growth factor receptor alpha 1(GFRA-1), insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta 1(TGFB-1), nerve growth factor receptor(NGFR), and downregulation of platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGFR-B) in sporadic VS. Significant differences in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1(FGFR-1), glial cell line derived growth factor receptor alpha 1(GFRA-1), and vascular endothelia growth factor(VEGF) gene expression was found between sporadic and NF2-related VS.

Expression of the Lhx genes apterous and lim1 in an errant polychaete: implications for bilaterian appendage evolution, neural development, and muscle diversification
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Arthropod and vertebrate appendages appear to have evolved via parallel co-option of a plesiomorphic gene regulatory network. Our previous work implies that annelids evolved unrelated appendage-forming mechanisms; we therefore found no support for homology of parapodia and arthropodia at the level of the whole appendage. We expand on that study here by asking whether expression of the LIM homeobox (Lhx) genes apterous and lim1 in the annelid Neanthes arenaceodentata supports homology of the dorsal branches as well as the proximodistal axes of parapodia and arthropodia. In addition, we explore whether the neural expression of apterous and lim1 in Neanthes supports the putative ancestral function of the Lhx gene family in regulating the differentiation and maintenance of neuronal subtypes.
				
				
					
						Results
					Both genes exhibit continuous expression in specific portions of the developing central nervous system, from hatching to at least the 13-chaetiger stage. For example, nerve cord expression occurs in segmentally iterated patterns consisting of diffuse sets of many lim1-positive cells and comparatively fewer, clustered pairs of apterous-positive cells. Additionally, continuous apterous expression is observed in presumed neurosecretory ganglia of the posterior brain, while lim1 is continuously expressed in stomatogastric ganglia of the anterior brain. apterous is also expressed in the jaw sacs, dorsal parapodial muscles, and a presumed pair of cephalic sensory organs, whereas lim1 is expressed in multiple pharyngeal ganglia, the segmental peripheral nervous system, neuropodial chaetal sac muscles, and parapodial ligules.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The early and persistent nervous system expression of apterous and lim1 in Neanthes juveniles supports conservation of Lhx function in bilaterian neural differentiation and maintenance. Our results also suggest that diversification of parapodial muscle precursors involves a complementary LIM code similar to those generating distinct neuronal identities in fly and mouse nerve cords. Expression of apterous and lim1 in discrete components of developing parapodia is intriguing but does not map to comparable expression of these genes in developing arthropod appendages. Thus, annelid and arthropod appendage development apparently evolved, in part, via distinct co-option of the neuronal regulatory architecture. These divergent patterns of apterous and lim1 activity seemingly reflect de novo origins of parapodia and arthropodia, although we discuss alternative hypotheses.

[talin, integrin, domain, interaction, membrane]

Functional mapping of auto-inhibitory sites in talin
Integrin activation by ìnside-out' signaling is a key process in cell migration and adhesion to extracellular matrix. Recent in-vivo and in-vitro studies have provided convincing evidence that the binding of talin, a cytoskeletal protein, to the integrin beta cytoplasmic tails is necessary and sufficient for integrin activation. The significance of its role in integrin signaling leads to the expectation that functions of talin are tightly controlled. Indeed, previous data have shown that cellular distribution of talin and its interaction with integrins is highly regulated; talin resides in the cytosol of platelets under resting conditions but, in response to intracellular signals, translocates to the membrane where it interacts with and activate integrins. However, despite intense interests and vigorous efforts, our understanding of molecular basis of talin regulation remains incomplete. In contrast to FL talin, the N-terminal THD binds to and strongly activates integrins without requiring additional signaling. Thus, we hypothesized that a region in the talin rod domain is involved in suppressing the functions of talin. Sequential C-terminal truncations of the talin rod domain and subsequent mutational analysis revealed that an alpha-helical bundle termed Domain E negatively regulates membrane recruitment of talin via its inter- domain interaction with the F3 domain of talin. However, increased membrane association of talin caused by disruption of the Domain E-F3 interaction is insufficient for plasma membrane localization of talin, for the talin- integrin interaction, or for integrin activation in cells or in an in-vitro nanodisc system. NMR analysis revealed an inter-domain interaction between another &alpha;- helical bundle in the talin rod called VBS1/2a and the F23 domain of talin, and truncation of VBS1/2a led to increased plasma membrane localization of talin. In addition, truncation analysis identified a short fragment within the linker region between THD and the rod domain that interferes with the talin-integrin interaction. In this study, we have mapped three auto-inhibitory sites within talin and have assigned a specific function to each one of them. These findings provide insights as to how talin is regulated and what may happen to talin during the final steps in integrin activation

Kinase and Hormone Receptor Signaling Networks in Cancer
Cell signaling networks govern basic cellular activities including cell growth, proliferation, survival and death. Dysregulation of signaling pathways caused by dysfunctional kinases and hormone receptors is commonly seen in human cancers. Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) has been indicated to be involved in determining cell size, cell proliferation and glucose homeostasis. The dissertation work dissected the regulation of S6 phosphorylation (pS6) by growth factor-driven pathways and amino acids in details. It challenged the common notion that pS6 is a good readout for the PI3K/Akt pathway in therapeutic evaluation by showing that pS6 received inputs from and could potentially depend on both overactivated PI3K and MAPK pathways in cancer cells. Furthermore, it provided evidence that a sustained amino acid input to mTORC1 was sufficient to cause pS6 and cell proliferation resistance to Akt and MEK inhibitors, which raised the possibility to target the amino acids/mTORC1 axis in anticancer treatment. The dissertation also comprised a functional study of constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) splice variants in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). By using immunoflurescent staining, luciferase reporter assay and xenograft animal models, we showed that only constitutively nuclear localized AR variants displayed transcriptional activity and growth advantage. However, those variants lost their activity when full length AR was blocked either pharmacologically or genetically, hence were not considered the cause of drug resistance in CRPC.

Regulation of Heterotrimeric G Alpha Subunits  in the Filamentous Fungus, Neurospora crassa
Heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathways are crucial for eukaryotic cells to regulate environmental sensing, growth and development.  G protein signaling involves a membrane spanning receptor called a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that can be activated by an extracellular signal.  GPCR's are bound intracellularly by a trimer of proteins: the G&alpha; subunit, which binds and hydrolyzes GTP, and a tightly associated G&beta;&gamma; dimer.  Upon receptor activation, a conformational change causes the G&alpha; subunit to exchange GDP for GTP and become dissociated from the GPCR and G&alpha;.  The GPCR is thus considered a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G&alpha; subunit.  The G&alpha; subunit has intrinsic GTPase activity which converts GTP to GDP, causing G&alpha; to re-associate with the receptor and G&beta;&gamma;.  This dissertation focuses on the regulation of G protein signaling in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>.  <italic>N. crassa</italic> has three G&alpha; proteins (GNA-1, GNA-2, GNA-3), one G&beta; (GNB-1), one G&gamma; (GNG-1), and 10 predicted GPCR's.  The G&alpha; subunit GNA-1 in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has been shown to be vital for proper cell growth and differentiation, and a variety of functions have been identified for GNA-1.  Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, I identified interesting potential partners of GNA-1 including two metabolic enzymes, two proteins involved in protein synthesis, an actin nucleating protein, and proteins involved in vitamin synthesis, lipid, and two fungal specific proteins with unknown function. The majority of this dissertation focuses on a homolog of a non-GPCR GEF, RIC8, which has been shown to be important in mechanisms for G&alpha; regulation in animals.  RIC8 is present in filamentous fungi, but is absent from the genomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and sequenced protists, including <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. Deletion of <italic>ric8</italic> leads to defects in polar growth and asexual and sexual development in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, and constitutively activated alleles of <italic>gna-1</italic> and <italic>gna-3</italic> rescue many defects of &delta;<italic>ric8</italic> mutants. RIC8 interacts in vitro with GNA-1 and GNA-3 and preliminary results show that RIC8 has GEF activity toward GNA-1.  This data shows both a functional and physical interaction between RIC8, GNA-1 and GNA-3.  Hyphae from <italic>Neurospora</italic> &delta;<italic>ric8</italic> mutants have small cell compartments that contain nuclei that are smaller and morphologically abnormal compared to wild-type, which also suggest a role in polar cell growth.  Taken together, our results support a role for RIC8 and G proteins in regulation of polar growth in <italic>Neurospora</italic>.

Protein secretion systems in Bordetella and Burkholderia species and their roles in virulence
<italic>Bordetella</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are significant human and animal pathogens. <italic>Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis</italic> and <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> colonize respiratory epithelium to cause human pertussis and pertussis-like respiratory illnesses, while <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> and its less-virulent relative <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> are soil organisms that can behave as opportunistic pathogens and survive as facultative intracellular parasites. <italic>Bordetella</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> are well equipped with virulence determinants, including multiple protein secretion systems. In the first section of this dissertation I describe an analysis of the <italic>Bordetella</italic> type III secretion (T3SS) effector protein BteA, which is necessary and sufficient for the induction of rapid toxicity in a variety of mammalian cell lines. We identify a N-terminal domain of BteA that mediates its localization to lipid raft domains of mammalian cells following ectopic expression and T3SS-mediated translocation by <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>. The rest of the dissertation is focused on the secretion systems and virulence mechanisms in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>. Unlike <italic>Bordetella</italic>, which contains a single injection-type T3SS and one known effector protein BteA, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> contains three injection T3SSs that function in mediating its interactions with other organisms in the rhizosphere and in mammalian pathogenesis. In the second section of the dissertation, the roles of T3SS and other virulence mechanisms are closely examined in the intracellular lifecycle of <italic>Burkholderia</italic>. Bacteria were delivered directly into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells using a photothermal nanoblade device, bypassing invasion and the need to escape from endosomes. Activity of the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> secretion apparatus T3SS (T3SS<sub>Bsa</sub>) was critical for endosome escape following infection, but was not required for subsequent actin polymerization, intercellular spread and the fusion of host cell membranes to form multinucleate giant cells (MNGCs) following cytosolic nanoblade delivery of bacteria. Motility, mediated by either the Fla2 flagellar system or actin polymerization, was required for cell-cell spread and MNGC formation by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, as was the activity of a type VI secretion (T6SS) system. We conclude that the primary means for intercellular spread involves cell fusion, as opposed to pseudopod engulfment and bacterial escape from double-membrane vacuoles. The third section of the dissertation describes further analysis of the Fla2 flagellar T3SS and <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> injection T3SS effector proteins. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we discovered that <italic>fla2</italic> encodes multiple, lateral flagellar filaments and is activated following infection of mammalian cells. Surprisingly, constitutive expression of a Fla2 response regulator protein, Frr, strongly reduced plaquing efficiency in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> and <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>. I also describe the identification and analysis of novel <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> effector protein (Bep) candidates. Specific phenotypes for six Bep proteins were observed following transfections of HeLa cells; BepA exhibited perinuclear localization, BepB resulted in cytotoxicity and alterations in cell morphology, BepC bundled actin, BepD decorated microtubules, and BepE and BepF rearranged actin and altered cell morphology. However, strains carrying deletion mutations in single Bep effector candidate loci did not exhibit defects following infection of mammalian cells. A single strain containing deletions in BopA, BopC and BopE, the three previously known T3SS<sub>Bsa</sub> effectors, exhibited reduced plaque formation in RAW264.7 macrophages. Of the three effectors, only BopA was seen to play a major role in <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> intracellular pathogenesis.

Pichia pastoris Rppa09976 is a peroxisomal membrane- associated ACBP domain-containing protein, delivered to peroxisomes from the ER, and is required for their selective degradation
It is imperative for organisms to find a way to recycle and degrade cytoplasmic constituents and eliminate unnecessary organelles. Autophagy is a tightly-regulated, non-selective degradation process that plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis by sequestering ubiquitous proteins or organelles, and delivers such cargo to the vacuole so that they may be degraded and their constituents recycled. For instance, peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles required for certain metabolic pathways including both alpha- and beta- oxidation of fatty acids, decomposition of harmful hydrogen peroxide molecules, the production of penicillin in certain fungi and photorespiration in plants. When peroxisomes become redundant, they are selectively delivered to the vacuole in an autophagy-related pathway, termed pexophagy. While most proteins required for autophagy are also required for pexophagy, only two proteins, Atg26 and Atg30, are known to be solely required for pexophagy, but not autophagy-related pathways. Here, we identified a novel peroxisomal membrane-associated acyl -CoA binding protein (ACBP) domain-containing protein, Rppa09976, also required for the selective degradation of peroxisomes, but dispensable for other autophagy-related pathways. Unlike most peroxisomal membrane proteins, Rppa09976 is a type II PMP, trafficking from the ER to peroxisomes, and degrades independent of pexophagy, autophagy and vacuolar proteolysis. Furthermore, we have identified a putative mammalian homolog, the murine peroxisomal MmAcbd5 protein, which, like Rppa09976, contains an N-terminal acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) domain. This discovery has led to a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the selective sequestration and degradation of peroxisomes, a process that may apply to higher organisms.

Assessing the potential for luminescence dating in the Mojave Desert, California
A reliable, widely applicable geochronological tool is an imperative part of neotectonic studies. While there are several geochronological techniques available for Quaternary research, each method has its limitations. Luminescence dating has huge potential for these kinds of studies, as it relies on commonly occurring minerals (namely quartz and K-feldspar), directly dates the event of interest, can be applied over a wide range of timescales, and gives ages without any complex calibration required. 	While optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of K-feldspar work well in many regions, these techniques have proven problematic for many OSL users and dating specialists in southern California. Issues of low sensitivity and low (dim) signal intensity often yield inconsistent and questionable results. It is the aim of this study to develop an improved methodology for luminescence dating in this region.	From the El Paso Peaks trench site on the central Garlock fault, several samples were collected for luminescence dating. Conventional quartz OSL protocols did not yield accurate age estimates. Various K-feldspar IRSL protocols were tested in this study, while new techniques were developed and assessed. Experimentation with two novel procedures, the selective SAR48-12 and SACoR approaches, demonstrate great potential for innovative new ways to deal with problematic samples. The novel K-feldspar isothermal thermoluminescence (ITL) approach gives encouraging results, although further research is warranted to determine how robust and widely applicable the technique is. Because of the pervasive problem of incomplete bleaching in the region, single-grain K-feldspar IRSL measurements may be the best technique for isolating well bleached grains and determining precise and accurate age estimates.

Analysis of Peptidergic Neural Networks Regulating Ecdysis in the Fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster
At the end of each developmental stage, insects undergo dramatic changes to shed old cuticle, a process called ecdysis. Ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH) released from epitracheal gland Inka cells is a master controller of events during ecdysis through its direct action on the central nervous system (CNS). ETH receptor neurons in the CNS comprise a peptide signaling cascade that initiates and schedules physiological and behavioral changes during the ecdysis sequence.      Among the physiological events regulated by ETH during ecdysis is tracheal inflation, which is the first visible change that occurs following release of ETH. I investigated the role of kinin neurons in the ecdysis sequence and found that impairment of ETH, kinin, or kinin receptor signaling elicits defects in tracheal inflation. Ablation of kinin neurons produced larvae exhibiting the buttoned-up phenotype and inability to remove residual fragments of old trachea during ecdysis  These findings suggest that kinin signaling is involved in both tracheal inflation and ecdysis behavior.      In order to analyze further the signaling cascade involving ETHR peptidergic ensembles in the ecdysis behavioral sequence, I investigated changes in pupal ecdysis behaviors of transgenic flies with targeted ablations of specific ETHR-A neurons. Varying degrees of behavioral defects were detected following ablation of ETHR neurons expressing eclosion hormone (EH), FMRFamide, kinin, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), myoinhibitory peptide (MIP), burs and bursicon. I determined that kinin neurons are critical regulators of pre-ecdysis and also discovered that bursicon neurons likely are involved in regulation of both ecdysis and post-ecdysis. To verify a previous sequential activation model for ecdysis regulation, I monitored calcium dynamics in two ETHR ensembles (kinin and bursicon) in the same animal elicited by ETH exposure. I found that kinin and bursicon neurons have distinct activation patterns and that they are activated sequentially. To explain the sequential activation of these ETHR ensembles, I tested a differential sensitivity model by analyzing changes in ecdysis scheduling following modification of ETH receptor density. Over-expression or suppression of ETH receptors in targeted neurons resulted in changes in onset timing during pupal ecdysis, supporting the hypothesis that differential sensitivity of ETHR ensembles to their sequential activation by ETH.     In summary, my data demonstrates that differential sensitivity of ETHR peptidergic ensembles can explain how the master hormone ETH schedules changes in physiology and behavior during the ecdysis sequence.

[rotenone, mechanism, pathway, complex, cell, response, neurodegeneration, disease]

Transcriptome analysis of a rotenone model of parkinsonism reveals complex I-tied and -untied toxicity mechanisms common to neurodegenerative diseases.
The pesticide rotenone, a neurotoxin that inhibits the mitochondrial complex I, and destabilizes microtubules (MT) has been linked to Parkinson disease (PD) etiology and is often used to model this neurodegenerative disease (ND). Many of the mechanisms of action of rotenone are posited mechanisms of neurodegeneration; however, they are not fully understood. Therefore, the study of rotenone-affected functional pathways is pertinent to the understanding of NDs pathogenesis. This report describes the transcriptome analysis of a neuroblastoma (NB) cell line chronically exposed to marginally toxic and moderately toxic doses of rotenone. The results revealed a complex pleiotropic response to rotenone that impacts a variety of cellular events, including cell cycle, DNA damage response, proliferation, differentiation, senescence and cell death, which could lead to survival or neurodegeneration depending on the dose and time of exposure and cell phenotype. The response encompasses an array of physiological pathways, modulated by transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory networks, likely activated by homeostatic alterations. Pathways that incorporate the contribution of MT destabilization to rotenone toxicity are suggested to explain complex I-independent rotenone-induced alterations of metabolism and redox homeostasis. The postulated mechanisms involve the blockage of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anions channels (VDACs) by tubulin, which coupled with other rotenone-induced organelle dysfunctions may underlie many presumed neurodegeneration mechanisms associated with pathophysiological aspects of various NDs including PD, AD and their variant forms. Thus, further investigation of such pathways may help identify novel therapeutic paths for these NDs.

The first part of this work deals with the synthesis and evaluation of these compounds as viscosity sensors. The effects of the molecular structure and electronic density of these rotors to the emission wavelength, fluorescence intensity and viscosity sensitivity are presented.

Pheromonal bile acid 3-ketopetromyzonol sulfate primes the neuroendocrine system in sea lamprey
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Vertebrate pheromones are known to prime the endocrine system, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. However, no known pheromone molecule has been shown to modulate directly the synthesis or release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), the main regulator of the HPG axis. We selected sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) as a model system to determine whether a single pheromone component alters the output of GnRH.Sea lamprey male sex pheromones contain a main component, 7&#945;, 12&#945;, 24-trihydroxy-5&#945;-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate (3 keto-petromyzonol sulfate or 3kPZS), which has been shown to modulate behaviors of mature females. Through a series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that 3kPZS modulates both synthesis and release of GnRH, and subsequently, HPG output in immature sea lamprey.
				
				
					
						Results
					The results showed that natural male pheromone mixtures induced differential steroid responses but facilitated sexual maturation in both sexes of immature animals (&#967;2 = 5.042, dF = 1, p &lt; 0.05). Exposure to 3kPZS increased plasma 15&#945;-hydroxyprogesterone (15&#945;-P) concentrations (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) and brain gene expressions (genes examined: three lamprey (l) GnRH-I transcripts, lGnRH-III, Jun and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05), but did not alter the number of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus in immature animals. In addition, 3kPZS treatments increased lGnRH peptide concentrations in the forebrain and modulated their levels in plasma. Overall, 3kPZS modulation of HPG axis is more pronounced in immature males than in females.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We conclude that a single male pheromone component primes the HPG axis in immature sea lamprey in a sexually dimorphic manner.

Comparative genomics and natural distributions of phenotypically distinct strains of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii
<italic>Crocosphaera watsonii</italic> is an ecologically important marine unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium.  It is often abundant in oligotrophic ocean regions where it provides fixed nitrogen to nutrient-limited phytoplankton communities.  Previous genetic studies have observed genetic rearrangements but very little sequence variation among natural populations or cultivated strains of <italic>Crocosphaera</italic>.  Those strains exhibit two phenotypes (large- and small-cell) with characteristics that suggest different ecological roles and niches.  Prior to this work, the genetic basis for the phenotypic differences was unknown, and molecular methods for enumerating natural <italic>C. watsonii</italic> could not differentiate between phenotypes.  To address those unanswered scientific questions, these studies compared the genomes of six <italic>C. watsonii</italic> strains, three of each phenotype, which were isolated over large spatial and temporal distances.  A large portion of those genome sequences were shared among all strains with nearly 100% nucleotide identity.  However, there were also genes that were specific to each strain, and others were specific to each phenotype, including some which could explain phenotypic differences (e.g. EPS biosynthesis).  Relative to small-cell strains, large-cell strains had larger genomes and additional genetic capabilities, including possibly increased adaptations to iron and phosphorus limitation.  Clustering based on genome sequences and content showed that strains with a common phenotype were evolutionarily most closely related, regardless of their time and location of isolation.  Surprisingly, the genome of the <italic>C. watsonii</italic> type-strain, WH8501, was quite unusual, even compared to those with the same phenotype, suggesting it may not be appropriately representative of the species.  To investigate distributions of <italic>Crocosphaera</italic> types in the marine environment, molecular assays were developed, based on phenotype-specific genes, and applied to samples from the North and South Pacific.  In those samples, small-cells dominated in the upper 75 m where abundance of both types was much greater, while large-cells dominated in samples with lower counts between 100 m and 175 m.  There was also more evidence that large-cells form aggregates in the N. Pacific.

BAY11 enhances OCT4 synthetic mRNA expression in adult human skin cells
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Introduction
               
               The OCT4 transcription factor is involved in many cellular processes, including development, reprogramming, maintaining pluripotency and differentiation. Synthetic OCT4 mRNA was recently used (in conjunction with other reprogramming factors) to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we discovered that BAY 11-7082 (BAY11), at least partially through an NF-&#954;B-inhibition based mechanism, could significantly increase the expression of OCT4 following transfection of synthetic mRNA (synRNA) into adult human skin cells.
            
            
               
                  Methods
               
               We tested various chemical and molecular small molecules on their ability to suppress the innate immune response seen upon synthetic mRNA transfection. Three molecules - B18R, BX795, and BAY11 - were used in immunocytochemical and proliferation-based assays. We also utilized global transcriptional meta-analysis coupled with quantitative PCR to identify relative gene expression downstream of OCT4.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               We found that human skin cells cultured in the presence of BAY11 resulted in reproducible increased expression of OCT4 that did not inhibit normal cell proliferation. The increased levels of OCT4 resulted in significantly increased expression of genes downstream of OCT4, including the previously identified SPP1, DUSP4 and GADD45G, suggesting the expressed OCT4 was functional. We also discovered a novel OCT4 putative downstream target gene SLC16A9 which demonstrated significantly increased expression following elevation of OCT4 levels.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               For the first time we have shown that small molecule-based stabilization of synthetic mRNA expression can be achieved with use of BAY11. This small molecule-based inhibition of innate immune responses and subsequent robust expression of transfected synthetic mRNAs may have multiple applications for future cell-based research and therapeutics.

Cancer stem cells from a rare form of glioblastoma multiforme involving the neurogenic ventricular wall
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis posits that deregulated neural stem cells (NSCs) form the basis of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM, however, usually forms in the cerebral white matter while normal NSCs reside in subventricular and hippocampal regions. We attempted to characterize CSCs from a rare form of glioblastoma multiforme involving the neurogenic ventricular wall.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We described isolating CSCs from a GBM involving the lateral ventricles and characterized these cells with in vitro molecular biomarker profiling, cellular behavior, ex vivo and in vivo techniques.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The patient&#8217;s MRI revealed a heterogeneous mass with associated edema, involving the left subventricular zone. Histological examination of the tumor established it as being a high-grade glial neoplasm, characterized by polygonal and fusiform cells with marked nuclear atypia, amphophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, frequent mitotic figures, irregular zones of necrosis and vascular hyperplasia. Recurrence of the tumor occurred shortly after the surgical resection. CD133-positive cells, isolated from the tumor, expressed stem cell markers including nestin, CD133, Ki67, Sox2, EFNB1, EFNB2, EFNB3, Cav-1, Musashi, Nucleostemin, Notch 2, Notch 4, and Pax6. Biomarkers expressed in differentiated cells included Cathepsin L, Cathepsin B, Mucin18, Mucin24, c-Myc, NSE, and TIMP1. Expression of unique cancer-related transcripts in these CD133-positive cells, such as caveolin-1 and &#8722;2, do not appear to have been previously reported in the literature. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice co-culture showed that the CD133+ cells behaved like tumor cells. The CD133-positive cells also induced tumor formation when they were stereotactically transplanted into the brains of the immune-deficient NOD/SCID mice.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This brain tumor involving the neurogenic lateral ventricular wall was comprised of tumor-forming, CD133-positive cancer stem cells, which are likely the driving force for the rapid recurrence of the tumor in the patient.

<italic>Salvia</italic> subgenus <italic>Calosphace</italic> (<italic>Lamiaceae</italic>), the largest of 5 subgenera with some 500 species and strongly supported as monophyletic, has received no comprehensive systematic research since the initial establishment of 91 taxonomic sections.  Representative taxa of 73 sections of <italic>Calosphace</italic> were sampled to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and identify major lineages using chloroplast (intergenic spacer, <italic>psbA-trnH</italic>) and nuclear DNA (ribosomal spacer region, ITS). Phylogenetic analysis of the combined data set established the monophyly of nine sections (<italic>Blakea, Corrugatae, Dusenostachys, Erythrostachys, Hastatae, Incarnatae, Microsphace, Nobiles</italic>, and <italic>Sigmoideae</italic>) and four major lineages (<italic>S. axillaris</italic>, &ldquo;<italic>Hastatae</italic> clade&rdquo;, &ldquo;<italic>Uliginosae</italic> clade&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Core <italic>Calosphace</italic>&rdquo;) corresponding with the four major stamen types identified within the subgenus.

Stellar Populations, Outflows, and Morphologies of High-Redshift Galaxies
Understanding the regulation and environment of star formation across cosmic time is critical to tracing the build-up of mass in the Universe and the interplay between the stars and gas that are the constituents of galaxies. Three studies are presented in this thesis, each examining a different aspect of star formation at a specific epoch. The first study presents the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of 321 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 3 to investigate systematically the relationship between Ly&alpha; emission and stellar populations. Ly&alpha; equivalent widths were calculated from rest-frame UV spectroscopy and optical/near-infrared/<italic>Spitzer</italic> photometry was used in population synthesis modeling to derive the key properties of age, dust extinction, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass. We directly compare the stellar populations of LBGs with and without strong Ly&alpha; emission, where we designate the former group (Ly&alpha; equivalent widths greater than 20 &Aring;) as Ly&alpha;-emitters (LAEs) and the latter group (Ly&alpha; equivalent widths  fewer than 20 &Aring;) as non-LAEs. This controlled method of comparing objects from the same UV luminosity distribution represents an improvement over previous studies in which the stellar populations of LBGs and narrowband-selected LAEs were contrasted, where the latter were often intrinsically fainter in broadband filters by an order of magnitude simply due to different selection criteria. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that Ly&alpha; equivalent width and age, SFR, and dust extinction, respectively, are significantly correlated in the sense that objects with strong Ly&alpha; emission also tend to be older, lower in star formation rate, and less dusty than objects with weak Ly&alpha; emission, or the line in absorption. We accordingly conclude that, within the LBG sample, objects with strong Ly&alpha; emission represent a later stage of galaxy evolution in which supernovae-induced outflows have reduced the dust covering fraction. We also examined the hypothesis that the attenuation of Ly&alpha; photons is lower than that of the continuum, as proposed by some, but found no evidence to support this picture.The second study focuses specifically on galactic-scale outflowing winds in 72 star-forming galaxies at z = 1 in the Extended Groth Strip. Galaxies were selected from the DEEP2 survey and follow-up LRIS spectroscopy was obtained covering SiII, CIV, FeII, MgII, and MgI lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Using  <italic>GALEX</italic>, <italic>HST</italic>, and <italic>Spitzer</italic> imaging available for the Extended Groth Strip, we examine galaxies on a per-object basis in order to better understand both the prevalence of galactic outflows at z = 1 and the star-forming and structural properties of objects experiencing outflows. Gas velocities, measured from the centroids of FeII interstellar absorption lines, are found to span the interval -217, +155 km s<super>-1</super>. We find that approximately 40% (10%) of the sample exhibits blueshifted FeII lines at the 1&sigma;  (3&sigma;) level. We also measure maximal outflow velocities using the profiles of the FeII and MgII lines; we find that MgII frequently traces higher velocity gas than FeII. Using quantitative morphological parameters derived from the <italic>HST</italic> imaging, we find that mergers are not a prerequisite for driving outflows. More face-on galaxies also show stronger winds than highly inclined systems, consistent with the canonical picture of winds emanating perpendicular to galactic disks. In light of clumpy galaxy morphologies, we develop a new physically-motivated technique for estimating areas corresponding to star formation. We use these area measurements in tandem with <italic>GALEX</italic>-derived star-formation rates to calculate star-formation rate surface densities. At least 70% of the sample exceeds a star-formation rate surface density of 0.1 solar masses yr<super>-1</super> kpc<super>-2</super>, the threshold necessary for driving an outflow in local starbursts. At the same time, the outflow detection fraction of only 40% in FeII absorption provides further evidence for an outflow geometry that is not spherically symmetric. We see a 3&sigma; trend between outflow velocity and star-formation rate surface density, but no significant trend between outflow velocity and star-formation rate. Higher resolution data are needed in order to test the scaling relations between outflow velocity and both star-formation rate and star-formation rate surface density predicted by theory.Galactic winds are further explored in the third study of this thesis, where we present a study at z = 1 of the prevalence and kinematics of ultraviolet emission lines from fine-structure FeII* transitions and resonance MgII transitions. Utilizing a multiwavelength dataset of 212 star-forming galaxies, we investigate how the strength and kinematics of FeII* and MgII emission lines vary as a function of galaxy properties. We find that FeII* emission is prevalent in the sample; composite spectra assembled on the basis of a variety of galaxy properties all show FeII* emission, particularly in the stronger 2396 and 2626 &Aring; lines. This prevalence of emission is in contrast to observations of local galaxies; the lack of FeII* emission in the small star-forming regions targeted by spectroscopic observations at z = 0 may imply that FeII* emission arises in more extended galaxy halos. The strength of FeII* emission is most strongly modulated by star-formation rate, dust attenuation, and OII equivalent width, such that systems with lower star-formation rates, lower dust levels, and larger OII equivalent widths show stronger FeII* emission. MgII emission, while not observed in a spectral stack of all the data in our sample, is seen in 30% of individual objects. We find that objects showing MgII emission have preferentially larger OII equivalent widths, bluer U-B colors, and lower stellar masses than the sample as a whole. Active galactic nuclei are not likely responsible for the MgII emission in our sample, since we have excluded active galaxies from our dataset. We also do not observe the NeV emission line at 3425 &Aring; characteristic of active galaxies in our co-added spectra. We find that the kinematics of FeII* emission lines are consistent with the systemic velocity. This result does not necessarily imply that these lines arise from star-forming regions, however, as an optically thin galactic wind could show blueshifted and redshifted FeII* emission lines centered around 0 km s<super>-1</super>. We note that FeII* emission arising from extended gas is consistent with the hypothesis that slit losses are responsible for the lack of FeII* emission in local samples. We propose that dust is primarily responsible for the correlations between FeII* strength and galaxy properties, as objects with lower star-formation rates and larger OII equivalent widths also exhibit lower dust attenuations, on average. The strong MgII emission seen in systems with larger OII equivalent widths, bluer U-B colors, and lower stellar masses may also be the result of low dust attenuation in these objects. Larger studies composed of high signal-to-noise observations will be critical for testing the hypothesis that dust is the primary modulator of fine-structure and resonance emission.

On the Structure of the Light Field at Shallow Depths in Deep Homogeneous Hydrosols
U.S. Bureau of Ships Report No. 3-5.  Recent experimental determinations of the up and downwelling irradiances in Lake Pend Oreille are studied with the purpose of explaining certain observed nonlinear trends in the semilog plots of these irradiances at shallow depths. A mathematical model which describes these irradiances is derived from the basic equations of radiative transfer. The model explains the observed phenomena in terms of the inherent optical properties of the medium and its external lighting conditions, and we arrive at a fairly detailed understanding of the light field at extreme depths (shallow and deep) in all homogeneous natural hydrosols.

Potassium nutrition and its effect on wood formation in poplar
Potassium is the most abundant cation in higher plants and essential for various physiological processes like enzyme activation, phloem transport and maintenance of cellular cation:anion balance. In addition, it mediates stomatal movements and osmoregulation during cell expansion. The uptake and transport mechanisms of potassium have been studied in detail in herbaceous species by various groups. After taken up by the roots, potassium is transported via the xylem towards the leaves, where it can be used metabolically or be loaded into the phloem and translocated to different sinks like young leaves, fruits and roots as well as developing wood. In contrast to herbaceous species our knowledge of potassium functions in trees is still incomplete and mainly focused on fertilization effects on phenological growth parameters. With regard to wood formation, previous work on spruce trees revealed a distinct correlation between potassium and cambial growth activity (Dünisch and Bauch 1994, Dünisch et al. 1998). In poplar, an important tree species in the field of wood biotechnology, we studied the role of potassium during xylogenesis and found a close correlation between cambial potassium content, osmotic potential and cambial activity (Wind et al. 2004). All parameters increased from spring to summer and decreased from summer to autumn. When poplar trees were grown under low potassium regimes, the cambial activity as well as the seasonal rate of wood increment and the vessel lumen were significantly reduced. Apart from the anatomical aspects the molecular and electrophysiological basis of potassium-dependent xylogenesis has been studied (Langer et al. 2002), indicating a strong involvement of specific ion channels. Two K+ ion channels, PTK2 and PTORK, have been identified and shown to correlate with seasonal wood production. While PTK2 carries inward K+ flux at hyperpolarized membrane potential and K+ release upon depolarization, PTORK mediates potassium release upon depolarization (Langer et al. 2002). Antibodies raised against PTORK recognized this channel in growth active trees only (Arend et al. 2005). PTORK labelling was found in young fibers of the developing wood and in ray parenchyma cells of mature wood. In the latter, it might be required for charge balance during uptake of metabolites from the vessels, whereas in differentiating fibers PTORK might be involved in the reduction of protoplast volume. Taken together, it can be concluded that potassium plays a key role in the regulation of wood formation.

Deep divergences and extensive phylogeographic structure in a clade of lowland tropical salamanders
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The complex geological history of Mesoamerica provides the opportunity to study the impact of multiple biogeographic barriers on population differentiation. We examine phylogeographic patterns in a clade of lowland salamanders (Bolitoglossa subgenus Nanotriton) using two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene. We use several phylogeographic analyses to infer the history of this clade and test hypotheses regarding the geographic origin of species and location of genetic breaks within species. We compare our results to those for other taxa to determine if historical events impacted different species in a similar manner.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Deep genetic divergence between species indicates that they are relatively old, and two of the three widespread species show strong phylogeographic structure. Comparison of mtDNA and nuclear gene trees shows no evidence of hybridization or introgression between species. Isolated populations of Bolitoglossa rufescens from Los Tuxtlas region constitute a separate lineage based on molecular data and morphology, and divergence between Los Tuxtlas and other areas appears to predate the arrival of B. rufescens in other areas west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The Isthmus appears responsible for Pliocene vicariance within B. rufescens, as has been shown for other taxa. The Motagua-Polochic fault system does not appear to have caused population vicariance, unlike in other systems.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Species of Nanotriton have responded to some major geological events in the same manner as other taxa, particularly in the case of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The deep divergence of the Los Tuxtlas populations of B. rufescens from other populations highlights the contribution of this volcanic system to patterns of regional endemism, and morphological differences observed in the Los Tuxtlas populations suggests that they may represent an undescribed species of Bolitoglossa. The absence of phylogeographic structure in B. nympha, in contrast to the other widespread species in the subgenus, may be due to historical forest contraction and more recent range expansion in the region. Phylogeographic data provide substantial insight into the evolutionary history of these morphologically similar species of salamanders, and contribute to our understanding of factors that have generated the high biodiversity of Mesoamerica.

Mechanisms of peroxide sensing using phthalocyanine organic thin film transistor arrays
Detection of gas phase hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) has growing importance in the security and defenses industries. Hydrogen peroxide based explosives are increasingly popular with terrorists as they are simple to synthesize from common materials. Triacetone triperoxide, a common hydrogen peroxide based explosive, can be detected by its release of hydrogen peroxide vapor upon exposure to UV light. A selective peroxide vapor detection method is demonstrated utilizing metal phthalocyanine (MPc) thin film transistors (chemFETs) which obviated the need for a detection array. The selective detection of vapor phase H₂O₂ on a single sensor element is demonstrated by recording on-current, mobility, and threshold voltage in MPc chemFETs. Doses of H₂O₂ cause an irreversible threshold voltage shift not evident with the non-oxidizing common background analytes such water and di -methyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). Furthermore, the Vth shift responds linearly to the dose time for exposure times of 1, 5, and 20 minutes, which permits dosiometric sensing analysis. ChemFET vapor detection of di-tert-butyl peroxide is also reported with varying shifts in Vth based on the metal center of the phthalocyanine film. This analysis permits a novel approach to selective H₂O₂ detection which is fundamentally different and potentially more selective than prior H₂O₂ detection methods

Geographical Theories
The emergence of geographical theory was an inevitable product of the desire to systematize existing geographic knowledge and to use that systematized base to explore new areas of knowledge. Although the usefulness of theory and predictive models in geography is  by now a matter of record, it was not always the case. The usefulness and need for theories was often disputed, despite the oft-repeated argument that theories of location explained the laws of spatial distributions, theories of interaction explain the laws of movement and spatial behaviour, theories of growth and development explain the nature of past, present, and future states of being, and theories of decision-making and choice explain observable regularities and repeatable trends in individual, group, institutional and governmental behaviours.  Hudson (1969) argued that a theory represents a direct attempt to provide a logical system or nesting place for previously noted regularities – in his case concerning changes in rural settlement patterns. While Hudson’s task was specific, the sentiment he expressed has widespread relevance for the emergence and adoption of geographical theories generally.

[proteasome, activity, rpt6, synaptic, phosphorylation, s120]

Dynamic regulation of proteasome function by neuronal activity
Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has been shown to regulate changes in synaptic strength that underlie multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. It is plausible, therefore, that the UPS is itself regulated by synaptic activity. By utilizing live- cell imaging strategies we report the rapid and dynamic regulation of the proteasome in hippocampal neurons by neuronal activity. We find that the blockade of action potentials (APs) with tetrodotoxin (TTX) inhibited the activity of the proteasome, while the up-regulation of APs with bicuculline (BIC) dramatically increased the activity of the proteasome. In addition the regulation of the proteasome is dependent upon external calcium entry, in part through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and L- type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and requires the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Using in vitro and in vivo assays we find that CaMKII stimulates proteasome activity and directly phosphorylates Rpt6, a subunit of the 19S (PA700) subcomplex of the 26S proteasome. Our data provide a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII may regulate the proteasome in neurons to facilitate remodeling of synaptic connections through protein degradation. We next aimed to further elucidate how phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates proteasome function in neurons. Using a phospho-specific antibody we showed that Rpt6 is phosphorylated at Serine 120 (S120) in a CaMKII-dependent fashion. While phosphorylation of this site is not sufficient to regulate proteasome activity, it is necessary for CaMKII-dependent stimulation of the proteasome. Interestingly we find that phosphorylation of S120 promotes detergent resistance of Rpt6, presumably by tethering the proteasome to the actin cytoskeleton at postsynaptic compartments. Additionally, electrophysiology experiments suggest that this phosphorylation event is important for proteasome dependent synaptic remodeling. Specifically, a phospho-mimetic Rpt6 S120 mutant leads to a decrease in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude, while a phospho-dead mutant causes an increase in mEPSC amplitude. Together this data suggests that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Rpt6 at S120 is an important regulator of proteasome function and UPS dependent synaptic remodeling

Prognostication of prostate cancer based on TOP2A protein and gene assessment: TOP2A in prostate cancer
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					
						TOP2A encodes for topoisomerase II&#945;, a nuclear enzyme that controls DNA topological structure and cell cycle progression. This enzyme is a marker of cell proliferation in normal and neoplastic tissues; however, little information is available about its expression in prostate cancer (PCa).
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was automated using mouse monoclonal antibody against TOP2A (clone SWT3D1; DAKO, Carpenteria, CA, USA) at dilution 1:800 and Flex Plus detection system in autostainer 48Ultra (DAKO). FISH was performed using TOP2A (17q21)/ CEP17 probe kit (Kreateck Biotechnology, San Diego, CA, USA). Biochemical and pathological data from 193 patients with PCa were retrieved for the analysis, whose significance was considered when p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05. Also, fractal analysis was performed in a subset of 20 randomly selected cases.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					TOP2A protein expression correlated with higher Gleason scores and higher levels of preoperative PSA (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.018 and p&#8201;=&#8201;0.011). Patients with higher levels of TOP2A presented shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). In multivariate analysis, we found that TOP2A remained an independent prognostic factor of BRFS, with a relative risk of 1.98 (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001; 95% CI, 1.338&#8211;2.93); thus, cases that expressed high levels of this enzyme had a shorter BRFS compared with TOP2A-negative or TOP2A-low cases. No alterations in TOP2A gene status nor correlation between FISH and IHC results were observed. Concerning fractal analysis, patients who expressed higher levels of TOP2A have angiolymphatic invasion and presented higher Gleason scores (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.033 and p&#8201;=&#8201;0.025, respectively). Also, patients with higher expression of TOP2A presented shorter BRFS (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This is the first study to perform TOP2A protein and gene digital assessment and fractal analysis in association with BRFS in a large series of PCa. Also, we show that TOP2A gene copy number alterations are not observed in this type of tumor. So, higher protein expression of TOP2A is not related to gene amplification in PCa. Furthermore, TOP2A protein assessment has prognostic importance and, due to its relation with poor outcome, TOP2A IHC evaluation in the biopsy can represent an important tool for selecting the most suitable surgical and clinical approach for patients with PCa.

Two general vortex flow patterns have been proposed for the wake of hovering hummingbirds: (1) The two wings form a single, merged vortex ring during each wing stroke; and (2) the two wings form bilateral vortex loops during each wing stroke. The second pattern was proposed after a study with particle image velocimetry that demonstrated bilateral source flows in a horizontal measurement plane underneath hovering Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna). Proof of this hypothesis requires a clear perspective of bilateral pairs of vortices. Here, we used high-speed image sequences (500 frames per second) ofC. anna hover feeding within a white plume to visualize the vortex wake from multiple perspectives. The films revealed two key structural features: (1) Two distinct jets of downwards airflow are present under each wing; and (2) vortex loops around each jet are shed during each upstroke and downstroke. To aid in the interpretation of the flow visualization data, we analyzed high-speed kinematic data (1,000 frames per second) of wing tips and wing roots as C. anna hovered in normal air. These data were used to refine several simplified models of vortex topology. The observed flow patterns can be explained by either a single loop model with an hourglass shape or a bilateral model, with the latter being more likely. When hovering in normal air, hummingbirds used an average stroke amplitude of 153.6° (range 148.9°–164.4°) and a wingbeat frequency of 38.5 Hz (range 38.1–39.1 Hz). When hovering in the white plume, hummingbirds used shallower stroke amplitudes ( xˉ = 129.8°, range 116.3°–154.1°) and faster wingbeat frequencies ( xˉ  = 41.1 Hz, range 38.5–44.7 Hz), although the bilateral jets and associated vortices were observed across the full kinematic range. The plume did not significantly alter the air density or constrain the sustained muscle contractile frequency. Instead, higher wingbeat frequencies likely incurred a higher metabolic cost with the possible benefit of allowing the birds to more rapidly escape from the visually disruptive plume.

Analytical and experimental study of seismic performance of reinforced concrete frames infilled with masonry walls
Unreinforced masonry panels are often used as interior or exterior partitions in reinforced concrete frames. How infills affect the seismic performance of an RC building is an intricate issue since their exact role in the seismic load resistance is not yet clearly understood due to the interaction with the bounding frame. Assessing this role presents a challenge for structural engineers due to the variety and complexity of observed failure mechanisms and the lack of reliable methods able to capture these mechanisms. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental data from large-scale dynamic tests of multi-story, multi- bay infilled frames to validate the analytical tools. This dissertation addresses this intricate issue with extensive analytical and experimental studies. The testing program involved quasistatic tests of small and large-scale specimens with and without openings and shake-table tests of a large-scale, three-story, two-bay, RC frame. This frame, which had a non-ductile design and was infilled with unreinforced masonry panels with openings, was the largest structure of this type tested on a shake table. The design of the specimens, the testing procedures, and the obtained results are discussed in this dissertation as they enhanced the understanding of the structural behavior. The experimental data has been used to validate the proposed analytical tools. These include a nonlinear finite element methodology and a simplified assessment tool for the engineering practice. The finite element modeling methodology combines the smeared and discrete crack approaches to capture the shear and flexural failure of RC members, crushing and splitting of brick units and the mixed-mode fracture of mortar joints. A systematic approach has been developed to calibrate the material parameters, and the comparison with the experimental results indicates it can successfully capture the nonlinear behavior of the physical specimens. The validated models have been used in parametric studies to identify the critical material parameters and assess the influence of design parameters and variations of the geometrical configurations to the structural response. The parametric studies and experimental findings have been used to develop a simplified method for the structural assessment of infilled frames. The proposed approach can estimate the structural performance, including the stiffness and strength and can be used for the construction of simple strut models for an entire structure

Surface Investigations of Novel Materials with Low Energy Ion Scattering
Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is an experimental technique that is of great utility in surface investigations of novel materials. LEIS is uniquely sensitive to the composition of the outermost atomic layer of a solid and can be used to determine the structure of the lattice in the near-surface region of a single crystal. More recently, it has been shown that the neutralization of scattered low energy alkali ions, which occurs via resonant charge transfer (RCT), is sensitive to the localized surface electronic structure. This thesis further demonstrates that RCT during LEIS reveals correlated-electron behavior at high temperature. The valence electron of a singly charged alkaline-earth ion is a magnetic impurity that interacts with the continuum of many-body excitations in the metal, leading to Kondo and mixed valence resonances near the Fermi energy. The occupation of these resonances is acutely sensitive to the surface temperature, which results in a marked temperature dependence of the ion neutralization. While the neutralization of magnesium (Mg) and gallium (Ga) scattered from polycrystalline gold (Au) shows little dependence on temperature, scattered strontium (Sr) does show an anomalous temperature dependence that provides clear evidence of electron correlations. The difference in neutralization between the alkaline earth Mg and Sr projectiles is discussed in terms of the velocity of the outgoing projectiles.The Topological Insulator, Bismuth Selenide (Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>), is comprised of Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers (QLs), so that Se should terminate the stable surface. After cleaving in ultra-high vacuum at room temperature, however, low energy electron diffraction shows order while low energy Na<super>+</super> LEIS reveals a Bi-termination. After cleaving at 80 K, the Se:Bi ratio measured by LEIS is enhanced, but slowly decreases to the room temperature value. Density functional theory suggests that a Bi bilayer positioned atop the nominal Se termination is energetically favorable and consistent with ARPES results from the literature. It is thus concluded that Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> cleaves between the QLs, but that a thermally activated process leads to the Bi termination. This observation may resolve issues concerning the long-term stability of such materials.

Interaction and transport in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures
Mono and bilayer graphene are novel carbon materials with many remarkable properties. Their electronic properties, including the basic band structure, can be tuned by electrostatic gating. Calculation of the effect of the gate requires solving self-consistent screening problem. An overview of the electronic properties of graphene system is given in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 illustrates the physics of Dirac fermion on the example of a graphene p-n junction. The results are shown to be essential for experimental verification of Klein tunneling in graphene. Chapter 3 discusses the effect of gating on bilayer graphene and how their signatures have been observed by the IR spectroscopy. Chapter 4 discusses the theory of semiclassical Landau quantization in bilayer subject to both electric and magnetic fields. This explains the role of the Berry phase, valley polarization

Electrical Transport of Topological Insulator-Bi2Se3 and Thermoelectric Properties of Graphene
This thesis summarizes our work in the past four years in the field of transport studies of the topological insulator materials and thermoelectric properties of graphene. The first half of the thesis is focused on the transport properties of topological insulator material-Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. In our research, we systematically tune the position of the chemical potential in p-type Ca-doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> thin devices first by eliminating excess holes with controlled post-fabrication electron beam irradiation that results in an insulating bulk state. In spite of the fact that the energetic electron beam creates defects to localize the bulk carriers and inevitably to cause additional scattering, we find a tenfold increase in carrier mobility associated with the extended states in the band gap. In addition, the resistance undergoes a fivefold increase and passes the maximum as the chemical potential is further tuned by electrostatic gating. A cusp-like low-field magnetoresistance feature also emerges which is indicative of strong spin-orbit interaction. The observed gate-tunable high-mobility is a signature of massless Dirac fermions in the band gap of Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>.	The second half of this thesis is focused on graphene. Our work first reported the thermoelectric study of graphene and demonstrated the anomalous thermoelectric transport of massless Dirac fermions. As a direct consequence of the linear dispersion of massless particles, we find that the Seebeck coefficient Sxx diverges with 1 / |n<sub>2D</sub>|<super>&half;</super>, where n<sub>2D</sub> is the carrier density. We observe a very large Nernst signal S<sub>xy</sub> (~ 50 &mu;V/K at 8 T) at the Dirac point, and an oscillatory dependence of both S<sub>xx</sub> and S<sub>xy</sub> on n<sub>2D</sub> at low temperatures. Our results underscore the anomalous thermoelectric transport in graphene, which may be used as a highly sensitive probe for impurity bands near the Dirac point.

The role of vinculin in cardiac mechanotransduction
Cardiac mechanotransduction is the process by which mechanical signals are transduced into biochemical signals in cardiac myocytes. It is important for moderation of changes in sarcomeric protein assembly, hypertrophic markers, and cell survival. Within a single cardiac myocyte, costameres are complex multi-protein structures which have been shown to be the site where forces generated by cardiac myocytes are transmitted to the external extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as the site where forces externally applied by the ECM are transmitted into the cardiac myocyte. Defects in vinculin and its isoforms, metavinculin, have been implicated in the development of dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Due to vinculin's role in contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy and its position in forming a bridge between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, it is hypothesized that vinculin is required for normal mechanotransduction. To study vinculin's role in mechanotransduction, a method using laser tweezers and multifocal multiphoton fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy was developed. This method allowed the application of calibrated localized forces to cardiomyocytes and the measurement of the cell's response to the force. Results demonstrated that this system can be used to study cardiac mechanotransduction, and that focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation (FAK-P) as reported by a FRET biosensor changed locally in the cell, but not distally from the site of force application. Additionally, in wildtype cells, FAK-P responses were dependent on cell geometry. These results reveal that types of load depending on orientation of a cell may trigger regulation of hypertrophy. Lastly, using this system, it was determined that anisotropic responses to mechanotransduction as reported by the FAK FRET biosensor is mediated by vinculin. These results reveal the role of the microanatomy of the costamere in determining mechanotransduction events and alterations in hypertrophic signaling. In conclusion, an optically based novel method for studying cardiac mechanotransduction has been developed and it has been used to determine that abnormal vinculin levels alter the biochemical signaling of FAK in response to directionally applied forces. These alterations may contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy and possibly in the development of heart failure

Petrogenesis of intraplate lavas from isolated volcanoes in the Pacific : implications for the origin of the enriched mantle source of OIB
Years of studies show that most of the ocean island basalts (OIB) that comprise the bulk of prominent linear volcanic chains are geochemically different from mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). However, the cause of the geochemical differences between OIB and MORB as well as the origin of geochemical enrichment and heterogeneity in OIB are highly controversial. Volcanic glasses and lavas with OIB-like composition from isolated intraplate volcanoes in the northern Lau Basin in the southwestern Pacific and from abandoned spreading centers in the eastern Pacific were investigated for their petrology and geochemistry to indirectly evaluate the man-tle source and origin of the enriched geochemical signature of OIB that form prominent linear volcanic chains. The study of the OIB-like lavas from isolated intraplate volcanoes in the Pacific suggests that (1) the mantle source of the OIB- like lavas is the compositionally heterogeneous upper mantle; (2) in the northern Lau Basin, the heterogeneity was created by the introduction into a pre-existing Indian Ocean-type suboceanic mantle of subduction components from the Tonga Trench and later by OIB components from the nearby Samoan mantle plume; (3) in the eastern Pacific, the geochemically enriched, OIB-like compositional signature of post-spreading lavas on fossil spreading axes were produced by low degrees of partial melting of the compositionally heterogeneous Pacific suboceanic mantle; and (4) OIB comprising prominent linear volcanic chains could not have been formed through the same mechanism of partial melting of random, enriched heterogeneities in the upper mantle; instead they appear to be coming from distinct, relatively large reservoirs that reside deeper in the mantle

Standardization and validation of a cytometric bead assay to assess antibodies to multiple Plasmodium falciparum recombinant antigens
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Multiplex cytometric bead assay (CBA) have a number of advantages over ELISA for antibody testing, but little information is available on standardization and validation of antibody CBA to multiple Plasmodium falciparum antigens. The present study was set to determine optimal parameters for multiplex testing of antibodies to P. falciparum antigens, and to compare results of multiplex CBA to ELISA.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Antibodies to ten recombinant P. falciparum antigens were measured by CBA and ELISA in samples from 30 individuals from a malaria endemic area of Kenya and compared to known positive and negative control plasma samples. Optimal antigen amounts, monoplex vs multiplex testing, plasma dilution, optimal buffer, number of beads required were assessed for CBA testing, and results from CBA vs. ELISA testing were compared.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Optimal amounts for CBA antibody testing differed according to antigen. Results for monoplex CBA testing correlated strongly with multiplex testing for all antigens (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.88-0.99, P values from &lt;0.0001 - 0.004), and antibodies to variants of the same antigen were accurately distinguished within a multiplex reaction. Plasma dilutions of 1:100 or 1:200 were optimal for all antigens for CBA testing. Plasma diluted in a buffer containing 0.05% sodium azide, 0.5% polyvinylalcohol, and 0.8% polyvinylpyrrolidone had the lowest background activity. CBA median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values with 1,000 antigen-conjugated beads/well did not differ significantly from MFI with 5,000 beads/well. CBA and ELISA results correlated well for all antigens except apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1). CBA testing produced a greater range of values in samples from malaria endemic areas and less background reactivity for blank samples than ELISA.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					With optimization, CBA may be the preferred method of testing for antibodies to P. falciparum antigens, as CBA can test for antibodies to multiple recombinant antigens from a single plasma sample and produces a greater range of values in positive samples and lower background readings for blank samples than ELISA.

Sub-wavelength resonant structures at microwave and optical frequencies
Sub-wavelength scale resonant structures have been at the forefront of physics and engineering in the past decade. They offer a path for creation of new materials and great advancements in the field of photonics. This dissertation deals with design, fabrication and characterization of sub -wavelength resonant structures. In the first part, we investigate the application of passive sub-wavelength resonators in meta-materials --- materials that have electromagnetic properties otherwise unattainable in nature. We develop a technique for characterization of negative index meta-materials by free-space measurement of the phase change in the meta-material. We also discuss the application of sub-wavelength resonators to highly efficient antenna design. In the second part of the dissertation we focus on active sub-wavelength resonant structures, specifically nanolasers. We present a first truly sub-wavelength nanolaser operating at the room temperature and later investigate cryogenic operation of this laser design. We also offer a new, highly compatible, fabrication approach that could enable the integration of nanolasers in various silicon photonic devices. Lastly, we show a coaxial nanolaser that offers some new and truly unique features. For one it is the first sub-wavelength laser that operates at continuous wave at room temperature. More importantly, it exhibits single mode, thresholdless lasing at cryogenic temperatures. We discuss the significance and the implications of these results

Electron generation and transport in intense relativistic laser-plasma interactions relevant to fast ignition ICF
The reentrant cone approach to Fast Ignition, an advanced Inertial Confinement Fusion scheme, remains one of the most attractive because of the potential to efficiently collect and guide the laser light into the cone tip and direct energetic electrons into the high density core of the fuel. However, in the presence of a preformed plasma, the laser energy is largely absorbed before it can reach the cone tip. Full scale fast ignition laser systems are envisioned to have prepulses ranging between 100 mJ to 1 J. A few of the imperative issues facing fast ignition, then, are the conversion efficiency with which the laser light is converted to hot electrons, the subsequent transport characteristics of those electrons, and requirements for maximum allowable prepulse this may put on the laser system. This dissertation examines the laser- to-fast electron conversion efficiency scaling with prepulse for cone-guided fast ignition. Work in developing an extreme ultraviolet imager diagnostic for the temperature measurements of electron-heated targets, as well as the validation of the use of a thin wire for simultaneous determination of electron number density and electron temperature will be discussed

Shear Layer Instabilities and Mixing in Variable Density Transverse Jet Flows
This work describes the experimental characterization of the instabilities forming in the near-field of the variable density transverse jet shear layer, and mechanisms by which jet behavior and mixing may be controlled. Jets comprised of mixtures of gaseous nitrogen and helium are injected from a nozzle mounted flush with an injection wall, issuing into air crossflows at a constant jet Reynolds number of 1800.  Jet-to-crossflow density ratio S isvaried between 1.00, representing the pure nitrogen jet, and 0.14, the pure helium jet, by changing the proportions of nitrogen and helium composing the jet fluid.  Jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio J is varied at incremental values between infinity>J>2 at each value of S.  The results of single-component hotwire measurements in the jet shear layer indicate that a transition to global instability likely occurs as J is altered below approximately 10 and/or as S is brought below approximately 0.45-0.40. This transition is characterized by several clear spectral features, including sharp spectral peaks and resistance to low level acoustic forcing for the globally unstable (self-excited) case, and broadband oscillations with high receptivity to applied forcing for the convectively unstable case. Evidence of a Hopf bifurcation is found under examination of the growth of the shear layer oscillation magnitude under variation of the control parameter J, as well in the response to pure-tone forcing near the shear layer's natural mode frequency. These observations appear to link many previous independent studies of both equidensity transverse jets and low density free jets, which may become globally unstable under alteration of J and S, respectively. However, the dynamical character of the transition to global instability in the low density transverse jet displays differences under independent variation of J and S, which may indicate the predominance of different modes. Particle image velocimetry is also used to expand upon these hotwire measurements using a less intrusive and planar technique, confirming the quantitative findings related to the shear layer behavior.  Planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements of jet fluid concentration in various cross-sections of the jet indicate that at large values of J and S, the Re = 1800 transverse jet is highly asymmetric about its (often) assumed plane of symmetry.  Mixing quantification shows that mixing may scale according to a normalized spatial coordinate x=sqrt(JD), and that lower density jets are less well mixed than their higher density counterparts at equivalent scaled downstream distances from the point of injection.  Acoustic excitation of a globally unstable transverse jet under a variety of dierent square waveforms yields optimal mixing enhancement at a particular square wave duty cycle associated with highest penetration of individual vortex rings into the crossflow. Knowledge of the transverse jet shear layer's stability characteristics remains an important factor in optimizing jet control.

On Theories About the Nature of Emotion
Professor Salzen presents us with his theory of emotion. At the outsetof his essay he tells us two things of importance for understanding whatis to follow. First, he asks, "Why add another grand theory of emotion?"His answer is that "the very multiplicity of theories suggest that nonehas a central point of view or a deductive or generative principle thatprovides a satisfactory or complete explanation of the phenomena ofemotion" (p. 47), We have some difficulty with such an assertion sincemultiplicity of theories do not, on scientific grounds, mean none arenecessarily satisfactory. An understanding of the property of light requiresat least two theories that happen to have the feature that if oneis true, the other is not. Wave and particle theories of light both serveto explain features of phenomena, and physics does quite well with multipleexplanation, even contradictory ones

Dynamics of the plant-pathogen interaction : strategies for bacterial virulence and coordinating the plant defense response
Using a myriad of genetic, biochemical, and cell biology based approaches, the interactions between pathogens and their hosts have been intensely examined since microbes were first described by Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century. Despite these efforts, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the basis of pathogenesis and host defense are still only partially unraveled. Our work has focused on the interaction between bacterial phytopathogens, specifically Pseudomonas syringae, and the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we examined the sub-cellular localization strategies utilized by a subset of P. syringae virulence factors, the AvrPphB-like family of type III effector proteins. Remarkably, some members of the AvrPphB family of effector proteins utilize their own cysteine protease activities to direct their localization within the plant cell. We have demonstrated that, following delivery through the type III secretion system, these effectors undergo self-proteolytic processing to reveal a novel amino terminus containing consensus sites for eukaryotic fatty acylation. We show that these effectors hijack the eukaryotic acylation machinery to ensure lipid modification, and are consequently delivered to the host plasma membrane. Additionally, we found that acylation of AvrPphB by the host lipidation machinery is absolutely required for successful cleavage of its in planta substrate. Finally, we have demonstrated that additional AvrPphB family members, surprisingly, employ acylation-independent localization strategies. Nonetheless, these effectors also localize to the host plasma membrane, underscoring the plant plasma membrane as a critical site for type III effector function. In addition, we have also investigated specific aspects of the plant defense system. Although the signaling pathways that encode innate immunity against invading microbes have been well studied, epigenetic regulation of plant defenses through modification of heritable DNA methylation patterns represents an unexplored regulatory mechanism of plant defense. Here, we show that Arabidopsis mutants deficient in cytosine methyltranserase activity are markedly more resistant to P. syringae, a phenotype that strongly correlates with up- regulation of known plant defense genes. Remarkably, we have also demonstrated that wild-type plants utilize transgenerational memory of P. syringae infection to encode enhanced pathogen resistance in their progeny, a mechanism that requires the activity of the DRM1, DRM2, and CMT3 DNA methyltransferases. Furthermore, using high- throughput sequencing technology, we mapped methylcytosines across the genome of Arabidopsis plants infected with P. syringae, and found multiple examples of pathogen-induced transient DNA methylation changes that correlate with transcriptional changes of proximal genes. Together, our results have revealed that cytosine methylation contributes to regulation of plant defense genes during infection, and that transient alterations in DNA methylation patterns may encode resistance to pathogens in subsequent generations

Correlations of gene expression with ratings of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity in tourette syndrome: a pilot study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity are the primary behaviors associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous studies showed that peripheral blood gene expression signatures can mirror central nervous system disease. Tourette syndrome (TS) is associated with inattention (IA) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI) symptoms over 50% of the time. This study determined if gene expression in blood correlated significantly with IA and/or HI rating scale scores in participants with TS.
				
				
					
						Methods
					RNA was isolated from the blood of 21 participants with TS, and gene expression measured on Affymetrix human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. To identify the genes that correlated with Conners&#8217; Parents Ratings of IA and HI ratings of symptoms, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed, controlling for age, gender and batch.
				
				
					
						Results
					There were 1201 gene probesets that correlated with IA scales, 1625 that correlated with HI scales, and 262 that correlated with both IA and HI scale scores (P&lt;0.05, |Partial correlation (r
						
							p
						)|&gt;0.4). Immune, catecholamine and other neurotransmitter pathways were associated with IA and HI behaviors. A number of the identified genes (n=27) have previously been reported in ADHD genetic studies. Many more genes correlated with either IA or HI scales alone compared to those that correlated with both IA and HI scales.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These findings support the concept that the pathophysiology of ADHD and/or its subtypes in TS may involve the interaction of multiple genes. These preliminary data also suggest gene expression may be useful for studying IA and HI symptoms that relate to ADHD in TS and perhaps non-TS participants. These results will need to be confirmed in future studies.

The effect of mindset on assimilative and contrastive social comparison outcomes and body image
Social comparisons can alter self-evaluations in multiple ways. Recent research highlights the role of an individual's mindset in moderating these comparison outcomes. Mussweiler's (2003) selective accessibility model (SAM) predicts that initial perceptions of either similarity or dissimilarity with the comparison target will lead to differential outcomes. A similarity mindset is predicted to move self-evaluations in the direction of the comparison target and promote assimilation whereas a dissimilarity mindset is predicted to move self- evaluations away from the comparison target and promote contrast. Additionally, Blanton's (2001) three-selves model predicts that the activation of a particular self- representation will moderate comparison outcomes. Activation of a possible-self by focusing one of who they can become is predicted to foster movement toward the target and promote assimilation, whereas activation of a personal-self mindset, focusing on who one is at present, is predicted to foster movement away from the target and promote contrast. The current research extends these social comparison models to the domain of body image, where ample research suggests that exposure to idealized media target produce decrements in body and self- satisfaction for women. Thus, most women demonstrate contrast in their self-evaluations following comparisons with media targets. Both SAM and the three-selves model predict that women adopting certain mindsets, specifically either a similarity or possible-self mindset, should report assimilation, increased self-ratings, instead. Results of 5 studies demonstrate that perceptions of similarity and activation of a particular self- representation moderate social comparison outcomes in the predicted manner. Furthermore, the final study explores the effect of multiple mindsets on comparison outcomes by combining both a self-activation and similarity mindset, with unexpected results. The implications of these findings for social comparison theory and body-image research are discussed

Cinematic displays of spatiotemporal electrocorticograms (ECoG) show turbulence, from which stable spatial patterns emerge that are correlated with perception of conditioned stimuli (CS). Extracting invariant properties of the perceptual patterns requires high-resolution measurements by high-density electrode arrays, high-order FIR filters, and the Hilbert transform giving analytic signals (instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies). Each pattern is preceded by anull spike, which is postulated to reveal asingularityin cortical dynamics that operates the shutter. A piecewise linear model is used to solve the nonlinear differential equations of mesoscopic cortical dynamics. Solutions point to the existence of a limit cycle attractor. The behavioral and physiological circumstances are described by which the trajectory of cortical dynamics may converge to the attractor and precipitate a phase transition, which destroys an existing pattern and initiates a new one.

Different Strategies for Biological Remediation of Perchlorate Contaminated Groundwater
Perchlorate (ClO4-) has gained attention recently due to its interference with thyroid gland function.  In infants and unborn children, inadequate thyroid hormone production can cause mental retardation and thyroid tumors.  Since new perchlorate standards will be proposed in 2013, and if a stricter standard is imposed, cost effective technologies will be in high demand.  The overall objective of this research was to evaluate two perchlorate bioremediation strategies using indigenous soil bacteria:  1) an autotrophic strategy using zero-valent iron (ZVI) to generate hydrogen as the electron donor and alkalinity in the form of (bi)carbonate as the carbon source for cell growth and maintenance and 2) a heterotrophic strategy using organic substrates as the electron donor and the carbon source for cell growth and maintenance.     The first strategy was evaluated on perchlorate-contaminated groundwater from West Valley Water District Well #2 located in Rialto, CA (Chapter III).  A mobile treatment system consisting of a water holding tank, a ZVI packed bed and two parallel sand filters was placed at the site.  In the first three months, the system experienced excellent performance, as measured by the tested parameters meeting the California drinking water standards.  The effluent concentration of perchlorate was non-detectable (below 4 µg/L), nitrate effluent concentration was less than 0.01 mg/L as N, effluent iron ranged from 0 to 0.05 mg/L.  Coliforms, fecal coliforms and E. coli in the reactor effluent were below the detection limit of 2 MPN/100mL.  However, significant loss of perchlorate performance was observed after 3 months operation.  The reason was attributed to the reduction of hydraulic conductivity and flow channeling.     A laboratory column experiment was conducted to investigate the hydraulic condition change in the ZVI beds (Chapter IV).  Effects of flow rate and (bi)carbonate on hydraulic condition were evaluated by performing hydraulic conductivity tests, SEM examination, and tracer tests.  The results indicated that the decrease of hydraulic conductivity was more pronounced in the low flow reactors than in the higher flow reactors.  This result appeared to contradict the hypothesis that increasing the flow rate will accelerate the hydraulic conductivity reduction.  (Bi)carbonate was determined to be the primary cause of the hydraulic conductivity reduction.  The decrease in hydraulic conductivity was most severe in the segment receiving the higher concentration of NaHCO3.  Hydraulic conductivity decreased from 10-2.73 cm/s to 10 -7.33 cm/s after constantly feeding 24 mM of NaHCO3 for 41 days.  The reduction of hydraulic conductivity was caused by the formation of mineral precipitates.       Because of the lack of long-term perchlorate reduction in the autotrophic ZVI-based system, an alternative strategy that utilized organics as both the electron donor and carbon growth source was tested for perchlorate bioremediation (Chapter V).  Laboratory microcosm and column tests were employed to assess the effectiveness of selected organic substrates on reducing perchlorate from two different locations of a real perchlorate-contaminated site.  One location (source area) had 70 mg/L of perchlorate in groundwater, and another one (plume edge, referred to "biobarrier") had 500 µg/L of perchlorate.  The effect of adding nutrients was also examined.  For the high concentration source area treatment, emulsified oil substrate (EOS) and glycerin were determined to be the most effective organics from the microcosm testing.  Hence, they were selected for column testing.  The results revealed that amending soil with EOS had significant advantages over using glycerin as a soil amendment.  After a single injection of EOS, perchlorate can be reduced to less than 4 µg/L for 4 months.  Perchlorate reduction was not initiated in glycerin-amended soil.  Glycerin had to be constantly added into the influent to treat perchlorate to non-detectable level.  For the low concentration biobarrier treatment, compost/mulch, EOS, and EHC (a combination of carbon plant-based carbon  source and zero-valent iron) had similar perchlorate removal rates in microcosm tests.  EOS appeared to have greater longevity than EHC in the column tests.  The addition of nutrients had minor benefit on both sites treatments.     Comparing the two strategies, using organic substrate was more feasible for perchlorate bioremediation in terms of overall performance and longevity.

Viral metagenomics in host-associated systems
Viruses are the most abundant and diverse entities on earth. Exploration of viral diversity has traditionally been limited by the lack of common marker genes, however, the advent of viral metagenomics has made it possible to characterize global viral communities. Viruses in host- associated systems, such as human and animal tissues, are of special interest as they may be causative agents of disease. Additionally, changes in the total viral consortium may be indicative of host health status, with opportunists and pathogens replacing normal viral flora in the disease state. This dissertation presents an introduction to viral metagenomics and explores use in both human and animal associated systems. Methods in viral metagenomics, including both molecular biology and bioinformatics are reviewed as well as viral metagenomic studies to date. The metagenomic signature technique is explored as a method to characterize metagenomes and to screen for contaminating host genomic DNA sequences in viral metagenomes. Three experimental studies are presented to demonstrate the utility of metagenomics in healthy and diseased individuals. A case study of oropharyngeal viruses revealed the presence of phage- encoded virulence genes in healthy individuals, and also provided the first ever characterization of oropharyngeal viral communities. In the second study, viral communities from the airways of individuals with and without cystic fibrosis (CF) were compared. There was a striking difference in metabolic functions encoded by phage in CF versus Non-CF individuals. Regardless of which taxa were present, CF-associated phage shared a common core metabolism that reflected the disease state and aberrant airway physiology. Viral communities in healthy and diseased fish were compared in the third study. In contrast to the airway viromes, fish-associated viromes were found to differ taxonomically but not in metabolic function in the disease state. Together these studies demonstrate the power of viral metagenomics for discovery and for deciphering how viral communities change in the face of disease

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 effects on proliferation and telomerase activity in sheep growth plate chondrocytes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) inhibits growth-plate chondrocyte proliferation and limits bone elongation. Gain-of-function FGFR3 mutations cause dwarfism, reduced telomerase activity and shorter telomeres in growth plate chondroyctes suggesting that FGFR3 reduces proliferative capacity, inhibits telomerase, and enhances senescence. Thyroid hormone (T3) plays a role in cellular maturation of growth plate chondrocytes and a known target of T3 is FGFR3. The present study addressed whether reduced FGFR3 expression enhanced telomerase activity, mRNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and RNA component of telomerase (TR), and chondrocyte proliferation, and whether the stimulation of FGFR3 by T3 evoked the opposite response.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Sheep growth-plate proliferative zone chondrocytes were cultured and transfected with siRNA to reduce FGFR3 expression; FGFR3 siRNA reduced chondrocyte FGFR3 mRNA and protein resulting in greater proliferation and increased TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Chondrocytes treated with T3 significantly enhanced FGFR3 mRNA and protein expression and reduced telomerase activity (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05); TERT and TR were not significantly reduced. The action of T3 at the growth plate may be partially mediated through the FGFR3 pathway.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The results suggest that FGFR3 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation by down-regulating TERT expression and reducing telomerase activity indicating an important role for telomerase in sustaining chondrocyte proliferative capacity during bone elongation.

Numerical Competence in Ferrets
Ferrets were tested in a free feeding situation that required them to eat only three pieces of food from a randomly sized larger array containing between 15-20 items. Controls were established to preclude discrimination based on spatial or volumetric cues, or cuing by the experimenter. This demonstration represents the first evidence of numerical competence in a mustelid species, and replicates the results of pioneering research by Koehler and his associates with budgerigars (Marold, 1939), as well as more recent work with rats (Davis & Bradford, 1991). Although the performance of ferrets reached comparable levels to those reported with other species, extended training yielded a deterioration in performance. These results are discussed in terms of the role of consequences to suppress competing responses, a problem that has been reported to underlie a variety of learning situations with ferrets.

Macroevolutionary patterns in planktonic foraminifera and the recovery of Pelagic Ecosystems from the Cretaceous- Paleogene mass extinction
In this dissertation, I investigate macroevolutionary patterns and dynamics in planktonic foraminifera and accompanying changes in their pelagic environment. My research focuses on processes that structure diversity in the open sea, including the response of oceanic ecosystems to the largest biotic disturbance of the Cenozoic, the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. I begin by investigating the determinants of community similarity in modern planktonic foraminiferal communities. Here, I find that community similarity is primarily determined by the environmental similarity between communities, and not geographic distance. On a global scale, planktonic foraminifera provide an exception to the rule that geographic proximity is the strongest predictor of community similarity.Patterns of morphological evolution in planktonic foraminifera also suggest that different evolutionary processes may predominate in the open ocean. I investigate a classic case of gradual evolution in the Globorotalia plesiotumida-G. tumida lineage of planktonic foraminifera using more sensitive numerical techniques and find evidence for a cryptic speciation event and a more rapid evolution of G. tumida than previously hypothesized. New analytical approaches were also developed in order to ask questions at a higher stratigraphic resolution at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary than is currently possible. To this end, Lagrangian advection-diffusion models were modified to fit iridium anomalies deposited by the KPg impactor. Insights into the recovery of pelagic ecosystems from the KPg mass extinction were obtained from high-resolution geochemical, grain size, and taxonomic records of the early post-extinction interval. Barium proxy records were used to investigate boundary-related changes in export productivity, and supported inferences from benthic foraminifera in describing geographically and temporally heterogeneous changes in export productivity following the KPg impact. When productivity was considered along with planktonic foraminifera community composition and relative flux, this evidence suggested that an alternative pelagic ecosystem may have thrived in some locales in a post-extinction world

Studies of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei with Monte Carlo and Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations
Results from several studies are presented which detail explorations of the physical and spectral properties of low luminosity active galactic nuclei.  An initial Sagittarius A* general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Monte Carlo radiation transport model suggests accretion rate changes as the dominant flaring method.  A similar study on M87 introduces new methods to the Monte Carlo model for increased consistency in highly energetic sources.  Again, accretion rate variation seems most appropriate to explain spectral transients.  To more closely resolve the methods of particle energization in active galactic nuclei accretion disks, a series of localized shearing box simulations explores the effect of numerical resolution on the development of current sheets.  A particular focus on numerically describing converged current sheet formation will provide new methods for consideration of turbulence in accretion disks.

A mixture model for expression deconvolution from RNA-seq in heterogeneous tissues
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               RNA-seq, a next-generation sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for comprehensive transcript abundance estimation. The accuracy of RNA-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. A prominent, outstanding problem in RNA-seq is how to estimate transcript abundances in heterogeneous tissues, where a sample is composed of more than one cell type and the inhomogeneity can substantially confound the transcript abundance estimation of each individual cell type. Although experimental methods have been proposed to dissect multiple distinct cell types, computationally "deconvoluting" heterogeneous tissues provides an attractive alternative, since it keeps the tissue sample as well as the subsequent molecular content yield intact.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Here we propose a probabilistic model-based approach, Transcript Estimation from Mixed Tissue samples (TEMT), to estimate the transcript abundances of each cell type of interest from RNA-seq data of heterogeneous tissue samples. TEMT incorporates positional and sequence-specific biases, and its online EM algorithm only requires a runtime proportional to the data size and a small constant memory. We test the proposed method on both simulation data and recently released ENCODE data, and show that TEMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods that do not take tissue heterogeneity into account. Currently, TEMT only resolves the tissue heterogeneity resulting from two cell types, but it can be extended to handle tissue heterogeneity resulting from multi cell types. TEMT is written in python, and is freely available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/TEMT.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               The probabilistic model-based approach proposed here provides a new method for analyzing RNA-seq data from heterogeneous tissue samples. By applying the method to both simulation data and ENCODE data, we show that explicitly accounting for tissue heterogeneity can significantly improve the accuracy of transcript abundance estimation.

Chemical Dependencies of Learning in the Rabbit Olfactory Bulb: Acquisition of the Transient Spatial Pattern Chance Depends on Norepinephrine
Intracerebral cannulas were implanted in both olfactory bulbs of 6 rabbits. A surface electrode-array (8 X 8) was implanted epidurally on the lateral surface of the left bulb. Each rabbit was conditioned to respond to sniffing to an odor paired with cutaneous shock while receiving continuous intrabulbar infusion of either vehicle or propranolol (100 microM at 1 microliter/hr) in vehicle. After two training sessions to the original odor, a response to a new odor was conditioned under the influence of the alternate infusate. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was sampled on inspirations before and during odor presentations. During vehicle infusion a transient alteration in the pattern of activity was acquired that occurred during the second and third inspirations following presentation of the reinforced odor. The acquisition did not occur when propranolol was infused. No significant pattern changes occurred with unreinforced odors in either condition. There was no local anesthetic effect of the racemic mixture of propranolol found for any type of electric activity, including antidromic spike activity observed in an independent control group. Intrabulbar norepinephrine injection (100 microM, 10 microL) resulted in an amplitude increase of the bulbar 40-80-Hz EEG and a potentiation of the transient spatial pattern change to a novel odor, when compared with those observed during vehicle infusion. It is concluded that norepinephrine released under centrifugal control may act to prevent or delay habituation that otherwise occurs rapidly to unreinforced odors.

A general theory of perturbed light fields, with applications to forward scattering effects in beam transmittance measurements
SIO Reference 58-37. The problem of the measurement of the optical properties of a given medium is complicated by the fact that the act of measurement perturbs the distribution of radiant flux in the immediate vicinity of the measuring process. Consequently, the numbers derived from a measurement process do not faithfully reflect the inherent optical properties of the medium under study, but rather contain along with the information sought both the effects of the presence of the measuring apparatus and its characteristic response to radian-flux. The present note contains a general formulation of the equation of transfer for perturbed radiance field in an arbitrary optical medium. The resultant theory is applied to the problem of the measurement of the volume attenuation function o<  (or, equivalently, beam transmittance) in natural waters and the atmosphere. In particular, the theory leads to several new measuring techniques for o< which take into account the perturbation effect on the light field of the standard measuring apparatus used for the determination of o< . In addition the theory provides a means of estimating the relatively elusive forward scattering value, o-o, of the volume scattering function o- . Finally, two criteria are given for estimating the order of magnitude of tho forward scattering effects encountered in beam transmittance measurements.

HIF-1 expression is associated with CCL2 chemokine expression in airway inflammatory cells: implications in allergic airway inflammation
AbstractBackgroundThe pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation in asthmatic patients is complex and characterized by cellular infiltrates and activity of many cytokines and chemokines. Both the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and chemokine CCL2 have been shown to play pivotal roles in allergic airway inflammation. The interrelationship between these two factors is not known. We hypothesized that the expression of HIF-1 and CCL2 may be correlated and that the expression of CCL2 may be under the regulation of HIF-1. Several lines of evidence are presented to support this hypothesis.MethodsThe effects of treating wild-type OVA (ovalbumin)-sensitized/challenged mice with ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB), which upregulate HIF, on CCL2 expression, were determined. Mice conditionally knocked out for HIF-1&#946; was examined for their ability to mount an allergic inflammatory response and CCL2 expression in the lung after intratracheal exposure to ovalbumin. The association of HIF-1&#945; and CCL2 levels was also measured in endobronchial biopsies and bronchial fluid of asthma patients after challenge.ResultsWe show that both HIF-1&#945; and CCL2 were upregulated during an OVA (ovalbumin)-induced allergic response in mice. The levels of HIF-1&#945; and CCL2 were significantly increased following treatment with a pharmacological agent which upregulates HIF-1&#945;, ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB). In contrast, the expression levels of HIF-1&#945; and CCL2 were decreased in the lungs of mice that have been conditionally knocked out for ARNT (HIF-1&#946;) following sensitization with OVA when compared to levels in wild type mice. In asthma patients, the levels of HIF-1&#945; and CCL2 increased after challenge with the allergen.ConclusionsThese data suggest that CCL2 expression is regulated, in part, by HIF-1 in the lung. These findings also demonstrate that both CCL2 and HIF-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation.

TAF1 Regulation of Gene Expression: Genome-Wide Localization and Transcription Profiling
The general transcription factor II D (TFIID) nucleates the assembly of general transcription factors (GTF) and RNA polymerase II at the promoters to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). TBP-associated factor I (TAF1), the scaffold of TFIID, not only interacts with other factors to stabilize the protein complex but also has several enzymatic activities.In this study, genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis revealed that TAF1 recognizes and binds in vivo to more than 1,800 of core promoters. From the transcription profiling, 4,531 genes have been identified with more than 1.25 folds change in transcriptional level, including 2,780 genes with reduced transcription and 1,751 with an enhanced transcription level. Among TAF1 target genes, 53% of genes were directly down-regulated by TAF1, especially cyclins and cell cycle regulators. Genes such as members of the heat shock protein family were associated with direct TAF1 upregulation. This study suggests that TAF1 is essential protein and involved in various biological processes including cell cycle progression and stress response.

Elastic-plastic analysis of the transition divertor joint for high performance divertor target plate
The use of tungsten as a plasma-facing material necessitates a transition joint to the structural material of the primary coolant loop at some location in order to transport the coolant to the heat exchanger. A critical issue in transition joints is the thermal expansion mismatch between materials, which can lead to unacceptably high thermal stresses. Detailed 2D and 3D analyses were performed to study the behavior of a transition from tungsten to ferritic steel (FS) with an intermediate layer of tantalum, located outside of the high heat flux region. This thesis describes the results of FEM analyses including primary and secondary stresses under various time-dependent loading conditions such as warm and cold shutdown, and allowing for inelastic behaviors leading to stress relaxation and ratcheting. In previous FEM analyses at UCLA, it was concluded the residual stress in Ta exceeds the ultimate and tensile strength. In such configuration that is under high pressure and temperature loading conditions, plastic deformation has to be considered during the analysis. It also causes stress relaxation on the configuration. The results exhibited that the original transition joint did not satisfy the design requirement on maximum accumulated plastic principal strain due to stress concentration. Some modifications were made on the transition joint. Fabrication steps were analyzed in 2D models utilizing ANSYS. The results of the modified design exhibited less plastic deformation in Ta alloy and ODS steel as well as no ratcheting in cold shutdown. Both 2D and 3D cold and warm shutdown were analyzed as well

Measurement of the elliptic anisotropy of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at √sNN=2.76 TeV
The anisotropy of the azimuthal distributions of charged particles produced in √ over ssubscript NN=2.76 TeV PbPb collisions is studied with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The elliptic anisotropy parameter, vsubscript 2, defined as the second coefficient in a Fourier expansion of the particle invariant yields, is extracted using the event-plane method, two- and four-particle cumulants, and Lee-Yang zeros. The anisotropy is presented as a function of transverse momentum (psubscript T), pseudorapidity (η) over a broad kinematic range, 0.3<psubscript T<20 GeV/c, |η|<2.4, and in 12 classes of collision centrality from 0 to 80%. The results are compared to those obtained at lower center-of-mass energies, and various scaling behaviors are examined. When scaled by the geometric eccentricity of the collision zone, the elliptic anisotropy is found to obey a universal scaling with the transverse particle density for different collision systems and center-of-mass energies.

Elucidation of the Role of Leucine Aminopeptidase A in the Wound Response Pathway in Tomato
Historically, peptidases have been considered as housekeeping proteins involved in protein degradation and amino acid turnover. However, recent work has highlighted the fact that peptidases, including aminopeptidases, have critical regulatory roles in the cell including modulation of growth, development and stress responses. Recently, plant leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) have been recognized for their roles in modulation of late wound-responses and insect defense. While no known mechanism of action has been identified, LAPs were presumed to act through their aminopeptidase function to affect the stability, activity, or localization of a peptide and protein involved in defense. In my dissertation studies, I have identified two new molecular functions for plant LAPs as molecular chaperones and Cys-Gly dipeptidases. In addition, microarray analyses has demonstrated the tomato LAP-A regulates early and late wound responses both positively and negatively. In particular, microarray analyses identified two new sets of genes modulated by LAP-A: late wound dehydrins and Pathogenesis-Related 1. This study also provides evidence LAP-A may act though the negative regulator salicylic acid or the positive regulator hydrogen peroxide to modulate wound signaling. The role of LAP-A in glutathione metabolism is also discussed. Together this study has provided evidence that LAP-A's role in wound signaling and insect defense is more complex than initially anticipated and may be the result of LAP-A utilizing multiple functions (aminopeptidase, chaperone and/or Cys-Gly dipeptidase activities) in different environments and in response to different stresses.

Then, selected polymers were selected according to their importance in smart surface technology. The extent of interaction of the selected probes with the array of soft surfaces gives insight to the potential tunability of these surfaces.

Genesis of the 1918 H1N1 Spanish influenza into the 2009 swine origin influenza
The influenza A virus surface hemagglutinin (HA) plays the critical role in governing the viral adaptation of a human host by switching binding specificity from long alpha-2, 3 to long &alpha;-2, 6 sialylated glycans receptors. The relationship between HA receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation and HA-glycan binding specificity, however, is not well understood due to varying experimental results. The human 1918 pandemic virus, A/South Carolina/1/18 (SC18) and its D190E/D225G avian-type mutant (AV18*) serves as an excellent paradigm for mutagenesis investigation of the molecular mechanisms of the double mutation, which has been qualitative and limited to visual inspection of superimposed crystal structures. In this study, a computational approach that integrates explicit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, statistical glycan conformational clustering analysis, molecular mechanics- Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) residue based pairwise energy decomposition and molecular mechanics- Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy calculation was developed. Using this approach, key HA-glycan residue interactions and relative overall binding free energies of SC18, AV18*, a 2009 swine-origin like S145K/A227E double mutant (CA18*), and CA04 bound to physiological alpha-2, 3 and alpha-2, 6 sialylated glycans receptors at atomic level have been identified. The structural and energetic data reveal the markedly distinct binding patterns of SC18 and AV18*, the deterministic role of residue 190 in anchoring sialic acid and the auxiliary role of residue 225 coupled with alpha -2, 3/alpha-2, 6 linkage. Furthermore, destabilization of D190 by A227E and increased importance of the 130-loop in the RBD causes an increase of overall alpha-2, 3/ alpha-2, 6 binding in CA18* and swine-origin A/ California/04/2009 (CA04)

The Role of AMPK and miR-92a in the Shear Stress Regulation of KLF2
The vascular endothelium is essential to maintain normal vascular homostasis and its dysfunction is a hallmark of atherosclerosis development. Up-regulated by laminar flow, the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a crucial integrator for maintaining multiple endothelial functions, including anti-inflammation, anti-thrombosis, vasodilatation, and anti-angiogenesis. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which KLF2 is regulated by different flow pattern, I examined the regulation of KLF2 expression at both transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level response to different flow pattern. In the first part of the study, I demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary and sufficient to regulate the expression of PS-induced KLF2 and its downstream (eNOS and ET-1).  In addition, I found PS induced the phosphorylation of ERK5 and MEF2, which regulates the KLF2 expression, is AMPK-dependent in ECs. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ERK5 and MEF2, as well as the expression of KLF2, were significantly reduced in the aorta of AMPK&#61537;2 knockout mice when compared with wild-type control mice. These findings suggest that AMPK/ERK5/MEF2 is a functional signaling for the regulation of KLF2 transcription. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the second part, I examined the role of miRNAs, particularly miR-92a, in the atheroprotective flow-regulated KLF2.  Fistly, I found KLF2 is regulated by miRNA by knockdown Dicer with siRNA. miR-92a directly binds to KLF2 3'UTR and inhibit its mRNA level and protein level. Subsequent studies revealed that, atheroprotective laminar flow downregulated the level of miR-92a to induce KLF2, and the level of this flow-induced KLF2 was reduced by pre-92a.  Consistent with these findings, miR-92a level was lower in the endothelium of atheroprotective than atheroprone areas of the mouse aorta.  Furthermore, mouse carotid arteries receiving pre-92a exhibited impaired vasodilatory response to flow. Collectively, my study suggests that atheroprotective flow patterns decrease the level of miR-92a, which in turn increases KLF2 expression to maintain endothelial homeostasis.

High Throughput Screening of Biologically Functional Small Molecules for Modulating the Expression of FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 in Fibroblasts
Objectives:  In skin wounds, inflammation associated cytokines and growth factors induce fibroblasts to undergo transdifferentiation allowing them to contract the wound. Though wounds in the oral cavity heal with a lesser degree of inflammation, they contract at a faster pace and exhibit reduced scarring compared to the skin. FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 is a small cytoplasmic peptide highly expressed by oral wound fibroblasts, but not by skin wound fibroblasts. In this study we aim to determine the exogenous factors possibly inducing FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 expression in skin fibroblasts through the development of a high throughput screening assay. Methods: This study examined the use of direct mRNA measurement assays for use in high throughput applications to find chemical agents that up or downregulate FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 expression. Using mouse clonal fibroblastic cell lines we characterized genetic expression, phenotype, and si-RNA knockdown of wit3.0.  We then developed and optimized a protocol for high throughput screening on a bDNA platform. A pilot screening was performed at the UCLA MSSR. Results: Confocal microscopy revealed that the cytoskeletal arrangement of actin and wit3.0 were phenotypically different in the heterozygous knockout stem cell derived fibroblasts. wit3.0 (+/-) cells exhibited disorganized actin fibers, while the wildtype showed a more organized archetype.  We found that wit3.0 was expressed in both L-929 and C3H/10T1/2 and appears in immunostaining as a cytoplasmic, granular protein. We were able to successfully perform a high throughput screening of 320 chemicals as a pilot study, and identified 7 compounds as modulators of wit3.0. Conclusion: This pilot study has identified biologically functional chemical compounds which could provide a novel clue in elucidating the mechanism of fibroblast-driven wound closure, and presents a new therapeutic potential in the field of wound healing.

Scaffolding of the Cofilin Pathway by Beta-Arrestin-1
Beta-arrestins are well-known mediators involved in both activation and termination of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. Beta-arrestins transduce signals by binding to, and either activating or inhibiting, various downstream signaling proteins, leading to a variety of cellular responses, which can occur independent of the heterotrimeric G-protein coupling. Since about 40% of currently used therapeutics target GPCRs, understanding the functions of beta-arrestins is an important biological question. We established a model that shows beta-arrestins mediate the actin cytoskeletal reorganization downstream of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) by temporally and spatially controlling cofilin activation. Cofilin severs actin filaments and is controlled by opposing actions of LIM kinase (LIMK) (which inactivates it by phosphorylation on Ser3) and cofilin-specific phosphatase, chronophin (CIN) that activates it. My study elucidated how beta-arrestin-1 can interact and regulate LIMK and cofilin in PAR-2-enhanced actin dynamics. First, beta-arrestin-1 bound and inhibited LIMK activity directly. At least two specific binding sites on beta-arrestin-1 to LIMK1 or to cofilin were identified within residues 1 to 99 and 183-418 by using multiple recombinant beta-arrestin-1 truncations and a deletion mutant (residues 146 to 182 were deleted) in sandwich immunoassays. The deletion mutant showed high binding affinity and direct inhibition of LIMK1, which suggested that if beta-arretsin-1 is induced into the appropriate conformation for exposing the amino and carboxyl binding regions, beta-arrestin-1 can directly bind and inhibit LIMK1 activity. Beta-arrestin-1 may protect cofilin from phosphorylation and inactivation, too. Results from spot peptide arrays confirmed the amino region of beta-arrestin-1 was the specific binding site for LIMK1. Co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay further proved the interaction of beta-arrestin-1 and LIMK1 in cells. The absence of beta-arrestins disrupted the cofilin activation and caused abnormal development of growth cones and mature dendritic spines in mouse hippocampus. This dissertation demonstrated that the specific regions in beta-arrestin-1 scaffold and regulate the kinase activity of LIMK1. Thus, beta-arrestin-1 contributes to the spatial regulation of cofilin activation by sequestering cofilin with CIN while inhibiting LIMK at cell protrusions.

Mass Spectrometry-Based Chemical and Quantitative Proteomics
As one of the most powerful techniques in analytical sciences, mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with the techniques for sample preparation and separation, plays an essential role on the rise of proteomics. In this dissertation, we focused on the development and application of MS and chemical tools for the identification and quantification of several important classes of proteins, including nucleotide-binding proteins, nucleic acid-binding proteins and plasma membrane proteins.In Chapter two, we described the synthesis and application of a biotin-conjugated chemical probe in probing nucleotide-binding proteins. This activity-based chemical probe can react specifically with the lysine residue at the nucleotide-binding site. The strategy developed for proteomic application is relatively simple, fast, and straightforward. This method is useful in the activity-based functional study and in profiling nucleotide-binding proteins, e.g., kinases, in complex biological samples.  In Chapter three, a strategy for the comprehensive investigation of DNA-binding proteins with in vivo chemical cross-linking and LC-MS/MS was developed. DNA-binding proteins were isolated via the isolation of DNA-protein complexes and released from the complexes by reversing the cross-linking. By using this method, we were able to identify more than one hundred DNA-binding proteins, including proteins involved in transcription, gene regulation, DNA replication and repair. In Chapter four, we described a strategy, including SILAC, cell-surface biotinylation, affinity purification and LC-MS/MS, for the identification and quantification of cell-surface membrane proteins. Integrins, cell adhesive molecules, CD antigens and receptors, which are essential in tumor development, were quantified in this work. The identification of aberrantly expressed membrane proteins of melanoma cells sets the stage for the future investigation of these proteins in the progression of human melanoma. The method held a great potential in the comprehensive identification of tumor progression makers, as well as in the discovery of protein-based new therapeutic targets.In Chapter five, a comparative study of protein expression in human leukemia cells upon 6-thioguanine treatment was performed by using a MS-based proteomic method together with SILAC. The biological implications of the changed expression of some proteins were discussed. This study may offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of this drug.

Scaling and genetics of neural architecture
The structure of neural systems is fundamental to their function and is the product of both genes and the environment. Elucidating how and why brains take their particular form is a step toward understanding what makes us human and would improve the diagnosis and treatment of heritable neuropsychiatric disorders with characteristic brain pathology. Statistical analysis of anatomical and genetic variation within species provides a powerful strategy for understanding the structural layout of brains, and variations to this approach were applied in three studies. The first study examined how continuously growing teleost fish compensate for potentially increasing visual conduction delays along lengthening optic nerves. We found that as fish grew retinal ganglion cell axons in the optic nerve enlarged so that the shape of the axon diameter distribution remained constant, potentially simplifying visual computation problems in the brain. The second study investigated the relationship between skull and brain morphology and genetic background among individuals of European ancestry. Skull size and shape as well as frontotemporal cortical surface area varied continuously along a NW-SE axis in Europe. This trend was consistent with known historical population movements and could not be attributed to brains scaling with body size. The third study applied a genome-wide analysis to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the scaling of visual cortical surface area in humans. In two independent cohorts, a common SNP was significantly associated with an increased occipital proportion of cortex as a function of total cortical surface area. In summary, allometric scaling and statistical genetic analyses provided insight into the scalable architecture of the fish visual system and genetic contributions to human cortical morphology. Identifying genes that contribute to normal cortical architecture provides a first step toward understanding genetic mechanisms that underlie cortical pathology in a host of heritable neuropsychiatric disorders

RNA-Seq Based Transcriptome Assembly: Sparsity, Bias Correction and Multiple Sample Comparison
RNA-Seq, or deep-sequencing of RNAs, is a new technology for transcriptome profiling using second generation sequencing. RNA-Seq has been widely used to identify and quantify transcriptomes at an unprecedented high resolution and low cost. An important computational problem arising from RNA-Seq is transcriptome assembly, in which the structures of transcripts (and their expression levels)  are inferred simultaneously from RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly allows for the detection of structural and quantitative changes of transcripts between samples, paving the way for novel biological discoveries. However, the problem of RNA-Seq transcriptome assembly is challenging because: (i) the complicated alternative splicing patterns of some genes result in a huge number of possible transcripts, (ii) different kinds of biases in RNA-Seq reads (including sequencing, positional and mappability biases) decrease the accuracy of assembly and expression level estimation algorithms, and (iii) the existing assembly tools can only reconstruct transcripts from a single sample, leading to a high false positive rate for comparing RNA-Seq experiments from multiple samples. We propose three different algorithms to address these challenges. First, we design a transcriptome assembly tool, IsoLasso, that balances different objectives (prediction accuracy, sparsity, interpretation) and takes advantage of the sparsity of expressed transcripts. Second, we use the quasi-multinomial distribution to model the RNA-Seq biases, and design a new algorithm, CEM, to handle different biases in both transcriptome assembly and transcript expression level estimation. Finally, we propose a multiple-sample transcriptome assembly tool, ISP, to assemble transcripts directly from RNA-Seq data of multiple samples. ISP reaches an improved performance compared to the assembly tools that consider one sample at a time, and helps to improve the accuracy of downstream differential analysis of transcriptomes between samples.

The Statistical Evolution of Multiple Generations of Oxidation Products in the Photochemical Aging of Chemically Reduced Organic Aerosol
The heterogeneous reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with squalane and bis(2-ethylhexyl)
sebacate (BES) particles are used as model systems to examine how distributions of reaction
products evolve during the oxidation of chemically reduced organic aerosol. A kinetic model of
multigenerational chemistry, which is compared to previously measured (squalane) and new
(BES) experimental data, reveals that it is the statistical mixtures of different generations of
oxidation products that control the average particle mass and elemental composition during the
reaction. The model suggests that more highly oxidized reaction products, although initially
formed with low probability, play a large role in the production of gas phase reaction products.
In general, these results highlight the importance of considering atmospheric oxidation as a
statistical process, further suggesting that the underlying distribution of molecules could play
important roles in aerosol formation as well as in the evolution of key physicochemical
properties such as volatility and hygroscopicity.

Magnetic Pattern Fabrication and Characterization for Next Generation High Density Magnetic Recording System
In this dissertation thesis, I will discuss the fundamental basic technology necessary for continuing the prosperity status of 21st century electronic devices; Lithography. I will give an overview of the concepts of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and development of direct electron beam lithography (D-EBL) for magnetic bit patterned media (BPM), capable of achieving magnetic recording areal densities above 1 terabit/in2. Furthermore, I will present the peripheral equipment mainly used for developing innovative processes. One of the main challenges in developing direct electron beam lithography technique for fabricating magnetic bit patterned media, which I was faced with was not only to reduce the minimum feature size below 10 nm but also to ensure an adequately small pitch size of less than 26 nm. The latter is the critical value for the side of a square pattern period (assuming a 1:1 bit-aspect ratio (BAR)) necessary to achieve over 1 terabit/in2 density in hard disk industry. The main concern was to overcome the technical limitations associated with a relatively wide electron beam tail. For instance, according to Gaussian distribution, even a "5-nm" electron beam spot size can have a "tail" of over 50 nm because of beam scattering and secondary effect. Another limitation in the spatial resolution of EBL resulted from the interaction of the electron beam with stray magnetic fields emanating from the transitions in the BPM film under study. Throughout my research I comparatively studied a number of EBL processes, the results from which led me into selecting a lift-off based EBL process on films spin-coated with a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) negative-tone e-beam resist. Using this process, we successfully transferred large-scale square periodic arrays of nano-"dots" with a sub-13-nm diameter and a sub-26-nm pitch, as required for densities above 1 terabit-per-square-inch, into continuous magnetic films made of exchange-coupled Co/Pd perpendicular multi-layers. Furthermore, I used the same EBL process to transfer ultra-high-density patterns not only in conventional single-layer recording media but also into potentially next-generation 3-D structures consisting of several independent magnetic layers.  Meanwhile, I fabricated Magnetic Force Microscopy probes for analyzing magnetic properties of nanometer size patterns. This process requires high sensitivity of the resolution and high coercivity at same time. Finally, I will discuss the results from a special magnetic force microscopy (MFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), focused magneto-optical Kerr Effect (F-MOKE) measurements developed to study the EBL-fabricated ultra-high-density BPM media.

Normal Hedge Tree is compared to Mindreader Dos over previously collected sequences. Overall, Normal Hedge Tree performs worse than Mindreader but for some sequences it has better results.

T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic CD8 lymphocytes rendered insensitive to transforming growth factor beta (TGFß) signaling mediate superior tumor regression in an animal model of adoptive cell therapy
Abstract
				
				Tumor antigen-reactive T cells must enter into an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, continue to produce cytokine and deliver apoptotic death signals to affect tumor regression. Many tumors produce transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;), which inhibits T cell activation, proliferation and cytotoxicity. In a murine model of adoptive cell therapy, we demonstrate that transgenic Pmel-1 CD8 T cells, rendered insensitive to TGF&#946; by transduction with a TGF&#946; dominant negative receptor II (DN), were more effective in mediating regression of established B16 melanoma. Smaller numbers of DN Pmel-1 T cells effectively mediated tumor regression and retained the ability to produce interferon-&#947; in the tumor microenvironment. These results support efforts to incorporate this DN receptor in clinical trials of adoptive cell therapy for cancer.

We study the identification and estimation of key parameters in a basic model of technology adoption when specifically collected information on subjective beliefs and expectations about the technology's impact is available. We discuss identification with both non-parametrically and parametrically specified utility as well as parametric and semi-parametric specifications for unobserved heterogeneity. We propose parametric and semi-parametric estimation methods to recover underlying preferences and use the model to study the adoption of bednets among poor households in rural Orissa (India). We carry out counterfactual exercises to examine the effects of price and belief changes on net ownership decisions. The results suggest that net purchase decisions are relatively insensitive to changes from current prices and beliefs.

ENU-induced phenovariance in mice: inferences from 587 mutations
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					We present a compendium of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mouse mutations, identified in our laboratory over a period of 10 years either on the basis of phenotype or whole genome and/or whole exome sequencing, and archived in the Mutagenetix database. Our purpose is threefold: 1) to formally describe many point mutations, including those that were not previously disclosed in peer-reviewed publications; 2) to assess the characteristics of these mutations; and 3) to estimate the likelihood that a missense mutation induced by ENU will create a detectable phenotype.
				
				
					
						Findings
					In the context of an ENU mutagenesis program for C57BL/6J mice, a total of 185 phenotypes were tracked to mutations in 129 genes. In addition, 402 incidental mutations were identified and predicted to affect 390 genes. As previously reported, ENU shows strand asymmetry in its induction of mutations, particularly favoring T to A rather than A to T in the sense strand of coding regions and splice junctions. Some amino acid substitutions are far more likely to be damaging than others, and some are far more likely to be observed. Indeed, from among a total of 494 non-synonymous coding mutations, ENU was observed to create only 114 of the 182 possible amino acid substitutions that single base changes can achieve. Based on differences in overt null allele frequencies observed in phenotypic vs. non-phenotypic mutation sets, we infer that ENU-induced missense mutations create detectable phenotype only about 1 in 4.7 times. While the remaining mutations may not be functionally neutral, they are, on average, beneath the limits of detection of the phenotypic assays we applied.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Collectively, these mutations add to our understanding of the chemical specificity of ENU, the types of amino acid substitutions it creates, and its efficiency in causing phenovariance. Our data support the validity of computational algorithms for the prediction of damage caused by amino acid substitutions, and may lead to refined predictions as to whether specific amino acid changes are responsible for observed phenotypes. These data form the basis for closer in silico estimations of the number of genes mutated to a state of phenovariance by ENU within a population of G3 mice.

Graphene Synthesis by Thermal Cracker Enhanced Gas Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Its Applications in Flash Memory
Because of its unique properties, such as extremely high mobility, high mechanical strength, good optical transparency and high chemical stability, graphene has attracted vast interests in nanotechnology communities, condensed matter physics, and chemistry. The method of synthesizing large-area graphene with good quality is critical for its potential applications. This dissertation reports a new synthesis method of using a home built thermal cracker enhanced gas source molecular beam epitaxy (GSMBE) system. Chapter 2 discusses graphene growth using nickel substrate in the GSMBE system. Hydrocarbon gas molecules were broken by thermal cracker at very high temperature of 1200°C and then impinged on a nickel substrate. High-quality, large-area graphene films were achieved at 800°C, and this was confirmed by both Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A rapid cooling rate was not required for few-layer graphene growth in this method, and a high-percentage single layer and bilayer graphene films were grown by controlling the growth time.  The results suggest that in this method, carbon atoms migrate on the nickel surface and bond with each other to form graphene. Few-layer graphene is formed by subsequent growth of carbon layers on top of existing graphene layers. This is completely different from graphene formation through carbon dissolving in nickel and then precipitating from the nickel during rapid substrate cooling in the chemical vapor deposition method. Chapter 3 further discusses using cobalt as graphene growth substrate. Growth conditions including growth temperature and growth time play important roles in the resulting morphology of as-grown films. A narrow growth time window was found for different growth temperatures. Carbon absorption and desorption phenomena were responsible for temperature-dependent and growth time-dependent graphene morphology. Fast cooling rate was not required in this process due to direct growth mechanism under atomic carbon growth condition. Large-area graphene films with high single-layer and bi-layer coverage of 93% were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.Graphene based flash memory was demonstrated by using nickel nanocrystals as storage nodes in chapter 4. First, the graphene channel with a dimension of a 20 µm × 5 µm was acquired by photolithography and oxygen plasma etching. Then, the gate stack formed by the deposition of tunneling oxide, nickel nanocrystal and block oxide. On/off operation of the transistor memory was acquired by static pulse response measurement. The memory window of the device was found up to be 23.1 V by back gate sweep. This memory effect is attributed to charging/discharging of nanocrystals. Furthermore, excellent retention and endurance performance were achieved. Chapter 5 demonstrated a memory capacitor with an embedded graphene nano dots structure. Graphene nano dots were successfully fabricated by using nickel nano crystals as etching masks. By tuning the etching parameters, graphene dots with the size of 10 nm to 100 nm can be acquired. Raman spectra confirms the defects and the edges effect of nano dots. A memory capacitor using a SiO<sub>2</sub>/graphene dots/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sandwich structure was fabricated. A hysteresis from the C-V sweep proves the memory capability of the as-fabricated capacitor.

Changing 14 residues in the active site of NPr can change its function to that of HPr and P-type ATPase analysis in archaea, spirochetes and across all known domains of life
NPr, a bacterial protein functioning in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism, was engineered to take on the function of its evolutionary homolog HPr, a bacterial protein involved in the uptake up of sugars through the PTS. This was achieved by replacing 14 amino acyl residues in NPr with the corresponding residues from HPr. These residues are all present at the active interface between HPr with the Mannitol Enzyme IIA and NPr with the nitrogen regulating IIA. This modified NPr gene was able to complement HPr negative mutants for growth on all PTS sugars. For sugars exclusive to the Mannose Enzyme II complex Family, the modified NPr protein out performed the wild type HPr. P-type ATPases, ion transporting pumps, are ubiquitous in nearly all organisms. This paper presents the bioinformatic analysis of these proteins in two organismal groups, the archaea and spirochetes. These studies involved phylogenetic, size, topological, conserved motif, familial and functional analyses. They also present the conclusions involving the analysis of P- type ATPases from organisms encompassing the three domains of life, bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Integration of protein sequence information provided evolutionary, distributional and functional insight into characterized as well as previously unidentified families of P-type ATPases

Interactions of Lignin and Hemicellulose and Effects on Biomass Deconstruction
Facing inexorable growth of global population and energy consumption, lignocellulosic biomass has taken a more central role in global energy strategy by providing sustainable sources for both liquid fuels and chemicals without competing with food and feed supplies.  To establish a large scale, reliable, and economic lignocellulosic industry, biomass recalcitrance must be well understood and overcome.  Currently cutting edge biological conversion research focuses mainly on three aspects: genetic modification of plant cell wall structure to reduce biomass recalcitrance, pretreatment of biomass as a critical prerequisite to achieve high sugar yields, and consolidated processing of enzymes and microorganisms to lower deconstruction costs.  More importantly, however, synergistic concert of these three approaches is critical to develop practical solutions for this challenge.  Thus, interactions and impacts among cell wall structural characteristics, pretreatment, and biological deconstruction are vital to understand.In light of this, six technical studies towards three main objectives were pursued in this thesis.  First, an integrated chromatographic method for xylooligosaccharides determination and a high throughput system using dilute alkali conditions were developed as characterization tools to facilitate understanding how pretreatment affects cell wall polysaccharide deconstruction.  Next, two fundamental studies on lignin deposition during pretreatment and reduced methylation of xylan side-chains, respectively, were employed to identify important recalcitrant aspects of lignin and hemicellulose on biomass digestion.  Finally, systematic research was undertaken to develop Agave as a low recalcitrant, drought resistant biofuels feedstock for semi-arid lands.  The findings of this thesis provide fundamental insights towards understanding interactions of lignin and hemicellulose, the two primary barriers to biological conversion, for more effective biomass deconstruction and better energy crops design.

MicroRNAs are a newly-discovered class of short regulatory RNAs that function as sequence-specific guides for the down-regulation of target gene expression. lin-4 was the first microRNA to be discovered, and it has two known targets: lin-14 and lin-28, which are regulated by partial base-pairing of the microRNA to target regions in their 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Chapter 1 of this thesis is devoted to analyzing the regulation of lin-4 biogenesis. MicroRNAs are initially transcribed as long primary transcripts, which are processed by RNAseIII enzymes Drosha and Dicer to liberate the mature microRNA. The expression of mature lin-4 is developmentally controlled such that worms do not express detectable levels of the microRNA, until ̃12 hours of development on food. However, RT-PCR techniques revealed that transcription of lin-4 primary transcripts occurs during the early period when mature microRNA is undetectable, suggesting the existence of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism preventing premature processing of these transcripts. A GFP-sensor- based RNAi screen for factors involved in this processing block identified a conserved RRM-domain protein, R05H10.2. Inactivation of R05H10.2 by RNAi causes a post- transcriptional defect in the accumulation of mature lin-4 and induces a dramatic growth defect. However, this growth defect is substantially suppressed in lin-14 and lin-28 mutant worms, revealing a previously undescribed linkage between the heterochronic pathway and organismal growth. Chapter 2 of this dissertation is an analysis of the mechanism of target regulation for lin-4. When my dissertation work commenced, the prevailing model for microRNA function held that target regulation occurred by translational control which left target mRNA levels unaffected. The work detailed in chapter 2 is an analysis of the levels of lin-14 and lin-28 mRNAs undergoing lin-4 mediated regulation in wild-type and lin-4 mutant worms, showing that the target mRNAs are degraded as a result of their interaction with the microRNA. The Pasquinelli lab was among the first groups to report degradation of target mRNAs by microRNA regulation of endogenous targets, and my work with lin-4 was combined with analysis of let-7 target regulation performed by other workers in the Pasquinelli lab, and published in Cell in 2005

State preparation and metrology of nitrogen nuclear spin in diamond
A negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising system for quantum computation and quantum information. It has the diamond structure with a substitutional nitrogen atom and a neighboring vacancy. An electron spin in the NV center has an exceptionally long coherence time at room temperature. Thus the NV center has a potential to realize a room-temperature quantum computer which is more efficient than a classical computer. In this dissertation, we focus on the nitrogen nuclear spin as well as the electron spin in the NV center. Every NV center has the nitrogen nuclear spin. Because of the long coherence time of the nitrogen nuclear spin, it is a good candidate for a quantum memory. Thus it is important to prepare the nitrogen nuclear spin qubit in a given pure state for quantum computation. We provide a theoretical understanding of the popular nuclear spin initialization technique. Furthermore, we propose an optimal condition for the initialization of the nitrogen nuclear spin by including the local strain in the NV center. We expect that this optimal condition can improve the purity of the nuclear spin initialization. We also propose an efficient quantum measurement protocol for the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the ¹⁵N nuclear spin in the NV center. A precise knowledge of the hyperfine interaction is important to reduce an error in a coherent control of the ¹⁵N nuclear spin. In this protocol, a sequence of quantum operations with successively increasing duration is utilized to estimate the hyperfine interaction with successively higher precision approaching the quantum metrology limit. Unlike common quantum metrological methods, this protocol does not need the preparation of the nuclear spin in a pure state. In the presence of realistic operation errors and electron spin decoherence, we show the overall precision of our protocol still surpasses the standard quantum limit

Simulating the interplay between plasma transport, electric field, and magnetic field in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere
The convection electric field resulting from the coupling of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) drives plasma in the tail plasma sheet earthward. This transport and the resulting energy storage in the near Earth plasma sheet are important for setting up the conditions that lead to major space weather disturbances, such as storms and substorms. Penetration of plasma sheet particles into the near-Earth magnetosphere in response to enhanced convection is crucial to the development of the Region 2 field-aligned current system and large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling, which results in the shielding of the convection electric field. In addition to the electric field, plasma transport is also strongly affected by the magnetic field, which is distinctly different from dipole field in the inner plasma sheet and changes with plasma pressure in maintaining force balance. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate how the plasma transport into the inner magnetosphere is affected by the interplay between plasma, electric field and magnetic field. For this purpose, we conduct simulations using the Rice Convection Model (RCM), which self-consistently calculates the electric field resulting from M-I coupling. In order to quantitatively evaluate the interplay, we improved the RCM simulations by establishing realistic plasma sheet particle sources, by incorporating it with a modified Dungey force balance magnetic field solver (RCM-Dungey runs), and by adopting more realistic electron loss rates. We found that plasma sheet particle sources strongly affect the shielding of the convection electric field, with a hotter and more tenuous plasma sheet resulting in less shielding than a colder and denser one and thus in more earthward penetration of the plasma sheet. The Harang reversal, which is closely associated with the shielding of the convection electric field and the earthward penetration of low-energy protons, is found to be located at lower latitudes and extend more dawnward for a hotter and more tenuous plasma sheet. In comparison with simulation runs under an empirical but not force balance magnetic field from the Tsyganenko 96 model, the simulation results show that transport under force-balanced magnetic field results in weaker pressure gradients and thus weaker R2 FAC in the near-earth region, weaker shielding of the penetration electric field and, as a result, more earthward penetration of plasma sheet protons and electrons with their inner edges being closer together and more azimuthally symmetric. To evaluate the effect of electron loss rate on ionospheric conductivity, a major contributing factor to M-I coupling, we run RCM-Dungey with a more realistic, MLT dependent electron loss rate established from observed wave activity. Comparing our results with those using a strong diffusion everywhere rate, we found that under the MLT dependent loss rate, the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the precipitating electron energy fluxes agrees better with statistical DMSP observations. The more realistic loss rate is much weaker than the strong diffusion limit in the inner magnetosphere. This allows high-energy electrons in the inner magnetosphere to remain much longer and produce substantial conductivity at lower latitudes. The higher conductivity at lower latitudes under the MLT dependent loss rate results in less efficient shielding in response to an enhanced convection electric field, and thus to deeper penetration of the ion plasma sheet into the inner magnetosphere than under the strong diffusion everywhere rate.

An examination of potential causal mechanisms linking genes and political behavior
Motivated by earlier work studying the genetic basis of political attitudes (Martin, Eaves, Heath, Jardine, Feingold & Eysenck 1986, Alford, Funk & Hibbing 2005), researchers found that political behaviors such as voter turnout (Fowler, Baker & Dawes 2008), broader participation (Fowler, Baker & Dawes 2008), and partisan attachment (Settle, Dawes & Fowler 2009, Hatemi, Hibbing, Alford, Martin & Eaves 2009) also have a significant heritable component. These findings prompted a great deal of discussion and debate and helped spawn the nascent field of "genopolitics". However, in order to push this area of research forward scholars must identify causal mechanisms linking genes to political behaviors. The goal of this dissertation, which is made up of three distinct chapters, is to explore potential causal pathways my testing potential mediators such as personality traits and cognitive ability as well as identifying new genetic variants that may be associated with political behaviors. The first chapter presents a twin study testing whether the psychological traits cognitive ability, personal control, and extraversion mediate the relationship between genes and political predisposition and acts of participation. The second chapter is a candidate gene association study that tests the hypothesis that extraversion mediates a relationship between a variant of the COMT gene and partisan attachment. The third chapter presents the results from a genome-wide association study of validated voter turnout in the 2010 election. To complete this work I have utilized four novel genetically informative data sets. Two of these data sets were constructed here at UCSD, one at the University of Minnesota, and another with a research team from Sweden. All three studies shed new light on the relationship between genes and these political behaviors. However, the mediation results from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 suggest only a modest amount of the relationship between genes and political behaviors are mediated by personality traits and cognitive ability. In addition, the investigation of over 500,000 genetic variants presented in Chapter 3 did not turn up many new significant associations. However, all three chapters provide a template for how future work in this area should be done as well as highlight the pitfalls in this burgeoning area of research

Molecular mechanisms of HIV gp120-induced neurotoxicity
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are characterized by cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction and progressive neurodegeneration. These neuropathological features are accompanied by infiltration of monocytic cells into the central nervous system (CNS); increases in inflammatory mediators in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF); and activation of stress-activated signaling cascades such as the p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. Several neurotoxic substances have been implicated in the etiology of HAND, including HIV-1 encoded protein Tat and HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120). Soluble gp120 can activate macrophages and microglia to produce neurotoxins. Therefore, the objectives of this dissertation were : 1) to investigate the cellular mechanisms of neuronal injury in in vitro models of HAND; 2) to examine the role of HIV- 1 gp120 in neurotoxicity within different brain cell populations; and 3) to analyze the activation of stress- activated kinase p38 MAPK and its downstream targets in the mechanisms of HIV-1 gp120-mediated neurotoxicity. To address these aims, in vitro studies using pharmacological compounds, heterologous expression and messenger RNA (mRNA) silencing were performed to inhibit p38 MAPK activity. These studies demonstrated that p38 MAPK signaling within both neurons and monocytic cells is critical for gp120-induced neurotoxicity. Using gene microarray and protein multiplex arrays, several genes were identified that are regulated by p38 MAPK and affect the neurotoxic phenotype of monocytes exposed to gp120. After pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK activity, neuroprotective beta chemokines and growth factors were found to be upregulated in addition to proinflammatory cytokines, while the arachidonate metabolism gene LTC4 synthase was down-regulated. These modulations possibly contribute to the reduction in gp120-induced macrophage- mediated neurotoxicity after inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. In fact, blocking the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor on microglia-depleted cerebrocortical cells increased neuronal survival after exposure to neurotoxic THP-1 supernatants. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis establish that the p38 MAPK signaling cascade plays a vital role in HIV-1 neuropathogenesis by stimulating neuronal apoptosis and by possibly increasing the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes, from monocytic cells. Future therapeutic approaches could target these molecular pathways to prevent or rescue neuronal populations from injury in patients with HAND

Fluorescence-Enhancement Based Detection and Identification of Bacterial Contaminants
Due to the considerable challenges for reliable and expedient detection of virulent vegetative bacterial, bacterial endospores and other hazardous biological agents, accidental exposure is a principal cause of fatality due to wound infection or slow diagnosis. Staining techniques, due to their simplicity, form a set of important tools for pathogen monitoring and control. The staining assays, such as immunoassays, however, provide only Boolean information: i.e., stain vs. does not stain. As a result, only the species being sought may have a chance to be identified, leaving key determining factors for the diagnosis quite susceptible to human error. Our principle motivation for this project is to expand the current analytical techniques beyond their Boolean nature, and to address the apparent need for simple, expedient and inexpensive assays. We describe the development of an assay system based on the dynamics of fluorophore uptake that will serve as a robust platform for detection of both vegetative and endospore bacterial contaminants. The kinetics of fluorescence staining depends on the coatings and protein content, which reflect the species phenotype. Hence, such kinetic measurements gain access to genetic information, in less than a minute, without conducting amplification procedures such as PCR. We have demonstrated for the first time that the kinetics of emission enhancement, caused by cell uptake of fluorophores, provides statistically significant discernibility between different and closely related vegetative bacteria and bacterial endospore species respectively. We observed that the time course of the fluorescence signal provides a unique species-specific signature that can prove indispensible for the identification of dangerous and life-threatening spores.

Dynamic High Pressure Study of Chemistry and Physics of Molecular Materials
Both temperature and pressure control and influence the packing of molecules in crystalline phases. Our molecular simulations indicate that at ambient pressure, the cubic polymorph of tetracyanoethylene, TCNE, is the energetically stable form up to ~ 160 K. The observed transition from the cubic to the monoclinic polymorph occurs however only at temperatures above ~ 318 K due to the large transition barrier. The temperature-induced phase transition in TCNE studied with high-resolution IR spectroscopy is explained in terms of the increased vibrational entropy in the crystals of the monoclinic polymorph.Based upon the inverted design of the Merril-Bassett Diamond Anvil Cell, an improved, second generation dynamic Diamond Anvil Cell was developed. Based on the fluorescence of ruby crystals, we were able to demonstrate that the pressure variation range can be further increased at least up to 7 kbar and that the dynamic pressure compression of up to 1400 GPa/s can be achieved. A new class of mechanophoric system, bis-anthracene, BA, and its photoisomer, PI, is shown to respond reversibly to a mild, static pressure induced by a Diamond Anvil Cell as well as to shear deformation based on absorption spectroscopic measurements. The forward reaction occurs upon illumination with light while the back-reaction may be accelerated upon heating or mechanical stress, coupled to a rehybridization on four equivalent carbon atoms. It is an intriguing result as high pressure stabilizes the photodimerized species in related systems. Our molecular volume simulations ruled out significant differences in the volumes between bis-anthracene and its photoisomer. Kinetic absorption measurements at several different pressures reveal a negative volume of activation in the exothermic back-reaction at room temperature. Through a series of temperature-dependent kinetic measurements it is shown that the barrier of activation for the back-reaction is reduced by more than an order of magnitude at several kbar pressure. Results are compared to the photoisomer of 9-anthroic anhydride and to the Dewar photoisomer. A two-step model involving the transition state is proposed for the pressure-induced PI-to-BA conversion, explaining the mechanism of the reaction occurring upon the application of homogeneous stress.

Exchange protein activated by cAMP : drug target and biomarker in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adult leukemia in the Western world, is associated with the accumulation of B-lymphocytes due to decreased apoptosis. The second messenger 3'5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) promotes apoptosis by unknown mechanisms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with CLL. The actions of cAMP are mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) and Exchange protein activated by cAMP-1 (Epac-1). Using real-time PCR we find that compared to PBMC from healthy subjects, CLL-cells have elevated Epac-1 and decreased PKA regulatory subunit RII&beta; mRNA expression. Studies using traditional PCR reveal that this increase in Epac-1 mRNA expression does not result from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of Epac-1. Use of fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) (to assess annexin 5 staining, a marker for apoptosis) revealed that 48 hr treatment with an Epac- selective analog (8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP 8Me, 50 muM) inhibited apoptosis of CLL-cells but that a PKA-selective analog (N6- Phenyladenosine-cAMP N6, 50 muM) induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Rap-1, the downstream mediator of Epac-1, with N-4-2(R)-Amino-3-mercaptopropylamino-2- naphthylbenzoyl-(L)-leucine methyl ester GGTI-298 (100 nM - 10 muM, 48h) increased apoptosis of CLL-cells and prevented the anti-apoptotic effect of Epac activation. These results reveal that CLL is associated with increased Epac-1 expression and that unlike PKA activation, Epac-1 activation (in a Rap-1 dependent manner) enhances the survival of the malignant B-cells. Approaches that decrease the expression and function of Epac-1 and increase the expression and function of PKA thus may be beneficial in treating CLL by increasing the pro-apoptotic effects of cAMP

The role of alpha4 containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in dopamine neurons
Nicotine is the primary psychoactive substance in tobacco and it exerts its effects by interaction with various subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain. One of the major subtypes expressed in brain, the alpha4beta2-nAChR, endogenously modulates neuronal excitability and, thereby, modifies certain normal, as well as nicotine-induced, behaviors. Although alpha4- containing nAChRs are widely expressed across the brain, a major focus has been on their roles within midbrain dopaminergic regions involved in drug addition, mental illness and movement control in humans. This work generated a unique model system to examine the role of alpha4-nAChRs within dopaminergic neurons by a targeted genetic deletion of the alpha4 subunit from dopaminergic neurons in mice. Selective deletion was confirmed by loss of alpha4 mRNA and alpha4beta2-nAChRs from dopaminergic neurons, as well as selective loss of alpha4beta2-nAChR function from dopaminergic but not GABAergic neurons. Mice without alpha4-containing nAChRs had no gross impairments in learning or locomotor activity and were examined in two behaviors central to nicotine dependence, reward and anxiety relief. alpha4-nAChRs on dopaminergic neurons were found to be necessary for nicotine reward as measured by nicotine place preference, but not for reward from another drug of abuse, cocaine. Studies using the elevated plus maze as a measure of anxiety indicated that alpha4beta2- nAChRs are necessary for the anxiolytic effects of nicotine and that elimination of alpha4beta2-nAChRs specifically from dopaminergic neurons decreased the sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of nicotine. In further characterizing the role of alpha4-nAChRs on dopaminergic neurons in nicotine behaviors, studies showed that deletion of these receptors also increased sensitivity to nicotine-induced locomotor depression, however these receptors were not involved in nicotine induced hypothermia. This was the first work to develop a dopaminergic specific deletion of a nAChR subunit and examine resulting changes in nicotine behaviors

Turbulence and internal waves in tidal flow over topography
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are used to investigate and quantify the dynamical processes underlying turbulence formed during the generation of an internal wave beam and its subsequent interaction with a realistically stratified upper ocean. As a part of the thesis, a three-dimensional mixed spectral/finite difference code was developed, parallelized, validated and employed to study several geophysical problems relevant to internal tide generation and its nonlinear breaking. The thesis research has four phases. In the first phase, a study of a stratified non- sloping bottom boundary layer under an oscillating tide was completed. The focus is on the boundary layer response to an external stratification based on LES. Flow instabilities and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer are found to excite internal gravity waves that propagate away into the ambient with phase angle varying over the tidal cycle. Subsequent studies as part of the second phase consider a stratified oscillating flow over a sloping bottom wall to mimic the generation of baroclinic internal waves (IW) from the tide-topography interaction at a model continental slope. The DNS study shows transition to turbulence, which is present along the entire extent of the near-critical region of the slope in the regime of low background excursion number and Reynolds number. The transition is found to be initiated by a convective instability, which is closely followed by shear instability. The peak value of the near-bottom velocity is found to increase with increasing length of the critical region of the topography. The scaling law that is observed to link the near-bottom peak velocity to slope length is explained by an analytical boundary layer solution that incorporates an empirically obtained turbulent viscosity. As an extension of the second phase, the objective of the third phase work is to numerically model a near-bottom beam with a larger, more realistic width using LES and characterize its turbulence statistics. Maximum turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate are found just after the zero velocity point when flow reverses from downslope to upslope motion. The phasing and other characteristics of the turbulent mixing in the present simulations show remarkable similarity with that observed off Kaena Ridge in Hawaii taken during the hawaiian ocean mixing experiment (HOME), and may be explained by the beam-scale convective overturns found here. The objective of the final phase is to understand the interaction process between an IW beam and an upper ocean pycnocline and to further characterize the cascade to small scales in the context of IW beam degradation observed in the ocean

Modeling and control of thin film surface morphology: application to thin film solar cells
Thin film solar cells, which consist of multiple layers such as the PIN layers and the Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) layers, are playing a more and more important role in the overall solar cell market owing to the potential of improving light conversion efficiencies (currently on the order of 10$\%$ for production modules). Over the last decade, it has been widely recognized that the surface morphology at each interface, which is characterized by surface root-mean-square roughness and slope, has crucial influence on the light conversion efficiency of thin film solar cells. Therefore, precisely shaping the surface morphologies of different layers in thin film solar cells during the thin film deposition process is a promising way to improve solar cell efficiency. Despite its importance, the computational modeling and control of the surface morphology, especially of the root-mean-square surface mean slope, during the thin film deposition process and its application to improve solar cell performance have not received enough attention.This dissertation presents a systematic framework for modeling and control of thin film surface morphology in both PIN layers and TCO layers. Specifically, we will present novel definitions for describing surface morphology by introducing both the surface root mean square roughness and slope to describe the surface morphology, study its physical properties and dependence on model parameters such like lattice size, activation energies and temperature, introduce and identify stochastic closed-form equations describing surface morphology, and finally design model predictive controllers to control the surface morphology to desired levels. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control framework.

Researchers' Attitudes Towards Data Discovery: Implications for a UCLA Data Registry
Research output is becoming increasingly digital. To harness the potential of the data and digital research output being produced in all fields, information professionals need to make research data discoverable to other scholars and students. This thesis focuses on understanding the various definitions that scholars use to characterize their data and other research outputs, as well as the methods and tools they use to disseminate, manage, and make their work discoverable. The UCLA Data Registry is a tool designed to serve the greater UCLA research community by collecting and making available surrogate records of research datasets. To figure out how to build this system in accordance with the needs of the community, a total of 20 researchers from disparate disciplines were interviewed about their data and metadata practices. The results indicate that researchers' attitudes towards making their work discoverable depend on their concept and definition of data.

Diversity and distribution of the marine actinomycete genus salinispora and evolution of secondary metabolite pathways
Bacteria are found in every environment on the planet, play roles in many important global cycles, and are responsible for many of the naturally produced antibiotics, yet there is still much we do not know about these organisms. The marine actinomycete genus Salinispora, represents an ideal system to test species concepts and biogeography as well as explore the evolution of pathways. The research presented here was developed in order to explore these topics in detail. The first portion of this dissertation focused on examining the diversity and distribution of Salinispora in Fijian sediments through culture work, gene sequencing and T-RFLP fingerprinting. Additionally, a summary of all the currently reported diversity within Salinispora was undertaken in order to accurately describe the present known distribution and diversity of this important marine genus. A total of 10 novel 16S rRNA gene sequence types were found within the genus, some only thus far reported from marine sponges, which highlights the importance of continuing studies on this organism. While actinomycetes are prolific producers of secondary metabolites, there have been few studies focusing on the phylogeny of their pathways. Interestingly, elucidating the evolutionary history of biosynthetic pathways appears to lend a clue to understanding the evolution of closely related species. Phylogenetic studies were undertaken to analyze the distribution of two pathways found in the three species of Salinispora. Additionally, chemical analyses were used to confirm production of the secondary metabolites in question. This project found that vertical inheritance and horizontal gene transfer have played a role in the current distribution of the pathways in question. The first two chapters outlined in the thesis laid a solid framework for continuing in depth multilocus phylogenetic analysis of a set of 48 Salinispora isolates in order to determine if the three delineated species were still clearly separately evolving lineages using rigorous criteria. Overall, the three projects completed were designed in order to obtain a clear understanding of the diversity as well as the evolution of secondary metabolite pathways of the marine genus Salinispora. Ultimately this genus proved to be an ideal system to discuss important topics in marine ecology such as the species concept, biogeography and the forces driving diversification of bacterial lineages

Mechanisms of mispair recognition by Msh2-Msh3
DNA mismatch repair is the process of fixing errors that arise in the genome during DNA replication and recombination. This is accomplished by the recognition of DNA lesions and the subsequent recruitment of factors to remove the damaged DNA and then incorporate the correct DNA sequence. The faithful maintenance of the genomic sequence is important since the accumulation of somatic mutations can disrupt basic processes within a cell and the accumulation of germline mutations can lead to inherited mutations or even inviable daughter cells. Errors in basic repair processes have severe consequences for stability of the genome and the development of cancer. Disruption of mismatch repair genes themselves leads to an overall defect in DNA mismatch repair causing the genome to accumulate mutations at a high rate. This hypermutation phenotype will eventually cause mutations at gene loci important for regulating the cell cycle and therefore lead to tumor development. A variety of studies presented here, demonstrate the importance of a functional mismatch repair system in the cell and provide a detailed analysis of mismatch recognition by the Msh2-Msh3 complex

Functional and structural investigation of Drosophila UNC- 45, a chaperone for myosin
The UCS family of proteins is important for myosin folding, stability, and maintenance. To understand the expression pattern, function, and structure of a UCS protein, the Drosophila UNC-45 (dUNC-45) was investigated. In chapter one, Western blot analysis indicates that dUNC-45 is expressed throughout development. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy shows strong dUNC-45 expression in the body-wall muscles of 14 hour wild-type embryos. Examination of third instar wild-type larvae body-wall muscles using the same approach localized dUNC-45 to the Z discs of sarcomeres. In the dUNC-45 knock out line (T-33), the strong dUNC-45 skeletal muscle expression is lost in the 14 hour old embryos and the embryos do not hatch. Electron microscopy assessment of 22 hour T-33 embryos showed poor myofibril organization and a loss of thick filaments, which is reflected by a loss of myosin on the Western blot analysis. Results in the wild-type and the T- 33 embryos suggest a post-translational association between myosin and dUNC-45. In chapter two, the chaperone function of bacterially expressed dUNC-45 was analyzed using in vitro chaperone assays. The results demonstrate that dUNC-45 is capable of refolding chemically denatured citrate synthase (CS) and suppressing heat-induced aggregation of CS, alpha-lactalbumin, and myosin. The addition of ATP or AMP-PNP enhanced dUNC-45 chaperone function, but no ATP hydrolysis was detected. in vivo, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of third instar wild-type larvae body-wall muscle suggest that heat stress induces translocation of dUNC-45 from the Z disc to the A band and possibly up-regulates protein level as shown in Western analysis. Chapter three focuses on the derivation and analysis of dUNC-45 x-ray crystal structure using bacterially expressed dUNC-45. Our 3.0 Å resolution model shows the Central and the UCS domains of dUNC-45 are composed of armadillo repeat protein motifs, but that the TPR domain is not resolved. Inspection of the surface hydrophobicity unveiled a groove in the UCS domain as the possible active site for myosin interaction. Future studies will involve defining the structure-function relationship between particular domains of UNC-45 and its chaperone activity

Human Factors, Psychological Factors, and Affirmation of Continuity
Thereare two general strategies that may be employed for "doing human factors research with nonhuman animals." First, one may use the methods of traditional human factors investigations to examine the nonhuman animal-to-machine interface. Alternatively, one might use performance by nonhuman animals as a surrogate for or model of performance by a human operator. Each of these approaches is illustrated with data in the present review. Chronic ambient noise was found to have a significant but inconsequential effect on computer-task performance by rhesus monkeys (Macaco mulatta). Additional data supported the generality of findings such as these to humans, showing that rhesus monkeys are appropriate models human psychomotor performance.

Hypoxic regulation of the NKG2D ligand, H60
Hypoxia in the context of cancer has been well studied as it has been shown that tumors that are in hypoxic conditions tend to become malignant or metastatic. There is evidence that hypoxia is able to modulate tumor immunogenicity, however this phenomenon has not been well characterized. Here, we look at the effects of hypoxia on tumor immunogenicity from the perspective of NK cell recognition. We find that hypoxia decreases the expression of the NKG2D ligand, H60 post-transcriptionally but not post-translationally, and that this down-modulation of the ligand prevents tumor recognition by NK cells

Review
In his new book, Richard M. Lerner is determined that the lessons learned from biology's shameful involvement in the horrors of Nazi genocidal programs must not be lost and that the hateful doctrine of biological determinism never again be permitted to justify oppression, inhumanity, and ultimately mass murder. Such vigilance is essential now, because he believes that the ideology of biological determinism has indeed been resurrected, this time in the guise of sociobiology, and that it too may well be used for "politically pernicious, fascist purposes"

Novel Material Behavior in Carbon  Nanotube/Elastomer Composites
Composites are multiphasic materials with individual constituent parts that work cooperatively to produce some desired result.  For the common case of structural composites, the use of nanoscale additives does not always yield a predictable outcome due to the complex interactions that occur in the interfacial region where a reinforcing filler meets the supporting matrix.  It stands to reason, however, that the thoughtful and deliberate exploitation of unusual effects in this region could lead to the development of nanocomposite materials with extraordinary properties.  In this thesis work, I will introduce two such responses in a compliant nanocomposite consisting of highly-aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encased within a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix.  It is first demonstrated that the material exhibits extremely anisotropic dynamic mechanical behavior.  The composite will behave in a way that is evocative of the neat polymer when deformed orthogonal to the CNT alignment direction, yet will exhibit strain softening when cyclically compressed along their axis due to the collective buckling of the nanotube struts.  Next, it is shown that this nanocomposite material has the ability to respond and adapt to applied loads.  Independent, yet complimentary tests reveal that the structure of the polymer in the presence of nanoscale interstitials will evolve during dynamic stressing, an effect that was predicted nearly 50 years ago.  With support from both recent and established literature, an updated mechanism is proposed.  Collectively, these results provide insight into the complicated mechanics between polymer matrices and embedded nanoparticles, and assist in the design of advanced synthetic materials with unique physical properties.

The contribution of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase, paraoxonase-1, and thioredoxin-interacting protein in lipid metabolism
The studies presented herein examine the role of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase, paraoxonase-1, and thioredoxin-interacting protein in various aspects of lipid metabolism. Cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. Hepatic over-expression of CYP7A1 maintained cholesterol homeostasis in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice that were fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. The presence of the CYP7A1 transgene altered the expression of many genes in the liver and the ileum. In particular, the expansion of the bile acid pool reduced ileal expression of Niemann-Pick C1 -like 1 (NPC1L1), in an farsenoid X receptor (FXR)- independent manner, which was associated with diminished cholesterol absorption. The expression of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) correlates inversely with the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Through the activation of FXR, bile acids increase the ileal expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) which binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) leading to diminished hepatic expression of PON1 and CYP7A1. In contrast to hepatic PON1 mRNA expression, a strong correlation exists between plasma PON1 activity levels and plasma HDL cholesterol levels. Indeed, mice that have virtually undetectable levels of plasma HDL cholesterol, such as ATP Binding Cassette Protein A1 (ABCA1)-deficient mice, have only minute plasma PON1 protein levels. However, the administration of reconstituted HDL to ABCA1-deficient mice is sufficient to generate a transient increase in mature HDL particles containing PON1. Disruption of thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) in mice leads to metabolic abnormalities, especially in the fasted state. Fasting Txnip knockout mice display high plasma triglyceride and ketone levels, as well as decreased plasma glucose levels. The hypertriglyceridemia observed in Txnip knockout mice is due to an impaired clearance of triglycerides, which correlated with decreased LPL mRNA expression and decreased LPL activity in the skeletal muscle and heart. Additional metabolic alterations in fasting Txnip knockout mice include impaired AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and diminished oxidative capacity of glucose, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and fatty acids

Integrating physical and genetic interaction networks for biological pathway discovery
The goal of understanding complex biological systems and how they are perturbed to cause disease has long been a central focus of biology. The past decade has seen the creation and maturation of a number of new technologies designed to study biological pathways on a genome-wide scale. Rather than obtaining information about the function of one gene or protein at a time, such approaches can offer insight into the activity of every gene and protein in the cell all in the context of one experiment. One fundamental mode of gathering biological insight is through identifying which proteins in the cell interact physically, such as those which form protein complexes or biochemical pathways. Techniques such as yeast-two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry allow the determination of a physical interaction map which details binding interactions between proteins on a large scale. Another fundamental mode of biological discovery is through assaying genetic interactions which arise when mutations in two genes produce a phenotype that is surprising in light of each mutation's individual effects. For example a synthetic lethal genetic interaction is indicated when deletions in two genes which are not essential for viability cause lethality when deleted together. Genetic interaction maps can be determined in high-throughput via SGA (Synthetic Genetic Array) technology. In Chapter 2 we derive and analyze a large physical protein interaction map centered on a set of human protein kinases and show how biological insight can be derived from such large-scale screens. In Chapter 3, we develop methods for the comparison of such physical protein interaction maps between species in order to identify proteins whose function is conserved throughout millions of years of evolution. In Chapter 4 we develop algorithms to integrate both physical and genetic interactions together for the purpose of biological pathway discovery. Moreover, our approaches create maps of genetic interactions that provide a picture of the global organization of pathways and complexes within the cell, which we apply to create a map of functional relationships among protein complexes involved in chromosomal biology. In Chapter 6, we apply this approach in two different yeast species and discover that while physical protein interactions are largely conserved across species, many genetic interactions are rewired which gives us valuable insight into pathway architecture. Finally in Chapter 7, we focus on the discovery of genetic interactions involved in the DNA damage response by assaying how different gene mutants respond to a drug which causes DNA damage and then demonstration how this elucidates pathways involved in this process

Enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease
Pompe Disease is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the gene for acid alpha- glucosidase. Mutations in this gene cause a buildup of glycogen within lysosomes, leading to lysosomal engorgement and a disruption of cellular processes. The heart and diaphragm are most often affected leading to death from cardiac or pulmonary failure. The only clinically available treatment methods are enzyme replacement therapy and nutritional and exercise therapy. Neither strategy completely resolves the syndrome, and enzyme replacement therapy is often too expensive for individuals. New treatment options for Pompe disease are needed. Guanidinylated neomycin (GNeo) is a novel molecular transporter which can target large bioactive molecules to the lysosome. If conjugated to acid alpha- glucosidase, GNeo may increase the efficacy of the currently available enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease by increasing the capacity of cells to take up the enzyme. In this thesis, the techniques required to demonstrate the efficacy of the GNeo molecular transporter are established. Methods for quantifying acid alpha- glucosidase presence and delivery to fibroblast lysosomes are demonstrated in vitro. A technique for inhibiting the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) delivery of acid alpha- glucosidase to the endosomal pathway in vitro is described. Finally, a method for conjugating acid alpha- glucosidase to guanidinylated neomycin in order to increase the enzymes affinity for negatively charged glycosaminoglycans is developed

The Relationship Between Calcium Gland Size, Fecunduty and Social Behavior in the Unisexual Gecks Lepidactyluse Lugubris and Hemidactylus Garnotii
Thethree present experiments examined the relationship between calcium gland size, fecundity, and dominance/social behavior in the unisexual geckos, Lepidodactylus lugubris and Hemidactylus garnotii. Study 1 examined the above variables while the geckos were housed communally and solitarily. L.lugubris established stable dominance hierarchies through aggressive interactions, whereas H. garnotii neither established a dominance hierarchy nor displayed signs of aggression while housed communally. Eggs were developed by 4 of 4 dominant L lugubris but by only 1 of 4 subordinate L lugubris and 1 of 6 H. garnotii. Calcium glands decreased in size in the subordinate L lugubris and H. garnotii during communal housing, then recovered when the geckos were housed solitarily. Study 2 examined the relationship between reproductive state and calcium gland size in L lugubris. Calcium glands were found to be smallest prior to and immediately after oviposition and largest when  eggs were yolking follicles. Study 3 examined the effect of sociality on fecundity in H. garnotii.Egg development was not related to whether geckos were housed solitarily or as dyads. Calcium gland size in geckos appears to be related to both stress and to the reproductive state of the gecko. We hypothesize that stress decreases the size of geckos' calcium glands resulting in decreased egg production in stressed animals.

Isolation and characterization of neuronal substrates of the ubiquitin proteasome system
The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is one of the most common regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells. It regulates numerous cellular processes through a combination of proteolytic and non-proteolytic forms of ubiquitination. In a neuronal context, the UPS has long been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders, and more recently, in normal neuronal function. Given the potential importance of the UPS in a neuronal framework, a logical step towards better understanding the scope of its function in neurons would involve an examination of the neuronal targets of the UPS. This research began with a large-scale identification of ubiquitinated, neuronal proteins. Using transgenic, His-6-ubiquitin tagged mice, in combination with denaturing nickel-affinity chromatography, we were able to specifically enrich for large amounts of ubiquitinated proteins. We identified over 385 unique proteins, of which 278 passed stringent filters of potential false-positives. With an approximate proteome of 1200 proteins, we concluded that at least 25% of all synaptic proteins were ubiquitinated at a detectable level. Following the screen, I conducted a more in-depth analysis of the more interesting targets. One of the more promising candidates identified was stromal interaction molecule I (STIM1). Characterization of neuronal STIM1 revealed that it was expressed throughout development with stable levels of expression in mature neurons. Furthermore, subpopulations of STIM1 were identified on the surface of hippocampal neurons. Ectopically expressed STIM1 rapidly redistributed into punctate clusters in response to thapsigargin (TG)-induced store-depletion. Proteasome inhibitors significantly increase surface STIM1 levels and peak Ca2+ influx upon TG -induced SOCE. Additionally, overexpression of POSH, an E3 ligase, leads to a decrease in STIM1 surface populations. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for previously undescribed roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the regulation of STIM1 and SOCE function. Examination of neuronal Rac1-GEF, kalirin-5, reveals that its stability is affected by CamKII and PP1/2 activity, in a proteasome-dependent manner. The role of kalirin-5 in the brain is yet unknown, but UPS-mediated regulation may provide a platform from which to pursue future studies

Synergistic Effect of Fullerene-Capped Gold Nanoparticles on Graphene Electrochemical Supercapacitors
We report the synthesis of graphene/fullerene-capped gold nanoparticle nanocomposite film which was used to construct supercapacitor electrodes. The fullerene-based self-assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were attained via the fullerene(C60)-gold interaction. The fullerene-capped AuNPs effectively separated the graphene sheets preventing aggregation. A synergistic effect was observed—the specific capacitance of graphene/fullerene-capped AuNP electrode is197 F/g, which is higher than that of graphene electrode (31 F/g), graphene/AuNP electrode (126 F/g), and graphene/fullerene electrode (118 F/g). The results render a novel route of synthesis and modification of graphene-based materials for the construction of electrochemical energy storage devices.

Methods for parallel amplification of single DNA molecules
The aim of this thesis is to develop two improved methods for amplifying genomic DNA and to order the individual amplified templates into arrays for high throughput and cost-efficient genome sequencing. The first method focuses on the synthesis of functionalized linear polymers for fabricating arrays for DNA amplification. These arrays can be used to improve PCR amplification of single molecules by extending the reaction into three-dimensional space similar to a solution reaction while each reaction is confined within the structure of the array. A method was developed for the synthesis and purification of linear polyacrylamide copolymers that can be captured and visualized. Several conjugation methods were investigated for functionalizing the copolymers with primers. The second amplification method utilized linear rolling circle amplification to produce long continuous DNA molecules with multiple copies of the template sequence. These single molecules could be captured onto an array for sequencing. The number of amplified copies in these molecules was characterized by several methods including gel electrophoresis, digestion, probe saturation, and electric field stretching. The amplified products displayed a broad distribution in length. However, they could be captured on a surface and imaged by fluorescence microscopy, and are accessible for downstream applications. Microemulsions can be used to further control the sizes of DNA single molecule amplicons. A microfluidic device was designed and fabricated for creating uniform microemulsions. Microemulsions with a coefficient of variation around 0.15 could be produced under various conditions. Further improvement in the device will be required to make it more reproducible

Functions of TBX-35, CEH-51, and TCF/POP-1 in Mesoderm Specification in Caenorhabditis elegans
Early cells of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> decide very early which types of tissues they will contribute to. The E and MS blastomeres are sister cells born at the 7-cell stage of embryonic development. E makes the entire endoderm (gut), while MS makes many mesodermal cell types, including pharynx, body muscles and the four embryonically-derived coelomocytes. The E cell is specified by two redundant genes, <italic>end-1</italic> and <italic>end-3</italic>, while MS is specified by the T-box gene <italic>tbx-35</italic>. However, previous studies indicate that another regulator is involved in MS specification, since <italic>tbx-35</italic> mutant embryos continue to make some MS-derived tissues (e.g., coelomocytes).  In addition, the embryos that lack NK-2 homeobox gene, <italic>ceh-51</italic>, previously identified by the Maduro lab to be a direct target of <italic>tbx-35</italic>, also showed partial specification of MS-derived tissues. Embryos that lack both <italic>tbx-35</italic> and <italic>ceh-51</italic>, however, show a synergistic reduction in MS-specific tissues, suggesting that TBX-35 and CEH-51 work together to specify for tissues downstream in the MS lineage.  The Wnt nuclear effector POP-1 is critical to making MS and E different from one another. The MS-to-E transformation that results from loss of <italic>pop-1</italic> function is well documented (Lin et al., 1995), and shows that the main requirement for POP-1 in C. elegans is repression of endoderm fate in MS. Recently, our laboratory has reported that E adopts an MS-like fate in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> embryos depleted for <italic>Cb-pop-1</italic> function. This and other observations prompted us to look for the requirements of POP-1 in specification of MS in C. elegans. We examined <italic>pop-1; end-1,3</italic> mutant embryos and found that although such embryos lack endoderm (as expected), they generate additional tissues that are normally made by MS, specifically pharynx muscle, body wall muscle, and coelomocytes. Using a laser microbeam to isolate MS or E, we have found that both cells make these tissues in <italic>pop-1; end-1,3</italic> mutants. However, E isolations in the triple mutant embryos also express the hypodermal marker nhr-25::YFP, suggesting that E generates some C-like tissues in the absence of <italic>end-1,3</italic>. Collectively, these results demonstrate that E is only partially restored to an MS-like fate. The conclusion is that POP-1 is dispensable for some aspects of MS specification in C. elegans end-1,3 mutants, and that there may be a role for POP 1 in blocking MS fate in E.

Foundations of Categorified Representation Theory
This thesis develops the foundations of the program of groupoidification and presents an application of this program --- the Fundamental Theorem of Hecke Operators.  In stating this theorem, we develop a theory of enriched bicategories and construct the Hecke bicategory --- a categorification of the intertwining operators between permutation representations of a finite group.  As an immediate corollary, we obtain a categorification of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra, which leads to solutions of the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation.  Such solutions are a positive step towards invariants of 2-tangles in 4-dimensional space and constructions of higher-categories with braided structures.

Empirical Bayesian LASSO-logistic regression for multiple binary trait locus mapping
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Complex binary traits are influenced by many factors including the main effects of many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), the epistatic effects involving more than one QTLs, environmental effects and the effects of gene-environment interactions. Although a number of QTL mapping methods for binary traits have been developed, there still lacks an efficient and powerful method that can handle both main and epistatic effects of a relatively large number of possible QTLs.
				
				
					
						Results
					In this paper, we use a Bayesian logistic regression model as the QTL model for binary traits that includes both main and epistatic effects. Our logistic regression model employs hierarchical priors for regression coefficients similar to the ones used in the Bayesian LASSO linear model for multiple QTL mapping for continuous traits. We develop efficient empirical Bayesian algorithms to infer the logistic regression model. Our simulation study shows that our algorithms can easily handle a QTL model with a large number of main and epistatic effects on a personal computer, and outperform five other methods examined including the LASSO, HyperLasso, BhGLM, RVM and the single-QTL mapping method based on logistic regression in terms of power of detection and false positive rate. The utility of our algorithms is also demonstrated through analysis of a real data set. A software package implementing the empirical Bayesian algorithms in this paper is freely available upon request.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The EBLASSO logistic regression method can handle a large number of effects possibly including the main and epistatic QTL effects, environmental effects and the effects of gene-environment interactions. It will be a very useful tool for multiple QTLs mapping for complex binary traits.

Plasticity of Local-Circuit Constraint Properties During  Functional Reorganization of Adult Cortex
Cortical sensory maps are highly organized structures that contain point-to-point representations of sensory inputs.  This organization emerges in-part from horizontal connections that limit activity-flow across representational borders (local-circuit constraint properties).  Interestingly, this organization undergoes experience-dependent modifications throughout life.  This dissertation examines changes in local-circuit constraint properties during cortical reorganization.       Synaptic plasticity of horizontal connections could modify activity-flow across borders.  Very little is known about inhibitory synaptic plasticity, its relationship to excitatory synaptic plasticity, and their relationship to functional organization.  To investigate this, we located the forepaw/lower jaw (FP/LJ) of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in vivo, and used whole cell-patch electrophysiology to record excitatory and inhibitory responses of horizontal connections in vitro.  Connections that remained within the representation (continuous) and those that crossed from one representation to another (discontinuous) were both examined before and after tetanization, allowing us to examine differences associated with borders.  Tetanic stimulation induced diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, with long-term potentiation (LTP) dominating for excitation and long-term depression dominating for inhibition.  The border did not restrict this plasticity in either case.  In contrast, tetanization elicited LTP of monosynaptic inhibitory responses in continuous, but not discontinuous connections.  These results demonstrate that continuous and discontinuous horizontal connections are capable of diverse plasticity responses that could theoretically functionally reorganize the cortex.     Axon remodeling could also change activity-flow across borders.  To investigate this, we examined axon remodeling during long-durations of reorganization.  We located the FP/LJ border and then iontophoresed a retrograde axonal tracer near the border at different durations of forelimb-denervation or sham-denervation.  In sham-denervated animals, neurons close to the border had axonal projections oriented away from the border (axonal bias).  Forelimb denervation resulted in a sustained change in border location and a significant reduction in the axonal bias after 6 weeks of denervation, but not after 4 or 12 weeks.  The change in axonal bias resulted from axon sprouting across the border at 6 weeks, followed by the retraction of those axons by 12 weeks.  This suggests bidirectional axonal rearrangements are associated with relatively long-durations of reorganization.  Thus, diverse synaptic and morphological plasticity mechanisms could contribute to functional reorganization.

These two types of tests are developed for different testing objectives and under different assumptions. We use simulation to demonstrate that their performance is better than that of the existing tests. We also discuss the differences of these two tests.

Hyper-variability in the Length of the Constitutive Heterochromatin Regions Associated With Cancer Susceptibility
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Research has linked genetic and lifestyle factors to increased risks of developing this disease. However, in spite of recent advances, there continue to be significant gaps in our understanding of the causes, susceptibility factors and mechanisms underlying the etiology of breast cancer. Environmental factors also contribute and it is believed that unintentional exposures to various physical and chemical agents play a major role in the etiology of this and other types of cancer. !Studies have reported that women with increased size variability of the constitutive heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 in normal peripheral blood cells are at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Previous work in our laboratory using a novel technique integrating fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with probes specific for the classical satellite regions located at the heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 was applied to lymphoblastoid cells lines derived from breast cancer patients and age-, ethnicity- and sex-matched controls. These results corroborated early studies reporting that the paracentromeric heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 were significantly more variable in size than those from the matched controls. The mechanisms underlying the increase in variability are unknown. The objectives of this research were to first, confirm and extend the earlier results from our laboratory, and secondly, to investigate the hypothesis that the increased variability observed is due to inefficient DNA repair of DNA inter-strand crosslinks. In comparing the results of the new and the earlier studies, similar results were seen, and as a result, the data were combined to enlarge the sample size and increase the accuracy of the results. The combined analyses confirmed that the size of the constitutive heterochromatin was significantly more variable in most cells obtained from the breast cancer patients when compared with the matched controls; the constitutive heterochromatin region was significantly more variable in 7 of the 10 breast cancer patient-derived cell lines when examining both chromosomes 1 and 9.To assess the role of DNA damage, we exposed six breast cancer patient cell lines to the alkylating agents, mitomycin C, melphalan and 2-chloroethylamine to investigate changes in the heterochromatin regions that occurred following treatment. Two of the six cell lines showed variability in the heterochromatin region of chromosome 9 that was strikingly greater following treatment than that seen in the matched controls. Interestingly, a similar trend was not seen with chromosome 1. The increase in heterochromatin variability was seen following treatment with both bifunctional and monofunctional alkylating agents indicating that the increase was not dependent upon the formation of DNA crosslinks. Of note, the two particularly sensitive cell lines did not exhibit major increases in alkylating agent-induced chromosome breakage in the micronucleus assay indicating that variability is not likely to be due to inefficient repair of genome-wide DNA breaks. Lastly, in a time-course experiment, the increases in heterochromatin variability in the two sensitive cell lines were seen at both 24 and 48 hr after treatment with mitomycin C, a potent cross linking agent. Interestingly, similar but only transient increases (at 24 hr. only) were also seen with DMSO treatment in the sensitive cells, but not controls, suggesting that the observed increases are not due to changes in DNA sequence but are more likely due to epigenetic changes occurring in the sensitive cell lines.

Subnanosecond control of excitons in coupled quantum well nanostructures : photonic storage and Exciton Conveyer devices
Indirect excitons in GaAs coupled quantum well nanostructures are a versatile system for fundamental study of cold neutral bosonic gases and demonstration of novel optoelectronic devices based on excitons -- a bound electron-hole pair -- rather than electrons. Indirect exciton lifetimes range from nanoseconds to microseconds and cool rapidly after photoexcitation to the lattice temperature. Lithographically-patterned electrodes enable design of potential energy landscapes, and both energy and lifetime can be controlled in situ, rapidly, on timescales much shorter than the exciton lifetime. Such intrinsically optoelectronic devices can operate at speeds relevant to optical networks, and later be fabricated in other semiconductors for higher-temperature operation. Two different kinds of devices are demonstrated Photon storage -- an optical memory -- with 250 ps rise time of the readout optical signal and storage time reaching microseconds was implemented with indirect excitons in CQW. The storage and release of photons was controlled by the gate voltage pulse, and the transient processes in the CQW studied by measuring the kinetics of the exciton emission spectra. This control of excitons on timescales much shorter than the exciton lifetime demonstrates the feasibility of studying excitons in in situ controlled electrostatic traps. The Exciton Conveyer is a laterally moving electrostatic lattice potential for actively transporting excitons. Generated by laterally modulated electrodes, the potential velocity and depth are controlled in situ by frequency and voltage. We observed exciton transport characterized by average exciton cloud spatial extension over several tens of microns, and observed dynamical localization-delocalization transitions for the excitons in the conveyer : In the localization regime of deeper potentials and moderate exciton density, excitons are moved by the conveyer; in the delocalized regime of shallower lattice potential or high exciton density, excitons do not follow the conveyer motion. We explore conveyer velocities both slower and faster than phonon velocities. Realizing subnanosecond manipulations of exciton energy and lifetime required versatile control of pulsed and multiple AC RF electrical signals in optical, liquid helium cryogenic systems. Considerable detail is presented of design, construction, and test of flexible experimental apparatus

Structural and functional study of virus protein 'u' from HIV-1 by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
Virus protein 'u' (Vpu) is one of the accessory proteins expressed by the HIV-1 genome. It is a type I integral phosphoprotein which contains a single-helical transmembrane (TM) domain and an amphipathic cytoplasmic domain. In its oligomeric form, the transmembrane domain is responsible for the ion channel activity of Vpu, and the domain itself is the main contributor in the antagonistic function against BST-2, a host cell viral restriction factor. The cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the binding of CD4 receptors at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and recruiting other protein complexes that ultimately leads to the CD4 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. In order to structurally characterize this protein by NMR, a lipid environment in the form of either micelle or bicelle was used for the proper solubilization and folding of the protein. Solution NMR was used as a method to quickly examine the stability of the protein within micelles and to identify the secondary structure regions, while solid- state NMR gave helical tilt and rotation information as well as the orientation restraints of individual amide bonds for a protein embedded in a bilayer environment. In this thesis, structural features of Vpu based on NMR results of wildtype and various truncated/mutant forms of the protein are presented. A single site mutation on the TM that enables the inter-conversion of structure and functionality between Vpu and M2, a structural analogue from Influenza A virus, will be discussed. The last section will describe the collaborative effort of examining the protein-protein interaction between Vpu and BST-2 using a combination of spectroscopic, biological, and computational approaches. Residues involved in the interaction between the two proteins' TM domains were identified in solution NMR experiments while the helical tilt angles and interaction faces were determined by solid -state NMR. A model of the complex is presented and shows remarkable agreement with the combination of NMR data, biological results, and computational simulation

Vesicular Horizon Distribution, Properties, and Pedogenic Processes in Deserts of the Western United States
Vesicular horizons are common surface horizons in arid and semi-arid lands and are characterized by the prevalence of nearly spherical, non-interconnected vesicular pores.  They regulate surface hydrology in water-limited ecosystems, but are easily disrupted by human land-use.  In order to interpret potential changes to vesicular horizon distribution and properties in response to land-use and climatic change, we need to know more about the current distribution of vesicular horizons and how they are formed.  The objectives of this dissertation are to: 1) evaluate the distribution and properties of vesicular horizons across the western U.S., 2) determine how disturbance and recovery of vesicular horizons impacts their pore morphology and hydraulic properties, and 3) determine the influence of microbial respiration and thermal expansion of gases on vesicular pore formation.  The methods used in this research include analysis of soil databases, examination of vesicular horizon recovery from disturbance in the field, creation of vesicular pores in the lab, and X-ray computed tomography analysis of soil pores.  Our results show that vesicular horizons cover 156,000 km<super>2</super> of the western U.S. and are best expressed in the cold deserts (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Central and Northern Basin and Range) relative to the warm deserts (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts).  We observed that vesicular horizons recover rapidly from disturbance, both in artificially disturbed soils and in tire tracks, and that the rate of recovery is dependent on the frequency of precipitation during the recovery period.  Disturbance does not severely alter the hydraulic properties of the vesicular horizon, but leads to a slight reduction in K<sub>sat</sub> and Gardner's &alpha;.  In the lab, we found evidence that both biotic and abiotic processes are involved in vesicular pore formation; however, the role of thermal expansion of gases in growth of the vesicular pores was not supported.  Through this work we have found that vesicular horizons occur extensively throughout arid and semi-arid regions of the western U.S.  Vesicular horizon formation and recovery from disturbance is dependent on climatic conditions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, precipitation frequency, soil temperature), biological factors (<italic>e.g.</italic>, shrub cover, microbial respiration), and their interactions.

[flow, plasma, turbulent, zonal, drift, energy, sheared]

Study of nonlinear energy transfer between drift wave turbulence and spontaneously generated sheared flows in a laboratory plasma
Experiments in a laboratory plasma are used to identify how small-scale turbulent structures give rise to large- scale sheared zonal flows. A new technique based on cross- bispectral analysis has been developed and applied to directly measure the nonlinear energy transfer rates between drift wave turbulence and sheared flows. In addition fast imaging is used to directly observe the turbulent structure dynamics. A combined study using both Langmiur probe arrays and fast visible light imaging shows that the sheared zonal flow is sustained by the emission of drift vortices in the central plasma which then propagate in a spiral trajectory, approach the shear layer, and then merge into the sheared flow, thereby transferring their momentum and kinetic energy to it. The shear flow is then amplified. The results are consistent with previous probe measurements of the turbulent Reynolds stress, and provide a detailed confirmation of the basic theoretical expectations for the turbulent drive of zonal flows in magnetized plasmas

[toxin, anthrax, entry, receptor, cell]

Requirements for anthrax toxin entry into cells
Bacillus anthracis secretes a harmful exotoxin called anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin has deleterious effects on several host cell types and is a significant contributor to anthrax pathogenesis. Toxin-deleted strains of B. anthracis are highly attenuated and many of the symptoms of anthrax can be replicated with anthrax toxin alone. Anthrax toxin is an AB-type toxin with two catalytic A moieties. PA, the B moiety, is responsible for receptor binding, pore formation and translocation of the catalytic moieties, EF and LF. PA binds one of two identified cellular receptors, ANTXR1 or ANTXR2. Previously, it was thought that pore formation and toxin translocation were both low-pH dependent processes and that the requirements for toxin entry mediated by either receptor were the same. Here, I report that while toxin entry mediated by ANTXR2 does require low-pH, when bound to ANTXR1 toxin can form pores in host membranes and translocate under near-neutral pH conditions. Additionally, I report that LRP6, a putative anthrax toxin co-receptor, is not absolutely required for toxin entry into cells. Finally, using a targeted siRNA screen, I identify other cellular factors involved in anthrax toxin entry. Studies characterizing these factors provide evidence in favor of a role for the recycling pathway in anthrax toxin receptor cell surface expression

Silencer-delimited transgenesis: NRSE/RE1 sequences promote neural-specific transgene expression in a NRSF/REST-dependent manner
Abstract
Background
We have investigated a simple strategy for enhancing transgene expression specificity by leveraging genetic silencer elements. The approach serves to restrict transgene expression to a tissue of interest - the nervous system in the example provided here - thereby promoting specific/exclusive targeting of discrete cellular subtypes. Recent innovations are bringing us closer to understanding how the brain is organized, how neural circuits function, and how neurons can be regenerated. Fluorescent proteins enable mapping of the 'connectome', optogenetic tools allow excitable cells to be short-circuited or hyperactivated, and targeted ablation of neuronal subtypes facilitates investigations of circuit function and neuronal regeneration. Optimally, such toolsets need to be expressed solely within the cell types of interest as off-site expression makes establishing causal relationships difficult. To address this, we have exploited a gene 'silencing' system that promotes neuronal specificity by repressing expression in non-neural tissues. This methodology solves non-specific background issues that plague large-scale enhancer trap efforts and may provide a means of leveraging promoters/enhancers that otherwise express too broadly to be of value for in vivo manipulations.

Results
We show that a conserved neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) can function to restrict transgene expression to the nervous system. The neuron-restrictive silencing factor/repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST) transcriptional repressor binds NRSE/repressor element 1 (RE1) sites and silences gene expression in non-neuronal cells. Inserting NRSE sites into transgenes strongly biased expression to neural tissues. NRSE sequences were effective in restricting expression of bipartite Gal4-based 'driver' transgenes within the context of an enhancer trap and when associated with a defined promoter and enhancer. However, NRSE sequences did not serve to restrict expression of an upstream activating sequence (UAS)-based reporter/effector transgene when associated solely with the UAS element. Morpholino knockdown assays showed that NRSF/REST expression is required for NRSE-based transgene silencing.

Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that the addition of NRSE sequences to transgenes can provide useful new tools for functional studies of the nervous system. However, the general approach may be more broadly applicable; tissue-specific silencer elements are operable in tissues other than the nervous system, suggesting this approach can be similarly applied to other paradigms. Thus, creating synthetic associations between endogenous regulatory elements and tissue-specific silencers may facilitate targeting of cellular subtypes for which defined promoters/enhancers are lacking.

Sonographic Identification of Tube Thoracostomy Study (SITTS): Confirmation of Intrathoracic Placement
Introduction: Thoracostomy tubes (TT) are commonly placed in the management of surgical, emergency, and trauma patients and chest radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are performed to confirm placement. Ultrasound (US) has not previously been used as a means to confirm intrathoracic placement of chest tubes. This study involves a novel application of US to demonstrate chest tubes passing through the pleural line, thus confirming intrathoracic placement.
      Methods: This was an observational proof-of-concept study using a convenience sample of patients with TTs at a tertiary-care university hospital. Bedside US was performed by the primary investigatorusing first the low-frequency (5–1 MHz) followed by the high-frequency (10–5 MHz) transducers, in both 2-dimensional gray-scale and M-modes in a uniform manner. The TTs were identified in transverse and longitudinal views by starting at the skin entry point and scanning to where the TT passed the pleural line, entering the intrathoracic region. All US images were reviewed by US fellowship-trained emergency physicians. CXRs and CTs were used as the standard for confirmation ofTT placement.
      Results: Seventeen patients with a total of 21 TTs were enrolled. TTs were visualized entering the intrathoracic space in 100% of cases. They were subjectively best visualized with the high-frequency (10–5 MHz) linear transducer. Sixteen TTs were evaluated using M-mode. TTs produced a distinct pattern on M-mode.
      Conclusion: Bedside US can visualize the TT and its entrance into the thoracic cavity and it can distinguish it from the pleural line by a characteristic M-mode pattern. This is best visualized with the high-frequency (10–5 MHz) linear transducer. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(4):305–311.

Biodegradable porous silicon nanomaterials for imaging and treatment of cancer
Cancer is the second leading cause of death, claiming ̃0.56 million lives in the U.S. every year following heart diseases (̃0.62 million). From 1991 to 2007, mortality associated with heart diseases decreased 39%; by contrast, the death rate of cancer only decreased by 17% in spite of intensive research and improved therapeutics. The stagnation of conventional medicine and the complexity of cancer demand new therapeutic strategies. As an emerging approach, the use of nanomaterials as cancer diagnostic and therapeutic agents has shown promising results due to their unique physical and chemical properties. To date, more than two dozen nanoparticle-based products have been approved for clinical use and they show advantages over conventional therapeutics. However, translation of many other nanomaterials has been impeded due to concerns over toxicity and biodegradability. This dissertation presents the development of biodegradable luminescent porous silicon nanomaterials and their potential applications for imaging and treatment of cancer. Chapter 3 presents a diagnostic application of LPSiNPs. Time-gated fluorescence imaging of tumors using LPSiNPs with long emission lifetime is developed. This technique can effectively eliminate interference from short-lived tissue autofluorescence and improve the detection sensitivity. Chapter 4-6 demonstrate the therapeutic applications of porous silicon nanomaterials. In Chapter 4, magnetically- guided delivery of anticancer drug to cancer cells in vitro is achieved using magnetic, luminescent porous Si microparticles. Chapter 5 demonstrates that porous silicon nanoparticles can be used as photosensitizer and generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen when irradiated by light. The phototoxicity of the nanoparticles against cancer cells is also studied. Finally, the use of LPSiNPs for immune activation is investigated in Chapter 6

Aptamers are becoming a viable alternative to antibodies as bio-recognition elements in analytical, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this research two aptamers were developed using capillary electrophoresis systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CE-SELEX). These aptamers were selected from and artificial library of single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) with 40 randomized nucleotides flanked by two priming sites with a diversity of 1015 different sequences.The first target employed in this study was the extensively used herbicide, atrazine, for which and aptamer with dissociation constant of 890 nM was selected.The second target was Protective antigen toxin from the gram positive spore forming bacteria Bacillus anthracis for which an aptamer with a dissociation constant of 112 nM was selected from the library.These two aptamers were used to construct a bioassay based on fluorescence polarization, for the successful detection of their respective targets in spiked samples under different conditions.

Deletions in the pyruvate pathway of Salmonella Typhimurium alter SPI1-mediated gene expression and infectivity
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide. S. Typhimurium encodes type III secretion systems via Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI), producing the major effector proteins of virulence. Previously, we identified two genes of Salmonella pyruvate metabolism that were up-regulated during chicken cell infection: pyruvate formate lyase I (pflB) and bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE). We were therefore interested in examining the role these genes may play in the transmission of Salmonella to humans.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Mutant strains of Salmonella with single gene deletions for pflB and adhE were created. Invasion and growth in human HCT-8 intestinal epithelial cells and THP-1 macrophages was examined. Quantitative PCR was performed on 19 SPI-1 genes.
				
				
					
						Results
					In HCT-8 cells, both mutant strains had significantly higher intracellular counts than the wild-type from 4 to 48&#160;h post-infection. Various SPI-1 genes in the mutants were up-regulated over the wild-type as early as 1&#160;h and lasting until 24&#160;h post-infection. In THP-1 cells, no significant difference in internal Salmonella counts was observed; however, SPI-1 genes were largely down-regulated in the mutants during the time-course of infection. We also found five SPI-1 genes - hilA, hilC hilD, sicP and rtsA - which were up-regulated in at least one of the mutant strains in log-phase broth cultures alone. We have therefore identified a set of SPI-1 virulence genes whose regulation is effected by the central metabolism of Salmonella.

Analysis of key regions, roles, and interactions of the IE2 family of proteins throughout the human cytomegalovirus infection process
Studies of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate early (MIE) protein, IE2 86 have yielded significant knowledge as to how this virus regulates many aspects of the viral infection. IE2 86 has been shown to be an essential regulatory factor during HCMV infection, and is thought to play many different roles throughout the different stages of the infection process. Two other proteins that are 3 prime co-terminal to IE2 86, IE2 60 and IE2 40, have also been found to be important at the later stages of the infection). Here, we have developed a system to overcome these limitations by using a translationally induced complementation system. Viruses expressing Cre and FLP recombinases have been constructed, and are used in conjunction with cell lines containing an inducible lenti-viral based vector to facilitate expression of IE2 86, IE2 60 or IE2 40. These cell lines are selected by a drug resistance marker placed upstream of IE2, and following a recombination event governed by Cre of FLP, the selectable marker is removed and allows expression of the 2nd open reading frame (ORF) encoding IE2 86, IE2 60 or IE2 40. These studies have also defined new roles of IE2 86, IE2 60, and IE2 40. We have found that expression of another early-late protein, UL84, is regulated post-transcriptionally by each of the IE2 proteins. This regulation can occur without any other viral proteins, but requires some cellular processes. We find that IE2 40 plays a major role in the expression of UL84 at late times post infection (p.i.), and that IE2 60 may also play a similar role, albeit to a lesser degree. IE2 86, IE2 60, and IE2 40 can interact with UL84 through the C-terminal region common to all three IE2 proteins. We have also identified that the first 105 aa of UL84 is responsible for an interaction with IE2 86 and IE2 40. Further, this domain is necessary and sufficient for the post-transcriptional regulation of UL84 governed by the IE2 proteins, and a protein-protein interaction is likely necessary for the regulation

Tidal Marsh Vegetation of China Camp, San Pablo Bay, California
China Camp (Marin County, California) preserves extensive relict stands of salt marsh vegetation developed on a prehistoric salt marsh platform with a complex sinuous tidal creek network. The low salt marsh along tidal creeks supports extensive native stands of Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa). The outer salt marsh accreted following hydraulic gold mining sedimentation. It consists of a wave-scarped pickleweed-dominated (Sarcocornia pacifica) high salt marsh terrace with a broad fringing low marsh dominated by S. foliosa, including intermittent, variable stands of alkali-bulrush (Bolboschoenus maritimus). Most of the extensive prehistoric salt marsh plains within the tidal creek network also support mixed assemblages of S. pacifica, but high marsh zones along tidal creek banks support nearly continuous linear stands of gumplant (Grindelia stricta) and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) with more diverse salt marsh forb assemblages. Salt pans with submerged wigeongrass (Ruppia maritima) are scarce, local, and small. The landward edge of the tidal marsh forms rare examples of ecotones with adjacent terrestrial vegetation, including those of alluvial valleys (riparian scrub and woodland, freshwater marsh, sedge-rush meadows) and hillslope grassland and oak woodland vegetation. Narrow high tidal marsh ecotones bordering terrestrial grasslands are locally dominated by creeping wildrye (Elymus triticoides) and Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), mostly on south-facing slopes. Brackish tidal marsh ecotones above ordinary high tides are associated with freshwater discharges from groundwater and surface flows. Brackish marsh ecotones support large clonal stands of sedge, bulrush, and rush vegetation (Carex praegracilis, C. barbarae, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Juncus phaeocephalus, Schoenoplectus acutus), intergrading with terrestrial freshwater wetlands and salt marsh. The terrestrial ecotone assemblages at China Camp are comparable with those of other prehistoric tidal marshes in the San Francisco Estuary, but China Camp lacks most native clonal perennial Asteraceae and halophytic annual forbs of the region’s remnant high tidal marsh ecotones. Few globally rare salt marsh plant populations have been reported from China Camp within the National Estuarine Research Reserve and State Park boundaries, but some species regionally uncommon in San Francisco Bay tidal marshes occur. To date, non-native tidal marsh plant invasions have been relatively minor and localized within China Camp.

An Investigation of Spin and Charge Transport in Doped and Defected Graphene
Graphene has proven to be an interesting and exciting material for experimental and theoretical researcher. The unique properties have motivated proposed applications including high frequency transistors, flexible touch screens, sensors, and spin logic gates, all of which will require integration of graphene with other materials. Additionally, exotic theoretical predictions involving magnetic phenomena in doped and defected graphene provide a new area of physics to explore. A central issue for both fundamental and applied physics involves understanding how charge and spin transport properties are affected by the presence of foreign materials or defects, a topic investigated here by intentionally introducing the graphene surface to transition metals, insulators, water, atomic hydrogen and lattice vacancies.  	The first portion of this thesis provides the reader with a general introduction to graphene, the field of spintronics, device fabrication, measurement techniques, and sample characterization methods. Included are basic theoretical concepts of charge and spin transport in graphene. Details of the unique ultra high vacuum system (UHV) that combines in situ variable temperature electrical measurement, molecular beam epitaxy, hydrogen doping, and sputtering capabilities are provided.	The second portion discusses experimental results. Firstly, all transition metals (Ti, Fe, Pt, Au) investigated result in ¬n-type doping for sub monolayer coverage. This behavior provides evidence for the presence of a strong interfacial dipole. Secondly, metallic and insulating dopants are directly compared by in situ oxidation of Ti. Monitoring the charge transport properties throughout oxidation provides evidence of short range scattering due to insulating titanium dioxide impurities. Thirdly, the spatial distribution of impurities is found to strongly affect charge transport. Using a fixed amount of gold impurities, the formation of clusters from point like charged impurities reduces the electronic doping and scattering. Fourthly, in regards to spin transport in graphene, exposure to water is found to result in a substantial enhancement of spin signal, providing a simple method by which researchers can improve graphene spin valve device performance. Finally, spin scattering experiments provide direct evidence for the formation of paramagnetic moments in graphene exposed to atomic hydrogen or lattice vacancies, resolving a long standing controversy in the field.

The role of notch signaling in vessel maturation and stabilization
Vascular development and angiogenesis initially depend on endothelial tip cell invasion, which is followed by a series of maturation steps, including lumen formation and recruitment of perivascular cells. Many studies have shown that Notch signaling is involved throughout embryonic vascular development, including the regulation of tip cell formation, artery/vein patterning, and vascular remodeling. However, the role of Notch signaling in the postnatal vasculature has not been well described. Blocking postnatal Notch results in a highly branched, immature vascular plexus. Vascular plexus maturation is partly regulated by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) coverage, and little is known about the role of Notch in the postnatal perivascular compartment. Therefore, the studies in this dissertation proposed to investigate Notch effectors in VSMCs that modulate vessel maturation during postnatal angiogenesis. To verify that Notch signaling is important for postnatal arterial VSMC coverage and subsequent vessel maturation, the perivascular compartment of pups undergoing retinal angiogenesis was examined following Notch inhibition. This resulted in significantly less arterial VSMC coverage. An angiogenesis-specific microarray panel identified Notch effector genes upregulated in VSMCs in contact with the endothelial Notch ligand Jagged1, which is known to be required for arterial VSMC coverage. One of the upregulated genes was integrin beta3, which led to increased surface expression of the integrin heterodimer, alphavbeta3. Integrin alphavbeta3 is important for cell adhesion and cell migration. In the vasculature, the only available ligand for alphavbeta3 is von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Examination of pups undergoing retinal developmental angiogenesis revealed that VSMC coverage co-patterns with accumulation of vWF in the endothelial basement membrane. In a 3-dimensional in vitro tube formation assay, disruption of Notch, alphavbeta3, or vWF prevented an association between VSMCs and newly formed endothelial tubes. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of Jagged1, alphavvbeta3, or vWF suppressed VSMC coverage of nascent vessels and arterial maturation during vascular development in vivo. Therefore, the findings described in this dissertation define a Notch-mediated interaction between the developing endothelium and VSMCs, leading to adhesion of VSMCs to the endothelial basement membrane and arterial maturation

Chromatin accessibility reveals insights into androgen receptor activation and transcriptional specificity
Abstract
Background
Epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin accessibility impact transcription factor binding to DNA and transcriptional specificity. The androgen receptor (AR), a master regulator of the male phenotype and prostate cancer pathogenesis, acts primarily through ligand-activated transcription of target genes. Although several determinants of AR transcriptional specificity have been elucidated, our understanding of the interplay between chromatin accessibility and AR function remains incomplete.

Results
We used deep sequencing to assess chromatin structure via DNase I hypersensitivity and mRNA abundance, and paired these datasets with three independent AR ChIP-seq datasets. Our analysis revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in chromatin accessibility that corresponded to both AR binding and an enrichment of motifs for potential collaborating factors, one of which was identified as SP1. These quantitative differences were significantly associated with AR-regulated mRNA transcription across the genome. Base-pair resolution of the DNase I cleavage profile revealed three distinct footprinting patterns associated with the AR-DNA interaction, suggesting multiple modes of AR interaction with the genome.

Conclusions
In contrast with other DNA-binding factors, AR binding to the genome does not only target regions that are accessible to DNase I cleavage prior to hormone induction. AR binding is invariably associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and, consequently, changes in gene expression. Furthermore, we present the first in vivo evidence that a significant fraction of AR binds only to half of the full AR DNA motif. These findings indicate a dynamic quantitative relationship between chromatin structure and AR-DNA binding that impacts AR transcriptional specificity.

Fast Times: Excitatory Effect of GABA in Axonal Compartments in the Cerebellar Molecular Layer
While exploring the functions of individual cells in a circuit, we can often overlook the importance of specialized subcellular compartments organized within one neuron.  We probe the former with techniques like optogenetics, optical imaging, and (multi) cell recordings, while the latter can be clouded with mystery that have only begun to resolve in recent years.  We explore these seemingly remote and difficult-to-record-from places in a well-mapped circuit in the cerebellum that is also relevant to behavior.  Granule cells of the cerebellar cortex carry information associated with the context of a motor movement to the Purkinje cells, which as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, is a major site of motor learning.  Traditionally thought to be inhibitory, GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in granule cells, although inhibitory in the soma, have been found to be excitatory in the axons.  These axons, the parallel fibers, are too thin to record from, and methods to study them include population recordings like calcium imaging and fiber volley detection, computational modeling, and voltage sensitive dyes.We first studied the presynaptic terminals of parallel fibers using calcium imaging, and showed that GABAAR activation leads to increased amplitude of stimulus-evoked calcium transients.  This excitation appears to bring axons closer to firing threshold, recruiting addition fibers as opposed to increasing calcium levels on a per fiber basis.  Blocking the transporter that accumulates chloride reduces the effect, suggesting that high chloride concentration in the axons is the mechanism behind this effect.To gain better temporal resolution, we used GABA uncaging to probe extracellular fiber volleys and found that GABA not only increases fiber volley amplitudes, but also increases conduction velocity on parallel fibers.  We showed that &#948;-subunits are not required for GABAAR-mediated excitation and that endogenous GABA in a slice is sufficient to excite parallel fibers.  Using a computational model of the granule cell, we showed how GABA-mediated excitation on the axons can influence cell spiking, and that properties of sodium channel inactivation determine whether there's an excitatory effect of GABA on threshold for spiking and on conduction velocity.Finally we described a novel method for detecting voltage in subcellular compartments utilizing fluorescence transfer between a lipophilic tracer dye and a voltage sensitive compound.  This two-component system is seen to produce some of the biggest voltage sensing signals in the literature, and is capable of recording submillisecond voltage fluctuations in subcompartments of a Purkinje cell.  We propose to use this system to record voltage from parallel fibers and determine the effect of GABA on action potential shape and subthreshold voltage fluctuations.

Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups confer differences in risk for age-related macular degeneration: a case control study
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in elderly, Caucasian populations. There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a role in the cell death found in AMD retinas. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of the Caucasian mitochondrial JTU haplogroup cluster with AMD. We also assessed for gender bias and additive risk with known high risk nuclear gene SNPs, ARMS2/LOC387715 (G &gt; T; Ala69Ser, rs10490924) and CFH (T &gt; C; Try402His, rs1061170).
				
				
					
						Methods
					Total DNA was isolated from 162 AMD subjects and 164 age-matched control subjects located in Los Angeles, California, USA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion were used to identify the J, U, T, and H mitochondrial haplogroups and the ARMS2-rs10490924 and CFH-rs1061170 SNPs. PCR amplified products were sequenced to verify the nucleotide substitutions for the haplogroups and ARMS2 gene.
				
				
					
						Results
					The JTU haplogroup cluster occurred in 34% (55/162) of AMD subjects versus 15% (24/164) of normal (OR&#8201;=&#8201;2.99; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.0001). This association was slightly greater in males (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.98, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.005) than the female population (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.02, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). Assuming a dominant effect, the risk alleles for the ARMS2 (rs10490924; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.00001) and CFH (rs1061170; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.027) SNPs were significantly associated with total AMD populations. We found there was no additive risk for the ARMS2 (rs10490924) or CFH (rs1061170) SNPs on the JTU haplogroup background.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					There is a strong association of the JTU haplogroup cluster with AMD. In our Southern California population, the ARMS2 (rs10490924) and CFH (rs1061170) genes were significantly but independently associated with AMD. SNPs defining the JTU mitochondrial haplogroup cluster may change the retinal bioenergetics and play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AMD.

Observation of Colloidal Nanocrystal Growth
Mechanisms using Graphene Liquid Cells
We introduce a new type of liquid cell for in-situ electron microscopy based upon
entrapment of a liquid film between layers of graphene. We employ this cell to
achieve high-resolution imaging of colloidal platinum nanocrystal growth. The
ability to directly image and resolve critical steps at atomic resolution provides new
insights into nanocrystal coalescence and reshaping during growth.

Seismic scattering in the subduction zone of the Middle America  region
Seismic scattering is the direct consequence of the changes in the elastic properties of the medium. These so-call heterogeneities play a fundamental role for the understanding of the propagation of seismic waves and their possible effect on the analysis of seismic risk. This dissertation examines the scattering properties of Middle America region at continental scale, and provides a discussion of the current methods aimed to model the effect of small-scale heterogeneities in the crust.\newlineUsing data from a portable array deployed in Mexico perpendicular to the trench, we identified and modeled trapped crustal waves that were previously undocumented. When low frequency f<1Hz body phases from teleseismic events reach the trench from the ocean side, the lateral discontinuity between the continental and oceanic crust behaves as a line source that generates surface waves. This trapped mode travels with a significantly small attenuation through the crust as if it were propagating through a waveguide structure. Interestingly, conversion rates for this phase can reach up to 60% the amplitude of the incident phase in the vertical component. The scattered wave is better observed following the SP, PS, and SS phases for events in the southern hemisphere. Numerical models using a boundary element formulation support this hypothesis. Comparison between the simulations and the seismic records suggested that the structure formed by the flat-subducting slab and the crust behaves very similar to a sedimentary basin but at a larger scale. These observations could explain differences in attenuation along different paths of propagation in this area.

Propagation of nonlinear waves in waveguides and application to nondestructive stress measurement
Propagation of nonlinear waves in waveguides is a field that has received an ever increasing interest in the last few decades. Nonlinear guided waves are excellent candidates for interrogating long waveguide like structures because they combine high sensitivity to structural conditions, typical of nonlinear parameters, with large inspection ranges, characteristic of wave propagation in bounded media.</DISS_para> <DISS_para>The primary topic of this dissertation is the analysis of ultrasonic waves, including ultrasonic guided waves, propagating in their nonlinear regime and their application to structural health monitoring problems, particularly the measurement of thermal stress in Continuous Welded Rail (CWR). Following an overview of basic physical principles generating nonlinearities in ultrasonic wave propagation, the case of higher-harmonic generation in multi-mode and dispersive guided waves is examined in more detail. A numerical framework is developed in order to predict favorable higher-order generation conditions (i.e. specific guided modes and frequencies) for waveguides of arbitrary cross-sections. This model is applied to various benchmark cases of complex structures. The nonlinear wave propagation model is then applied to the case of a constrained railroad track (CWR) subjected to thermal variations. This study is a direct response to the key need within the railroad transportation community to develop a technique able to measure thermal stresses in CWR, or determine the rail temperature corresponding to a null thermal stress (Neutral Temperature - NT). The numerical simulation phase concludes with a numerical study performed using ABAQUS commercial finite element package. These analyses were crucial in predicting the evolution of the nonlinear parameter Beta with thermal stress level acting in the rail. A novel physical model, based on interatomic potential, was developed to explain the origin of nonlinear wave propagation under constrained thermal expansion. In fact, where the classical physics of nonlinear wave propagation assumes finite strains, the case at hand of constrained thermal expansion is, instead, characterized by infinitesimal (ideally zero) strains. Hand-in-hand with the theoretical analyses, a comprehensive program of experimental testing has been conducted at UCSD's Large-Scale Rail NT Test-bed, a unique 70-ft track with controlled temperature excursions constructed at UCSD's Powell Laboratories with government and industry funding. A prototype has been constructed for wayside determination of the rail NT based on the measurement of wave nonlinearities. The experimental results obtained with the prototype in the Large-Scale Test-bed are extremely encouraging, showing an accuracy of only a few degrees for the determination of the rail NT. If confirmed in the field, this result could revolutionize the way CWR are maintained to prevent rail buckling with respect to the thermal stress management problem

Einstein@Home all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in LIGO S5 data
This paper presents results of an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the frequency range 50,1 190  Hz and with frequency derivative range of ∼-20,1.1×10superscript -10  Hz ssuperscript -1 for the fifth LIGO science run (S5). The search uses a noncoherent Hough-transform method to combine the information from coherent searches on time scales of about one day. Because these searches are very computationally intensive, they have been carried out with the Einstein@Home volunteer distributed computing project. Postprocessing identifies eight candidate signals; deeper follow-up studies rule them out. Hence, since no gravitational wave signals have been found, we report upper limits on the intrinsic gravitational wave strain amplitude hsubscript 0. For example, in the 0.5 Hz-wide band at 152.5 Hz, we can exclude the presence of signals with hsubscript 0 greater than 7.6×10superscript -25 at a 90% confidence level. This search is about a factor 3 more sensitive than the previous Einstein@Home search of early S5 LIGO data.

The role of ecological variation in driving divergence of sexual and non-sexual traits in the red-backed fairy-wren (Malurus melanocephalus)
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Many species exhibit geographic variation in sexual signals, and divergence in these traits may lead to speciation. Sexual signals may diverge due to differences in ecology if the environment constrains signal production or transmission. Alternatively, sexual signals may diverge stochastically through sexual selection or genetic drift, with little environmental influence. To distinguish between these alternatives we quantified variation in two putative sexual signals &#8211; tail length and plumage color &#8211; and a suite of non-sexual morphometric traits across the geographic range of the red-backed fairy-wren (Malurus melanocephalus). We then tested for associations between these traits and a number of environmental variables using generalized dissimilarity models.
				
				
					
						Results
					Variation in morphometric traits was explained well by environmental variation, irrespective of geographic distance between sites. Among putative signals, variation in plumage color was best explained by geographic distance, whereas tail length was best explained by environmental variation. Divergence in male plumage color was not coincident with the boundary between genetic lineages, but was greatest across a contact zone located 300&#160;km east of the genetic boundary.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Morphometric traits describing size and shape have likely been subject to ecological selection and thus appear to track local environmental variation regardless of subspecies identity. Ecological selection appears to have also influenced the evolution of tail length as a signal, but has played a limited role in shaping geographic variation in plumage color, consistent with stochastic divergence in concert with Fisherian selection on this trait. The lack of coincidence between the genetic boundary and the contact zone between plumage types suggests that the sexual plumage signal of one subspecies has introgressed into the genetic background of the other. Thus, this study provides insight into the various ways in which signal evolution may occur within a species, and the geographic patterns of signal variation that can arise, especially following secondary contact.

Manipulation of cellular DNA repair by early adenovirus proteins
After induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) functions to inhibit the cell cycle, allowing for repair of the damage. Adenovirus is a double strand DNA virus that replicates in the host cell nucleus and expresses early proteins to inactivate the DNA damage response in order to prevent the recognition of its viral genome as a cellular DSB. Adenovirus that is deleted for the E4 region cannot inactivate the DNA damage response and consequently the viral genome is recognized as DNA damage and the cellular DNA repair machinery ligates the viral genome into end-to- end concatemers. Adenovirus expresses two proteins from the E4 region E4orf3 and E4orf6 that have been demonstrated to inhibit the DNA damage response. E4orf3 mislocalizes cellular proteins to prevent their accumulation at viral replication centers during infection. The E4orf6 protein interacts with the viral protein E1b55K to mediate degradation of cellular proteins in a proteasome-dependent manner. The research presented in this thesis demonstrates that E4orf3 and E4orf6/E1b55K target specific components of the DDR, and provides insight into the consequences of targeting these components for the virus and for cells. The Mre11-Nbs1- Rad50 (MRN) complex is the main sensor of DNA damage and functions to activate the DDR and promote repair of DSBs. We show that E4orf3 mislocalization of the MRN complex prevents a DNA damage response mediated by the Ataxia- Telangiectasia Mutated Rad3 related (ATR) protein. CtIP and BLM are proteins implicated to function in the DDR and in resection of DSBs. We identified the BLM helicase as a novel target of E1b55K/E4orf6 mediated degradation during infection. We also found that CtIP is required for concatemer formation in vitro and is inhibitory to adenovirus replication. Together, the data presented in this thesis demonstrate that adenovirus infection provides an ideal model system for study of DNA damage response and repair pathways. Our studies not only provide information on the function of cellular proteins during infection, but also can yield insights into broader functions for these cellular proteins in a non-viral contex

Competition between coral and algal holobionts
Coral reefs around the world have suffered devastating losses of reef building corals with a concomitant increase in benthic algae. While it is clear that a variety of local and global disturbances play a role in the replacement of corals by algae, the mechanisms behind this transition are not. Space is limited on coral reefs, and competition between corals and benthic algae plays a major role in shaping the composition of the benthos. The objective of this dissertation was to investigate the dynamics of coral-algae competition, with a focus on how different algae affect coral physiology and their associated microbes, and how these small-scale dynamics influence the distribution of corals and algae on pristine to degraded coral reefs. I found significant differences in the composition and outcomes of coral-algae interactions across reefs; corals were consistently better competitors against crustose coralline algae (CCA), but were damaged by turf algae on inhabited but not uninhabited reefs, suggesting that competition dynamics are affected by human activity. Physiological investigations of coral interactions with four common types of benthic algae (CCA, calcareous macroalgae, fleshy macroalgae, and turf algae) demonstrated that all algae except CCA cause net heterotrophy and disruption of coral tissue and pigments along the interaction border. These effects were negated by antibiotics, indicating that disruption of coral health during algal competition is mediated by microbes. These same algae were found to harbor highly diverse bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities, but their competitive interfaces with corals hosted a community of microbes distinct from either side. Turf algae borders had a large proportion of potential pathogens, while fleshy macroalgae led to an increase of bacterial carbohydrate utilization metabolisms. This suggests that turf and fleshy macroalgae compete with corals by stimulating bacterial growth and respiration and promoting the invasion of opportunistic pathogens on corals, leading to coral mortality and freeing space for the alga. This dynamic appears to be amplified by human disturbances such as overfishing and eutrophication, which remove the top-down and bottom-up controls on algae

The Kinetochore Protein Mif2p is Targeted by Cdk1p and Development of a Selection for Regulators of Centromere/Kinetochore Structure/Function
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Kinetochore Protein Mif2p is Targeted by Cdk1p and Development of a Selection for Regulators of Centromere/Kinetochore Structure/FunctionbyIsha Kimisha WallaceDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Cell, Molecular and Developmental BiologyUniversity of California, Riverside, March 2010Dr. Jeffrey Bachant, ChairpersonChromosome segregation is a critical determinant of cell survival and genome stability.  Defects in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer cells.  Kinetochores, built specifically on a unique centromeric region on each chromosome, are large protein complexes that mediate chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle.  Interactions between kinetochores and spindle microtubules power chromosome movements during chromosome segregation.  Kinetochore-spindle interactions are also monitored by checkpoint and error correction pathways that ensure replicated chromosomes attach and align on the spindle properly.  Genetic screens and biochemical assays have revealed that in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the kinetochore is comprised of 80+ proteins grouped into several subcomplexes.  Collectively, these proteins function together to assemble the kinetochore, to mediate chromosome attachment and force generation, and to control spindle checkpoints.  The central focus of the work in this dissertation is the conserved, essential kinetochore protein Mif2p, which is homologous to the mammalian protein CENP-C.  Previous studies suggest that Mif2p may help build the foundation of the kinetochore and serve as a linker between inner and central kinetochore complexes.  Here, we describe a novel Cdk1p-dependent phosphorylation event on Mif2p; Cdk1p is the master cell cycle regulatory kinase that catalyzes entry into and progression through mitosis.  My evidence that Mif2p is a novel Cdk1p substrate includes the following observations:  (1) Mif2p displays an electrophoretic mobility shift on western blots that can be collapsed with phosphatase treatment.  This indicates that the electrophoretic mobility shift represents a phosphorylated Mif2p species; (2) the Mif2p phosphorylation shift is cell cycle regulated and coincides with periods in which mitotic forms of Cdk1p are known to be active; (3) the Mif2p phosphorylation shift is dependent on Cdk1p activity.  The mutant Cdk1p alleles cdc28-4 and cdc28-1N, and inhibition of the analogue-sensitive cdc28-as1 allele, all abolished the Mif2p phosphorylation shift observed on western blots; (4) mutation of the six Cdk1p consensus phosphorylation sites in Mif2p to non-phosphorylatable alanine residues abolished the phosphorylation shift as well; and (5) a Mif2 peptide containing five of the six Cdk1p consensus phosphorylation sites can serve as in vitro substrate of Clb2-Cdk1.    Interestingly, I observed that interactions between the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex and spindle microtubules are required for Cdk1p to target Mif2p.  In the context of previous observations, this leads me to hypothesize that Cdk1p targeting of Mif2p may be part of a regulatory mechanism that converts initial interactions between kinetochores and microtubules into stable, end-on attachments. The secondary focus of the work presented here is the development of a genetic selection for factors influencing centromere/kinetochore chromatin structure.  This strategy is conceptually distinct from the genetic approaches used to identify most other kinetochore proteins, which have relied on chromosome loss as a primary screening criterion. To accomplish this, I describe the modification a technique, originally developed by Phil Hieter and colleagues, called the centromere transcription read-through assay.  In this assay, a centromere is placed between the strongly inducible GAL promoter and a LacZ reporter gene.  In the presence of galactose, the centromere/kinetochore protein complex impedes LacZ transcription.  In contrast, mutants defective in centromere/kinetochore structure allow increased LacZ expression.  We have modified this assay by replacing LacZ with yeast nutritional markers, permitting selection of strains that allow transcription through the centromere region. Thus, the rationale is that by selecting for a centromere transcription read-though phenotype one can potentially identify a broad range of factors that are controlling centromere chromatin structure and function.  I describe my success in establishing this assay as a genetic selection technique as well as some problems I encountered.  Potential strategies to overcome these problems and move forward in implementing this promising approach will also be discussed.  Unexpectedly, this approach also revealed a possible epigenetic aspect to centromere specification.   While epigenetics plays a well-defined role in the specification of centromeres of higher eukaryotes, there is only limited evidence to suggest that budding yeast centromere specification also involves an epigenetic aspect.

Systematic Identification of Cellular Regulators of Gammaherpesvirus Lytic Replication
Gammaherpesviruses are clinically important human pathogens associated with multiple types of tumors.  The life cycle of gammaherpesviruses consists of two distinct phases, latency and lytic replication, both of which are important for the viral-associated pathogenesis.  Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) has been used as a model to study virus-host interactions of human gammaherpesviruses because of its genomic and biological similarities.  During the course of MHV-68 lytic infection, the virus is highly dependent on cellular machinery to facilitate its replication.  Host cells, on the other hand, develop mechanisms to sense and restrict virus replication.  Here, we present an integrative systems approach to elucidate the interactions between MHV-68 and its host.  Our previous yeast-two-hybrid analysis and genome-wide expression profiling implicated hundreds of cellular factors mediating virus-host interactions.  Among the cellular factors identified, those involved in kinase- and transcription factor- regulated signaling are the most highly enriched.  Therefore, high-throughput screens of cellular kinome and transcription factors cDNA and siRNA libraries were carried out, which uncovered 125 MHV-68 dependency factors and 213 restriction factors.  We found that many cellular factors affect MHV-68 replication by regulating RTA transcription.  Characterization of this subset of genes showed they also play roles in KSHV latency maintenance and reactivation.  Furthermore, cellular factors regulating later steps of viral replication, such as viral late gene expression and egress, were also identified and validated.  Finally we compared the viral restriction factors to the results of a kinome siRNA screen designed to identify cellular regulators of innate immune response to cytosolic DNA.  Remarkably, 23 genes were found among the top 10% of the hits of both screens.  The MHV-68 restriction factor RIOK3 was confirmed to play a role in IRF3 activation and type I interferon induction mediated by both cytosolic DNA and RNA.  RIOK3 is required for cellular antiviral response to both DNA virus (MHV-68) and RNA virus (Influenza A), suggesting a central role in innate immunity.  Further analysis revealed that RIOK3 complexes with TBK1 and IRF3, bridging the activity between the two.  Collectively, this multilayered approach unfolded a comprehensive map of gammaherpesvirus-host interactions which will provide basis for developing new anti-viral therapies.

Symmetry and Feature Selection in Computer Vision
In the dissertation, two advanced computer vision techniques, named symmetry and feature selection, are proposed. The wide existence of symmetry in many image objects generates the motivation of using symmetry as a high level feature in region growing image segmentation and region-of-interest (ROI) detection in brain MRI sequences. The symmetry is explicitly applied in different forms as symmetry affinity matrix, high-level segmentation cue, statistical analysis and 3D asymmetry volume in classification features. The incorporation of symmetry provides a new effective feature to achieve the performance improvement. In the second field of my research, the feature selection with Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) as the search strategy, and with the Bayesian classifier as the evaluation metric, is applied in content-based image retrieval (CBIR), semi-supervised learning with relevance feedback, local kernel based distance metric, image classification, and online ensemble learning. It provides more compact and optimal feature sets to generate robust learning models. Experimental results on wide range of image datasets indicate the advantages of using symmetry and feature selection in computer vision tasks.

Activation of the retina's regenerative potential by embryonic stem cell-derived microvesicles
Retinal degenerative diseases are a leading cause of irreversible blindness.  While the retina of amphibians and birds has a remarkable capacity for near complete regeneration - Muller cells now recognized as the likely source of this regeneration - no spontaneous regeneration has been observed in the mammalian retina.  Therapies to augment retinal repair could improve the quality of life of millions of individuals.  In my studies, I examined the possibility of augmenting the retina's endogenous regenerative capacity using embryonic stem cell-derived microvesicles (ESMVs) released by embryonic stem cells (ESCs). I found that ESMVs contain multiple mRNAs encoding the core transcription factors known to induce pluripotency in somatic cells and microRNAs of the 290 cluster, pivotal in the control of the ESC-specific cell cycle.  In vitro, I demonstrated that ESMVs selectively transfer their mRNA and microRNA cargo to human Muller cells and induce in them morphological, mRNA, and microRNA expression changes.  I observed upregulation of mRNAs involved in induction and maintenance  of stem cell pluripotency, early ocular genes, and genes important for retinal protection and remodeling, as well as downregulation of inhibitory and scar-related genes; and upregulation of microRNAs promoting pluripotency and cell proliferation and downregulation of those involved in differentiation and cell cycle arrest.  Moreover, a subset of the ESMV-treated Muller cells expressed markers of amacrine, ganglion, and rod photoreceptor cells.   These results suggested that ESMVs induce dedifferentiation  of Muller cells to a stem cell phenotype and differentiation towards other retinal lineages.  I then conducted preliminary studies on the ability of ESMVs to augment retinal regeneration in vivo, injecting ESMVs into mouse retinas damaged with NMDA.  I observed many proliferating cells in ESMV-treated and none in non-treated retinas.  The majority of these cells expressed the Muller cell marker CRALBP, and a subset of them, the amacrine neuronal markers Syntaxin 1a and GAD67.   ERGs demonstrated functional improvement in several ESMV-treated retinas.  My findings suggest that ESMVs may have the potential to augment retinal endogenous regenerative capacity.  Further studies of the effects of ESMVs on the regeneration of damaged retinas may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches for retinal degenerations.

Identification of new RNA substrates for the NMD and exosome RNA surveillance pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Using the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model system, we utilized Affymetrix tiling arrays to globally investigate novel targets of the nonsense mediated decay pathway. The research that has been presented in the first chapter of this dissertation is centered around the investigation of extended transcripts and the degradation pathways that contribute to its rapid turnover in yeast cells. This work was published in the online version of the journal, PLoS Genetics. The work that is presented in the second chapter is based on our findings that intron-retained or unspliced RNAs are markedly stabilized in NMD mutant strains which led us to conclude the widespread impact of the nonsense mediated decay pathway in the degradation of unspliced RNAs. We further expanded our work and showed that introns emanating from NMD-sensitive loci can elicit an NMD-sensitive phenotype in trans, which led us to conclude that the intron (intronic sequences) are necessary for proper NMD-targeting. We further discovered that sequences located within the 5'SS as well as the branchpoint (BP) are responsible in part for the generation of unspliced/inefficiently spliced transcripts. Lastly, we showed that amino acid starvation results in a transient inhibition of nuclear splicing resulting in hyperaccumulation of unspliced transcripts. Under this condition, we elucidated a stress-specific role for the NMD pathway in rapidly targeting and degrading these unspliced transcripts. The results that have been presented in the second chapter of this dissertation have been published in the Molecular Cell journal (August 8th, 2008 issue). The third chapter (part) of this dissertation explores themes that have directly evolved from the first part. Specifically, the second part has shown that there are more complex routes for the degradation for unspliced transcripts besides the NMD pathway. In particular, synergistic modes of degradation involving components of the nuclear exosome and factors involved in NMD function to limit and hence degrade these unspliced transcripts. Decay measurements were undertaken to show that there are unspliced RNAs whose degradation mode depends on a synergistic mode of degradation requiring both the nuclear exosome component, Rrp6p and the NMD factor, Upf1p. Conversely, we found a class of unspliced transcripts whose turnover relies largely on the action of the NMD pathway and not on synergistic degradation. We further expanded our research and showed that inactivation of an essential, conserved, yeast RNA export factor, Mex67p, results in the nuclear sequestration and degradation of normally cytoplasmically degraded unspliced transcripts. This result highlighted the generic features of RNA degradation and has shown that temporal changes (such as malfunction of proper nuclear-to-cytoplasmic RNA trafficking) cause spatial redistribution and degradation of the unspliced RNA. We have also shown that the nuclear periphery factor, Mlp1p, could have a potential role in the retention of nuclear-degraded unspliced RNA. Deletion of this factor led to an increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of the unspliced RNA which was then degraded by the NMD pathway.

Taxonomy, Phylogenetics, Comparative Morphology and Evolution of Assassin Bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) With Emphasis on Harpactorinae and Peiratinae
The current dissertation project integrates revisionary taxonomy, comparative morphology, molecular phylogenetics and comparative evolutionary analyses to investigate the diversity and evolution of assassin bugs, focusing on the Malagasy Bekilya group (Peiratinae) and the New World Harpactorini (Harpactorinae). Four objectives and research topics are addressed. (1) Association of dimorphic sexes in the Bekilya group and taxonomic revisions. Members of three genera of Malagasy Peiratinae, Bekilya Villiers, Hovacoris Villiers, and Mutillocoris Villiers, appear to be mimics of mutillid wasps. Mutillocoris was originally described only from female specimens, the two remaining genera from males. Molecular data demonstrate that species of Mutillocoris represent females of Bekilya and Hovacoris. Mutillocoris is therefore synonymized with Bekilya. The current project treats a total of 10 species as belonging to the Bekilya group, including 6 species that are described as new. (2) Investigation of the taxonomic distribution of sticky glands. Specialized glands have been known from species of Zelus Fabricius for more than 50 years. The current study examines 67 taxa of Reduviidae and finds sticky glands in 12 genera of Harpactorini. (3) Reconstruct a molecular phylogeny of Harpactorini and investigate the evolution of sticky trap predation and its relationship to accelerated morphological diversification. A molecular phylogeny of the Harpactorini is presented, sampling 198 taxa of Harpactorini and using 5 genes. Comparative analyses show that bugs exhibiting sticky trap predation have evolved more slender and longer fore femora than non-sticky bugs. Using phylogenetically independent contrast analyses, correlated evolution between femoral thickness and length is documented, thus providing support for the existence of a functional constraint on the fore femur and a trade-off between femoral thickness and length. It is argued that the novel sticky trap predation strategy may allow sticky bugs to alleviate functional constraints on the fore femur and thus to attain a higher rate of fore leg evolution than other Harpactorini or Reduviidae. (4) Taxonomic revision of Zelus Fabricius, 1803. The harpactorine genus Zelus is revised based on examination of 11,000 specimens, recognizing 70 species as valid. Twenty-four new species are described, 13 new synonymies proposed, and 5 previously synonymized names are returned to species status. Additionally, eight species that were previously treated as Zelus are removed from this genus.

Statistical Analysis for On-Chip Power Grid Networks and Interconnects Considering Process Variation
With the aggressive scaling down of semiconductor VLSI devicesfrom 65nm to 45 nm, 32nm, the process induced variability becomesthe major design concern. The fundamental change in VLSI chipdesign in current and future nodes is that what has been designedwill not agree with the products manufactured due to theuncertainties in the manufacture processes. Even worse, thevariabilities keep growing as the technology scales downcontinually. The process induced variations manifest themselvesfrom wafer to wafer, die-to-die and device to device within a die.Some are systematic variabilities and some are randomvariabilities, which have to leave extra margin for worst case.The Monte Carlo method can come to the rescue by simulating theprobability of the worst case in a random way. However, it is wellknown this approach is very time consuming and forbidding slow. Itis highly desirable to have more efficient statistical modelingand simulation techniques and tools to guide the design in thepresence of uncertainties in the nanometer VLSI regime.In this dissertation, the influence of the  variability, such asthreshold voltage variation, interconnect wire height, widthvariation, on the performance of power grid delivery networks andsignal interconnect circuits, are studied. First we develop a newstatistical method, which is based on concept of Hermite polynomialchaos, to analyze power grid voltage drop variations of on-chippower grid networks. The new approach considers both wirevariations and sub-threshold leakage current variations, which aremodeled as lognormal distribution random variables. We alsoconsider spacial correlation of the leakage variables by applyingorthogonal decomposition to map the correlated random variablesinto independent ones before the analysis.  Second, we propose amore efficient statistical analysis approach, StoEKS, in which theextended Krylov subspace method is used to speedup the solutionprocedure of the variational circuit equations. By using the modelorder reduction technique, StoEKS partially mitigates circuit-sizeincreasing problem associated with the augmented matrices from theGalerkin-based spectral statistical method. Finally, we propose anefficient method to calculate variational interconnect delay,which is a crucial step in the statistical static timinganalysis(SSTA). We apply Numerical quadrature method based onorthogonal polynomial representation (OPR) of statisticalvariations  to derive the non-linear, non-Gaussian analyticinterconnect delay models in terms of the interconnect wire width,height variations. It can take in variational parameters in OPRform and outputs the delays computed in OPR form again, which iscompatible with existing SSTA methods.

Optimized Structures for Low-Profile Phase Change Thermal Spreaders
Thin, low-profile phase change thermal spreaders can provide cooling solutions for some of today's most pressing heat flux dissipation issues.  These thermal issues are only expected to increase as future electronic circuitry requirements lead to denser and potentially 3D chip packaging.  Phase change based heat spreaders, such as heat pipes or vapor chambers, can provide a practical solution for effectively dissipating large heat fluxes.  This thesis reports a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art capillary pumped wick structures using computational modeling, micro wick fabrication, and experimental analysis. Modeling efforts focus on predicting the shape of the liquid meniscus inside a complicated 3D wick structure.  It is shown that this liquid shape can drastically affect the wick's thermal resistance.  In addition, knowledge of the liquid meniscus shape allows for the computation of key parameters such as permeability and capillary pressure which are necessary for predicting the maximum heat flux.  After the model is validated by comparison to experimental results, the wick structure is optimized so as to decrease overall wick thermal resistance and increase the maximum capillary limited heat flux before dryout.  The optimized structures are then fabricated out of both silicon and copper using both traditional and novel micro-fabrication techniques.  The wicks are made super-hydrophilic using chemical and thermal oxidation schemes.  A sintered monolayer of Cu particles is fabricated and analyzed as well.The fabricated wick structures are experimentally tested for their heat transfer performance inside a well controlled copper vacuum chamber.  Heat fluxes as high as 170 W/cm2 are realized for Cu wicks with structure heights of 100 &#956;m.  The structures optimized for both minimized thermal resistance and high liquid supply ability perform much better than their non-optimized counterparts.  The super-hydrophilic oxidation scheme is found to drastically increase the maximum heat flux and decrease thermal resistance. This research provides key insights as to how to optimize heat pipe structures to minimize thermal resistance and increase maximum heat flux.  These thin wick structures can also be combined with a thicker liquid supply layer so that thin, low-resistance evaporator layers can be constructed and higher heat fluxes realized.  The work presented in this thesis can be used to aid in the development of high-performance phase change thermal spreaders, allowing for temperature control of a variety of powerful electronic components.

Impact of Psychological Research on Moral Theory: Prospect Theory and the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing
It is widely acknowledged that Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's Prospect Theory offers a better explanation of our decision making under uncertainty than some of the most widely accepted theories to-date, including especially Expected Utility Theory. I give a sympathetic summary of the case against Expected Utility Theory, but then show how Prospect Theory has not demonstrated that it can give a better explanation of our moral decision making under uncertainty (contrary, e.g., to the claims of Tamara Horowitz). In particular, it has not been demonstrated that it can give a better explanation of our intuitions in hard cases, such as the much discussed Trolley Car cases concocted by Philippa Foot and developed by her and Warren Quinn, among other contemporary moral philosophers concerned with issues often studied by both Expected Utility Theory and Prospect Theory. Prospect Theory has a weakness in common with Expected Utility Theory, namely, both are too focused on the consequences of our actions. In this respect, Prospect Theory is a consequentialist theory of moral decision making, and I bring out Prospect Theory's limitations by exploring the work of Foot's and Quinn's non-consequentialist theorizing in this context, with special emphasis on the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, and related principles like the Doctrine of Double Effect.

Role of Rhizobium endoglucanase CelC2 in cellulose biosynthesis and biofilm formation on plant roots and abiotic surfaces
Abstract


Background
The synthesis of cellulose is among the most important but poorly understood biochemical processes, especially in bacteria, due to its complexity and high degree of regulation. In this study, we analyzed both the production of cellulose by all known members of the Rhizobiaceae and the diversity of Rhizobium celABC operon predicted to be involved in cellulose biosynthesis. We also investigated the involvement in cellulose production and biofilm formation of celC gene encoding an endoglucanase (CelC2) that is required for canonical symbiotic root hair infection by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii.


Results
ANU843 celC mutants lacking (ANU843&#916;C2) or overproducing cellulase (ANU843C2+) produced greatly increased or reduced amounts of external cellulose micro fibrils, respectively. Calcofluor-stained cellulose micro fibrils were considerably longer when formed by ANU843&#916;C2 bacteria rather than by the wild-type strain, in correlation with a significant increase in their flocculation in batch culture. In contrast, neither calcofluor-stained extracellular micro fibrils nor flocculation was detectable in ANU843C2+ cells. To clarify the role of cellulose synthesis in Rhizobium cell aggregation and attachment, we analyzed the ability of these mutants to produce biofilms on different surfaces. Alteration of wild-type CelC2 levels resulted in a reduced ability of bacteria to form biofilms both in abiotic surfaces and in planta.


Conclusions
Our results support a key role of the CelC2 cellulase in cellulose biosynthesis by modulating the length of the cellulose fibrils that mediate firm adhesion among Rhizobium bacteria leading to biofilm formation. Rhizobium cellulose is an essential component of the biofilm polysaccharidic matrix architecture and either an excess or a defect of this &#8220;building material&#8221; seem to collapse the biofilm structure. These results position cellulose hydrolytic enzymes as excellent anti-biofilm candidates.

Separation of cancer cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using pH control and dielectrophoresis
The ability to identify, characterize and isolate cancer cell subpopulations from a global cell population is important and fundamental for effective cancer diagnostic treatments. Cells that have shed from a primary tumor site at early stages of malignant progression and then enter the blood circulation are called circulating tumor cells (CTC). Although only a small percentage of CTC survive (roughly 0.05%), the detection of these cells provides an excellent indicator of metastatic primary tumor sites. The necessity for effective measurement of CTC requires engineering a standardized detection method capable of processing whole blood samples. An alternative method to cell selection is the alternating current (AC) electrokinetic technique, dielectrophoresis (DEP), which employs the use of alternating current (AC) fields to separate cells. Previous studies have confirmed the diagnostic ability of identification and separation of live cells from dead ones using DEP. A novel approach utilized to kill explicit cell lines in order to perform DEP separations of live and dead cells, employs a developed theory that tumor microenvironments are more acidic than normal microenvironments. By combining the selection of cancer cells from normal cells through pH control and subsequently separating these cells using dielectrophoresis an effective circulating tumor cell detection system can be produced

A Car-Following Theory for Multiphase Vehicular Traffic Flow
We present in this paper a new car-following theory that can reproduce both the so-called capacity drop and traffic hysteresis, two prominent features of multiphase vehicular traffic flow. This is achieved through the introduction of a single variable, driver response time, that depends on both vehicle spacing and traffic phase. By specifying different functional forms of response time, one can obtain not only brand new theories but also some of the well-known old car-following theories, which is demonstrated in this paper through both theoretical analyses and numerical simulation.

Cell-Sheet Technology: A Novel Method To Enhance Bone-Implant Integration
Although dental implants have become a standard treatment procedure, there is still a growing demand to enhance their osseointegration capability to address complex cases, such as host sites with bone grafts and type IV bone. This study explored the viability and effectiveness of pre-osseointegrated implants to achieve faster establishment of bone-implant integration using cell sheet technology. Cells harvested from the rat bone marrow were cultured on a poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) culture dish. Taking advantage of the ability of temperature responsive conversion of the dish from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, the layer of the grown cells was detached as a sheet. For in-vitro experiments, the cell sheet (single or double layered) was transferred to acid-etched titanium disks and examined for its capability to show cell metabolic activity, osteoblastic phenotypes and responsiveness to an osteogenic enhancer molecule, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). For in vivo study, the experimental titanium implants (1 mm in diameter and 2 mm in length) were coated with the cell sheet and placed into rat femurs. After 2 weeks of healing, the implants were subjected to the biomechanical push-in test to evaluate the strength of bone-implant integration. Cell sheet grown on temperature sensitive dishes showed the expected cell metabolic activity levels and osteoblastic phenotypes of cells grown on regular culture dishes. Cell sheets, created from bone marrow cells, were successfully transferred as an intact sheet, to titanium disks and showed the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Double layers of the sheets showed 2-fold greater cell metabolic activity than single layered ones. The cell sheets treated with NAC showed significantly greater ALP activity in a NAC dose-dependent manner. The cell sheet-coated implants showed a 2.2-fold greater push-in value than uncoated implants. This is the first study that has established an osteogenic cell sheet applicable to titanium implants. Transferred cell sheets to titanium surfaces are capable to show reliable osteogenic phenotypes and to accelerate the bone-titanium integration, can be enhanced by foreign molecules and show increased cell metabolic activity levels depending on the number of layers of cell sheets transferred.

Synthesis of Donor Ligands and Their Applications in Catalysis
The discovery of new transition metal mediated homogeneous catalytic reactions, and the improvement of known reactions is oftentimes attributable to changes made to the ancillary ligands bound to a metal center.  In the last decades stable carbenes have been recognized as powerful tools for the creation of organometallic complexes which exhibit dramatic increases in activity and stability over analogous complexes featuring tertiary phosphine ligands.  The discovery and development of new classes of carbenes has even given rise to new classes of catalytic reactions.This work is centered on the development of mono amino carbenes which feature a ferrocene directly bound to the carbene center.  Indeed, the first aminoferrocenyl carbene has been synthesized.  Since acyclic carbenes oftentimes are less stable than their cyclic counterparts, we have targeted cyclic aminoferrocenylcarbenes.	The second portion of this work deals with the study of the deprotonation of isothiazolium salts and the resulting products, 2-amino-thietes.  Reactivity of the thietes with amines and lithium amides is reported.Our group has been active in reporting new families of carbon-based donor ligands.  The last part of this work deals with taking ligands developed in our group, namely cyclic bent allenes and abnormal carbenes, and finding applications for them in homogeneous catalysis.  This has necessitated the modification of these donor ligands, both sterically and electronically, in order to find more active catalysts.  The first palladium and ruthenium complexes of cyclic bent allenes have been prepared.  Grubbs style ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst bearing abnormal carbenes have been developed and their reactivity is described herein.

Formation of appropriate synapses in the nervous system of the medicinal leech
The ability of complex organisms to sense their environment, make decisions, and behave appropriately relies upon the synaptic connections within their nervous systems. Developmentally, neurons reliably form predictable connections onto other neurons. My work examined how neurons choose their specific synaptic partners. We chose the leech to study the developmental formation of synapses based on its simple nervous system, identified neurons, characterized neuronal development, and known behavioral circuitry. Chapter 2 demonstrates that electrical synaptic connections are required prior to chemical synaptogenesis to permit the development of appropriate chemical synapses between neurons. We used RNA interference in single embryonic neurons to transiently decrease the mRNA of innexin-1, a component of electrical synapses in the leech CNS. Pressure-mechanosensory (P) cells treated in this manner failed to form a normal chemical synaptic connection onto a known post-synaptic partner, the Anterior Pagoda (AP) cell. Each of the four P cells in a midbody ganglion transduces sensory information from a quadrant of the leech's body wall and through chemical synapses with 24 interneurons mediates an avoidance behavior called a local bend. Disrupting the expression of electrical synapses in a single P ablated the behavioral response to stimuli within that P cell's receptive field. Treated P cells transduced sensory input, but failed to transmit that information to postsynaptic neurons. Chapter 3 describes a novel technique to study motor neuron development in leech embryos. Somata of most leech motor neurons lie on the dorsal surface of each ganglion, facing the interior of the animal. Thus, following the development of motor neurons over time requires that embryos must be dissected, embedded in agarose, and maintained in organotypic culture. This technique allowed us to keep embryos healthy many days longer than previously reported, revealing to us that the RNA interference method of the previous chapter was effective in motor neurons, as well as in sensory neurons. Chapter 4, reports how transplanting peripheral target tissues affected the morphology and central synaptic connections of developing motor neurons. After transplanting pieces of body wall either ectopically or eutopically, we determined how the presence of this altered peripheral tissue affected neuronal development

A Conceptual Model of Sedimentation in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta
Sedimentation in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta builds the Delta landscape, creates benthic and pelagic habitat, and transports sediment-associated contaminants. Here we present a conceptual model of sedimentation that includes submodels for river supply from the watershed to the Delta, regional transport within the Delta and seaward exchange, and local sedimentation in open water and marsh habitats. The model demonstrates feedback loops that affect the Delta ecosystem. Submerged and emergent marsh vegetation act as ecosystem engineers that can create a positive feedback loop by decreasing suspended sediment, increasing water column light, which in turn enables more vegetation. Sea-level rise in open water is partially countered by a negative feedback loop that increases deposition if there is a net decrease in hydrodynamic energy. Manipulation of regional sediment transport is probably the most feasible method to control suspended sediment and thus turbidity. The conceptual model is used to identify information gaps that need to be filled to develop an accurate sediment transport model.

Development of a population suppression strain of the human malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Transgenic mosquito strains are being developed to contribute to the control of dengue and malaria transmission. One approach uses genetic manipulation to confer conditional, female-specific dominant lethality phenotypes. Engineering of a female-specific flightless phenotype provides a sexing mechanism essential for male-only mosquito, release approaches that result in population suppression of target vector species.
				
				
					
						Methods
					An approach that uses a female-specific gene promoter and antibiotic-repressible lethal factor to produce a sex-specific flightless phenotype was adapted to the human malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi. Transposon- and site-specific recombination-mediated technologies were used to generate a number of transgenic An. stephensi lines that when combined through mating produced the phenotype of flight-inhibited females and flight-capable males.
				
				
					
						Results
					The data shown here demonstrate the successful engineering of a female-specific flightless phenotype in a malaria vector. The flightless phenotype was repressible by the addition of tetracycline to the larval diet. This conditional phenotype allows the rearing of the strains under routine laboratory conditions. The minimal level of tetracycline that rescues the flightless phenotype is higher than that found as an environmental contaminant in circumstances where there is intensive use of antibiotics.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These studies support the further development of flightless female technology for applications in malaria control programmes that target the vectors.

Tailored charged particle beams from single-component plasmas
There are currently many uses of positrons as well as a strong potential for novel applications on the horizon. Due to the scarce nature of antimatter, positron research and technology is frequently limited by the ability to collect, confine, and manipulate antiparticles. Trapping large numbers of positrons as nonneutral plasmas has proven ideal in this endeavor. This thesis focuses on exploiting the attractive properties of single-component positron plasmas to develop new tools for antimatter research. A Penning-Malmberg trap is used to confine single component electron (used for increased data rate) plasmas. The trap consists of a cylindrical electrode structure, centered in the bore of a superconducting magnet. The superconducting magnet supplies a uniform 5 tesla field that provides radial confinement, while voltages applied to both ends of the electrode structure confine the plasma axially. The trap exhibits long confinement times (̃ days) and low plasma temperatures (T < 20 meV). The focus of this thesis is the development of a nondestructive technique to create narrow beams with narrow energy spreads and transverse spatial widths from single-component plasmas in a Penning-Malmberg trap. This technique is valuable for effectively and efficiently utilizing trapped positrons. Beams are extracted by carefully lowering the confining trap potential on one end to some extraction voltage. Due to the plasma space charge, beam pulses (Deltat < 10 musec) emerge from near the plasma center with radii as small as Rhob = 2lambaD (HW 1/e, and energy spreads DeltaE ̃ T. Through cyclotron radiation and the rotating wall, the plasma temperature and density is tailored such that beams are narrow (Rhob = 2lambaD) and (DeltaE ̃ T) cold, resulting in quality beams of a low emittance. A simple nonlinear model is used to derive equations predicting a wide range of beam properties from only the plasma parameters and the extraction voltage. An expression is first derived for the radial profile of the beam Sigmab (r). A relation for the total number of escaping particles as a function of the extraction voltage is developed. From this expression, the full energy distribution of the beam is obtained, as a function of the kinetic energies in direction parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The equations are generically written in terms of the scaled beam number, extraction voltage, and electrode radius, only. The resulting expressions are verified experimentally over a wide range of beam number and electrode radius. General trends in the RMS energy spread of the beams DeltaE are discussed. The extraction of more than 50 % of a trapped plasma into a train of nearly identical beams is demonstrated. The techniques described above result in beams in a high (e.g., several tesla) magnetic field. However for many applications, such as atomic-physics scattering experiments and the creation of microbeams by electrostatic focusing and remoderation, beams in a magnetic-field free region are desired. For these applications, a technique is described to create high- quality electrostatic beams by extracting the initial beam from the confining magnetic guide field. The beam is first adiabatically transferred to a low field region, then brought through a magnetic shield to a region of zero field by means of a nonadiabatic fast extraction. Once in this zero field region, the beam is focused to smaller transverse dimensions using an electrostatic (Einzel) lens. This technique is shown to produce quality electrostatic beams in an efficient and reproducible way. Potential applications and the possibilities for further advances in magnetically guided and electrostatic beams are discussed. Finally, results of RW compression in low fields (B=2 T) are briefly reported. Difficulties encountered while operating the RW in low fields (e.g., B=2 T) are presented and discussed

Geophysical Constraints on Sediment Dispersal Systems
Geophysical and geological approaches were employed to understand sediment dispersal systems and their response to various forcing functions (i.e., sea level member marine environments were studied; one with high precipitation and sediment discharge (Gulf of Papua, Papua New Guinea) and the other with low precipitation and sediment discharge (Oceanside Littoral Cell). The high-sedimentation rate in the Margins Source-to-Sink (S2S) program, we acquired CHIRP and core data across the GoP continental shelf that complemented onshore and offshore research in the region. CHIRP seismic data imaged three Holocene sedimentary lobes. The older Central lobe is downlapped by two younger lobes to the north and south. Sediment analysis showed that the older Central lobe has an elemental signature similar to the younger Northern lobe with both sourced from the Purari River watershed and lobe migration appears to be climatically controlled. The Southern lobe has elemental signatures more consistent with the Fly River watershed. Our results suggest the northern rivers began depositing sediments on the shelf during the Holocene sea level rise in the central region of the GoP and migrated abruptly north at ~2 kybp. Conversely, during the early Holocene transgression, sediments in the Fly drainage system were sequestered onshore infilling accommodation created in the large low-relief coastal plain during the sea level rise. Upon infilling the onshore accommodation, the Fly River delivered sediment to the ocean and formed the Southern lobe. Such differences in onshore storage capacity may introduce a lag between low-gradient rivers (Type I) with a large coastal plain versus high-gradient river systems (Type II) with small coastal plains.
      The second study site is in the sediment-starved Oceanside Littoral Cell (OCL) of Southern California. Terrestrial Laser scanning was performed seasonally using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology to perform time series modeling of sea cliff erosion. We established a repeatable and reliable protocol for efficiently conducting coastal sea cliff mapping. Changes in geomorphology were quantified to determine the forcing mechanisms controlling erosion. Results from our investigations provide insight into “hot spots” of erosion along the coast and the controlling processes. Subaerialand marine erosion are predominantly controlled by precipitation and wave energy, respectively. Beach elevation, a seasonally dependent variable, is the most important physical factor controlling whether a sea cliff is vulnerable to marine-based or subaerial erosion. Due to the heavy coastal development and important state revenue from beach tourism, it is critical to continue this type of time series research to understand fully these relationships. This study provides a baseline from which future change due to the rapid sea level rise (>3 mm/yr) and climate change can be assessed.

Earthquake Nucleation on Geometrically Complex Faults
We have employed numerical approaches to study earthquake nucleation on geometrically complex faults governed by either slip-dependent friction or rate- and state- dependent friction. The interactions of fault friction, complex fault geometry and remote slow stressing from plate tectonics are investigated. In particular, we focus on characterizing three important physical aspects of an earthquake: the occurrence time, hypocenter location and earthquake source dimensions. Using a slip dependent friction law, we have investigated earthquake nucleation on both thrust and normal dip-slip faults with changes in dip (bends) at depth. Our results show that earthquakes tend to nucleate at shallower depth on thrust faults as compared to those on normal faults with the same geometry. Nucleation time increases significantly as the fault plane are bent more severe for both thrust and normal faults. Using the rate- and state-dependent friction, we studied nucleation on two parallel planar faults with step-over features. We focus on investigating how nucleation is affected by the offset between the two faults. We found that for faults with compressional step-overs, earthquakes tend to nucleate the end of the overlapping zone when the offset is small, but generally nucleate further away from the overlapping end as the offset becomes larger. For faults with extensional step-overs, nucleation always occurs near the overlapping end for all the offsets considered. Our studies provide better understanding of the effects of fault geometry on earthquake nucleation and form a basis for the study of nucleation on large scale geometrically complex fault systems such as fault systems in Southern California. Our results may also provide realistic earthquake source conditions for rupture dynamics studies which at present largely employ ad hoc source conditions.

Effect of a Holliday junction binding peptide, wrwycr, in human cells
Cancer is a life threatening disease characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Extensive research in the field for the last fifty years led to the discovery of diverse classes of drugs called chemotherapeutics. The mode of action of many of these drugs exploits the fact that cancer cells replicate much faster than normal cells. Different classes of drugs target different proteins in the DNA replication and repair pathways and kill cells by interfering with these indispensable life processes. Two major obstacles to successful cancer chemotherapy are the significant cytotoxicity of the chemicals to normal cells and the high probability of resistance. Combination therapies, in which two or more different drugs are used, may help avoid both these problems. In this study I investigated the effects of a hexapeptide molecule (sequence wrwycr) in cancer cells versus normal cells with particular emphasis on the cytotoxicity of the peptide, and DNA damage resulting from exposure. Peptide wrwycr was originally isolated in our laboratory in a combinatorial peptide library screen for inhibitors of phage lambda site-specific recombination. Subsequently it was discovered that the peptide stabilizes a transient DNA intermediate, the Holliday junction (HJ) generated in the process of recombination and disrupts the equilibrium of the reaction. Extensive in vitro and ex vivo characterization of the peptide has revealed that it belongs to the class of broad spectrum antibacterial that induces its bactericidal effect via DNA damage. Since HJs (and other branched DNA substrates) are produced in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, I tested the effects of wrwycr on human cells by studying two cancer cell lines, U2OS, HeLa and a non-cancerous lung fibroblast, IMR-90 as a control. This is a preliminary step towards exploring the anticancer potential of this peptide. Our results indicate that the effect of wrwycr in cultured human cells is cell- type dependent. Like natural, cationic, hydrophobic antibacterial peptides, wrwycr can enter cancer cells more efficiently than normal cells. U2OS, an osteosarcoma cell line is more sensitive to wrwycr-induced cytotoxicity than HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line. In U2OS cells, wrwycr produces a non-linear dose-dependent cytotoxicity partly via apoptosis. Concurrent administration of a sublethal dose of etoposide with wrwycr potentiates cell death in U2OS and induces the DNA double strand break response. More specifically, wrwycr interferes with recovery from intra-S arrest in synchronized U2OS cells in a linear, dose-dependent manner with no significant killing. This suggests that the exponential increase in cell death upon linear increase in wrwycr dose could be due to the interaction of peptide wrwycr with other cellular targets generating different forms of damage like ER stress, membrane rupture or mitochondrial damage. HeLa cells show more signs of cell cycle arrest than cell death with wrwycr treatment. This becomes more evident upon simultaneous treatment with etoposide. Interestingly, IMR- 90 cells are the most resistant to wrwycr lethality and DNA damage. This can be attributed only partly to lesser uptake inside these cells. Taken together, we have starting evidence that wrwycr has potential to be used as an anticancer drug by itself or in combination therapy. Much more basic and clinical research needs to be done before this long term goal can be achieved

Mechanical and Electrical Properties of Modified Graphene Devices
Compared with traditional semiconductor materials, graphene has unparalleled advantages on mobility, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength and so on. Thus it was considered as a promising candidate material for the future semiconductor industry. However, since its band structure is gapless, band gap engineering has become a significant task for scientists. My dissertation focuses on chemical and physical modification methods that could pave the way to applications of graphene based devices and reveal a number of interesting phenomena.    The critical roadblock for graphene electronics is the absence of a band gap. We first focus on chemical functionalization of graphene as a route to band gap engineering. This is first achieved via grafting nitrophenyl groups onto single layer graphene sheets. The functionalized graphene samples behave like semiconductors. Substrate supported and suspended samples demonstrate transport gaps as large as ~0.1eV and ~1eV, respectively. Secondly, we developed a different chemical functionalization approach based on organometallic chemistry. Apart from behaving like semiconductors, functionalized samples also retains the high mobility of the pristine state.     The second part of the thesis focuses on physical modifications of graphene a. Suspended graphene-based switch was developed using a special pulsing breakdown technique. Voltage pulses of 2.5V~4V and 8V can turn a switch device to ON (high conductance) state and OFF (low conductance) state, respectively. We provide experimental evidence that these behaviors arise from motions of atomic-scale carbon chains and reformation of chemical bonds.     Finally, strain engineering is another approach for modifying transport properties of graphene. We proposed and developed novel nano-electromechanical system (NEMS)-like devices that allows in situ modulation of strain on suspended graphene flakes, which in turn induces interesting changes in both transport and morphological properties of graphene.     In summary, this dissertation presents our studies on chemical and physical modification approaches of graphene samples, and related novel phenomena that emerge amid these devices, with implications on next generation electronic devices.

B7h-expressing dendritic cells and plasma B cells mediate distinct outcomes of ICOS costimulation in T cell-dependent antibody responses
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The ICOS-B7h costimulatory receptor-ligand pair is required for germinal center formation, the production of isotype-switched antibodies, and antibody affinity maturation in response to T cell-dependent antigens. However, the potentially distinct roles of regulated B7h expression on B cells and dendritic cells in T cell-dependent antibody responses have not been defined.
				
				
					
						Results
					We generated transgenic mice with lineage-restricted B7h expression to assess the cell-type specific roles of B7h expression on B cells and dendritic cells in regulating T cell-dependent antibody responses. Our results show that endogenous B7h expression is reduced on B cells after activation in vitro and is also reduced in vivo on antibody-secreting plasma B cells in comparison to both na&#239;ve and germinal center B cells from which they are derived. Increasing the level of B7h expression on activated and plasma B cells in B-B7hTg mice led to an increase in the number of antibody-secreting plasma cells generated after immunization and a corresponding increase in the concentration of antigen-specific high affinity serum IgG antibodies of all isotypes, without affecting the number of responding germinal center B cells. In contrast, ICOS costimulation mediated by dendritic cells in DC-B7hTg mice contributed to germinal center formation and selectively increased IgG2a production without affecting the overall magnitude of antibody responses.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Using transgenic mice with lineage-restricted B7h expression, we have revealed distinct roles of ICOS costimulation mediated by dendritic cells and B cells in the regulation of T cell-dependent antibody responses.

Efficient trapping of the light in a photon absorber or a photodetector can improve its performance and reduce its cost. In this paper we investigate two designs for light-trapping in application to infrared absorption. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that nonabsorptive pyramids either located on top of an absorbing film or having embedded absorbing rods can efficiently enhance the absorption in the absorbing material. A spectrally averaged absorptance of 83% is achieved compared to an average absorptance of 28% for the optimized multilayer structure that has the same amount of absorbing material. This enhancement is explained by the coupled-mode theory. Similar designs can also be applied to solar cells.

RhoA, B, and C in cancer : study of statin-induced changes in Rho signaling, and identification of isoform-specific Rho effectors
The three Rho subfamily members, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, share 85% sequence identity, yet display opposite phenotypes. Whereas RhoA and RhoC proteins promote cellular proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and human cancers, RhoB hinders oncogenesis. How such similar proteins can have such opposing functions is not clearly defined. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), typically prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties, were additionally found to lower rates of various cancers. Rho proteins were hypothesized to contribute to this anti- tumorigenic effect given that one of the pleiotropic effects of statins is inhibition of Rho prenylation. In our experiments, we found that RhoA and RhoC were more sensitive to the statin-induced decline in prenylation than RhoB, likely due to the ability of RhoB to be additionally farnesylated. In addition, we found that RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC activation and expression were greatly increased in lovastatin-treated cells. An increase in activated, GTP-bound Rho occurred even when RhoA and RhoC were completely unprenylated. This increase in Rho activation was at least partly explained by the decreased ability of unprenylated Rho to associate with its Rho- dissociation inhibitor, RhoGDI\alpha\. An increase in activated, yet unprenylated, Rho in response to statins could lead to a potential gain-of-function or a loss-of- function for Rho, and we hypothesized that this might explain how statins provide their anti-oncogenic properties. However, many statin-induced effects on proliferation, transcription, apoptosis, and polyploidy could not be explained by a change in Rho function and we found no evidence that the lovastatin-induced increase in RhoB contributed significantly to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of lovastatin in human leukemia cells. We used a proteomics approach to search for Rho interacting factors with differential binding affinity for RhoA/C and RhoB. Through the use of affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified a novel RhoA and RhoC isoform-specific interacting protein, IQGAP1. The binding to IQGAP1 was found to be dependent on the activation and prenylation state of Rho. Like RhoA and RhoC, IQGAP1 has many pro-proliferative, pro-invasion, and pro-oncogenesis properties. The lack of RhoB association with IQGAP1 may explain in part how this Rho isoform differs so dramatically in its function from RhoA and C.

Reconstitution of mammalian ion channels in droplet bilayers
Ion channel studies are important for scientific characterization of cellular processes and for the purpose of drug discovery. The sessile droplet bilayer platform allows for simple, fast, inexpensive and high-yield formation of artificial lipid bilayers and reconstitution of ion channels. We validated this bilayer formation platform with mammalian ion channels like Chloride Intracellular Channel 1 (CLIC1) and Voltage-gated potassium channel 1.2 (Kv1.2). Ion channel synthesis using traditional bacterial expression systems is a complex and time consuming process and it limits the number of eukaryotic proteins that can be expressed therein.

Measuring and mapping biophysical properties and their influence on mesenchymal stem cell fate
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as adherent stem cells are being increasingly used as a therapeutic cell source, thus developing a better understanding of how to control MSC fate choice is an increasingly important task. Unlike the well known chemical cues, the biophysical properties of the surrounding extracellular environment, such as the appropriate spatial display of adhesion sites and environment stiffness should be clarified. The atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based technique called force spectroscopy mapping (FSM) was applied for examination biophysical properties such as elasticity and adhesion site size and spacing. Using the indentation, the spatial changes in the mechanics of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(acrylamide) (PAam) hydrogels were detected. PVP hydrogels had very heterogeneous elastic moduli as a function of hydrogel position as well as the amount of crosslinker. PAam hydrogels were a much more homogeneous substrate, showing little spatial variation in moduli. Coupled with chemical-functionalized probe, the technique of chemical FSM (CFSM) was shown the capability of recognizing sub-micron adhesive sites from probe retraction studies. By functionalizing the probe to recognize the charged surface of copolymers, the spatial display of adhesion sites in diblock copolymer foams was investiaged. Prepared by high internal phase emulsion templating using amphiphilic copolymers of polystyrene- block-polyacrylic acid and polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide, the porous foams have been synthesized and characterized. With nanoscopic domains of cell inert and active chemistries mimicking native matrix, the nanodomains of adhesive sites were detected by CFSM. Protein adsorption on surfaces was examined in spatially macro-, micro-, and nanoscopic level. MSCs from different cell sources of human-embryonic stem-mesoderm progenitors (hES-MPs) and human bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were examined by quantitative PCR to assess their expression of myogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic genotypes as a result of their interaction with the foams of varying composition. Interestingly, without the induction media, hBMSCs expressed adipogenic genes and proteins on 'patchy' matrices where adhesive nano-domains were present. More interestingly, and their expression depends on stem cell origin: marrow-derived and mesenchymal progenitor cells exhibit fundamentally different differentiation patterns, adipo- and osteogenic, respectively. Together these data for the first time implicate adhesion as a complex regulator of cell fate

Variation on the Theme of the Conley Conjecture
We prove a generalization of the Conley conjecture: Every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of a closed symplectic manifold has infinitely many periodic orbits if the first Chern class vanishes on the second fundamental group. In particular, this removes the rationality condition from similar theorems by Ginzburg and Gürel. The proof in the irrational case involves several new ingredients including the definition and the properties of the filtered Floer homology for Hamiltonians on irrational manifolds. For this proof, we develop a method of localizing the filtered Floer homology for short action intervals using a direct sum decomposition. One of the summands only depends on the behavior of the Hamiltonian in a fixed open set and enables us to use tools from more restrictive cases in the proof of the Conley conjecture. We also prove the Conley conjecture for cotangent bundles of oriented, closed manifolds, and Hamiltonians, which are quadratic at infinity, i.e., we show that such Hamiltonians have infinitely many periodic orbits.

Endogenous mammalian histone H3.3 exhibits chromatin-related functions during development
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The histone variant H3.3 plays key roles in regulating chromatin states and transcription. However, the role of endogenous H3.3 in mammalian cells and during development has been less thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we report the production and phenotypic analysis of mice and cells with targeted disruption of the H3.3-encoding gene, H3f3b.
				
				
					
						Results
					
						H3f3b knockout (KO) mice exhibit a semilethal phenotype traceable at least in part to defective cell division and chromosome segregation. H3f3b KO cells have widespread ectopic CENP-A protein localization suggesting one possible mechanism for defective chromosome segregation. KO cells have abnormal karyotypes and cell cycle profiles as well. The transcriptome and euchromatin-related epigenome were moderately affected by loss of H3f3b in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with ontology most notably pointing to changes in chromatin regulatory and histone coding genes. Reduced numbers of H3f3b KO mice survive to maturity and almost all survivors from both sexes are infertile.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Taken together, our studies suggest that endogenous mammalian histone H3.3 has important roles in regulating chromatin and chromosome functions that in turn are important for cell division, genome integrity, and development.

The Role of Biogenic Amines and Dopamine Receptors in Envenomation by the Parasitoid Wasp <italic>Ampulex compressa</italic>
The parasitoid wasp <italic>Ampulex compressa</italic> uses a unique biochemical strategy to exploit the American cockroach <italic>Periplaneta</italic> americana as a food source for its offspring.  The wasp injects venom directly into the brain and subesophageal ganglion of the cockroach, which leads to a bout of grooming which lasts approximately 30 minutes.  The cockroach subsequently falls into a state of hypokinesia, which is characterized by reduction of escape responses and inability to generate spontaneous movements.  We investigated potential mechanisms of action for these venom-induced behaviors, focusing predominantly on the possible roles of the biogenic amine dopamine.  Reserpine injection produces similar behavioral phenotypes to stung cockroaches by depleting presynaptic stores of biogenic amines.  We determined that levels of dopamine, serotonin, octopamine, or tyramine in the head and thoracic ganglia were not depressed in stung cockroaches, but were dramatically reduced in reserpinized animals.  We also investigated the effects of <italic>Ampulex</italic> venom and two major venom peptides (DG2847 and DG2807) on dopamine receptors in relation to sting-induced grooming and hypokinesia induction.  The full-length cDNA encoding the D2-like dopamine receptor from <italic>Periplaneta americana</italic> (PeaD2R) was sequenced and cloned into a vector for expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells.  Three dopamine receptors from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (dDA1, DAMB, and D2R) were also cloned.  Using an aequorin-based cell luminescence assay, pharmacological profiles were generated for each receptor using various synthetic dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists in order to determine the specificity of these compounds on each receptor subtype.  The D2-selective compound sulpiride, when preinjected into cockroach hemolymph, significantly reduced sting-induced grooming.  Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that has been implicated in sting-induced grooming, was determined to be present in milked venom by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.  We also investigated functional properties of <italic>Ampulex</italic> venom and venom peptides.  We determined that neither <italic>Ampulex</italic> venom, nor the venom peptides, possessed antimicrobial activity, or induced cell death <italic>in vitro</italic>.  Milked venom and the venom peptides induced a decrease in ligand-induced luminescence when incubated with CHO-K1 cells.  This suggests that calcium mobilization is being altered when exposed to venom, which may disrupt signaling pathways in the central nervous system.

On-Road Measurement of Carbonyls in California Light-Duty Vehicle Emissions
Emissions of carbonyls by motor vehicles are of concern because these species can be hazardous to human health and highly reactive in the atmosphere. The objective of this research was to measure carbonyl emission factors for California light-duty motor vehicles. Measurements were made at the entrance and exit of a San Francisco Bay area highway tunnel, in the center bore where heavy-duty trucks are not allowed. During summer 1999, approximately 100 carbonyls were identified, including saturated ahphatic aldehydes and ketones, unsaturated ahphatic carbonyls, ahphatic dicarbonyls, and aromatic carbonyls. Concentrations were measured for 32 carbonyls and were combined with NMOC, CO and CO2 concentrations to calculate by carbon balance emission factors per unit of fuel burned. The measured carbonyl mass emitted from light-duty vehicles was 68 +/- 4 mg L^-1. Formaldehyde accounted for 45% of the measured mass emissions, acetaldehyde 12%, toluadehydes 10%, benzaldehyde 7.2%, and acetone 5.9%. The ozone forming potential of the carbonyl emissions was dominated by formaldehyde (70%) and acetaldehyde (14%). Between 1994 and 1999, emission factors measured at the same tunnel for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzaldehyde decreased by 45-70%. Carbonyls constituted 3.9% of total NMOC mass emissions and 5.2% of NMOC reactivity. A comparison of carbonyl emissions with gasoline composition supports previous findings that aromatic aldehyde emissions are related to aromatics in gasoline. Carbonyl concentrations in liquid gasoline were also measured. Acetone and MEK were the most abundant carbonyls in unburned gasoline, 8 other carbonyls were detected and quantified.

[splicing, factor, cus2, phosphorylation, role]

A characterization of the role of phosphorylation in regulating pre-mRNA splicing
Pre-mRNA splicing is a key process in gene regulation that involves the removal of noncoding sequences from nascent RNA transcripts to form a mature message that can be translated into a protein. The spliceosome is a large, dynamic macromolecular complex which is responsible for the identification and removal of these introns. To achieve its role in splicing, the Spliceosome undergoes a series of dynamic rearrangements involving protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions. How these rearrangements are regulated is not well understood and may involve posttranslational modifications of the protein factors. The work presented in this thesis provides evidence that many splicing factors are in fact posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation, although only a handful of these modifications have previously been described in detail. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of the yeast splicing factor Cus2 is important for its function in splicing. Specifically, we find that phosphorylation within a RNA binding domain (RRM) of Cus2 regulates its ability to associate with and mediate folding of its known substrate, the U2 snRNA. We discuss the potential implications of this finding, including the possibility that Cus2 is regulated in response to cellular conditions, including the cell cycle, in order to coordinate spicing with the events that occur during cell division. We further this investigation by exploring potential interactions between Cus2, its substrate U2 snRNA, and the Bur kinase complex. The mammalian homologs of these factors have been shown to physically interact in vitro to positively regulate transcription elongation. We investigated the possibility that a similar relationship exists between these factors in yeast. We were unable to find any evidence for a similar set of interactions in vivo or that the splicing factors have an obvious effect on transcription. Taken together, our data elucidate the role of posttranslational modifications in regulating Cus2's role in splicing and provide further insight into the connection between splicing and the transcription machinery

Proteasome inhibitor biosynthesis and self-resistance in the marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica
Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy in cancer chemotherapy with the FDA approval of bortezomib. The marine actinobacterium Salinispora tropica, discovered in sediments off the Bahamas, produces a potent natural product PI, salinosporamide A (NPI-0052 or marizomib), which is now in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma. A chlorine atom, incorporated via the novel polyketide synthase extender unit chloroethylmalonyl-CoA, confers highly potent and irreversible inhibition of the eukaryotic 20S proteasome. Herein I report the in vitro characterization of one enzyme, the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SalM, responsible for the oxidation of 5-chloro-5-deoxy-D-ribose to 5-chloro-5-deoxy -D-ribono-gamma-lactone en route to chloroethylmalonyl- CoA. Using heterologously produced SalM, a sensitive, real -time ¹³C NMR assay was developed to monitor transient product formation followed by spontaneous lactone hydrolysis. SalM was determined to have an atypical divalent cation dependence (Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺ or Ca²⁺) and to oxidize tetrose or pentose furanoses with hydroxy stereochemistry equivalent to that of D-ribose, making it the first reported stereospecific non-phosphorylated ribose-1-dehydrogenase. Additionally, I explored the question of PI self-resistance in S. tropica as actinobacteria possess 20S proteasome machinery. A secondary catalytic beta-subunit (SalI) encoded adjacent to the salinosporamide biosynthetic gene cluster was characterized by heterologous expression and in vitro assaying of the alpha/SalI complex. An altered proteolytic specificity and 30-fold resistance toward salinosporamide A inhibition was demonstrated for the alpha/SalI complex relative to the housekeeping alpha/ beta₁ complex. Sequence comparison of these two beta- subunits revealed two mutations, M45F and A49V, which likely conferred resistance. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the A49V mutation of SalI is partially responsible for resistance which correlates to identical mutations observed in bortezomib resistant human cancer cell lines. The alpha/SalI complex was also cross- resistant to bortezomib and to salinosporamide analogs, suggesting that S1 binding pocket mutation leads to resistance against all proteasome beta-subunit inhibitors. As bortezomib therapy is plagued by intrinsic and acquired resistance, it is critical to determine if salinosporamide A will suffer the same fate. My analysis suggests that bortezomib resistant cancer cell lines are likely cross-resistant to salinosporamide A. Moreover, these results suggest that self-resistance to natural PIs may predict clinical outcomes

Gap-filling analysis of the iJO1366 Escherichia coli metabolic network reconstruction for discovery of metabolic functions
AbstractBackgroundThe iJO1366 reconstruction of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli is one of the most complete and accurate metabolic reconstructions available for any organism. Still, because our knowledge of even well-studied model organisms such as this one is incomplete, this network reconstruction contains gaps and possible errors. There are a total of 208 blocked metabolites in iJO1366, representing gaps in the network.ResultsA new model improvement workflow was developed to compare model based phenotypic predictions to experimental data to fill gaps and correct errors. A Keio Collection based dataset of E. coli gene essentiality was obtained from literature data and compared to model predictions. The SMILEY algorithm was then used to predict the most likely missing reactions in the reconstructed network, adding reactions from a KEGG based universal set of metabolic reactions. The feasibility of these putative reactions was determined by comparing updated versions of the model to the experimental dataset, and genes were predicted for the most feasible reactions.ConclusionsNumerous improvements to the iJO1366 metabolic reconstruction were suggested by these analyses. Experiments were performed to verify several computational predictions, including a new mechanism for growth on myo-inositol. The other predictions made in this study should be experimentally verifiable by similar means. Validating all of the predictions made here represents a substantial but important undertaking.

The Role of Emotion Perception and Experience on Laterality
Language research has moved from the left hemisphere (LH) processing all language, to a differential processing across hemispheres. Davidson (1995) suggests the right hemisphere (RH) is specialized for experiencing negative emotions, while the LH is specialized for experiencing positive emotions. However, when readers' perceive emotion, the RH processes emotion regardless of valence. Examining laterality of perception versus experience of emotions has not been thoroughly tested using cognitive paradigms. Experience was examined using positive, negative, and neutral moods induced via pictures from the International Affective Picture Inventory. We predicted a LH advantage for positive or neutral mood induction and a RH advantage when negative mood was induced. Perception of emotions was tested using valence judgments.  Predictions were a RH advantage for natural and man-made target words preceded by positive and negative central words and a LH advantage for targets preceded by neutral central words. An overall LH advantage for the semantic decision task was found. The valence of the central word did have an effect on accuracy and reaction time of the subsequent semantic decision words. Although there was no effect of visual field for the negative mood induction condition, there was a trend toward a significant interaction between mood and visual field. A LH advantage was found for accuracy of the semantic decision task for the positive mood induction, which partially supports experimental predictions. This experiment examined the effect of valence on hemispheric asymmetry. Arousal level was controlled for in order to have a non-confounded measure of valence. Given experimental findings, arousal level may be an important variable when examining valence.

Graduate Student Researcher
In the retina, somatostatin (SRIF) is an inhibitory neuropeptide that influences multiple cell types, including bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells.  SRIF is reported to have multiple cellular actions including modulation of the release of dopamine (DA) from tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing amacrine cells; however, the cellular basis of this interaction is unknown.  Using immunohistochemistry I showed SRIF- and TH-containing wide-field amacrine cells co-stratify in the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) adjacent to the inner nuclear layer (INL).  These processes form a dense network, which co-ramify and make numerous contacts along their processes and at varicosities.  SRIF- and TH-immunoreactive (IR) cell bodies and processes also contain GABA and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) immunoreactivity, and express the GABAA &#945;3 receptor subunit.  TH-IR cells also express the SRIF receptor subtype 2A (sst2A) and SRIF-IR cells express the D1 receptor.  Calcium imaging recordings of Fluo-4 labeled TH-red fluorescent protein (TH-RFP) processes exhibited a ~40% decrease in fluorescent intensity following 60 mM K+ depolarization in the presence of SRIF (100nM-100 &#956;M) and L054264 (1-10&#956;M), a selective sst2A agonist.  These findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between these two amacrine cell types mediated by both feedback and feed forward actions.  SRIF amacrine cells act at TH-containing amacrine cells by a paracrine mechanism at sst2A, as well as directly at GABAA receptors.  TH amacrine cells likely act at SRIF-containing amacrine cells at D1 and GABAA receptors.  This retinal microcircuit defines a novel modulatory relationship for SRIF and demonstrates its broad influence on multiple visual processes.

Metal-directed protein self-assembly
The de novo design of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has proven to be an immense challenge due to the difficulty in controlling and predicting the weak forces that govern them. In order to circumvent this challenge, we set out to induce new PPIs between monomeric proteins through the coordination of metal ions. In our strategy, the strength of the metal bonding interactions should be sufficient to drive the formation of PPIs without initial consideration of the weak non-covalent interactions along the newly formed interfaces. Additionally, the distinct geometric preferences of metal ions should only allow for a limited number of organizations of proteins around a given metal center, thus permitting a degree of foresight into the oligomeric architectures that will be formed. As a model system, we chose a stable, four-helix bundle protein, cytochrome cb₅₆₂, onto which two i and i+4 bis- histidine "clamp" coordination motifs were installed. The resulting metal-binding construct, MBPC-1, is shown to be capable of forming discrete oligomeric species whose supramolecular architectures depend on the stereochemical preferences of the added metal. Further studies to exert control over the morphology of a Zn-mediated tetrameric assembly of MBPC-1 (Zn₄:MBPC-1₄) highlighted the fact that , although we initially ignored secondary, non-covalent interactions along our newly induced interfaces, these interactions do play a role in determining the overall structure of the complex. This idea led us to computationally "evolve" our protein by re-designing residues along interfaces of the Zn₄:MBPC-1₄ tetramer to include more favorable hydrophobic packing interactions. The resulting constructs were shown to not only form a significantly stabilized tetramer, but also to have the ability to form oligomers in the absence of metals. Further stabilization of this tetrameric architecture by way of chemical crosslinking has allowed for the formation of a potentially metal-selective complex that can serve as a stable platform onto which functionalized metal centers, and in turn enzymatic activity, may be engineered in the future

Identification and characterization of regulators of survival in human pluripotent stem cells
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be derived from the inner cell mass of a developing blastocyst or through transcription factor mediated reprogramming.  hPSCs can be maintained indefinitely in culture and have the capacity to differentiate into any cell type found in the body, making them powerful tools for studying development, modeling diseases, and potential regenerative medicine therapies.  Before we can utilize the full potential of these cells, there are many unanswered questions remaining regarding their basic growth and survival.  While hPSCs are regularly grown as compact colonies and passaged as small clumps, when dissociated to single cells they survive poorly and undergo apoptosis rapidly after dissociation.  This poor survival as single cells impairs the use of hPSCs in common techniques that require the isolation of specific clonal populations, including genetic manipulation.  Towards this end, we have taken several approaches, including candidate targeting and large scale screening, to identify modifiers of survival in hPSCs.  One such small molecule that significantly improved the survival of dissociated hPSCs was the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor HA-1077.  Using shRNA we confirmed that inhibiting ROCK activity in hPSCs improves their survival by inhibiting dissociation-induced apoptosis.  We also explored the role of cell-cell junctions between hPSCs in regulating survival.  We found that blocking the activity of E-cadherin in dissociated cells reduces their survival and plating efficiency, even when treated with a ROCK inhibitor.  Furthermore, we identified multiple junction proteins that are disrupted after dissociation of hPSC colonies, representing novel targets with potential to regulate survival of hPSCs.  Finally, we developed improved high throughput assays for screening large libraries of small molecules to search for novel regulators of hPSC survival.  We identified several novel small molecules, and validated that most function through inhibition of ROCK, suggesting that ROCK activity is a key modulator of survival in hPSCs.  The data reported here represent a comprehensive evaluation of how survival is regulated in hPSCs.  Further this work is one of the first to generate and compare large scale screening platforms for hPSC survival.  With minor modifications, these screening platforms can be adapted to examine other aspects of hPSC fate such as self-renewal and differentiation.  Improving our ability to grow, maintain, and manipulate hPSCs will enhance their use as a model for human disease and development and a source of future cell-based regenerative therapies.

Solution grown antimony doped zinc oxide films
Zinc oxide is an extensively studied semiconducting material due to its versatile properties applicable to many technologies such as electronics, optoelectronics, sensing and renewable energy. Although zinc oxide films have been created for device fabrication, the methods used to synthesize them are expensive and unrealistic for affordable commercial devices. In addition, zinc oxide is intrinsically n-type making the realization of stable p- type materials a great challenge for light emitting diodes, solar cells and UV lasing. In this thesis zinc oxide films are created using low cost solution methods. To accomplish this, a previously unreported surfactant, tert-butanol, is used. Several controlled experiments vary the concentration of tert-butanol, zinc and oxygen sources to demonstrate the ability of tert-butanol to create low cost films. Further, small amounts of antimony glycolate are added to the reaction solution, to create antimony doped zinc oxide films on sapphire and silicon substrates. Although hall measurements indicate that the films are n- type, a discussion of antimony activation provides a feasible path for the realization of low cost, p-type zinc oxide films

This interview with Andrew Todd Newberry was conducted by Randall Jarrell, the former director of the Regional History Project, on July 18, 1994 in Newberry's office at UCSC. Todd Newberry arrived at UCSC as a founding faculty member in biology when the campus opened in 1965. He had earned a B.A. in biology from Princeton University and a Ph.D. in biology from Stanford University, where his doctoral research focused on ascidian tunicates ("sea squirts"). Other research interests included invertebrate development and reproduction and biosystematics. Professor Newberry speaks of teaching "as a form of persuasion, of launching, of getting people interested in things." Some of the other courses Newberry taught over the years included Invertebrate Zoology, The Organism in Its Environment (Biology 1A), Invertebrate Anatomy Laboratory, Morphogenesis, and California Marine Invertebrates.
      In this narration Newberry provides his recollections of the early years at UCSC, particularly of Cowell College. He characterizes those years as "exhilarating," and as an "improbable adventure." He also discusses the development of the biology board now department, and his colleagues such as William Doyle, Charles Daniel, and Peter Ray.

Generalized Atkin Polynomials and Non-Ordinary Hyperelliptic Curves
There exists a sequence of orthogonal polynomials with many interesting properties from the standpoint of number theory. These polynomials are called Atkin polynomials, and they can be constructed using the theory of modular forms for the group PSL_{2}(Z). Closed formulas for these polynomials are known, and their zeros provide information about supersingular elliptic curves.In this dissertation, we construct an infinite collection of sets of orthogonal polynomials, of which the Atkin polynomials are but one example. These polynomials are constructed using the theory of modular forms for the Hecke triangle groups G_{m}, as well as the theory of hypergeometric functions. As in the previously known case, the zeros of this larger family of polynomials provide information about curves. In this setting, however, the curves are hyperelliptic, and the zeros detect whether or not certain curves are ordinary. We show how these curves arise and give proofs generalizing the known properties of the Atkin polynomials. We also interpret these generalized Atkin polynomials within the framework of period functions and weakly holomorphic modular forms, and prove some new results on the Fourier coefficients of certain modular integrals.

Improving Multiple Sequence Alignments by Revising Sequence Families with Alignment Scoring Approaches
Characterizing the functional, structural, and evolutionary relationships of biological sequences is an important task in modern genomics and computational biology. Most of these applications involve the assembly of sequence families by similarity searching, subsequent formation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and downstream phylogenetic analyses. Especially, MSAs play a central role in this modeling workflow. Thus, the quality of the MSAs is of critical importance for its success. In this study I present an approach to improve the quality of MSAs by using a sequence family revision approach that can automatically remove false positive candidates from sequence families and then recompute an improved MSA. The approach is able to combine sequence-level scores from two MSA scoring methods, norMD and GUIDANCE. It automatically selects an optimized score threshold for removing sequences from MSAs. To test the performance of this method, I developed several automated procedures to add to curated MSAs from the CDD database controlled numbers of randomly selected nonmember sequences. Then I performed Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis on the classification results incorporating automatic threshold selection approaches. Surprisingly, the sequence-level scores, provided by the two MSA scoring methods, were less successful than a simple all-against-all BLAST-based pairwise alignment scoring approach. However, I was able to improve one of the MSA scoring methods by extending it with a dynamic threshold selection approach. The extended method outperformed the performance of the BLAST-based method in detecting false positives in sequence families.

Selective, On-Resin N-Methylation of Cyclic Peptides and Implications for the Discovery of Membrane Permeable Scaffolds
Many biologically active cyclic peptides, especially those of natural origin, are known to penetrate cells by passive diffusion despite lying well outside Lipinski's "rules of 5" for predicting bioavailability. The backbone amides of these natural products are often N-methylated, a modification that serves to enhance lipophilicity and proteolytic stability.  The impact of N-methylation on passive membrane diffusion in cyclic peptides, however, has not been investigated in detail. Here we present a new method for the selective, on-resin N-methylation of cyclic peptides to generate compounds with drug-like membrane permeability. The selectivity and degree of N-methylation of the cyclic peptide depends on the stereochemistry of the backbone, suggesting that conformation dictates the regiochemistry of the N-methylation reaction. For two of the diastereomers investigated, unique N-methyl products were observed with each diastereomer yielding a different N-methyl variant. 2D 1H NMR and H/D exchange studies provide insight into the conformational basis of the regioselectivity of the reaction and provide a rationale for the observation that the partially methylated derivatives are not only significantly more membrane permeable than their nonmethylated precursors, but are also more permeable than the corresponding permethylated species.

Effects on motor neuron development of altering peripheral targets in embryonic leeches (Hirudo verbana)
During embryonic development, axons that project into the peripheral tissue encounter many different cues that can affect their final phenotype. We have studied the development of individually identified motor neurons in medicinal leeches (Hirudo verbana). We hypothesized that contact with peripheral targets provide signals that direct the formation of central synaptic connections. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted pieces of body wall into ectopic locations to ask if the central connections of motor neurons change when they contact the "wrong" peripheral target. We used embryos at 47-50% of development, a stage at which neurons are just beginning to form their central electrical connections. We transplanted tissue from a donor embryo and implanted it into the opposite region of a host embryo. We then let our embryos develop to a juvenile stage. External pigment patterns indicated that transplanted tissues retained their original fate. Immunostaining for acetylated tubulin revealed that the transplanted tissue became innervated, although less densely than un-manipulated tissue. Injections of AlexaFlour 488 dextran into motor neurons adjacent to an ectopic transplant indicated that the axons of these neurons projected into the periphery similarly to unaltered controls. Injecting Alexa Flour 488 plus Neurobiotin, which crosses gap junctions, revealed no statistically significant difference in the number of cells that were dye-coupled to the filled cell in embryos that received ectopic transplants, although the neurons and connections within the ganglion become markedly un- patterned, suggesting that disrupting the periphery exerts at least some influence in the central nervous system

A novel series of conferences tackling the hurdles confronting the translation of novel cancer immunotherapies
Abstract
				While there has been significant progress in advancing novel immune therapies to the bedside, much more needs to be done to fully tap into the potential of the immune system. It has become increasingly clear that besides practical and operational challenges, the heterogeneity of cancer and the limited efficacy profile of current immunotherapy platforms are the two main hurdles. Nevertheless, the promising clinical data of several approaches point to a roadmap that carries the promise to significantly advance cancer immunotherapy. A new annual series sponsored by Arrowhead Publishers and Conferences aims at bringing together scientific and business leadership from academia and industry, to identify, share and discuss most current priorities in research and translation of novel immune interventions. This Editorial provides highlights of the first event held earlier this year and outlines the focus of the second meeting to be held in 2013 that will be dedicated to stem cells and immunotherapy.

Molecular decay of enamel matrix protein genes in turtles and other edentulous amniotes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Secondary edentulism (toothlessness) has evolved on multiple occasions in amniotes including several mammalian lineages (pangolins, anteaters, baleen whales), birds, and turtles. All edentulous amniote clades have evolved from ancestors with enamel-capped teeth. Previous studies have documented the molecular decay of tooth-specific genes in edentulous mammals, all of which lost their teeth in the Cenozoic, and birds, which lost their teeth in the Cretaceous. By contrast with mammals and birds, tooth loss in turtles occurred in the Jurassic (201.6-145.5 Ma), providing an extended time window for tooth gene degradation in this clade. The release of the painted turtle and Chinese softshell turtle genomes provides an opportunity to recover the decayed remains of tooth-specific genes in Testudines.
				
				
					
						Results
					We queried available genomes of Testudines (Chrysemys picta painted turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis Chinese softshell turtle), Aves (Anas platyrhynchos duck, Gallus gallus chicken, Meleagris gallopavo turkey, Melopsittacus undulatus budgerigar, Taeniopygia guttata zebra finch), and enamelless mammals (Orycteropus afer aardvark, Choloepus hoffmanni Hoffmann&#8217;s two-toed sloth, Dasypus novemcinctus nine-banded armadillo) for remnants of three enamel matrix protein (EMP) genes with putative enamel-specific functions. Remnants of the AMBN and ENAM genes were recovered in Chrysemys and retain their original synteny. Remnants of AMEL were recovered in both testudines, although there are no shared frameshifts. We also show that there are inactivated copies of AMBN, AMEL and ENAM in representatives of divergent avian lineages including Galloanserae, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes, and that there are shared frameshift mutations in all three genes that predate the basal split in Neognathae. Among enamelless mammals, all three EMP genes exhibit inactivating mutations in Orycteropus and Choloepus.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our results highlight the power of combining fossil and genomic evidence to decipher macroevolutionary transitions and characterize the functional range of different loci involved in tooth development. The fossil record and phylogenetics combine to predict the occurrence of molecular fossils of tooth-specific genes in the genomes of edentulous amniotes, and in every case these molecular fossils have been discovered. The widespread occurrence of EMP pseudogenes in turtles, birds, and edentulous/enamelless mammals also provides compelling evidence that in amniotes, the only unique, non-redundant function of these genes is in enamel formation.

Transport in a field aligned magnetized plasma/neutral gas boundary: the end of the plasma
The objective of this dissertation is to characterize the physics of a boundary layer between a magnetized plasma and a neutral gas along the direction of a confining magnetic field.  A series of experiments are performed at the Enormous Toroidal Plasma Device (ETPD) at UCLA to study this field aligned Neutral Boundary Layer (NBL) at the end of the plasma.  A Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB6) cathode and semi-transparent anode creates a magnetized, current-free helium plasma which terminates on a neutral helium gas without touching any walls.  Probes are inserted into the plasma to measure the basic plasma parameters and study the transport in the NBL.  The experiment is performed in the weakly ionized limit where the plasma density (ne) is much less than the neutral density (nn) such that ne/nn < 5%.The NBL is characterized by a field-aligned electric field which begins at the point where the plasma pressure equilibrates with the neutral gas pressure.  Beyond the pressure equilibration point the electrons and ions lose their momentum by collisions with the neutral gas and come to rest.  An electric field is established self consistently to maintain a current-free termination through equilibration of the different species' stopping rates in the neutral gas.  The electric field resembles a collisional quasineutral sheath with a length 10 times the electron-ion collision length, 100 times the neutral collision length, and 10,000 times the Debye length.Collisions with the neutral gas dominate the losses in the system.  The measured plasma density loss rates are above the classical cross-field current-free ambipolar rate, but below the anomalous Bohm diffusion rate.  The electron temperature is below the ionization threshold of the gas, 2.2 eV in helium. The ions are in thermal equilibrium with the neutral gas.  A generalized theory of plasma termination in a Neutral Boundary Layer is applied to this case using a two-fluid, current-free, weakly ionized transport model.  The electron and ion momentum equations along the field are combined in a generalized Ohm's law which predicts the axial electric field required to maintain a current-free termination.  The pressure balance criteria for termination and the predicted electric field are confirmed over a scaling of plasma parameters.  The experiment and the model are relevant for studying NBLs in other systems, such as the atmospheric termination of the aurora or detached gaseous divertors.  A steady state modified ambipolar system is measured in the ETPD NBL.  The drift speeds associated with these currents are a small fraction of the plasma flow speeds and the problem is treated as a perturbation to the termination model.  The current-free condition on the model is relaxed to explain the presence of the divergence free current.

On thermodynamic and microscopic reversibility
The word ``reversible'' has two (apparently) distinct applications in statistical thermodynamics. A thermodynamically reversible process indicates an experimental protocol for which the
entropy change is zero, whereas the principle of microscopic reversibility asserts that the probability of any trajectory of a system through phase space equals that of the time reversed trajectory.
However, these two terms are actually synonymous: a thermodynamically reversible process is microscopically reversible, and vice versa.

Structure-function effects of mutations in domains of Inducible Tyrosine Kinase
The dissertation is studying structural mutants of various domains of the Inducible Tyrosine Kinase (Itk), and their relation to functionality of this protein in immune cells. Using cell lines as well as primary cells from Itk-/- mice, and employing systematic functional study approach this work is exploring effects of several mutations (Y511F, BtkSH3, FYF) on immediate, and far downstream signaling of Itk under conditions of TCR induced stimulation. Structural (FRET), as well as biochemical and molecular biology techniques were used (western blotting, flow cytometry, ELISA). It was shown that Itk does not exhibit noticeable differences neither in structure, nor in localization in resting cells, but changes conformation and localization patterns under stimulation in T-cell-APC system. This event is pronounced in statistically significant manner in wild type Itk, but is disrupted to different extent in mutants. PH domain mutant FYF is the only one from those explored that has disrupted localization pattern, and surprisingly, nonfunctional activation residue mutant Y511F preserves intact localization. However, all mutants show disruption in structural pattern when compared to wild type Itk. Another novel finding is related to Itk-SLP-76 interaction, which proved to be disrupted in BtkSH3 mutant that lacks noncanonical SH3 domain interactions, pointing on important role of noncanonical SH3 interactions in signaling of Itk in complex with SLP-76, and as a result in activation of Itk. All mutants show some extent of disruption in Y511 phosphorylation, which has a direct effect on downstream events as assessed by PLCGamma phosphorylation, and reflects defects in structure and localization patterns, with mutants being significantly deficient comparing to wild type. This results in even more pronounced effect in Th2 cytokine production, and this dissertation provides the first evidence of the influence of these mutants on Th2 cytokines, which are the signature cytokines of Itk. The dissertation proposes explanations of the mentioned phenomena, underlines an importance of different parts of Itk molecule in its functionality, and makes possible to apply the data acquired here to further understand the role of Itk in deeper detail with possible clinical implications in the future

WPP, No.110: Registers in tonal contrasts
This study revisits the issue of tonal registers by exploring the cues used in producing andperceiving the five level tones of Black Miao. Both production and perception experiments show that non-modal phonations are very important cues for tonal contrasts. Two different kinds of non-modal phonations that either enhance pitch contrasts or provide an additional contrastive cue divide tonal levels into several registers. Benefiting from more than one cue, 11, 33 and 55 are well distinguished in the tonal space; by contrast, 22 and 44, only contrasting in pitch, are the most confusable tones. The tonal registers model can explain the different uses of non-modal phonations across languages.

Recommendation for Mitigations of the Electron Cloud Instability in the ILC
Electron cloud has been identified as one of the highest priority issues for the international Linear Collider (ILC) Damping Rings (DR). An electron cloud Working Group (WG) has evaluated the electron cloud effect and instability, and mitigation solutions for the electron cloud formation. Working group deliverables include recommendations for the baseline and alternate solutions to the electron cloud formation in various regions of the ILC Positron DR, which is presently assumed to be the 3.2 km design. Detailed studies of a range of mitigation options including coatings, clearing electrodes, grooves and novel concepts, were carried out over the previous several years by nearly 50 researchers, and the results of the studies form the basis for the recommendation. The recommendations are the result of the working group discussions held at numerous meetings and during a dedicated workshop. In addition, a number of items requiring further investigation were identified during the discussions at the Cornell meeting and studies will be carried out at CesrTA, a test accelerator dedicated to electron cloud studies, and other institutions.

Microbial and Colloidal Deposition to Solid Surfaces: Effect of Heterogeneity
Microbial and colloidal particle transport and deposition onto solid surfaces are of great significance to many environmental and technological processes. Initial attachment of particles is governed by the interactions between particles and surfaces. Classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory is utilized to predict interactions between particles and surfaces. However, discrepancies between experimental observations and theoretical predictions exist and the failure of the predictive model is often attributed to particle and solid collector physical and chemical heterogeneities.This work sought to elucidate the contribution of heterogeneity to the initial particle deposition behavior in a radial stagnation point flow system or a parallel plate flow chamber system by systematically adjusting particle type and size, as well as collector surface chemical and/or physical properties. In Chapter 2 and 3, the role of particle heterogeneity (type and size) was examined. Comparable deposition trends were observed between particles, in this case groundwater and marine bacteria, <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> G4g and <italic>Halomonas pacifica</italic> g, respectively. However, the deposition kinetics of <italic>H. pacifica</italic> g appeared to be more sensitive to solution chemistry than that of <italic>B. cepacia</italic> G4g. Experimental results also demonstrated that particle size (colloidal and bacterial) had a considerable impact on the transport and interaction with surfaces. In Chapter 4, a method to influence collector surface charge and subsequent colloid deposition was described. Experimental results suggest colloids respond to local variations in surface potential through electrostatic interactions, altering particle streamlines flowing along the surface, and ultimately the extent of deposition. In Chapter 5, cell deposition onto bare and zeolite coated aluminum alloy and stainless steel surfaces was investigated using bacterium <italic>H. pacifica</italic> g. Collector surface properties found to have the most notable effect on cell attachment were the electrokinetic and hydrophobic nature of the bare metal and zeolite coated surfaces. In Chapter 6, the relative impact of physical roughness on antifouling nature of zeolite surfaces, as compared to these other chemical mechanisms was investigated.This comprehensive dissertation project established both particle and collector surface heterogeneity has a significant effect on particle deposition, which was clearly identified by altering various physical and chemical interaction parameters between particles and surfaces.

Comparative analysis of complete mitochondrial genome sequences confirms independent origins of plant-parasitic nematodes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The nematode infraorder Tylenchomorpha (Class Chromadorea) includes plant parasites that are of agricultural and economic importance, as well as insect-associates and fungal feeding species. Among tylenchomorph plant parasites, members of the superfamily Tylenchoidea, such as root-knot nematodes, have great impact on agriculture. Of the five superfamilies within Tylenchomorpha, one (Aphelenchoidea) includes mainly fungal-feeding species, but also some damaging plant pathogens, including certain Bursaphelenchus spp. The evolutionary relationships of tylenchoid and aphelenchoid nematodes have been disputed based on classical morphological features and molecular data. For example, similarities in the structure of the stomatostylet suggested a common evolutionary origin. In contrast, phylogenetic hypotheses based on nuclear SSU ribosomal DNA sequences have revealed paraphyly of Aphelenchoidea, with, for example, fungal-feeding Aphelenchus spp. within Tylenchomorpha, but Bursaphelenchus and Aphelenchoides spp. more closely related to infraorder Panagrolaimomorpha. We investigated phylogenetic relationships of plant-parasitic tylenchoid and aphelenchoid species in the context of other chromadorean nematodes based on comparative analysis of complete mitochondrial genome data, including two newly sequenced genomes from Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Aphelenchoidea) and Pratylenchus vulnus (Tylenchoidea).
				
				
					
						Results
					The complete mitochondrial genomes of B. xylophilus and P. vulnus are 14,778 bp and 21,656 bp, respectively, and identical to all other chromadorean nematode mtDNAs in that they contain 36 genes (lacking atp8) encoded in the same direction. Their mitochondrial protein-coding genes are biased toward use of amino acids encoded by T-rich codons, resulting in high A+T richness. Phylogenetic analyses of both nucleotide and amino acid sequence datasets using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods did not support B. xylophilus as most closely related to Tylenchomorpha (Tylenchoidea). Instead, B. xylophilus, was nested within a strongly supported clade consisting of species from infraorders Rhabditomorpha, Panagrolaimomorpha, Diplogasteromorpha, and Ascaridomorpha. The clade containing sampled Tylenchoidea (P. vulnus, H. glycines, and R. similis) was sister to all analyzed chromadoreans. Comparison of gene arrangement data was also consistent with the phylogenetic relationships as inferred from sequence data. Alternative tree topologies depicting a monophyletic grouping of B. xylophilus (Aphelenchoidea) plus Tylenchoidea, Tylenchoidea plus Diplogasteromorpha (Pristionchus pacificus), or B. xylophilus plus Diplogasteromorpha were significantly worse interpretations of the mtDNA data.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Phylogenetic trees inferred from nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mtDNA coding genes are in agreement that B. xylophilus (the single representative of Aphelenchoidea) is not closely related to Tylenchoidea, indicating that these two groups of plant parasites do not share an exclusive most recent common ancestor, and that certain morphological similarities between these stylet-bearing nematodes must result from convergent evolution. In addition, the exceptionally large mtDNA genome size of P. vulnus, which is the largest among chromadorean nematode mtDNAs sequenced to date, results from lengthy repeated segments in non-coding regions.

Individual and collective analyses of the genesis of student reasoning regarding the invertible matrix theorem in linear algebra
In this study, I considered the development of mathematical meaning related to the Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT) for both a classroom community and an individual student over time. In this particular linear algebra course, the IMT was a core theorem in that it connected many concepts fundamental to linear algebra through the notion of equivalency. As the semester progressed, the IMT took form and developed meaning as students came to reason about the ways in which key ideas involved were connected. As such, the two research questions that guided my dissertation work were : 1. How did the collective classroom community reason about the Invertible Matrix Theorem over time? 2. How did an individual student, Abraham, reason about the Invertible Matrix Theorem over time? Data for this study came from the third iteration of a semester-long classroom teaching experiment (Cobb, 2000) in an inquiry-oriented introductory linear algebra course. Data sources were video and transcript of whole class and small group discussion. To address the second research question, data from two individual semi-structured interviews, as well as written work, were also analyzed. The overarching analytical structure of my methodology was influenced by a framework of genetic analysis through the notion of cultural change, using two interrelated strands of microgenesis and ontogenesis (Saxe, 2002). I utilized two analytical tools, adjacency matrices and Toulmin's Model of argumentation, to analyze the structure of explanations related to the IMT both in isolation and as they shift over time. In addition to an in-depth analysis of the complex ways in which Abraham and the classroom community reasoned about the IMT throughout the semester, this dissertation presents methodological contributions regarding the two analytical tools. First, it necessitates the definition of four new argumentation schemes that are expanded versions of Toulmin's model. Second, it further adapts and refines the use of adjacency matrices within mathematics education research to analyze student thinking, both at static moments and over time. Finally, the present study lays a strong foundation for a 2-fold analytical coordination. The first coordinates results from adjacency matrix analysis with those from Toulmin's Model to demonstrate they were often compatible, with the tools varying in their respective strengths and limitations. Second, the present study lays a foundation for coordinating the mathematical development of both the individual and the collective units of analysis

A Tidal Hydrology Assessment for Reconnecting Spring Branch Creek to Suisun Marsh, Solano County CA:  Predicting the Impact to the Federally Listed Plant Soft Bird's Beak
ABSTRACT
      Spring Branch Creek drains a 2,670-acre watershed into tidally influencedSuisun Marsh in Suisun City, Solano County, CA. A farm levee road and berm that were constructed in the 1930s to drain the site for agriculture created an abrupt transition between fluvialand tidal systems. In the 1990s, the landowner Solano Land Trust installed two four-foot culverts beneath the levee road in attempt to partially restore the exchange of brackish tidal water with fresh water. Ten years later (in 2000), a population of federally listed plant soft bird’s beak (Chloropyron molle ssp. molle, syn., Cordylanthus mollis ssp. mollis) was reintroduced in the high marsh zone under these altered hydro-logical conditions and is now a thriving population of 100,000 individuals. Now, a proposal to remove the levee completely, and reconnect fluvialand tidal systems, raised concern that the livelihood of this population might be compromised by altering the hydrological conditions. I conducted a tidal inundation analysis to describe the differences in current inundation frequency, duration, and depth in the high and low marsh zones, and above and below the Spring Branch Creek culverts. I also created a water surface model to predict how these hydrological differences will change following reconnection. Results show that hydrological conditions in the high marsh zone, where soft bird’s beak occurs, will not significantly change following reconnection, with tidal changes of only 5-6 cm. Water elevation ranges in the low marsh zone, however, are predicted to decrease as much as 55 cm, and could possibly affect low marsh vegetation. Threats beyond the proposed hydrological reconnection that directly impact the plant include competition from non-native species. Thus, monitoring of population viability should continue after reconnection.

Expression of Genes Linked to NOx Detoxification in Aerobic Bacteria
Microorganisms capable of nitrifier denitrification and aerobic denitrification are of significant interest due to their release of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O in the atmosphere. Studies have therefore focused on the physiology and genetic diversity in organisms capable of nitrogen oxide (NOx) metabolism in the production of these gases. Genomic analysis of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) revealed the presence of NOx-related gene homologues normally present in denitrifying bacteria. Thought to serve in NO detoxification, these genes include nitrite reductase (<italic>nirK</italic>), nitric oxide reductases (<italic>norB</italic> and <italic>norS</italic>), and cytochromes P460 (<italic>cytL</italic>) and c' beta (<italic>cytS</italic>). The goal of the study in Chapter 2 was to determine regulation of these genes in three representative AOB grown in HEPES- or phosphate- buffered media in the presence of 0, 10, and 20mM NaNO<sub>2</sub>. Results indicate that differential regulation of homologous genes occurs in each AOB in response to nitrite, suggesting different mechanisms in coping with nitrosative stress.	<italic>Sphingomonas wittichii </italic> RW1 contains genes involved in NOx metabolism, including <italic>nirK</italic>, <italic>norB</italic>, <italic>norZ</italic>, and <italic>hmp</italic> (encoding flavohemoglobin), but has no previous history of denitrification. The goal of the study in Chapter 3 was to determine whether these genes were regulated in response to nitrite under initial 20% and 3% oxygen levels. <italic>S. wittichii</italic> RW1 was not capable of nitrite respiration. High basal mRNA levels of these genes indicate differential regulation by oxygen. Increased levels of <italic>hmp</italic> and <italic>norB</italic> mRNA in NO<sub>2</sub><super>-</super> -treated groups under low O<sub>2</sub> suggest hypoxic function and activity. Total nitrite consumption was observed, and aerobic production of N<sub>2</sub>O was greatest in treated cells incubated under 3% O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, <italic>S. wittichii</italic> is capable of aerobic denitrification, in the detoxification of nitrite.	A Delta;<italic>norZ</italic> mutant was constructed in <italic>S. wittichii</italic> for the study in Chapter 4 to determine the roles of the two <italic>nor</italic> genes with respect to aerobic N<sub>2</sub>O production. Total nitrite consumption occurred indicating a functional activity of <italic>nirK</italic>. The Delta;<italic>norZ</italic> strain was able to produce N<sub>2</sub>O, though significantly less compared to wildtype cells. An increase in <italic>norB</italic> mRNA levels in NO<sub>2</sub><super>-</super> -treated cells was observed, suggesting compensation for the loss of NorZ function. 	The studies presented show that nitrite differentially affected transcription of <italic>nirK</italic>, <italic>amoA</italic>, and <italic>norS</italic> in the AOB. In <italic>S. wittichii</italic>, NOx- related genes are regulated by oxygen and collectively used to aerobically detoxify nitrite, resulting in N<sub>2</sub>O production; additionally, <italic>norB</italic> is an isofunctional NO reductase.

The unusual feature of the formation of virion-filled vesicles by these large, complex, double-stranded DNA viruses results from a process similar to apoptosis, but one modified to rescue the developing apoptotic bodies for viral reproduction and virion dissemination. Another unusual feature of these viruses is their dependence on transmission by endoparasitic wasps that deposit their eggs in a lepidopteran host. Four species of ascoviruses have been sequenced and reveal a range of genes involved in apoptosis, RNA metabolism, and lipid metabolism. In the present dissertation, the research focuses on characterization of a novel type of DNA binding protein, P64 along with its homologs, responsible for condensing viral genomic DNA as part of the process of virion assembly.     Proteomic, electron microscopic, and biochemical studies demonstrated that P64 is a major virion protein which bound to and condensed DNA prior to virion core formation and envelopment. Mobility shift assays, bioinformatics, and additional electron microscopy data provided strong evidence that P64 and its homologs constitute a novel family of DNA condensing proteins. The combination of P64's highly basic nature, its large size relative to known viral/eukaryotic genome condensing proteins, its non-specific DNA binding activity, and the presence of two distinct and unique domains suggest that these proteins evolved in certain complex DNA viruses to condense and assist the packaging of newly synthesized viral genomes as part of the assembly of progeny virions. Preliminary data suggest that P64 might associate with other virion structural proteins once it has bound to condensed DNA.      Finally, phylogenetic analyses and results of binding studies showed that P64 is related to DNA binding proteins from viruses of the closely related <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> family, which provided additional evidence that the ascoviruses evolved from iridoviruses.

Bayesian Analysis of MTD/BMTD Models
In reality many time series are non-linear and non-gaussian. They show the characters like flat stretches, bursts of activity and outliers. (Bivariate) Mixture Transition Distribution model are introduced  to study these time series data.   EM algorithm is used for point estimations of parameters. However as is known, for many mixture models, the likelihoods couldn't be maximized since they will go to infinity. Number of mixtures should be prefixed in this way but in many realities it is unknown.  In our research, Bayesian methods are used to solve these problems. When the posterior is got, EM algorithm is used to maximize the posterior. Under some conditions these estimates are proved to be consistent. The second method is using MCMC to sample from the posterior and now number of mixtures itself can be treated as a random variable. Two methods for MCMC sampling are used. The first is Birth-Death process: if a birth happens, a new mixture component is added; if a death happens, an existed mixture will disappear. The second is Dirichlet process mixtures where we choose Dirichlet process priors for the parameters. When using MCMC, not only point estimations but also interval estimations can be constructed. For all these methods we do simulations to compare   Bayesian methods with non-Bayesian methods and to show the excellence of Bayesian methods.

The International Biogeography Society: enabling a dynamic discipline
Biogeography is a dynamic field that has transformed dramatically over the last few decades from being necessarily descriptive to become a rigorous science. Major recent areas of growth have included phylogenetics and phylogeography, microbial biogeography and metagenomics, and macroecology. However, the welcome recent deluge of massive amounts of data, in particular from genomics, museum specimens, and field observations, as well as environmental information, is posing a huge challenge to the field. The society has several key roles, not only to serve as a home for researchers in the field and enabling interaction among them, but also: (1) to provide a forum to facilitate awareness and use of rapidly developing tools and data; (2) to encourage a solid foundation in organismal research, with emphasis on field and museum based resources; (3) to promote global connections; and (4) to cultivate interdisciplinarity, such that the predictive capabilities of the field can be used to inform management and policy.

Nitrogen Fixation and Dentrification in Sediments of Eutrophic Mediterranean-Type Estuaries: Seasonal Patterns and Responses to Anthropogenic Nitrogen Inputs
Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems at the interface of terrestrial and oceanic nutrient cycles. Nitrogen (N) fixation and denitrification are key N-cycle components that add or remove N, respectively. In mediterranean-type estuaries, wet and dry seasons affect freshwater inflows and nutrient inputs, and greater coastal development and agriculture increases anthropogenic nutrient inputs, often leading to eutrophication. My research expands understanding of N-cycling in modified mediterranean-type estuaries subject to increasing nutrient influences. Using field surveys and manipulations, I investigated spatial and temporal patterns of N-fixation and relationships with abiotic characteristics and impacts of nutrient inputs on N-fixation and denitrification in unvegetated sediments of intertidal mudflats in southern California estuaries.A 2-year survey determined N-fixation was influenced by seasonal precipitation, yet played a minor role in supplying N. During dry conditions porewater ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><super>+</super>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super>) were negatively related to N-fixation. In wet conditions, porewater salinity and N-fixation showed a negative relationship, despite simultaneously high NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super>. Only a small proportion of N-fixation variability was explained by these factors, possibly because salinity and NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super> typically co-vary and have conflicting relationships with N-fixation.In a microcosm experiment, sediments were subjected to elevated NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super> and phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><super>3-</super>) concentrations, alone and together. NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super> concentrations up to 2730&#956;M significantly affected both processes; N-fixation decreased up to 40%, while denitrification increased up to 180-fold. However, denitrification was too low to compensate for high N inputs. In a small, highly modified estuary, I determined N-fixation and denitrification rates under simulated low and high tide and NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super> enriched conditions. There were no differences in N-fixation or denitrification between ambient emerged and submerged conditions, suggesting rates do not vary across tidal cycles. Both processes responded significantly to N-enrichment; N-fixation decreased up to 9-fold and denitrification increased more than 100-fold.	Overall, N-fixation rates were comparable to other eutrophic mediterranean-type systems, though lower than in more oligotrophic systems. Denitrification was lower than in other eutrophic estuaries despite dramatic increases in activity under high NO<sub>3</sub><super>-</super>. These results provide insight into how N is supplied internally in mediterranean-type estuaries with anthropogenic nutrient impacts and suggest additional nutrient management strategies are necessary to reduce anthropogenic eutrophication.

Techniques in two-photon microscopy for neuroscience
Fluorescence imaging in biology has become a fundamental tool to understanding structure and function. In addition, the past two decades has seen the first implementation, and subsequent widespread use, of two-photon scanning laser microscopy as a tool to allow fluorescent data to be acquired in new modalities, such as imaging at depth, complete three-dimensional reconstructions, rapid acquisition of cellular activity, and accurate assessment of cerebral blood flow at the level of individual vessels. This thesis examines the use of two-photon microscopy to study neurovascular coupling, the process by which computational mechanism in the brain actively reroute blood flow to regions of increased neural activity, where it is needed the most. Understanding the mechanisms through which this occurs is an active area of research, and represent a "sweet spot'' in terms of complexity: the function of the system can be stated simply, and many of the mechanisms involved are understood in isolation. However, putting everything together into a complete picture has remained elusive, and understanding how the brain accomplishes this seemingly simple task should provide insight into the general computational mechanisms of the brain. Central to this research was the development of scanning hardware and software techniques that allow the rapid acquisition of the biologically relevant variables with high signal-to-noise ratios. This lead to the development of computer control software for creating user-defined scan lines, which can interface with machine learning programs for quickly and accurately identifying relevant regions in the field of view, and photon-counting hardware to make the most out of the limited amount of light that can be collected per unit time. The photon- counting hardware and firmware, developed at UCSD, let to some unexpected and previously unanalyzed findings about what happens to the signal under high light conditions, and the resulting analysis and corrections are generally useful to two-photon microscopy. It is hoped that the data acquisition and analysis tools discussed here, and currently being used in the laboratory, will help advance the field of neuroscience, and provide some insight to long standing questions in brain function

Electrical Transport in Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene
This thesis summarizes our work in the past few years in the field of transport studies of carbon nanotubes and graphene. The first half of the thesis focuses on carbon nanotube (CNT) Josephson junctions (JJ) formed by coupling CNTs to superconducting electrodes. They exhibited Fabry Perot resonance patterns, enhanced differential conductance peaks, multiple Andreev reflection peaks, gate-tunable supercurrent transistor behaviors, hysteretic current-voltage line shape and "superconductor-insulator" transition. The junction behavior can be understood based on the dissipation dynamics and phase diffusion on the model of resistively and capacitively shunted junctions (RCSJ). In addition, we investigated Fano resonance on a particular device. The transport spectroscopy exhibited "inverse" Coulomb blockade structures superimposed on Fabry-Perot resonance patterns, indicating quantum interference between a channel that is well-coupled to the electrodes and another channel that is poorly-coupled channel. Our transport data was reproduced reasonably by the simulation. The second half of the thesis discusses our results on graphene. Firstly, by developing a technique to fabricate suspended top gates, we were able to fabricate exceedingly clean, high quality graphene pnp junctions. In the high magnetic fields, we observed quantum hall plateaus at fractional values, which arise from edge state propagation and equilibration in regions with different filling factors, in agreement with the theoretical predictions. In zero magnetic fields, we observed Fabry-Perot conductance oscillations in the bipolar regime, demonstrating the high quality of our devices. Secondly, we explored specular Andreev reflection and have observed conductance peaks at the superconducting energy gap in normal metal - graphene - superconductor (NS) junctions. However, the intended goal of the project, observation of specular Andreev reflection, was not achieved. As significant progress has been made towards fabrication of high quality suspended devices, we expect that specular Andreev reflection could be observed in the near future.

Structural analysis of a forkhead-associated domain from the type III secretion system protein YscD
The type III secretion system, T3SS, is used by many bacterial pathogens to evade the host immune response. The T3SS utilizes a multiprotein complex, the injectisome, to transport virulence proteins directly into the host cytosol. Injectisome proteins extend from the bacterial cytosol, across the bacterial inner and outer membranes, and into the extracellular space. A crucial injectisome protein from the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis T3SS is YscD. YscD is an inner membrane protein that has both cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the cytoplasmic domain of YscD, YscDc, is presented here. YscDc has a forkhead- associated (FHA) domain fold. Based on structural comparisons between the FHA domain of YscDc and FHA domains of known function, two regions of possible importance were identified within YscDc : loops beta3beta4 and beta4beta5. Type III secretion in Y. pseudotuberculosis was abolished when loop beta3beta4 and beta4beta5 amino acids were substituted by alanines. The FHA domain of YscD was determined to be crucial for the function of the T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis. The FHA domain of YscDc is highly similar in sequence to YscD homologs of other T3SS- encoding bacteria. This domain may be significant for injectisome structural integrity or may be engaged in critical protein-protein interactions with cytosolic T3SS proteins. Understanding the role that this FHA domain plays in the T3SS will provide insight into the role of a protein crucial for injectisome assembly and T3SS function

Jakob Bernoulli's Theory of Inference
This review of Ars Conjectandi, written on the eve of its 300th anniversary, discusses an aspect of Bernoulli’s magnum opus which hitherto has not received the attention it merits. Bernoulli envisioned a theory for the advancement of science based on the idea of pairing empirical evidence with the then-novel concept of probability. This theory of inference, which he termed “ars conjectandi”, was intended to complement the predominant axiomatic-deductive method where the latter could not be applied successfully. In the 300 years since its publication, Bernoulli’s idea went through ups and downs, but eventually ended up as the deﬁning characteristic of statistical science and a cornerstone of modern science. This review discusses the historical context from which Bernoulli’s idea was conceived, his sources of inspiration, and provides a detailed account of his theory of inference.

Protease-Activated Receptor-2 in the Intestinal Epithelium & Differential Effects of Beta Arrestins on the Internalization, Desensitization & ERK 1/2 Activation Downstream of Protease-Activated Receptor-2
Research of G-protein coupled receptor signaling (GPCR) for therapeutic applications have historically been a hot topic of research.  In the past, GPCR studies have been primarily focused on the molecular mechanism of its signaling pathway debunking the components of either traditional G-protein signaling or by other novel and more complex signaling pathways.  However, recent GPCR studies have transitioned to examining distinct behaviors exhibited by and physiological responses that are triggered by cell- and localization-specific GPCRs.  These responses include inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, cell migration and metastasis.  Further, research of GPCR signaling have extended to the utilization of "biased agonists" where these modified agonists activates a specific GPCR and have the ability to trigger the activation of a specific pathway and inhibit other pathways that otherwise is propagated via activation by the non-modified agonist.    In the first study, we focus on the two distinct pools of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) present in intestinal epithelial cells: an apical pool facing the lumen, and a basolateral pool facing the bloodstream.  Studies have demonstrated that introduction of PAR-2 agonists such as 2-furoyl-LIGRL-O-NH2 (2fAP) to the lumen can activate apical PAR-2 while it has been predicted mast cells and recruited leukocytes release proteases that can activate basolateral PAR-2.  However, whether both pools of PAR-2 are equally capable of signaling, and the possible distinction between apical and basolateral PAR-2 induced responses have yet been addressed.  Here we identified the expression of both apical and basolateral PAR-2 in cultured CACO2-BBe monolayers, and in mouse proximal jejunum.  We reveal apical and basolateral PAR-2 in the intestinal epithelium are accessible by PAR-2 agonist 2fAP, and have both temporally and mechanistically signaling distinctions.  Further, we demonstrate the apical and basolateral pools of PAR-2 can trigger distinct physiological responses as well.  Secondly, we illustrate that PAR-2 activation enhanced bacteria uptake in cultured colonocytes via a clathrin and phosphotidyl-inositol-3-kinase dependent manner.  Moreover, we show that PAR-2 activation stimulated bacteria uptake in mice intestines.  These results suggested that activation of the receptor plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction and is indeed a contributing factor to bacterial infection, further allowing for better understanding of PAR-2 and its physiological role in the gastrointestinal system. On the whole these studies attempts to provide clarification for the characterization of PAR-2 in the gastrointestinal system that can be used further in the research for the usage of PAR-2 as a therapeutic target. Lastly, findings for which I was a supporting author in a recent publication, we examined the differential effects of &#946;-arrestins on internalization, desensitization and signaling of PAR-2.  We demonstrate here that &#946;-arrestin-1 and &#946;-arrestins-2 have distinctive roles in PAR-2 signaling, including mechanistic and temporal distinctions in signaling, signal termination, cellular localization of signaling components and degradation.

Structural Equation Modeling of Travel Choice Dynamics
This research has two objectives. The first objective is to explore the use of the modeling tool called "latent structural equations" (structural equations with latent variables) in the general field of travel behavior analysis and the more specific field of dynamic analysis of travel behavior. The second objective is to apply a latent structural equation model in order to determine the causal relationships between income, car ownership, and mobility.
      Many transportation researchers might be unfamiliar with latent structural equation modeling, which is also known as "latent structural analysis," "causal analysis," and "soft modeling." However, most researchers will be quite familiar with techniques that are special cases of latent structural equations: e.g., conventional multiple regression and simultaneous equations, path analysis, and (confirmatory) factor analysis. Furthermore, recent advances in estimation techniques have made it possible to incorporate discrete choice variables and other non-normal variables in structural equations models. Thus, probit choice models (binomial, ordered, and multinomial) can be incorporated within the general model framework.
      The empirical analysis reported here involves dynamic travel demand data from the Dutch National Mobility Panel for the three years 1984 through 1986. All variables in the model, with the exception of income level in the first year, are endogenous: income is treated as an ordinal (four category) variable; car ownership is treated as either an ordinal (ordered probit) or a categorical (multinomial probit) choice variable; and mobility, in terms of car trips and public transport trips, is treated as two censored (tobit) continuous variables. The model fits the data well, but only scratches the surface of the potential of latent structural equation modeling with panel data. Some possible extensions are outlined.
      The methodological discussion is not intended as a comprehensive overview of structural equation modeling with latent variables. Rather, the aim is to explore the technique in comparison to conventional methods of travel behavior analysis. Many extensive overviews are available, due to the popularity of the technique in the fields of sociology and psychology, and more recently in marketing research. The technique as described here has been in use since the early 1970s, but, because of recent rapid developments, current overviews are more relevant to transportation researchers. Such overviews are provided by Bentler (1980), Bentler and Weeks (1985), Fornell and Larcker (1981), Hayduk (1987), and Joreskog and Wold (1982), among others. In particular, Hayduk (1897) provides an extensive bibliography. Historical developments are reviewed in Bentler (1986) and Bielby and Hauser (1977).
      The author is aware of three computer programs for latent structural equation modeling: LISREL (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1984; 1987), EQS (Bentler, 1985), and LISCOMP (Muthen, 1987). Each program is based on a different approach to estimation and testing and each has its advantages and disadvantages. The three approaches are briefly reviewed in Section 6 on estimation methods. The application results presented here were obtained using the LISCOMP program. It is also possible to replicate the approaches of these programs by implementing several separate estimation procedures (e.g., maximum likelihood estimations of probit models and tobit models, and generalized least square and maximum likelihood estimations of siumultaneous equations) in sequential and recursive order, but this is inefficient in view of the available comprehensive packages.

Aerosol effects on red blue ratio of clear sky images, and impact on solar forecasting
To address solar variability, ground based whole-sky imaging (WSI) techniques have been developed for solar forecasting. In WSI the red-blue-ratio (RBR) from a few clear days is used as a reference to detect clouds in the imagery throughout the year. However, due to changes in atmospheric aerosol concentration (parameterized by Aerosol Optical Thickness, AOT) and size distribution (parameterized by Angstrom Parameter, AP), the solar spectrum significantly varies between clear days. As a result, cloud detection methods are unable to distinguish optically thin clouds from clear skies with high aerosol content. In this work we examine the correlation between RBR and AOT and AP for 18 clear days in San Diego, California. The AP was only weakly correlated to RBR, while a strong correlation to between RBR and AOT was observed. Consequently, AOT can be modeled based on sky imagery. Alternatively, RBR measurements can be auto- calibrated to yield better dynamic thresholds for cloud detection in WSI

Cell-intrinsic Transforming Growth Factor-beta signaling mediates virus-specific CD8⁺ T cell deletion and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus persistence in vivo
Chronic viral infections lead to a delicate long-term equilibrium between pathogen and host and represent a major biomedical problem for human populations worldwide. Although, in both humans and mice, viral persistence has been associated with insufficient numbers and/or dysfunction of effector CD8⁺ T cells, the underlying mechanisms involved in these pathogen evasion strategies are not completely understood. By using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in its natural murine host, we found that enhanced and sustained Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression and phosphorylation of its signaling mediator, Smad-2, were distinctive features of virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells during chronic versus acute viral infections in vivo. Selective attenuation of TGF-beta pathway in T cells decreased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and increased survival and numbers of virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells. Under these conditions, virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity, increased production of anti-viral cytokines, and down-regulation of the inhibitory molecules programmed-death-1 (PD-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). The presence of these enhanced numbers of functional virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells resulted in rapid virus eradication and generation of an effective memory T cell response that protected the host upon subsequent challenge. Notably, we found that cell- intrinsic TGF-beta signaling was responsible for virus- specific-CD8⁺ T cell apoptosis but was not necessary for their functional exhaustion. Our findings demonstrate that sustained TGF-beta -Smad signaling is as a hallmark and biologically meaningful regulator of CD8⁺ T cell responses during chronic viral infection in vivo

Topics in Scattering Amplitudes
In Part 1, we combine on-shell methods with the six-dimensional helicity formalism of Cheung and O'Connell to construct tree-level and multiloop scattering amplitudes. As a nontrivial multiloop example, we confirm that the recently constructed four-loop four-point amplitude of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, including nonplanar contributions, is valid for dimensions less than or equal to six. We demonstrate that the tree-level amplitudes of maximal super-Yang-Mills theory in six dimensions, when stripped of their overall momentum and supermomentum delta functions, are covariant with respect to the six-dimensional dual conformal group. We demonstrate that this property is also present for loop amplitudes. In Part 2, we explore consequences of the recently discovered duality between color and kinematics, which states that kinematic numerators in a diagrammatic expansion of gauge-theory amplitudes can be arranged to satisfy Jacobi-like identities in one-to-one correspondence to the associated color factors. The related squaring relations express gravity amplitudes in terms of gauge-theory ingredients. We then present a Yang-Mills Lagrangian whose diagrams through five points manifestly satisfy the duality between color and kinematics. Finally, we compute the coefficient of the potential three-loop divergence in pure N=4 supergravity and show that it vanishes, contrary to expectations from symmetry arguments.

Fleshly Embodiments: Early Modern Monsters, Victorian Freaks, and Twentieth-Century Affective Spectatorship
ABSTRACTSara E. S. OrningFleshly Embodiments: Early Modern Monsters, Victorian Freaks, and Twentieth-Century Affective SpectatorshipThe primary theoretical concern in this dissertation is to put the embodied, non-Cartesian subject at the center of the emergence of the normative human body and the experience of affective spectatorship. My investigation is set against the backdrop of the ontological privileging of the human in Western culture since the Renaissance, and an aim of my analysis is to provide an account of how the human came to occupy this position. I draw in particular on Michel Foucault's genealogical method, which focuses on the emergence of phenomena instead of searching for their origins, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology to make a claim about the sustained effect of Descartes's <italic>cogito</italic> on how we conceive of our humanness and embodiment.In the first part of the dissertation, I examine the development of humanness by looking at its relationship with monstrosity in popular and scientific literature from the mid-1500s to the late-1800s, especially Ambroise Paré's <italic>On Monsters and Marvels</italic> (1543) and nineteenth-century medical literature. From existing on a continuum with a range of other agents - animals, gods, monsters, nature - in early modern Europe, the human gradually became the advantaged being towards the end of the seventeenth century and other agents ceased to matter in any meaningful way. This shift occurs around the same time as the emergence of a systematic anatomical knowledge of the so-called normal and abnormal human body, based on dissection. I argue that the normative body is challenged and deconstructed by the lived experience of the female, literary freaks in Katherine Dunn's <italic>Geek Love</italic> (1983) and Angela Carter's <italic>Nights at the Circus</italic> (1984). They refuse the Cartesian split that enables the designation of normal or abnormal in the first place.In the second part of the dissertation, I draw on phenomenological approaches to film, especially Vivian Sobchack's <italic>Carnal Knowledge</italic> (2004), and my own experiences as a spectator to formulate a theory of spectatorship built on embodied knowledge. In my examination of recent uncomfortable French films, such as <italic>Romance</italic> (1999), <italic>The Piano Teacher</italic> (2001), and <italic>In My Skin</italic> (2001), I argue that the affective, affected subject is key to theorizing cinema because it opens up for considering the lived body as a site for generating and interpreting knowledge. In conclusion, this study offers a corporeal history of the emergence of humanness, focusing especially on the trajectory of the mind/body split and ending with a call to revise our Cartesian vocabulary.

The expression and regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 is critically modulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide with heterogeneous lipid A structures in human gingival fibroblasts
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial virulence factor strongly associated with chronic periodontitis which is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. It exhibits remarkable heterogeneity containing tetra-(LPS1435/1449) and penta-(LPS1690) acylated lipid A structures. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) as the main resident cells of human gingiva play a key role in regulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and contribute to periodontal homeostasis. This study investigated the expression and regulation of MMPs1-3 and tissue inhibitors of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) in HGFs in response to P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449 and LPS1690 and hexa-acylated E. coli LPS as a reference. The expression of MMPs 1&#8211;3 and TIMP-1 was evaluated by real-time PCR and ELISA.
				
				
					
						Results
					The MMP-3 mRNA and protein were highly upregulated in P. gingivalis LPS1690- and E. coli LPS-treated cells, whereas no induction was observed in P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449-treated cells. On the contrary, the expression of MMP-1 and &#8722;2 was not significantly affected by P. gingivalis LPS lipid A heterogeneity. The TIMP-1 mRNA was upregulated in P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449- and E. coli LPS-treated cells. Next, signal transduction pathways involved in P. gingivalis LPS-induced expression of MMP-3 were examined by blocking assays. Blockage of p38 MAPK and ERK significantly inhibited P. gingivalis LPS1690-induced MMP-3 expression in HGFs.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					The present findings suggest that the heterogeneous lipid A structures of P. gingivalis LPS differentially modulate the expression of MMP-3 in HGFs, which may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.

Lateral Quantum Dots for Quantum Information Processing
The possibility of building a computer that takes advantage of the most subtle nature of quantum physics has been driving a lot of research in atomic and solid state physics for some time. It is still not clear what physical system or systems can be used for this purpose. One possibility that has been attracting significant attention from researchers is to use the spin state of an electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot. The electron spin is magnetic in nature, so it naturally is well isolated from electrical fluctuations that can a loss of quantum coherence. It can also be manipulated electrically, by taking advantage of the exchange interaction. In this work we describe several experiments we have done to study the electron spin properties of lateral quantum dots. We have developed lateral quantum dot devices based on the silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor, and studied the physics of electrons confined in these quantum dots. We measured the electron spin excited state lifetime, which was found to be as long as 30 ms at the lowest magnetic fields that we could measure. We fabricated and characterized a silicon double quantum dot. Using this double quantum dot design, we fabricated devices which combined a silicon double quantum dot with a superconducting microwave resonator. The microwave resonator was found to be sensitive to two-dimensional electrons in the transistor channel, which we measured and characterized. We developed a new method for extracting information from random telegraph signals, which are produced when we observe thermal fluctuations of electrons in quantum dots. The new statistical method, based on the hidden Markov model, allows us to detect spin-dependent effects in such fluctuations even though we are not able to directly observe the electron spin. We use this analysis technique on data from two experiments involving gallium arsenide quantum dots and use it to measure spin-dependent tunneling rates. Our results advance the understanding of electron spin physics in lateral quantum dots, in silicon and in gallium arsenide.

The chemical-in-plug bacterial chemotaxis assay is prone to false positive responses
Abstract



Background

Chemical-in-plug assays are commonly used to study bacterial chemotaxis, sometimes in the absence of stringent controls.



Results

We report that non-chemotactic and non-motile mutants in two distinct bacterial species (Shewanella oneidensis and Helicobacter pylori) show apparent zones of accumulation or clearing around test plugs containing potential attractants or repellents, respectively.



Conclusions

Our results suggest that the chemical-in-plug assay should be used with caution, that non-motile or non-chemotactic mutants should be employed as controls, and that results should be confirmed with other types of assays.

The fester locus in Botryllus schlosseri experiences selection
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Allorecognition, the ability of an organism to distinguish self from non-self, occurs throughout the entire tree of life. Despite the prevalence and importance of allorecognition systems, the genetic basis of allorecognition has rarely been characterized outside the well-known MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) in vertebrates and SI (Self-Incompatibility) in plants. Where loci have been identified, their evolutionary history is an open question. We have previously identified the genes involved in self/non-self recognition in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, and we can now begin to investigate their evolution. In B. schlosseri, colonies sharing 1 or more alleles of a gene called FuHC (Fusion Histocompatibility) will fuse. Protein products of a locus called fester, located ~300 kb from FuHC, have been shown to play multiple roles in the histocompatibility reaction, as activating and/or inhibitory receptors. We test whether the proteins encoded by this locus are evolving neutrally or are experiencing balancing, directional, or purifying selection.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Nearly all of the variation in the fester locus resides within populations. The 13 housekeeping genes (12 nuclear genes and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I) have substantially more structure among populations within groups and among groups than fester. All polymorphism statistics (Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F*) are significantly negative for the East Coast A-type alleles, and Fu and Li's F* statistic is significantly negative for the West Coast A-type alleles. These results are likely due to selection rather than demography, given that 10 of the housekeeping loci have no populations with significant values for any of the polymorphism statistics. The majority of codons in the fester proteins have &#969; values &lt; 1, but 15&#8211;27 codons have &gt; 95% posterior probability of &#969; values &gt; 1.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					
						Fester proteins are evolving non-neutrally. The polymorphism statistics are consistent with either purifying selection or directional selection. The &#969; statistics show that the majority of the protein is experiencing purifying selection (&#969; &lt; 1), but that 15&#8211;27 codons are undergoing either balancing or directional selection: &#969; &gt; 1 is compatible with either scenario. The distribution of variation within and among populations points towards balancing selection and away from directional selection. While these data do not provide unambiguous support for a specific type of selection, they contribute to our evolutionary understanding of a critical biological process by determining the forces that affect loci involved in allorecognition.

Adjustment patterns to commodity terms of trade shocks: the role of exchange rate and international reserves policies
We analyze the way in which Latin American countries have adjusted to commodityterms of trade (CTOT) shocks in the 1970-2007 period. Specifically, we investigate the degreeto which the active management of international reserves and exchange rates impacted thetransmission of international price shocks to real exchange rates. We find that active reservemanagement not only lowers the short-run impact of CTOT shocks significantly, but alsoaffects the long-run adjustment of REER, effectively lowering its volatility. We also show thatrelatively small increases in the average holdings of reserves by Latin American economies (tolevels still well below other emerging regions current averages) would provide a policy tool aseffective as a fixed exchange rate regime in insulating the economy from CTOT shocks.Reserve management could be an effective alternative to fiscal or currency policies forrelatively trade closed countries and economies with relatively poor institutions or highgovernment debt. Finally, we analyze the effects of active use of reserve accumulation aimedat smoothing REERs. The result support the view that “leaning against the wind” is potent, butmore effective when intervening to support weak currencies rather than intervening to slowdown the pace of real appreciation. The active reserve management reduces substantiallyREER volatility.

[auxin, signaling, cell, abp1, rop, tmk]

ABP1 and ROP Mediated Auxin Signaling in Arabidopsis
Auxin is a multi-functional hormone essential for plant development and pattern formation. A nuclear auxin perception and signaling system controlling auxin-induced gene expression has been established. However this nuclear-based auxin signaling cannot explain all the actions of auxin in plant cells. In this dissertation, we have demonstrated a cytoplasmic auxin signaling mechanism that can regulate cell morphogenesis through ROP GTPase signaling. In the first charpter, we use leaf pavement cells (PCs) as a model system to investigate how auxin modulate the interdigitation growth between adjacent cells. PCs develop interdigitated lobes and indentations to form a puzzle-piece shape and provide a useful system to investigate the spatial coordination of cell expansion among cells in a two-dimensional plane. PC interdigitation is compromised in leaves deficient in either auxin biosynthesis or its export by the auxin transport facilitator PINFORMED 1 (PIN1) which is localized at the lobe tip.  Auxin coordinately activates two Rho GTPases, ROP2 and ROP6, which promotes the formation of complementary lobes and indentations across cells, respectively. Activation of both ROP2 and ROP6 by auxin occurs within 30 seconds and depends on AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1). These findings reveal ROP-based novel auxin signaling mechanisms, which modulate the spatial coordination of cell expansion across a field of cells.However, the mechanism about how auxin activates ROPs is still unknown since ABP1 localized to the outer surface of plasma membrane and cannot directly bind with ROPs. In the second chapter, we reported a family of receptor like kinases (RLK) called TMK that could bind with ABP1 on plasma membrane and activate ROP GTPase in pavement cells. tmk mutant showed similar phenotype and auxin insensitivity as in abp1 mutant. And both ROP2 signaling and ROP6 signaling are not activated in tmk mutant. ABP1 and TMK1 are confirmed in a same complex on PM by co-immunoprecipitation. In the meanwhile, TMK kinase domain can directly bind with N terminal of SPK1, which is a putative ROPGEF that can activate ROP2. Therefore, we concluded that TMK and ABP1 are forming an auxin receptor complex on PM that mediate auxin activation of ROP signaling pathway.

A strategy for the quantification of protein polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatized sites using iTRAQ
Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derivatized proteins are important pharmaceuticals and the characterization of their PEGylation patterns are of great importance to regulatory agencies for their approval. Accurate quantification of the PEGylated sites are technically challenging. The PEG moiety attached to the protein is very bulky and hinders protease digestion, with the removal of PEG a succinyl linker (100.01 Da) is still attached and can be used for identification of PEGylated sites. The dePEGylated protein can also be used in comparison to the Native protein to determine the percent occupancy of PEG on lysine. Here, we present an improved mass spectrometry based method using iTRAQ reagents (AB SCIEX) to quantitate ADI, a PEGylated protein. By using LC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF), PEGylated lysines are characterized by measuring the ratio of 114: 115 iTRAQ reagent tags, on Native and dePEGylated protein. 24 of 27 lysines were determined to have a succinyl modification. 14 of 27 lysines were quantified to determine their percent occupancy

The Coastal Boundary Layer: Pattern, Mechanism, and Ecological Effects of Decreased Alongshore Transport
Dispersion of planktonic propagules connects shoreline populations of many marine species, and considerable effort has been directed at understanding this process. However, gaps in knowledge persist. In particular, relatively little information has been available regarding transport over the innermost portions of the continental shelf and its impacts on larval distributions and population connectivity. I quantified velocity in nearshore waters at 5 sites along the California coast and investigated characteristics relevant for dispersing larvae. Mean depth-averaged velocities increased with distance from shore at all sites. This repeated and consistent “coastal boundary layer” (CBL) pattern exhibits a logarithmic profile that resembles that associated with the “law of the wall” of smaller-scale turbulent boundary layers, despite differences in spatial dimension and governing physics. A tentative scaling of dominant terms in an alongshore momentum balance suggests nontrivial levels of lateral stress, but small cross-shore gradients in this quantity. Such a trend of near-constant lateral stress, when combined with simple representations of horizontal mixing (i.e., eddy viscosity) that increase approximately linearly with distance from shore, provides a possible explanation for the observed logarithmic velocity pattern. I incorporated these gradients in alongshore velocity and mixing into a 2-dimensional Lagrangian particle-tracking model to explore effects of the CBL on dispersal and self-retention for a variety of sites and life histories. Incorporating a CBL decreased mean dispersal distances up to 56% and was more profound for shorter pelagic larval durations (PLD) and gentler bathymetric slopes associated with broader CBLs. Most notable is that the presence of a CBL increased self- retention by as much as three orders of magnitude, which indicates that ignoring the reduced velocities in the CBL may overestimate population connectivity. These model results were echoed by measurements of planktonic communities within the field. I measured cross-shore distributions of crustacean larvae within the CBL in northern California (between 250 and 1100 m from shore) and found high larval abundances within the CBL, peaking inshore of the 30 m isobath (1 km from shore). However, abundances decreased substantially in the inner portion of the CBL, and there were distinct larval communities between the nearshore and the rest of the CBL. These patterns persisted across sample dates, suggesting that the spatial structure of nearshore larval communities is robust to changes in physical conditions. High larval abundance within the CBL coupled with the potential of the CBL to reduce alongshore larval transport suggests that larvae may exhibit behaviors that interact with recirculating flow features to elevate local retention. Because of these consequences, CBLs should be considered in future models of coastal transport, as they appear to have large effects on population dynamics of marine species.

The study of two barley Type I-like MADS-box genes as potential targets of epigenetic regulation during seed development
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					MADS-box genes constitute a large family of transcription factors functioning as key regulators of many processes during plant vegetative and reproductive development. Type II MADS-box genes have been intensively investigated and are mostly involved in vegetative and flowering development. A growing number of studies of Type I MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis, have assigned crucial roles for these genes in gamete and seed development and have demonstrated that a number of Type I MADS-box genes are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, reports on agronomically important cereals such as barley and wheat are scarce.
				
				
					
						Results
					Here we report the identification and characterization of two Type I-like MADS-box genes, from barley (Hordeum vulgare), a monocot cereal crop of high agronomic importance. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative proteins are related to Type I MADS-box proteins, and classified them in a distinct cereal clade. Significant differences in gene expression among seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars with varying seed size were revealed for both genes. One of these genes was shown to be induced by the seed development- and stress-related hormones ABA and JA whereas in situ hybridizations localized the other gene to specific endosperm sub-compartments. The genomic organization of the latter has high conservation with the cereal Type I-like MADS-box homologues and the chromosomal position of both genes is close to markers associated with seed quality traits. DNA methylation differences are present in the upstream and downstream regulatory regions of the barley Type I-like MADS-box genes in two different developmental stages and in response to ABA treatment which may be associated with gene expression differences.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Two barley MADS-box genes were studied that are related to Type I MADS-box genes. Differential expression in different seed developmental stages as well as in barley cultivars with different seed size was evidenced for both genes. The two barley Type I MADS-box genes were found to be induced by ABA and JA. DNA methylation differences in different seed developmental stages and after exogenous application of ABA is suggestive of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The study of barley Type I-like MADS-box genes extends our investigations of gene regulation during endosperm and seed development in a monocot crop like barley.

Beyond Traditional Four-Connected Zeolitic Frameworks: Design, Syntheses and Characterization of Porous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and Open-Framework Metal Chalcogenides
Zeolites have played essential roles in a number of industrial processes and technological applications. The intensive research in crystalline microporous materials has successfully extended such traditional inorganic zeolites to semiconducting open-framework metal chalcogenides and hybrid porous coordination polymers. Our research group has made a number of key advances in the development of metal chalcogenide clusters and their self-assembled open frameworks. Some of these key advances resulted from this thesis work and are described here. This dissertation also deals with the synthesis of some unique families of porous frameworks based on coordination polymers.    Porous zeolitic metal imidazolate frameworks can be considered as integrating features of both traditional inorganic zeolites and porous coordination polymers because the Si-O-Si angle in zeolites is coincident with that of the bridging angle formed by the Metal-Imidazolate-Metal unit. In this thesis work, two different strategies are employed. The first is the use of mixed, sterically tuned and complementary imidazole ligands, which results in several novel zeolitic topologies with both 3-ring and large rings (>12). The second is the use of novel tetrahedral nodes (e.g., Li and B), which leads to a new family of boron imidazolate open-framework materials.    Open-framework metal chalcogenides are a new generation of inorganic porous materials because their semiconducting properties could expand the utility of inorganic porous materials into areas in which traditional insulating inorganic zeolite materials have had little impact. Key synthetic discoveries made in this thesis work include (1) synthesis of a family of Sn- and/or S-doped Zn-Ga-Se clusters and frameworks and demonstration of site-selective doping chemistry controlled by the interplay of multiple fundamental chemical and geometrical factors, (2) synthesis of two selenide 3D superlattices based on dual-sized supertetrahedral clusters and demonstration of charge density tuning of chalcogenide clusters using three types of charge-complementary and yet geometry-matching metal cations (di-, tri-, and tetravalent ions), (3) synthesis of the largest discrete chalcogenide clusters with tunable band gaps, which further blurs the boundary between molecular clusters and colloidal nanoparticles,  and (4) the synthesis of a new family of 3D covalent arrays of supertetrahedral clusters and negatively-charged imidazolate ligands.

Study of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) Genetic Pathways in Boundary Maintenance of Arabidopsis
The meristem-organ boundary resides between the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and lateral organ primordia, not only providing a physical barrier in the shoot apex, but also actively communicating between the shoot apical meristem and emerging lateral organ primordia. LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) is specifically expressed at the boundary region and functions to suppress growth to ensure boundary integrity. This dissertation focuses on the study of the LOB genetic pathway in boundary maintenance of Arabidopsis.In Chapter 1 (together with other previous work - Bell et al., in press), I revealed that LOB suppresses brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in the boundary region via directly activating PHYB ACTIVATION TAGGED SUPPRESSOR1 (BAS1) transcription to maintain boundary integrity. LOB directly binds the BAS1 promoter and activates BAS1 transcription in the boundary, thus suppressing BR signaling. Boundary-specific overexpression of positive regulators of BR signaling, such as DWARF4 (DWF4) and BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), leads to organ fusion, suggesting that BR suppression is required for boundary maintenance.In Chapter 2, I identified a negative feedback pathway downstream of LOB that involves the BR receptor, BRI1-LIKE 3 (BRL3). LOB directly binds the BRL3 promoter and activates BRL3 transcription in the boundary region. Similar to BRI1, mis-expression of BRL3 in the boundary region led to a boundary fusion phenotype and locally suppressed LOB expression. Taken together, I proposed that a negative feedback loop regulates LOB expression and boundary maintenance through the LOB-BRL3 genetic pathway. Work in Chapter 3 revealed that LOB and LATERAL SUPPRESSOR (LAS) have a novel synergistic interaction. On one hand, the lob las double mutant has dramatic boundary fusion between stem and lateral cauline leaves, demonstrating the synergistic genetic interaction between LOB and LAS for boundary maintenance. Consistently, overexpressing LAS inhibits plant cell growth and reduces plant size. On the other hand, lob las double mutants also have a stronger reduction in axillary meristem formation than the las single mutant, revealing a novel role for LOB in axillary meristem formation. Moreover, LAS is required for the normal boundary expression pattern of LOB and several other boundary genes such as LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1 (LOF1), CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), suggesting hierarchical interactions between different boundary genes.

Data Mining Empowers the Generation of a Novel Class of Chromosome-specific DNA Probes
Probes that allow accurate delineation of chromosome-specific DNA sequences in interphase or metaphase cell nuclei have become important clinical tools that deliver life-saving information about the gender or chromosomal make-up of a product of conception or the probability of an embryo to implant, as well as the definition of tumor-specific genetic signatures. Often such highly specific DNA probes are proprietary in nature and have been the result of extensive probe selection and optimization procedures. We describe a novel approach that eliminates costly and time consuming probe selection and testing by applying data mining and common bioinformatics tools. Similar to a rational drug design process in which drug-protein interactions are modeled in the computer, the rational probe design described here uses a set of criteria and publicly available bioinformatics software to select the desired probe molecules from libraries comprised of hundreds of thousands of probe molecules. Examples describe the selection of DNA probes for the human X and Y chromosomes, both with unprecedented performance, but in a similar fashion, this approach can be applied to other chromosomes or species.

Mass Spectrometry-Based Elucidation of Protein Structure Using Noncovalent Molecular Recognition and Photo-Induced Radical Chemistry
Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled quick and accurate protein identification, an important analytical goal. However, knowledge of the identity of a protein only skims the surface of the structural and functional complexities that are characteristic of proteins. Described in this dissertation is the development of MS-based analytical techniques to investigate the structure of proteins using noncovalent interactions and photo-induced radical chemistry. The first half of the dissertation reports the discovery of a novel gas phase protein dissociation method using photo-induced radical chemistry to `direct' backbone fragmentation to specific amino acid residues, which we have called `radical directed dissociation' or RDD. Residue-specific dissociation, which is nearly unprecedented in the literature, is a significant advance towards enzyme-like protein disassembly in the gas phase. Investigation of numerous peptides and proteins yields two key features of RDD. First, fragmentation frequently occurs at tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine, threonine, and serine. These residues have the lowest predicted C(beta)-H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the twenty canonical amino acids. Second, removal of the beta carbon of tyrosine abrogates backbone fragmentation at that residue. These results indicate that the C(beta) is the most important site for radical-induced backbone fragmentation and that radical migration in peptides appears to favor sites with the lowest C-H BDEs. We have called this latter phenomenon "radical funneling". Although useful for peptides, the "radical funneling" model becomes inappropriate for larger peptides and proteins, where structural effects cannot be ignored. Indeed, we show that radical migration is a sensitive reporter of tertiary structure of proteins in vacuo.The remaining half of the dissertation reports the development of selective noncovalent adduct protein probing mass spectrometry (SNAPP-MS) and radical migration as methods of investigating the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Information on three-dimensional structure is typically unobtainable by MS. However, orthogonal techniques may be used to translate structural information into changes that are observable by MS. SNAPP-MS is a fast technique that uses 18-crown-6 ether (18C6) as a molecular probe of lysine availability in proteins. The number of 18C6s that bind to protein is easily measured by MS. Interestingly, the binding of 18C6 to protein occurs in solution, which allows investigation of solution phase structure.

Let F be a number field, AF its ring of adeles, and let pin and pin+1 be irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representations of SOn(AF) and SOn+1AF), respectively. In 1991, Benedict Gross and Dipendra Prasad conjectured the non-vanishing of a certain period integral attached to pin and pin+1 is equivalent to the non-vanishing of L(1/2, pin X pin+1). More recently, Atsushi Ichino and Tamotsu Ikeda gave a refinement of this conjecture, as well as a proof of the first few cases (n = 2,3). Their conjecture gives an explicit relationship between the aforementioned L-value and period integral. We make a similar conjecture for unitary groups, and prove the first few cases. The first case of the conjecture will be proved using a theorem of Waldspurger, while the second case will use the machinery of the theta correspondence

Studies of turbulence and flows in the DIII-D tokamak
Understanding the turbulent transport of particles, momentum, and heat continues to be an important goal for magnetic confinement fusion energy research.  The turbulence in tokamaks and other magnetic confinement devices is widely thought to arise due to linearly unstable gyroradius-scale modes.  A long predicted characteristic of these linear instabilities is a critical gradient, where the modes are stable below a critical value related to the gradient providing free energy for the instability and unstable above it.  In this dissertation, a critical gradient threshold for long wavelength ($k_{\theta} \rho_s \lesssim 0.4$) electron temperature fluctuations is reported, where the temperature fluctuations do not change, within uncertainties, below a threshold value in $L_{T_e}^{-1}=|\nabla T_e| / T_e$ and steadily increase above it.  This principal result, the direct observation of a critical gradient for electron temperature fluctuations, is also the first observation of critical gradient behavior for \textit{any} locally measured turbulent quantity in the core of a high temperature plasma in a systematic experiment.  The critical gradient was found to be $L_{T_e}^{-1}|_{crit}=2.8 \pm 0.4 \ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.  The experimental value for the critical gradient quantitatively disagrees with analytical predictions for its value.  In the experiment, the local value of $L_{T_e}^{-1}$ was systematically varied by changing the deposition location of electron cyclotron heating gyrotrons in the DIII-D tokamak.  The temperature fluctuation measurements were acquired with a correlation electron cyclotron emission radiometer.  The dimensionless parameter $\eta_e=L_{n_e}/L_{T_e}$ is found to describe both the temperature fluctuation threshold and a threshold observed in linear gyrofluid growth rate calculations over the measured wave numbers, where a rapid increase at $\eta_e \approx 2$ is observed in both.  Doppler backscattering (DBS) measurements of intermediate-scale density fluctuations also show a frequency-localized increase on the electron diamagnetic side of the measured spectrum that increases with $L_{T_e}^{-1}$.  Measurements of the crossphase angle between long wavelength electron density and temperature fluctuations, as well as measurements of long wavelength density fluctuation levels were also acquired.  Multiple aspects of the fluctuation measurements and calculations are individually consistent with the attribution of the critical gradient to the $\nabla T_e$-driven trapped electron mode.  The accumulated evidence strongly enforces this conclusion.  The threshold value for the temperature fluctuation measurements was also within uncertainties of a critical gradient for the electron thermal diffusivity found through heat pulse analysis, above which the electron heat flux and electron temperature profile stiffness rapidly increased.  Toroidal rotation was also systematically varied with neutral beam injection, which had little effect on the temperature fluctuation measurements.  The crossphase measurements indicated the presence of different instabilities below the critical gradient depending on the neutral beam configuration, which is supported by linear gyrofluid calculations.In a second set of results reported in this dissertation, the geodesic acoustic mode is investigated in detail.  Geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) and zonal flows are nonlinearly driven, axisymmetric ($m=0,\ n=0$ potential) $E \times B$ flows, which are thought to play an important role in establishing the saturated level of turbulence in tokamaks.  Zonal flows are linearly stable, but are driven to finite amplitude through nonlinear interaction with the turbulence.  They are then thought to either shear apart the turbulent eddies or act as a catalyst to transfer energy to damped modes.  Results are presented showing the GAM's observed spatial scales, temporal scales, and nonlinear interaction characteristics, which may have implications for the assumptions underpinning turbulence models towards the tokamak edge ($r/a \gtrsim 0.75$).  Measurements in the DIII-D tokamak have been made with multichannel Doppler backscattering systems at toroidal locations separated by $180^{\circ}$; analysis reveals that the GAM is highly coherent between the toroidally separated systems ($\gamma > 0.8$) and that measurements are consistent with the expected $m=0,\ n=0$ structure.  Observations show that the GAM in L-mode plasmas with $\sim 2.5-4.5$ MW auxiliary heating occurs as a radially coherent eigenmode, rather than as a continuum of frequencies as occurs in lower temperature discharges; this is consistent with theoretical expectations when finite ion Larmor radius effects are included.  The intermittency of the GAM has been quantified, revealing that its autocorrelation time is fairly short, ranging from about 4 to about 15 GAM periods in cases examined, a difference that is accompanied by a modification to the probability distribution function of the $E \times B$ velocity at the GAM frequency.  Conditionally-averaged bispectral analysis shows the strength of the nonlinear interaction of the GAM with broadband turbulence can vary with the magnitude of the GAM.  Data also indicates a wave number dependence to the GAM's interaction with turbulence.  Measurements also showed the existence of additional low frequency zonal flows (LFZF) at a few kilohertz in the core of DIII-D plasmas.  These LFZF also correlated toroidally.  The amplitude of both the GAM and LFZF were observed to depend on toroidal rotation, with both types of flows barely detectable in counter-injected plasmas.In a third set of results the development of diagnostic hardware, techniques used to acquire the above data, and related work is described.  A novel multichannel Doppler backscattering system was developed.  The five channel system operates in V-band (50-75 GHz) and has an array of 5 frequencies, separated by 350 MHz, which is tunable as a group.  Laboratory tests of the hardware are presented.  Doppler backscattering is a diagnostic technique for the radially localized measurement of intermediate-scale ($k_{\theta} \rho_s \sim 1$) density fluctuations and the laboratory frame propagation velocity of turbulent structures.  Ray tracing, with experimental profiles and equilibria for inputs, is used to determine the scattering wave number and location.  Full wave modeling, also with experimental inputs, is used for a synthetic Doppler backscattering diagnostic for nonlinear turbulence simulations.  A number of non-ideal processes for DBS are also investigated; their impact on measurements in DIII-D are found, for the most part, to be small.

Probing the nonribosomal peptide synthetase epimerization domain via rationally designed suicide inhibitors
Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) represent a class of biologically active natural products that contain a great deal of functional and therapeutic diversity. They are produced by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from large, multidomain megaenzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Many of these NRPs contain D-amino acids that provide a great deal of physiological importance to their functionality. Incorporation of D- amino acids into the NRP natural product often occurs through integrated epimerization (E) domains that catalyze racemization of the Calpha position of a PCP-tethered L- amino acid. Several small molecule probes have been rationally designed in order to investigate the mechanism as well as gain insight into intradomain communication of E domains. alpha-Chlorvinylglycine 10 and beta, gamma-phenylethynylglycine 15 are proposed to form a reactive allene intermediate in situ upon catalysis of the E domain that can be rapidly attacked by an active-site base. Utilizing the diketopiperazine condensation assay, we have demonstrated that probe 10 acts as an inhibitor of the E domain of the initiation module, grsA, of the gramicidin S synthetase. Inhibition of E domain activity suggests covalent crosslinking of the E domain and its proximal PCP partner, allowing insight into protein interactions that regulate NRP biosynthesis

Large scale passive force-displacement and dynamic earth pressure experiments and simulations
During strong earthquakes, foundation structures such as bridge abutments and pile caps mobilize resistance due to passive earth pressure. Dynamic earth pressure can also increase the demand placed on retaining walls during earthquake excitation. Current uncertainty in the passive earth pressure load-displacement behavior and the evaluation of dynamic earth pressure during earthquake excitation motivates the large scale experimental and numerical investigation presented in this dissertation. In the experimental investigations, a 2.15 m high, 5.6 m long, and 2.9 m wide dense, well-graded silty sand backfill is constructed behind a stiff vertical concrete wall inside a large soil container. First, the passive earth pressure load-displacement curve is recorded in two tests. From those tests, the peak passive resistance compares well with the theoretical predictions. Using the test data, a calibrated finite element (FE) model is employed to produce additional load-displacement curves for a wider range of practical applications. A spring model is also developed for representing the passive resistance in dynamic simulations. Next, dynamic earth pressure is measured in 26 events, as the soil container-wall-backfill configuration is subjected to shake table excitations. With peak input accelerations up to about 0.6 g, the earth pressure resultant force remains close to the static level. Small wall movements coupled with the high backfill stiffness and strength contribute to this favorable response. At higher input acceleration levels, the backfill shear strength is further mobilized, resulting in significant dynamic earth pressure increases. FE simulations support and demonstrate the experimental observations. Results show that accurate consideration of the retaining wall-backfill interaction may result in more realistic dynamic earth pressure predictions than the simplified analytical methods which are currently used in design. The unique combination of laboratory and large scale test data reveals interesting features regarding backfill soil shear strength. For instance, although the tested backfill soil had only 7% silty fines, cohesion contributed significantly to the passive resistance and helped to limit dynamic earth pressure. The backfill friction angle in the plane strain test configuration was also found to be relatively high, contributing favorably to the response under both passive and dynamic earth pressure loading

Biological Assembly and Synthesis of Inorganic Nanostructures
Science technologies have been in pursuit of smaller, faster and more efficient devices and enormous efforts made by myriad numbers of scientists have provided us with electronics in reduced volumes with improved performances. Miniaturization of electronic circuits down to micrometer scale has been well-developed as industrial processes and it is easy to witness electronic products containing integrated circuits consisted of microstructures in our everyday life. However, miniaturization of circuit components down to nanometer scale has revealed new challenges not only for difficult handling of diminutive structures but also for unusual physical properties of nanomaterials. Countless numbers of conventional chemical and physical studies have been dedicated to exploit the benefit of the unique properties of nanostructures by developing efficient techniques for controlled synthesis and assembly of nanostructures. However, environmental concerns of using toxic solvent systems and high energy-consuming processes, and pursuit of highly selective molecular interactions for highly precise assemblies have averted the eyes of scientists to biological materials. Biorecognition properties of biological materials are attractive for achieving programmed self-assembly of nanostructures and biomolecules with metal-reducing ability are very inviting for developments of environmentally-acceptable synthesis processes. In the light of above discussion, this thesis takes the advantages of biological approaches to assemble and synthesize inorganic nanostructures in a controlled manner. DNA was used for the assembly processes due to their facilities of sequence programming and chemical modifications. Spatially controlled assembly of multi-segmented Au/Pd/Au nanowires across gold electrodes has been demonstrated using thiolated DNA strands functionalized on the gold surface of nanowires and electrodes. Electron transport properties of DNA-assisted assembled nanowires were demonstrated showing negligible blocking effect by DNA layers hybridized between nanowires and electrodes. The assembled Au/Pd/Au nanowire was used for hydrogen sensing manifesting the applicability of DNA-assisted assembly to build functional nanodevices.      Amino acids are essential as building blocks for proteins and for metabolisms. Recently, amino acids have been given another important role as a reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of gold nanostructures. Amino acid-mediated synthesis of gold nanostructures has been demonstrated showing the capability of biological approaches to synthesize single crystalline gold nanostructures in 0-D, 1-D and 2-D dimensions by manipulating the reaction environment. Structural changes of gold nanostructures due to the speciation of gold complexes were systematically demonstrated by altering solvent conditions. The effect of the side chains of amino acids on the structural features of gold nanostructures was systematically demonstrated. Distinguished electron transport properties were observed for single crystalline nanoribbons showing resistivity lower by an order of magnitude than polycrystalline counterparts.

Enthalpy and entropy in chemical reactivity
Secondary deuterium isotope effects on the acidities of carboxylic acids and phenols were measured at various temperatures using a highly accurate NMR titration method. Our measurements confirmed that deuteration decreases acidity. The contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the isotope effects were also determined to explore the origin of these secondary isotope effects on the acidities of carboxylic acids and phenols. While it has previously been shown that these isotope effects are predominantly due to changes in bond vibrational frequencies and zero-point energies upon deprotonation (which would be manifested in enthalpy) it was not known if there is also a smaller contribution from an inductive effect. An inductive contribution to the isotope effect could arise from an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged carboxylate and the dipole moment of the C-D or C-H bond, and would be manifested in entropy. Our results settle a question that has been unanswered for over 50 years and finally confirm that IEs originate only from changes in vibrational frequencies and zero-point energies upon deprotonation, and that there is no contribution from an inductive effect. The rate constants and activation parameters for the thermal decomposition of malonic, methylmalonic, and dimethylmalonic anhydrides were reliably obtained using NMR spectroscopy. The highest rate of decomposition was found for methylmalonic anhydride and the lowest rate of decomposition was found for dimethylmalonic anhydride. The enthalpy of activation values provided additional evidence supporting the previously proposed 2+2 cycloreversion mechanism for the decomposition of the malonic anhydrides. Additionally, the enthalpy of activation values were used to determine the extent to which electronic and steric factors influence the rate of decomposition. Our results show that the dominant influence, on the rates of decomposition of malonic anhydrides, is the steric hindrance to the formation of the twisted Möbius transition state by the bulky methyl groups. We also found a smaller contribution from electronic effects due to the stabilization of the sp² carbons forming in the transition state by the electron donating methyl groups. The entropy of activation values for the decomposition of the three anhydrides are also discussed. Finally, the reactions of methylmalonic anhydride with various hindered bases were monitored by NMR spectroscopy and the relative acidity of methylmalonic anhydride was estimated. Preliminary work has been done towards developing a new isothermal titration calorimetry method to measure the enthalpies of proton transfer between isopropylamine and various large ring cycloalkylamines, which would ultimately allow us to dissect the relative basicities of these amines into enthalpic and entropic components. The enthalpic and entropic components to the relative basicities of cycloalkylamines and isopropylamine would clarify whether conformational effects or hindrance to the solvation of the cycloalkylammonium ions by additional carbons are responsible for the previously observed, unexpectedly low, basicities of large ring cycloalkylamines

The Role of CD137 and Notch Signaling in M Cell Development
Microfold cells (M cells) are specialized epithelial cells that reside on mucosal surfaces, specifically in nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). M cells are highly efficient at transcytosis, allowing them to transport particles or antigens from their apical surface to their basolateral side for immune surveillance. Despite our understanding of their function, M cell development remains mostly unexplored. This study investigates the important role that both CD137 and Jag1-Notch1 signaling play in M cell development. Notch signaling activates lateral inhibition early in M cell development, preventing cells adjacent to the M cell precursor from differentiating into additional M cells. Notch1 conditional KO mice highlight this inhibitory role, exhibiting increased M cell formation with clustered distributions. Similarly, knocking out the corresponding ligand, Jag1, also results in M cell clustering. However, in contrast to the Notch1 KO mice, Jag1 removal decreases overall M cell numbers, suggesting that it serves a significant role in M cell differentiation. Additionally, previous in vitro research connected CD137 to M cell development; this study expands on this research in vivo, using CD137 KO mice. While CD137 KO mice show normal M cell formation, functional development is impaired, particularly uptake functionality and basolateral pocket morphology. Adoptive-­transferred bone marrow chimera mice also exhibit significantly reduced NALT M cell uptake, further demonstrating the importance of CD137 expression for M cell functional development.

Common inversion polymorphism at 17q21.31 affects expression of multiple genes in tissue-specific manner
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Chromosome 17q21.31 contains a common inversion polymorphism of approximately 900&#8201;kb in populations with European ancestry. Two divergent MAPT haplotypes, H1 and H2 are described with distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns across the region reflecting the inversion status at this locus. The MAPT H1 haplotype has been associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, while the H2 is linked to recurrent deletion events associated with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, a disease characterized by developmental delay and learning disability.
				
				
					
						Results
					In this study, we investigate the effect of the inversion on the expression of genes in the 17q21.31 region. We find the expression of several genes in and at the borders of the inversion to be affected; specific either to whole blood or different regions of the human brain. The H1 haplotype was found to be associated with an increased expression of LRRC37A4, PLEKH1M and MAPT. In contrast, a decreased expression of MGC57346, LRRC37A and CRHR1 was associated with H1.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Studies thus far have focused on the expression of MAPT in the inversion region. However, our results show that the inversion status affects expression of other genes in the 17q21.31 region as well. Given the link between the inversion status and different neurological diseases, these genes may also be involved in disease pathology, possibly in a tissue-specific manner.

Hemispheric Processing of Temporal Information
The capacity of the two cerebral hemispheres for temporal processing was investigated in two experiments concerned with sensory and motor processing, respectively. The temporal processing of sensory information was examined in a task requiring simultaneity judgement of pairs of tactile stimuli delivered unimanually or bimanually. Unimanual stimulation permitted presentation of both events to the same hemisphere while bimanual stimulation involved both hemispheres and necessarily required interhemispheric communication to compare stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). The order of presentation of asynchronous pairs determined which cerebral hemisphere was activated first. Pairs of stimuli were judged as simultaneous at longer SOAs in the bimanual than the unimanual conditions whilst unimanual left and right simultaneity thresholds did not differ. These results suggest that the two hemispheres are equally capable of temporally resolving a pair of simple tactile stimuli. A structural model proposing that temporal comparisons are carried out in the hemisphere receiving the second stimulus provides the best account of the results.
      The temporal processing of motor information was examined in a task requiring the planning and execution of sequences of finger movements. A predetermined number of double-tap responses with the index and middle fingers of a given hand were required in response to a visual cue in the ipsilateral visual field. The restriction of the performance cue in each trial to the hemisphere controlling the response permitted assessment of the contribution of each cerebral hemisphere to differences in hand skill. Movement time increased linearly for both hands with increasing length of tap sequence and did not differentiate hand performance. Response preparation time, however, increased linearly with increasing task load for the preferred hand but varied quadratically for the non-preferred hand. These results indicate that differences in hand skill may be determined by the mode of response preparation within the contralateral hemisphere. They also suggest that studies of hand differences involving fixed levels of motor demand would not properly differentiate hand performance.
      Together, these studies indicate that both cerebral hemispheres are capable of the temporal processing of sensory and motor information but that the hemisphere primarily involved is determined by side of stimulus or response, respectively.

Development of NMR Methods for the Characterization of Heparin and its Impurities
The goal of this dissertation is to develop and apply NMR methods for the analysis of heparin and its impurities. As a result of the intentional contamination of heparin with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS), significant efforts have been placed on the development of analytical methods to evaluate heparin purity. To advance the suite of analytical methods available for heparin analysis, HPLC-NMR and diffusion NMR methods were developed for its characterization. Our HPLC-NMR method focuses on the WAX separation of intact glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) coupled to on-line UV and NMR spectroscopy for detection and identification of heparin contaminants. The weak anion exchange (WAX) method developed allows for the timely separation of heparin and its impurities, OSCS, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate A. In addition to the study of heparin impurities using WAX-HPLC, the characterization of intact and digested heparin samples was investigated using diffusion NMR. Because the diffusion behavior of the intact biopolymers can be dominated by viscosity and molecular crowding effects even in dilute GAG solutions, NMR diffusion results must only be interpreted qualitatively. These limitations can be largely overcome by digesting heparin to low molecular weight oligosaccharides, significantly improving the resolution of heparin and its biopolymer impurities.The second part of this dissertation is on the characterization of heparin-derived oligosaccharides. Because of the structural complexity and heterogeneity of heparin and heparan sulfate, extensive or partial digestion of the full length polysaccharides is a common practice. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to separate digested heparin oligosaccharides into size-based fractions while SAX-HPLC was used to further purify individual oligosaccharides for NMR characterization. Although, NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for structure determination, it trails other analytical techniques in sensitivity. Microcoil NMR is an inexpensive method for enhancing the mass sensitivity of NMR allowing structure elucidation with 5-10 &mu;g of isolated material. Results are presented showing the utility of microcoil NMR for the structure characterization of microgram amounts of heparin-derived tetrasaccharides, reducing the NMR sample requirements by 2-fold when compared to analysis in a Shigemi tube.In Chapter 6, an IMPACT-HNMBC experiment was used in the detection of <super>15<super>N in amino sugars through long-range couplings to carbon-bound protons of the sugar ring. Comparison of the ge-HMBC, IMPACT-HMBC and a modified IMPACT-HNMBC pulse sequence revealed improved sensitivity, resolution and reduced F1 noise with the IMPACT-HNMBC experiment.

Thermal Conductivity of Mesoporous Titania Films Made From Nanocrystalline Building Blocks and Sol-Gel Reagents
This paper reports the cross-plane thermal conductivity of amorphous and crystalline mesoporous titania thin films synthesized by evaporation-induced self-assembly. Both sol-gel and nanocrystal-based mesoporous films were investigated, with average porosities of 30% and 35%, respectively. The pore diameter ranged from 7 to 30 nm and film thickness from 60 to 370nm while the average wall thickness varied from 3 to 50 nm. The crystalline domain sizes in sol-gel films varied from 12 to 13 nm while the nanocrystal-based films consisted of monodisperse nanocrystals 9 nm in diameter. The cross-plane thermal conductivity was measured at room temperature using the 3w method. The average thermal conductivity of the amorphous sol-gel mesoporous titania films was 0.37 ± 0.05 W/m.K. It did not show strong dependence on pore diameter, wall thickness, and film thickness for sol-gel amorphous mesoporous titania thinfilms. This result can be attributed to the fact that heat is carried, in the amorphous matrix, by localized non-propagating vibrational modes. The thermal conductivity of crystalline sol-gelmesoporous titania thin films was significantly larger at 1.06 ± 0.04 W/m.K and depended on the organic template used to make the films. The thermal conductivity of nanocrystal-based thin films was 0.48 ± 0.05 W/m.K and significantly lower than that of the crystalline sol-gel mesoporous thin films. This was due to the fact that the nanocrystals were not as well interconnected as the crystalline domains in the crystalline sol-gel films. These results suggest that both connectivity and size of the nanocrys-tals or the crystalline domains can provide control over thermal conductivity in addition to porosity.

Spice Up Your Lipids: The Effects of Curcumin on Lipids in Humans
Curcumin has been lauded for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties in various research studies, but its effects on cholesterol levels are not as well-understood. This review paper aims to consolidate the findings from three recent investigations on curcumin's reputed hypolipidemic effect in humans by Pungcharoenkul, Alwi, and Baum. No consistent effect was noted in healthy subjects receiving a 500mg or 6,000mg daily dose of curcumin, in patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving a daily supplementation of 45-180mg curcumin, or in subjects with cognitive decline given 1,000mg or 4,000mg curcumin per day, as compared with controls. Two earlier studies generated enthusiasm regarding curcumin's ability to lower apo B/apo A ratio, serum cholesterol, and lipid peroxides in healthy humans, but those were flawed and less rigorous trials. Pungcharoenkul showed that daily curcumin dosages of 500mg and 6,000mg significantly decreased subjects' cholesterol levels, but this hypolipidemic effect was not noted across the different populations and dosages in the other two recent studies.

On Riemannian Submersions and Diffeomorphism Stability
This thesis consists of work that was carried out in three separate papers that were written during my time at UC, Riverside. Abstract of chapter II: If $\pi:M\rightarrow B$ is a Riemannian Submersion and $M$ has non-negative sectional curvature, O'Neill's Horizontal Curvature Equation shows that $B$ must also have non-negative curvature. We find constraints on the extent to which O'Neill's horizontal curvature equation can be used to create positive curvature on the base space of a Riemannian submersion. In particular, we study when K. Tapp's theorem on Riemannian submersions of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics generalizes to arbitrary manifolds of non-negative curvature.Abstract of Chapter III: Though Riemannian submersions preserve non-negative sectional curvature this does not generalize to Riemannian submersions from manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We give here an example of a Riemannian submersion $\pi: M\rightarrow B$ for which $\textrm{Ricci}_p(M)>0$ and at some point $p\in B$, $\text{Ricci}_p(B)<0$. Abstract of Chapter IV: The smallest $r$ so that a metric $r$--ball covers a metric space $M$ is called the radius of $M.$ The volume of a metric $r$-ball in the space form of constant curvature $k$ is an upper bound for the volume of any Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $\geq k$ and radius $\leq r$. We show that when such a manifold has volume almost equal to this upper bound, it is diffeomorphic to a sphere or a real projective space.

Deletion Xq27.3q28 in female patient with global developmental delays and skewed X-inactivation
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Global developmental delay and mental retardation are associated with X-linked disorders including Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Single nucleotide mutations in the iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) gene at Xq28 most commonly cause Hunter syndrome while a CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene at Xq27.3 is associated with Fragile X syndrome. Gene deletions of the Xq27-28 region are less frequently found in either condition with rare reports in females. Additionally, an association between Xq27-28 deletions and skewed X-inactivation of the normal X chromosome observed in previous studies suggested a primary role of the Xq27-28 region in X-inactivation.
				
				
					
						Case presentation
					We describe the clinical, molecular and biochemical evaluations of a four year-old female patient with global developmental delay and a hemizygous deletion of Xq27.3q28 (144,270,614-154,845,961 bp), a 10.6&#160;Mb region that contains &gt;100 genes including IDS and FMR1. A literature review revealed rare cases with similar deletions that included IDS and FMR1 in females with developmental delay, variable features of Hunter syndrome, and skewed X-inactivation of the normal X chromosome. In contrast, our patient exhibited skewed X-inactivation of the deleted X chromosome and tested negative for Hunter syndrome.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This is a report of a female with a 10.6&#160;Mb Xq27-28 deletion with skewed inactivation of the deleted X chromosome. Contrary to previous reports, our observations do not support a primary role of the Xq27-28 region in X-inactivation. A review of the genes in the deletion region revealed several potential genes that may contribute to the patient&#8217;s developmental delays, and sequencing of the active X chromosome may provide insight into the etiology of this clinical presentation.

Extensive innate immune gene activation accompanies brain aging, increasing vulnerability to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration: a microarray study
AbstractBackgroundThis study undertakes a systematic and comprehensive analysis of brain gene expression profiles of immune/inflammation-related genes in aging and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD).MethodsIn a well-powered microarray study of young (20 to 59&#8201;years), aged (60 to 99&#8201;years), and AD (74 to 95&#8201;years) cases, gene responses were assessed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and post-central gyrus.ResultsSeveral novel concepts emerge. First, immune/inflammation-related genes showed major changes in gene expression over the course of cognitively normal aging, with the extent of gene response far greater in aging than in AD. Of the 759 immune-related probesets interrogated on the microarray, approximately 40% were significantly altered in the SFG, PCG and HC with increasing age, with the majority upregulated (64 to 86%). In contrast, far fewer immune/inflammation genes were significantly changed in the transition to AD (approximately 6% of immune-related probesets), with gene responses primarily restricted to the SFG and HC. Second, relatively few significant changes in immune/inflammation genes were detected in the EC either in aging or AD, although many genes in the EC showed similar trends in responses as in the other brain regions. Third, immune/inflammation genes undergo gender-specific patterns of response in aging and AD, with the most pronounced differences emerging in aging. Finally, there was widespread upregulation of genes reflecting activation of microglia and perivascular macrophages in the aging brain, coupled with a downregulation of select factors (TOLLIP, fractalkine) that when present curtail microglial/macrophage activation. Notably, essentially all pathways of the innate immune system were upregulated in aging, including numerous complement components, genes involved in toll-like receptor signaling and inflammasome signaling, as well as genes coding for immunoglobulin (Fc) receptors and human leukocyte antigens I and II.ConclusionsUnexpectedly, the extent of innate immune gene upregulation in AD was modest relative to the robust response apparent in the aged brain, consistent with the emerging idea of a critical involvement of inflammation in the earliest stages, perhaps even in the preclinical stage, of AD. Ultimately, our data suggest that an important strategy to maintain cognitive health and resilience involves reducing chronic innate immune activation that should be initiated in late midlife.

A reproducible, high throughput method for fabricating fibrin gels
AbstractBackgroundFibrin gels are a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering. However, current fabrication methods are time intensive with inherent variation. There is a pressing need to develop new and consistent approaches for producing fibrin-based hydrogels for examination.FindingsWe developed a high throughput method for creating fibrin gels using molds fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Fibrin gels were produced by adding solutions of fibrinogen and thrombin to cylindrical defects in a PDMS sheet. Undisturbed gels were collected by removing the sheet, and fibrin gels were characterized. The characteristics of resulting gels were compared to published data by measuring compressive stiffness and osteogenic response of entrapped human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Gels exhibited compressive moduli nearly identical to our previously reported fabrication method. Trends in alkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker of osteogenic differentiation in MSCs, were also consistent with previous data.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate a streamlined approach to fibrin gel production that drastically reduces the time required to make fibrin gels, while also reducing variability between gel batches. This fabrication technique provides a valuable tool for generating large numbers of gels in a cost-effective manner.

Transcriptome Profiling of the Demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica Reveals Genome-wide Events that Accompany Major Life Cycle Transitions
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               The biphasic life cycle with pelagic larva and benthic adult stages is widely observed in the animal kingdom, including the Porifera (sponges), which are the earliest branching metazoans. The demosponge, Amphimedon queenslandica, undergoes metamorphosis from a free-swimming larva into a sessile adult that bears no morphological resemblance to other animals. While the genome of A. queenslandica contains an extensive repertoire of genes very similar to that of complex bilaterians, it is as yet unclear how this is drawn upon to coordinate changing morphological features and ecological demands throughout the sponge life cycle.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               To identify genome-wide events that accompany the pelagobenthic transition in A. queenslandica, we compared global gene expression profiles at four key developmental stages by sequencing the poly(A) transcriptome using SOLiD technology. Large-scale changes in transcription were observed as sponge larvae settled on the benthos and began metamorphosis. Although previous systematics suggest that the only clear homology between Porifera and other animals is in the embryonic and larval stages, we observed extensive use of genes involved in metazoan-associated cellular processes throughout the sponge life cycle. Sponge-specific transcripts are not over-represented in the morphologically distinct adult; rather, many genes that encode typical metazoan features, such as cell adhesion and immunity, are upregulated. Our analysis further revealed gene families with candidate roles in competence, settlement, and metamorphosis in the sponge, including transcription factors, G-protein coupled receptors and other signaling molecules.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               This first genome-wide study of the developmental transcriptome in an early branching metazoan highlights major transcriptional events that accompany the pelagobenthic transition and point to a network of regulatory mechanisms that coordinate changes in morphology with shifting environmental demands. Metazoan developmental and structural gene orthologs are well-integrated into the expression profiles at every stage of sponge development, including the adult. The utilization of genes involved in metazoan-associated processes throughout sponge development emphasizes the potential of the genome of the last common ancestor of animals to generate phenotypic complexity.

Factors that can influence the onset time of rapid intensification of tropical cyclones
An axisymmetric version of the Bryan Cloud Model (CM1) is used to determine how quickly a coherent and relatively stable tropical cyclone (TC) circulation can form from an initial vortex of nominal intensity. Some of the factors that may influence the onset time of the rapid intensification are examined, including the height of the tropopause, the microphysical parameterizations, the midlevel dryness and the total surface heat flux from the sea surface. Our analyses of these simulations suggest that there are two conditions that need to be satisfied before RI can occur: the vertical structure of the middle troposphere has to become moist adiabatic in the inner core and peripheral convection has to become suppressed or merged with convection in the inner region.

The role of MMPs in the intravasation of a highly disseminating HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell variant : a protective role for tumor- derived MMP-9
Intravasation, the process by which tumor cells enter the vasculature, is a rate-limiting step within the metastatic cascade. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), an enzyme family of endopeptidases, are known to play roles in metastasis and angiogenesis, but the specific functions of MMPs during tumor cell intravasation remain unclear. To investigate molecular mechanisms of tumor cell intravasation, we have utilized high and low disseminating cell variants isolated from human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, HT -hi/diss and HT-lo/diss respectively, which differ by 50 - 100-fold in their ability to intravasate and metastasize in the chick embryo. HT-1080 tumor cell variants form primary tumors on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos, and the cells escaping the primary site disseminate through the circulation. The escaped tumor cells arrest in the CAM, which serve as a repository for intravasated cells, and also metastasize to internal organs of the embryo. The disseminated human tumor cells are quantified by Alu qPCR. In this study, an RNAi approach to downregulate individual tumor MMPs was used to determine their functional roles in HT-hi/diss intravasation. MMP gene and protein expression were compared in HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss in culture and in primary tumors by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Protein expression analysis of primary CAM tumors demonstrated that MMP-1 and MMP-9 were more abundant in the HT-hi/diss variant, MMP-2 was more abundant in the HT- lo/diss variant, and MMP-14 expression was similar in both variants. RNAi-mediated downregulation of three secretory MMPs, i.e. MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9, substantially increased HT-hi/diss dissemination, suggesting protective roles for these enzymes in intravasation. Further investigation indicated that the enzymatic activity of tumor MMP-9 was needed to confer its protective role in intravasation. Moreover, tumor-derived MMP-9 exhibited pro- or anti- metastatic roles depending on cancer type since downregulation of MMP-9 resulted in opposite effects on HT -1080 fibrosarcoma and HEp3 carcinoma. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that tumor-derived MMPs may have protective functions in cancer cell intravasation, i.e. catalytically interfering with the early stages of tumor dissemination. Therefore, targeting certain tumor MMPs in specific cancer types may result in enhanced malignancy

Tuning the magnetization dynamics of nanomagnetic elements through irradiation, composition, and shape
The areal density of current magnetic storage technologies is approaching the superparamagnetic limit. In order to reach densities of 1 Tb/in<super>2</super> and beyond, new recording techniques are needed, such as the use of patterned media or energy-assisted recording. Studying the small angle ultrafast dynamics sheds light on the intrinsic magnetic properties that determine the device speed. In this Thesis, I will discuss several material systems related to the next generation technologies, and how their dynamics can be tuned through ion irradiation, changes in composition, and three-dimensional shaping. The ability to not only characterize a material's dynamics, but to tune its resonance frequencies, adds an extra dimension of design optimization and flexibility.  First, we measured how the magnetization dynamics of CoCrPt:SiO<sub>2</sub> granular media is affected by irradiation with Co<super>+</super> ions. We observe a steep decrease in the resonance frequency as the ion fluence is increased. Moreover, we quantified how the intergranular exchange can affect the dynamics, causing an increase in frequency beyond what is predicted through macrospin calculations. Next, we used the composition of the FePt alloy to tune the dynamic response. We showed that the magnetic oscillation frequency of disordered Fe<sub>x</sub>Pt<sub>100-x</sub> alloys can be tuned by up to 50 % by varying the iron content from 42 at. % to 100 at. %. The increasing amount of Pt causes a decrease in the saturation magnetization, and this causes a change in resonance frequency. Furthermore, the damping is enhanced as the Pt is increased due to the additional mosaicity and spin scattering in the alloy.The main focus of this work was the first investigation of the switching behavior and magnetization dynamics of curved nanomagnets ("caps") and their comparison to flat dots of the same diameter and thickness. We find that the spherical caps reverse via coherent rotation at a larger diameter than the flat dots, and that the caps become saturated at lower applied field strengths. The spin wave spectra of the spheres also proved to be dramatically different than the flat dots, exhibiting a complex mode spectrum with atypical field dependence. The additional modes were due to the interplay of the field direction and curvature of the sphere, which caused multiple distinct regions of demagnetizing field value that were able to support localized spin waves.

Transcriptome-based exon capture enables highly cost-effective comparative genomic data collection at moderate evolutionary scales
AbstractBackgroundTo date, exon capture has largely been restricted to species with fully sequenced genomes, which has precluded its application to lineages that lack high quality genomic resources. We developed a novel strategy for designing array-based exon capture in chipmunks (Tamias) based on de novo transcriptome assemblies. We evaluated the performance of our approach across specimens from four chipmunk species.ResultsWe selectively targeted 11,975 exons (~4 Mb) on custom capture arrays, and enriched over 99% of the targets in all libraries. The percentage of aligned reads was highly consistent (24.4-29.1%) across all specimens, including in multiplexing up to 20 barcoded individuals on a single array. Base coverage among specimens and within targets in each species library was uniform, and the performance of targets among independent exon captures was highly reproducible. There was no decrease in coverage among chipmunk species, which showed up to 1.5% sequence divergence in coding regions. We did observe a decline in capture performance of a subset of targets designed from a much more divergent ground squirrel genome (30 My), however, over 90% of the targets were also recovered. Final assemblies yielded over ten thousand orthologous loci (~3.6 Mb) with thousands of fixed and polymorphic SNPs among species identified.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the potential of a transcriptome-enabled, multiplexed, exon capture method to create thousands of informative markers for population genomic and phylogenetic studies in non-model species across the tree of life.

Depth profiling ambient noise in the deep ocean
Deep Sound is an un-tethered, free-falling acoustic platform designed to profile the ambient noise field in the ocean from the surface to a pre-programmed depth, at which point a ballast weight is dropped and the instrument returns to the surface under its own buoyancy. Three iterations of the instrument, Mk I, II and III, have been designed, built and tested, the first two rated to descend to 9 km and the third to a full ocean depth of 11 km. During a deployment of the instrument, vertically and horizontally spaced hydrophones continuously record the ambient noise pressure time series over a large bandwidth (5 Hz - 40 kHz), returning the power spectral density, vertical and horizontal coherence as a function of depth. Deep Sound Mk I and Mk II have been deployed down to 9 km depth in the Mariana Trench and Mk I has descended three times to 5 km, 5.5 km and 6 km in the Philippine Sea. The data reported here examines the depth-dependence of the power spectrum, vertical coherence and directionality of rain and wind noise in the Philippine Sea. Acoustic estimates of rainfall rates and wind speeds are made from the surface to 5.5 km and 6 km respectively and compared to surface meteorological measurements. The depth- dependence of the accuracy of these estimates is relatively small and found to improve with depth. A coherence fitting procedure is employed to return ambient noise directionality and provide information on the spatial variability of an overhead rainstorm. With moderate 7-10 m/s winds, downward propagating noise from directly overhead dominates the noise field directionality from the surface to 6 km. Using the wind generated surface noise and the depth dependence of the spectral slope over the band 1 - 10 kHz, the frequency dependence of the absorption due to sea water is estimated and used to infer a mean water column value of pH

The influence of tectonics, sea level, and sediment supply on coastal morphology in the Oceanside littoral cell, CA
Two studies, conducted within the Oceanside littoral cell, reveal how different earth processes (i.e. climatic, fluvial, and tectonic) affect and control both marine and subaerial morphology. The first study uses terrestrial LIDAR techniques to record changes in subaerial beach sediment due to seasonal transitions, on the San Luis Rey rivermouth in Oceanside, CA. The study period spanned from winter to fall in 2008, so the majority of the data represents the transition from a winter to summer beach profile. A reversal in the seasonal accumulation trend (observed from April-May 2008) may be the result of two erosional wave events, with one occurring concurrently with increased precipitation and river discharge from the San Luis Rey River. The occurrence of two directionally favorable wave events, the second of which occurred during a pulse in precipitation and a slight increase in river discharge, appears to have caused sufficient beach erosion to reverse the seasonal accumulation trend. The second study used high resolution CHIRP seismic reflection data, collected offshore, to provide new insights into tectonic control on coastal morphology and regional shelf width. Within the Oceanside littoral cell, a marked change in shelf width is observed and may be a result of faulting and folding in the region associated with splays off the Cristianitos Fault. There is an abrupt transition in the geology onshore, exposed in the sea cliffs. The tectonic feature responsible for the observed placement of adjacent geologic formations is proposed to be an oblique slip fault

Transcriptome analysis reveals unique metabolic features in the Cryptosporidium parvum Oocysts associated with environmental survival and stresses
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					
						Cryptosporidium parvum is a globally distributed zoonotic parasite and an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Little is known on the metabolic dynamics of the parasite, and study is hampered by the lack of molecular and genetic tools. Here we report the development of the first Agilent microarray for C. parvum (CpArray15K) that covers all predicted ORFs in the parasite genome. Global transcriptome analysis using CpArray15K coupled with real-time qRT-PCR uncovered a number of unique metabolic features in oocysts, the infectious and environmental stage of the parasite.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Oocyst stage parasites were found to be highly active in protein synthesis, based on the high transcript levels of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, transcription and translation. The proteasome and ubiquitin associated components were also highly active, implying that oocysts might employ protein degradation pathways to recycle amino acids in order to overcome the inability to synthesize amino acids de novo. Energy metabolism in oocysts was featured by the highest level of expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene. We also studied parasite responses to UV-irradiation, and observed complex and dynamic regulations of gene expression. Notable changes included increased transcript levels of genes involved in DNA repair and intracellular trafficking. Among the stress-related genes, TCP-1 family members and some thioredoxin-associated genes appear to play more important roles in the recovery of UV-induced damages in the oocysts. Our observations also suggest that UV irradiation of oocysts results in increased activities in cytoskeletal rearrangement and intracellular membrane trafficking.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					CpArray15K is the first microarray chip developed for C. parvum, which provides the Cryptosporidium research community a needed tool to study the parasite transcriptome and functional genomics. CpArray15K has been successfully used in profiling the gene expressions in the parasite oocysts as well as their responses to UV-irradiation. These observations shed light on how the parasite oocysts might adapt and respond to the hostile external environment and associated stress such as UV irradiation.

A light detection and ranging (lidar) study of the Sierra Nevada
Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been used widely for the remote sensing of multiple
parameters from earth’s surface. Lidar systems are used to measure light scattered to find and or
range a specific target using laser pulses and radio waves by measuring the time delay between
transmission of a pulse and detection of reflected signal. Lidar has proven to be a promising
technology for estimating forest biophysical parameters, but due to high-cost of flights, computer
processing times, hard drive storage limitations, lidar flights are not numerous and difficult to
process at high-resolutions. Discreet return lidar (three dimensional point cloud data) is used for
a variety of applications including: urban planning, forest management, wildlife habitat analysis,
and forest biomass estimations. This study aims to provide a framework in generating lidar-derived
product such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and
lidar-derived biomass estimates for a study area in the Sierra Nevada. This study also provides
an open-source framework for storing and sharing spatial data using an online web-content
management system. Results include USGS and lidar-derived DEM error, generating DSMs
across a variety of platforms including point-density reduction, interpolation methods and
resolutions, as well as a comparison of estimating biomass using individual tree extraction from
lidar and a multivariate point cloud regression approach using ground-truthed plot data. The
web-based software in this study is used to store and share data amongst a variety of teams and
persons including the public, the Sierra Nevada Adaptive Management Project, National Critical
Zone Observatories and other research teams associated with UC Merced.

Effects of Tissue Nitrogen and Media Nitrate on Trace Metal Uptake and Trophic Transfer by Ulva spp.
A general survey of trace metal content in Ulva spp. (Linnaeus) around Moss Landing, California was carried out. The next objective was to evaluate whether tissue nitrogen or media nitrate affects metal uptake (As, Pb, Mn, Zn) by Ulva spp. under eutrophic conditions. Additionally, the role of metal burden in the invertebrate Idotea resecata as a function of metal content in its diet was examined. Mean trace metal concentrations in Ulva differed significantly among sites in Moss Landing, California. Laboratory measurements using samples from 15 sites along the central California coast revealed a significant positive correlation between Ulva spp. tissue nitrogen and both arsenic and manganese uptake. No relationship was found between tissue nitrogen and lead or zinc, but a significant positive correlation with the relative change in manganese and lead was observed. Though statistically insignificant, a regression analysis revealed a logarithmic relationship between media nitrate and both tissue arsenic and manganese. Lead and zinc content in Ulva had no relationship with media nitrate. Metal in Idotea resecata was not significantly related to diet treatments; however, a bioaccumulation trend was observed for arsenic and manganese. Given the role of trace metals in the production of photosynthetic enzymes and proteins, variability in productivity may drive the uptake of essential and non-essential elements. Depending on the amount of Ulva consumed, elevated metal content in these macroalgae could pose a health risk to invertebrates and/or humans.

A specific family of interspersed repeats (SINEs) facilitates meiotic synapsis in mammals
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Errors during meiosis that affect synapsis and recombination between homologous chromosomes contribute to aneuploidy and infertility in humans. Despite the clinical relevance of these defects, we know very little about the mechanisms by which homologous chromosomes interact with one another during mammalian meiotic prophase. Further, we remain ignorant of the way in which chromosomal DNA complexes with the meiosis-specific structure that tethers homologs, the synaptonemal complex (SC), and whether specific DNA elements are necessary for this interaction.
				
				
					
						Results
					In the present study we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA sequencing to demonstrate that the axial elements of the mammalian SC are markedly enriched for a specific family of interspersed repeats, short interspersed elements (SINEs). Further, we refine the role of the repeats to specific sub-families of SINEs, B1 in mouse and AluY in old world monkey (Macaca mulatta).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Because B1 and AluY elements are the most actively retrotransposing SINEs in mice and rhesus monkeys, respectively, our observations imply that they may serve a dual function in axial element binding; i.e., as the anchoring point for the SC but possibly also as a suppressor/regulator of retrotransposition.

Extending the Applicability of Lexical Mapping Theory
<p>LFG grants syntactic functions a central role and has developed a theory of argument structure, Lexical Mapping Theory (LMT), which is independent of phrase-structure trees and thus able to account for morpholexical derivations.  Yet some fundamental phenomena falling within the scope of morpholexical analysis – such as morphosemantic (meaning-altering) operations, phenomena referred to 
elsewhere as ‘demotions’, or subjectlessness –are currently denied satisfactory LMT accounts.  This paper offers a way of extending LMT to phenomena which are awkward or impossible to handle with the current widely accepted versions of LMT.
</p>
<p>While retaining the main component of LMT – the feature decomposition of syntactic functions – I suggest the following set of revisions: (1) restoring the early LFG distinction between argument positions and semantic roles; (2) allowing the semantic participants to change order and re-associate with different argument positions for non-default (morphosemantically altered) mappings; (3) fixing the order of (syntactic) argument positions; (4) reformulating the principles of 
argument-to-function mapping to make fuller use of the markedness hierarchy of 
syntactic functions and render the Subject Condition redundant; and (5) using a 
mechanism of increasing markedness to account for morphosyntactic operations 
referred to as ‘demotions’ in RG.  I demonstrate that these revisions make LMT a cleaner formalism which is immediately applicable to some important phenomena that have so far escaped (good) analyses.</p>

TNF alpha enhances cancer stem cell-like phenotype via Notch-Hes1 activation  in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells
Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs; also known as tumor initiating cells) is defined as a small subpopulation of cancer cells within a tumor and isolated from various primary tumors and cancer cell lines.  CSCs are highly tumorigenic and resistant to anticancer treatments.  In this study, we found that chronic exposure to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a major proinflammatory cytokine, enhances CSC phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, such as an increase in tumor sphere-forming ability, stem cell-associated genes expression, chemo-radioresistance, and tumorigenicity.  Moreover, activation of Notch1 signaling was detected in the TNF alpha-exposed cells, and suppression of Notch1 signaling inhibited CSC phenotype.  Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of a Notch downstream target, Hes-1, led to suppression of CSC phenotype in the TNF alpha-exposed cells.   We also found that Hes1 expression is commonly upregulated in OSCC lesions compared to precancerous dysplastic lesions, suggesting the possible involvement of Hes1 in OSCC progression and CSC in vivo.  In conclusion, inflammatory cytokine exposure may enhance CSC phenotype of OSCC, in part by activating the Notch-Hes1 pathway.

Serotonin 5HT-1A receptor density in the brain of the spontaneously hypertensive rats
Hypertension is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, renal failure and stroke. Recent evidence indicates a strong relationship between sleep and hypertension. Neuronal serotonin has been identified as a neurotransmitter that is involved in many processes necessary for the control of both sleep and waking. Serotonin 5HT-1A receptors have been implicated to be involved in the regulation of sleep and waking. The objective of this study is to examine the extracellular domain receptor density for serotonin 5HT-1A. The extracellular domain density of the Serotonin 5HT-1A receptor was compared between control Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in the hypothalamic region of the brain. Additionally, a group of animals were treated with an MMP inhibitor, doxycycline for 26 weeks. At the end of the treatment, systolic blood pressure, proteolytic activity and 5HT-1A receptors extracellular domain receptor density were measured. Immunofluorescence results showed that 5HT-1A extracellular domain receptor density is significantly lower in SHR in the hypothalamic region of the brain compared to that in WKY (p<0.05). After doxycycline treatment, the systolic blood pressure was suppressed in SHR and WKY. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure was noted between the doxycycline treated and non -treated groups (p<0.05). After doxycycline treatment, serotonin 5HT-1A extracellular domain receptor density was significantly increased in the treated SHRs (p<0.05). These results suggest that doxycycline can increase extracellular domain receptor density

The INs and OUTs of the Participle-Adjective Conversion Rule
<p>Bresnan (1978:8-9, 1982:29, 2001:31) proposes that English has a general morphological process of participle-adjective conversion which enables any verbal participle to be used as an adjective. The phenomenon captured by the Participle-Adjective Conversion Rule has been used as key evidence from English that passivisation is a lexical relation change, not a syntactic transformation, and as such, it can feed lexical processes of derivational morphology. The discussion offered in this paper supports fully the lexical character of both passivisation and participial formation. However, it argues for a small but important revision to the formulation of the Conversion Rule. Specifically, the morphological derivation of participles does not engage the syntactic level of argument structure. The input to the Conversion Rule is a verb, and the output is a deverbal form (a participle) which is category-neutral between a verb and an adjective (i.e. it is both a verb and an adjective at the same time). Passivisation is also a derivation, but it is morphosyntactic: it occurs at the level of argument structure of the predicate and it is an operation on grammatical functions. A patient-oriented (derived) participle is passive only if it is used as the main verb of the passive construction.</p>

Asterixis as a Presentation of Cerebellar Ischemic Stroke
Asterixis is not yet considered a common neurological sign of cerebellum infarction, and the pathogenic mechanism for asterixis remains elusive. We report a 58-year-old male with moderate hypertension who presented to our emergency department for acute headache in both cervical and occipital regions of the left side. About 2 hours later the patient developed ipsilateral asterixis in the upper left limb; 3 days later the asterixis disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed cerebellarinfarctions at the left superior cerebellar artery. In conclusion, we observed that a transitory asterixis associated with ipsilateral headache can be an initial clinical manifestation of ipsilateral cerebellar infarctions in the superior cerebellar artery area.

Comparative genomics of the classical Bordetella subspecies: the evolution and exchange of virulence-associated diversity amongst closely related pathogens
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The classical Bordetella subspecies are phylogenetically closely related, yet differ in some of the most interesting and important characteristics of pathogens, such as host range, virulence and persistence. The compelling picture from previous comparisons of the three sequenced genomes was of genome degradation, with substantial loss of genome content (up to 24%) associated with adaptation to humans.
				
				
					
						Results
					For a more comprehensive picture of lineage evolution, we employed comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses using seven additional diverse, newly sequenced Bordetella isolates. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis supports a reevaluation of the phylogenetic relationships between the classical Bordetella subspecies, and suggests a closer link between ovine and human B. parapertussis lineages than has been previously proposed. Comparative analyses of genome content revealed that only 50% of the pan-genome is conserved in all strains, reflecting substantial diversity of genome content in these closely related pathogens that may relate to their different host ranges, virulence and persistence characteristics. Strikingly, these analyses suggest possible horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events in multiple loci encoding virulence factors, including O-antigen and pertussis toxin (Ptx). Segments of the pertussis toxin locus (ptx) and its secretion system locus (ptl) appear to have been acquired by the classical Bordetella subspecies and are divergent in different lineages, suggesting functional divergence in the classical Bordetellae.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Together, these observations, especially in key virulence factors, reveal that multiple mechanisms, such as point mutations, gain or loss of genes, as well as HGTs, contribute to the substantial phenotypic diversity of these versatile subspecies in various hosts.

AbstractFirst paragraph (this article has no abstract)

For well over 100 years, cell biologists have been wondering what determines the size of cells. In modern times, we know all of the molecules that control the cell cycle and cell division, but we still do not understand how cell size is determined. To check whether modern cell biology has made any inroads on this age-old question, BMC Biology asked several heavyweights in the field to tell us how they think cell size is controlled, drawing on a range of different cell types. The essays in this collection address two related questions - why does cell size matter, and how do cells control it.

Chip-scale plasmonic resonant nanostructures : manipulation of light from nano to micro scale
Nanophotonics is finding myriad applications in information technology, health care, lighting and sensing. Plasmonics, as one of the most rapidly growing fields in nanophotonics, has great potential to revolutionize many applications in nanophotonics, including bio-sensing, imaging, lighting, photolithography and magnetic recording. In this dissertation, we explore the electrodynamics of plasmonic fields on different structured metallic chips and demonstrate how to manipulate light from nano to micro scale on the structure plasmonic chips. It is highly desired to excite and control propagation of surface plasmon polariton fields in a systematic fashion as it is possible with optical fields both in free space and dielectric waveguides. To accomplish this goal, we developed the design methodology compatible with the conventional Fourier optical devices, investigated on-chip plasmonic metamaterials with novel material response and functionalities, as well as constructed sophisticated chip-scale integration of different optical element. We begin by discussing the fundamentals of plasmonic fields and modal propagation properties. We next investigate a metallic metamaterial showing form-birefringence by engineering the inherent metal properties on nanoscale, and experimentally characterized their supported plasmonic index ellipsoids. We present novel experimental and analytic results of plasmonic nano metamaterials allowing excitation of plasmonic fields by transverse electric polarized incidence, complementing so far demonstrated transverse magnetic polarized excitation. We further construct a plasmonic photonic crystal to manipulate the propagating plasmonic field on a micro scale. On a lager sub- millimeter scale, we experimentally validated the feasibility of Fourier plasmonics, demonstrating possibilities of miniaturizing the conventional bulky optical devices on small plasmonic chips. We ultimately integrate various photonic components on different scales and provide an approach for efficiently using resonant plasmonic phenomena to achieve nanoscale optical field localization

Phylogenetics of Pteromalidae and Eulophidae (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) With a Study of Cranial Bridges in Chalcidoidea
Phylogenetic studies on two different groups of Chalcidoidea were conducted. The subfamily Pteromalinae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) was analyzed using the 28S D2-D5, Cytochrome b and Cytochrome Oxidase II gene regions, with focus on discovering the nearest relatives of the genus Nasonia. No support was found for monophyly of Pteromalinae, perhaps in part because of the low 28S molecular divergence within the group. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian results indicate that Nasonia renders Trichomalopsis paraphyletic, and that Trichomalopsis sarcophagae is the sister group of the genus Nasonia. Nasonia and T. sarcophagae are both infected by Wolbachia bacteria, suggesting a history of Wolbachia infection that could be older than Nasonia itself. Other clades of Pteromalini that were 100% infected with Wolbachia among sampled species include the Australasian genus Pseudanogmus and Coelopisthia + Diglochis. Support was found for a monophyletic assemblage of taxa historically placed in Miscogasterinae, and the subfamilies Cratominae, Miscogasterinae and Panstenoninae are synonymized under Pteromalinae n. syn. The genus Diconocara is transferred from Pteromalini to Miscogasterini n. stat. based on both molecular and morphological data.	A combined molecular and morphological phylogeny of the family Eulophidae is presented with focus on relationships within the subfamily Entedoninae. The 28S D2-D5 and CO1 gene regions were examined in partitioned maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, and an additional Bayes analysis was conducted to oberserve the effect of historically recognized morphological characters on the results. Eulophidae was strongly supported as monophyletic only when the genus Trisecodes was excluded. The subfamilies Eulophinae, Entiinae (=Euderinae) and Tetrastichinae were consistently monophyletic, but monophyly of Entedoninae was supported only in the combined morphological and molecular analysis. The lack of support from the molecular data was likely due to the form of the 3e´ subregion of the 28S D2 rDNA in the nominal subgenus of Closterocerus. The tribe Euderomphalini was excluded from a monophyletic Entiinae, suggesting that it should be retained in Entedoninae. Opheliminae n. stat. is raised from unplaced tribe to subfamily status, and a sister group relationship of Opheliminae + Entiinae was strongly supported. The genera Neochrysocharis n. stat. and Asecodes n. stat. were removed from synonymy with Closterocerus because molecular data corroborate their morphological differences. Closterocerus (Achrysocharis) germanicus was transferred to the genus Chrysonotomyia n. comb. based on molecular and morphological characters.	The posterior surface of the head was examined in several families of Chalcidoidea and interpreted according to theories of head capsule evolution as proposed by Snodgrass. Most chalcidoids have only a hypostomal bridge, but some species in the families Chalcididae, Eurytomidae, Pteromalidae, and Torymidae have postgenal bridges that may have been independently derived. Species of small-bodied parasitic wasps with a reduced head capsule, such as many Aphelinidae, Mymaridae, and Trichogrammatidae, lack important landmarks and cannot be easily interpreted without making inferences from related species. Several features provide potentially useful phylogenetic information, such as the presence of a postgenal bridge, extent of the hypostomal carina, extent of secondary posterior tentorial pits, and form of the mesal lamellae extending from the foramen magnum to the oral cavity. However, in many cases these characters present problems of homology that require a larger phylogenetic context to answer.

The development of direction selectivity in the mouse retina
Whether capturing prey or evading predators, an animal's ability to detect movement in the world is critical for its survival. The first cells in the visual pathway that are tuned to detect motion are a subset of retinal ganglion cells called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). DSGCs respond strongly to motion in the "preferred" direction and weakly to motion in the opposite, or "null" direction. The circuitry underlying this computation consists of precise wiring between inhibitory interneurons, called amacrine cells, and the DSGCs. The role of neural activity in guiding this wiring is not known. We performed a series of experiments to examine whether DSGCs require activity for normal development. First, we tested whether visual experience was required for the establishment of direction selectivity in the retina. We recorded from the retinas of dark-reared mice using large-scale multi-electrode arrays, which allow for the recording from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. We found that DSGCs develop independent of visual experience, and are present as early as eye-opening. Second, to target recordings from DSGCs before eye-opening, we characterized a mouse line where a class of DSGCs expresses a fluorescent reporter. These experiments also allowed for the first complete description of the projection patterns for this cell. Finally, using this transgenic mouse with labeled DSGCs, we showed that DSGCs participate in spontaneous retinal activity before the eyes open, suggesting a possible role for early, spontaneous activity in their development

perspective: Causes and consequences of range size variation: the influence of traits, speciation, and extinction
The tremendous variation in species richness observed among related clades across the tree of life has long caught the imagination of biologists. Recently, there has been growing attention paid to the possible contribution of range size variation, either alone or in combination with putative key innovations, to these patterns. Here, we review three related topics relevant to range size evolution, speciation, and extinction. First, we provide a brief overview of the debate surrounding patterns and mechanisms for phylogenetic signal in range size. Second, we discuss some recent findings regarding the joint influence of traits and range size on diversification. Finally, we present the preliminary results of a study investigating whether range size is negatively correlated with contemporary extinction risk in flowering plants.

DPY-19-1 : a murine endoplasmic reticulum protein that controls cortical migration
The gene dpy-19 has been shown to be involved in migration of the developing nervous system in Caenorhabditis elegans. We previously have characterized a mouse homologue for this gene. Its expression pattern and association with the C. elegans gene suggest a role for it in cortical migration. Deprivation of mouse DPY-19-1 protein in vitro results in neurons with fewer processes and unusual membrane ruffling. We show here that downregulation of dpy-19-1 during cortical migration leads to an increased rate of migration. Additionally, migrating cells with downregulated dpy-19-1 might have an abnormally shaped leading process. We use a neurosphere migration assay to further examine the role of dpy-19-1 in migration, and results so far are inconclusive

Development of Quantitative FRET Technology for SENP Enzyme Kinetics Determinations and High-Sensitive High-Throughput Screening Assay for Protease Inhibitor Discovery
SUMOylation is an important post-translational protein modification mechanism which plays important roles in a variety of biological processes. Conjugating SUMO to substrates requires an enzymatic cascade. SENP, SUMO specific protease, can either mature pre-SUMO or deconjugate SUMO from its target proteins. To fully understand the roles of SENPs in the SUMOylation cycle, it is critical to understand their kinetics. FRET is an energy transfer phenomenon which occurs between two spectrum-overlapping fluorophores in close proximity. The efficiency of FRET is highly dependent on the distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores, which makes FRET very powerful in the detection of molecular interactions and biomolecular conformational changes.A novel highly sensitive FRET-based protease assay was designed and developed to study the activities and specificities of SENP in SUMOylation signaling pathway and to identify bioactive chemical compounds which can specifically inhibit SENPs' activities. The endopeptidase and isopeptidase activities of SENP1/2/5/6/7c toward SUMO1/2/3 were studied and verified by western-blot assay. A novel quantitative FRET analysis was performed to study the protease kinetics to compare the specificities to substrate. The direct emissions of donor and acceptor were considered in FRET signal analysis. The mathematical algorithm dependent on pre-established standard curves or later optimized internal calibration method related the hydrolyzed substrate concentration to detected fluorescent signals during the dynamic processes, and thus derived the kinetics constants. Then, the developed protease assay and protease kinetics analysis methods were applied to study the pre-SUMO4's maturation and the product inhibition in pre-SUMO's maturation, which indicated the potential application in biomechanism study and chemical compounds' inhibition characterization. Finally, the FRET-based assay was developed to HTS assay to screen small chemical SENP inhibitors. The screening conditions were optimized to achieve satisfactory Z' factor value and high signal-to-noise ratio. 55,000 compounds were screened by the developed HTS assay. The general principles of the quantitative FRET analysis in protease kinetics, including the characterization of inhibition, can be applied to other substrate-protease with inhibitors. The FRET-based protease assay as well as the HTS assay provided a powerful tool for large-scale and high-throughput applications.

Beneath the Surface of Giant Planets: Evolution, Structure, and Composition
This thesis is focused on utilizing the combination of giant exoplanet mass via radial velocity observations and radius via transit observations to study their structure and evolution. In Chapter 2, Giant planet thermal evolution models are coupled to tidal evolution dynamics, including orbital evolution and planet interior heating. Viable tidal evolution histories are explored to explain inflated radii of hot Jupiters. Tidal evolution is demonstrated to be a viable heating mechanism in some cases, but for other cases it can not explain the large radii. The thesis continues in Chapter 3 by exhibiting cases when the tidal-thermal evolution model, including energy-limited mass loss, can be used to infer interior properties and demonstrate a possible evolution history. Specifically, I utilize the thermal evolution models to examine planets CoRoT-2b, CoRoT-7b, and the Kepler-11 system. In Chapter 4, planets with lower incident irradiation are examined to infer the heavy element composition inside a range of planets. These planets don't appear to be significantly inflated by the unknown radius inflation mechanism, thus the mysterious mechanism can be ignored. It is shown that the heavy element mass inside these planets correlates with the metallicity of the star. The heavy element mass also correlates with the mass of the planet. However, the heavy element enrichment is inversely related to the mass of the planet. In the final chapter, I develop a mixing equation of state code for the MESA stellar evolution project. This code is developed with the intention of studying inhomogeneous thermal evolution of planets.

Regulatory Mechanisms of Low Oxygen Sensing and Response in Arabidopsis thaliana
Flooding is a major natural disaster that is responsible for significant crop loss worldwide. Ethylene accumulation and reduced oxygen availability are typical changes upon submergence in plant tissues. Researchers identified two antithetical strategies, `escape' and `quiescence', for survival of submergence. These are manifested in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) through regulation of growth and carbohydrate consumption by group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factors. The low oxygen response of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a model dicot species, includes transcriptional regulation. Independent transcriptomic analyses using microarray technology identified about 50 core hypoxia-responsive genes, including over 25 encoding proteins of unknown function. In this study,<italic> in planta</italic> measurement of oxygen content revealed distinct dynamics in root and shoot tissues upon submergence. Microarray analysis was conducted to dissect the molecular response to submergence of these organs in rosettes and for comparison to that of roots and shoots of hypoxic seedlings. Studies of loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of <italic>HYPOXIA-RESPONSIVE UNKNOWN PROTEIN</italic> (<italic>HUP</italic>) genes identified conserved genes that contribute to low oxygen and submergence tolerance in Arabidopsis. Of these a previously uncharacterized protein was recognized as a negative transcriptional regulator of the hypoxia response. This protein, HYPOXIA RESPONSIVE ATTENUATOR1 (HRA1), contains a trihelix domain and functions as a transcriptional activator in yeast. Overexpression of <italic>HRA1</italic> dampened transcription of core hypoxia-responsive genes in seedlings. Investigation of N-end rule pathway of targeted proteolysis (NERP) unveiled a mechanism of direct sensing of oxygen availability in Arabidopsis. Mutation of genes encoding NERP components resulted in constitutive expression of many core hypoxia-responsive genes. Five Arabidopsis group VII ERFs are positive regulators of transcription in response to hypoxia. One of these was shown to be unstable in seedlings maintained in air and stabilized upon transfer to low oxygen condition and in mutants lacking NERP activity. Thus, the observation that the mutation of the second amino acid of these proteins from cysteine to alanine, provides strong evidence that Arabidopsis group VII ERFs are substrates of NERP in an oxygen-dependent manner. This dissertation provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of low oxygen sensing and response in Arabidopsis, which may be conserved in other plant species.

Structural Analysis of Catalytic and Post-catalytic Spliceosome Complexes
Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression.  Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large and highly dynamic macromolecular machine in the cell.  Errors in splicing have been linked to many diseases, including cancer.  The spliceosome is responsible for precisely joining the protein coding sequences that will be translated to protein.  It is composed of five small nuclear RNA (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) along with over 100 unique proteins.  Understanding the RNA/RNA and RNA/protein interactions that position the pre-mRNA substrate in the spliceosome for the two catalytic steps of splicing is key to determining the molecular mechanisms of this dynamic complex.In this thesis, we compared two states of the spliceosome complexes, catalytic and post-catalytic.  We investigated the role of pre-mRNA sequences in the spliceosome complex stalled prior to the second step of splicing.  We next developed a new strategy that traps the spliceosome after the second step of splicing, but before the mRNA is released.  We show that structural rearrangements of the RNA substrate exist as the spliceosome transitions from the first to second step of splicing.  Using mass spectrometry assays, we identify proteins that stably associate with affinity-purified catalytic and post-catalytic complexes.  We show enrichment of SF3B components and loss of an ATPase, DHX35, in the post-catalytic complex.  In conjunction with biochemical studies, we use electron microscopy to determine structures of both complexes to further gain insights into the spliceosome's role in splicing.  This study serves as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the later stages of spliceosomal progression.

[synesthesium, perceptual, mechanism, condition]

When and how does 2 turn blue? : the neural timing and mechanisms underlying synesthesia
Synesthesia is a perceptual experience in which stimuli presented through one perceptual stream will spontaneously evoke unrelated sensory experiences. While synesthesia can occur in response to drugs, sensory deprivation, or brain damage, research has largely focused on heritable variant comprising roughly 4% of the general population. This condition is by definition involuntary, automatic, and stable over time, and evidence suggests that the condition occurs from increased connectivity between the senses. However, the precise mechanisms that give rise to these sensations remain a matter of active debate. Across five studies using electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and behavioral measures, we present evidence that early and quick communication between low-level perceptual centers mediates the initial processing stage in synesthesia. Furthermore, this research also suggests early synesthetic mechanisms partially overlap with those that support multisensory processes in the general population. This work clarifies the mechanisms that underlie this interesting condition, and provides a roadmap to using synesthesia as a tool to better understand perceptual and conceptual processes present in all individuals

Stellar Mass Buildup in Galaxies in the First 1.5 Gyr of the Universe
The buildup of galaxies is one of the most fundamental questions inmodern cosmology. The study of this process in the first few Gyr of theUniverse, starting from the first stars, is a challenging endeavor. Inthis thesis we have made extensive use of the deepest optical andinfrared images currently available from the <italic>Hubble SpaceTelescope (HST)</italic> and the <italic>Spitzer SpaceTelescope</italic> to study the properties of the stellar populationsand the stellar mass buildup in galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr after theBig Bang.We have studied the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of<italic>z&sim;4-8</italic> Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) in the rest-frameUV and optical and compared them to synthetic stellar population modelsto learn about the properties of these galaxies. We have found that thetypical best fit ages for these systems are in the range 300-600 Myr. Ina more general context this is not a very old population but at<italic>z&ge;4</italic> this represents a large fraction of the cosmictime, indicating that these galaxies likely started forming stars muchearlier, at <italic>z&ge;10</italic>.The star formation Rates (SFRs) estimated for LBGs at<italic>z&ge;4</italic> are generally in the range 1-100 M<sub>sun</sub>yr<super>-1</super>. The stellar mass estimates are most robust forsources with good <italic>Spitzer</italic>/IRAC detections,corresponding to galaxies with stellar masses&ge;10<super>8.5</super> M<sub>sun</sub> at <italic>z&sim;4(&ge;10<super>9.5</super> M<sub>sun</sub> at <italic>z&sim;7</italic>).For sources with lower rest-frame optical luminosities, that, as aresult, are individually undetected in IRAC, their average stellarmasses have been studied in a stacking analysis of a large number ofsources. This enables us to reach stellar masses&sim;10<super>7.8</super>M<sub>sun</sub> at <italic>z&sim;4</italic>.The stellar masses show a fairly tight correlation with UV luminosity orSFR, and the zeropoint of the relation does not seem to evolve stronglywith redshift. This relation is a direct reflection of a correlationbetween the UV and optical colors and it favors a typical star formationhistory (SFH) at high redshift in which the SFR of a galaxy increases asa function of time.  This is consistent with the observed brightening ofthe UV luminosity function (UV LF) and with expectations from numericalsimulations.We have taken advantage of the UV luminosity vs. stellar mass relationobserved in LBGs at <italic>z&ge;4-7</italic> to derive the stellar massfunction (SMF) of galaxies at these redshifts. The method uses acombination of the UV LF and the mean UV vs. stellar mass relation(including the scatter, estimated to be &sim;0.5 dex at brightluminosities at <italic>z&sim;4</italic>). This method allows ananalytic estimate of the low mass slope of the SMF. This slope (thepower-law exponent of the SMF at low masses), is estimated to be in the-1.44--1.55, range which is flatter than the UV LF faint end slope atthese redshifts (&le;-1.74).  This means that low mass systemscontribute less to the total stellar mass density (SMD) of the Universethan would have been estimated assuming a constant mass-to-UV-lightratio. We show that this is also much flatter than the theoreticalpredictions from simulations, which generally over-predict the numberdensity of low mass systems at these redshifts.The UV luminosity vs. stellar mass relation indicates only a smallvariation of the mass-to-light ratio as a function of UV luminosity.This is confirmed in a stacking analysis of a large number of sourcesfrom the HUDF and the Early Release Science fields (<italic>&sim;400z&sim;4, &sim;120 z&sim;5, &sim;60 z&sim;6, 36 at z&sim;7<italic>).Interestingly, the stacked SEDs at <italic>z&ge;5<italic> in therest-frame optical shows a color 3.6-4.5&sim;0.3 mag. This color ishard to reproduce by synthetic stellar population models that onlyinclude stellar continua, and it probably indicates the presence ofmoderately strong emission lines (H&alpha; EW<sub>rest</sub>&sim;300&Aring;). The contribution from such emission lines in the IRAC fluxesindicates that the stellar masses and ages could both be over-estimatedby a factor &sim;2.One of the most interesting results presented in this thesis is theapparent plateau of the specific SFR (sSFR = SFR / stellar mass).  Inearly results, the similarity in the SEDs of galaxies at a given UVluminosity in the <italic>z</italic>&sim;4-7 redshift range resulted invery similar estimates of the SFR and stellar masses of these galaxies.Furthermore, we find that the reported sSFR estimates at<italic>z</italic>&sim;2 are also very similar to the ones in the<italic>z</italic>&sim;4-7 redshift range (&sim;2 Gyr<super>-1</super>for &sim;5&times;10<super>9</super> M<sub>sun</sub> galaxies).  A puzzlearises from the fact that the dark matter accretion rate onto halosis predicted to decrease monotonically and rather fast as a functionof cosmic time (approximately propotional to(1+<italic>z</italic>)<super>2.5</super>). If gas and star formationfollow the inflow of dark matter, the sSFR at a constant mass shouldalso decrease monotonically with time, which is contrary to theindication from these observations. When we include the possibleeffects of emission lines, the stellar masses decrease by a factor&sim;2&times; at <italic>z</italic>&ge;5. The revised stellar massesmay favor a slowly rising sSFR at <italic>z</italic>&ge;2, but therise as a function of redshift is still much slower(sSFR(<italic>z</italic>) propto(1+<italic>z</italic>)<super>0.6</super>) than that of specific darkmatter accretion rate.  This suggests that the stellar mass buildupis somehow decoupled from the dark matter buildup at early times.A detailed understanding of the connection between the buildup of galaxymass and dark matter is key for models of galaxy formation in the earlyUniverse. It will be crucial to expand on analyses like the onepresented here, including larger samples and broader stellar massranges, to explore the buildup of galaxies with improved statistics.Wide-area surveys with newly acquired <italic>HST</italic> and<italic>Spitzer</italic> data, and the upcoming generation ofinstruments, will likely provide the opportunity to make such aconnection.

Co-expression of HER2 and HER3 receptor tyrosine kinases enhances invasion of breast cells via stimulation of interleukin-8 autocrine secretion
Abstract
Introduction
The tyrosine kinase receptors HER2 and HER3 play an important role in breast cancer. The HER2/HER3 heterodimer is a critical oncogenic unit associated with reduced relapse-free and decreased overall survival. While signaling cascades downstream of HER2 and HER3 have been studied extensively at the level of post-translational modification, little is known about the effects of HER2/HER3 overexpression and activation on gene expression in breast cancer. We have now defined the genetic landscape induced by activation of the HER2/HER3 unit in mammary cells, and have identified interleukin (IL)8 and CXCR1 as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HER2/HER3-overexpressing breast cancers.

Methods
Three-dimensional (3D) cultures, invasion and migration assays were used to determine the effects of HER2 and HER3 co-expression and activation. Gene expression analysis was performed to identify the gene network induced by HER2/HER3 in 3D cultures. Bioinformatic analysis and neutralizing antibodies were used to identify key mediators of HER2/HER3-evoked invasion.

Results
Co-expression of the tyrosine kinase receptors HER2 and HER3 induced migration and invasion of MCF10A cells. Microarray analysis of these cells revealed a specific "HER2/HER3 signature" comprising 80 upregulated transcripts, with IL8 being the highest (11-fold upregulation). Notably, examination of public datasets revealed high levels of IL8 transcripts in HER2-enriched as well as basal-like primary breast tumors, two subtypes characterized by a particularly poor prognosis. Moreover, IL8 expression correlated with high tumor grade and ER-negative status. Importantly, treatment with IL8-neutralizing antibodies prevented invasion of MCF10A-HER2/HER3 and BT474 cells in 3D cultures, highlighting the importance of IL8 autocrine signaling upon HER2/HER3 activation.

Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that HER2 and HER3 co-expression induces IL8 autocrine signaling, leading to the invasion of mammary cells. Agents targeting IL8 or its receptor CXCR1 may be useful for the treatment of HER2/HER3/IL8-positive breast cancers with invasive traits.

Mechanism Studies on Fungal Type I Iterative Polyketide Synthases and Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases
Filamentous fungi have long been recognized as prolific producers of natural products due in a considerable part to their strong track record in producing blockbuster drugs such as penicillin and lovastatin. The biosynthetic enzymes from fungi that assemble these molecules, such as polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are large highly complex multifunctional megasynthetases. Different from their well-studied bacterial counterparts, to date, the biosynthetic programming rules utilized by the fungal PKSs and NRPSs remain largely unknown. Despite the fact that a number of fungal PKSs and NPRSs genes have been discovered over the last three decades, few of them have been characterized and thus directly linked to the biosynthesis of specific fungal secondary metabolites. To fully understand the biosynthetic logic of PKSs and NRPSs and decipher the relationship between sequences and the structures of fungal polyketides and nonribosomal peptides, the thesis focus on three independent fungal biosynthetic systems involving PKSs, NRPS and PKS-NRPS. In the first project, the biochemistry of tandem fungal PKSs for the formation of nanomolar HSP 90 inhibitor radicicol are reconstituted in vivo and in vitro and extensively investigated with the help of tool compounds acyl thioesters. Secondly, a cryptic, NRPS-like enzyme (NRPS325) mined from Aspergillus terreus was reconstituted in vitro and was shown to synthesize thiopyrroles and thiopyrazines via unprecedented mechanisms. The remarkable substrate promiscuity of NRPS325 towards different amino acids, free thiols and &#946;-ketoacyl substrates were explored to produce hundreds of new compounds. Lastly, the genome sequence of Aspergillus clavatus was analyzed and the 30 kb cytochalasin gene cluster was identified based on the presence of the PKS-NRPS and a putative Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase. Deletion of the central PKS-NRPS gene, ccsA, abolished the production of cytochalasin E and K, demonstrating the direct association between the natural products and the gene cluster. Overexpression of the pathway specific regulator ccsR greatly elevated the titer of cytochalasins.

The Design, Synthesis, and Study of Solid-State Molecular Rotors: Structure/Function Relationships for Condensed-Phase Anisotropic Dynamics
<italic>Amphidynamic crystals</italic> are an extremely promising platform for the development of artificial molecular machines and stimuli-responsive materials.  In analogy to skeletal muscle, their function will rely upon the collective operation of many densely packed molecular machines (<italic>i.e.</italic> actin-bound myosin) that are self-assembled in a highly organized anisotropic medium.  By choosing lattice-forming elements and moving "parts" with specific functionalities, individual molecular machines may be synthesized and self-assembled in order to carry out desirable functions.  In recent years, efforts in the design of amphidynamic materials based on molecular gyroscopes and compasses have shown that a certain amount of free volume is essential to facilitate internal rotation and reorientation within a crystal.In order to further establish structure/function relationships to advance the development of increasingly complex molecular machinery, molecular rotors and a molecular "spinning" top were synthesized and incorporated into a variety of solid-state architectures with different degrees of periodicity, dimensionality, and free volume. Specifically, lamellar molecular crystals, hierarchically ordered periodic mesoporous organosilicas, and metal-organic frameworks were targeted for the development of solid-state molecular machines.  Using an array of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques, the dynamic properties of these novel molecular machine assemblies were determined and correlated with their corresponding structural features.  It was found that architecture type has a profound influence on functional dynamics.  The study of layered molecular crystals, composed of either molecular rotors or "spinning" tops, probed functional dynamics within dense, highly organized environments.  From their study, it was discovered that: 1) crystallographically distinct sites may be utilized to differentiate machine function, 2) halogen bonding interactions are sufficiently strong to direct an assembly of molecular machines, 3) the relative flexibility of the crystal environment proximate to a dynamic component may have a significant effect on its function, and, 4) molecular machines, which possess both solid-state photochemical reactivity and dynamics may show complex reaction kinetics if the correlation time of the dynamic process and the lifetime of the excited state occur on the same time scale and the dynamic moiety inherently participates as a reaction intermediate. The study of periodic mesoporous organosilica with hierarchical order probed molecular dynamics within 2D layers of molecular rotors, organized in only one dimension and with <italic>ca.</italic> 50% exposed to the mesopore free volume.  From their study, it was discovered that: 1) molecular rotors, which comprise the layers of the mesopore walls, form a 2D rotational glass, 2) rotator dynamics within the 2D rotational glass undergo a transition to a 2D rotational fluid, and, 3) a 2D rotational glass transition may be exploited to develop hyper-sensitive thermally activated molecular machines.  The study of a metal-organic framework assembled from molecular rotors probed dynamics in a periodic three-dimensional free-volume environment, without the presence of close contacts.  From the study of this solid-state material, it was determined that: 1) the intrinsic electronic barrier is one of the few factors, which may affect functional dynamics in a true free-volume environment, and, 2) molecular machines with dynamic barriers <<k<sub>B</sub>T may behave "inertially" in a free volume environment.

One-Dimensional Conducting Polymer Nanostructures for Chemical and Biological Sensor Applications
Despite of their short history, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) have emerged as a novel building block for label-free chemiresistive/FET chemical/biological sensors owing to a great environmental stability, active functional monomers for direct covalent immobilization of bioreceptors, remarkable optical, magnetic, and electrical properties like a semiconductor as well as mechanical property and ease of fabrication possessed by polymers. Tunable electrical conductivity can also be realized by several orders of magnitude via the process called `doping' where anions or dopants is chemically or electrochemically incorporated to oxidized CP backbones to attain the charge neutrality. Confining conducting polymers to one-dimensional (1-D) nanoscale has ultimately increased the surface area to volume ratio and facilitated the electron transport through the bulk of 1-D nanomaterials. Therefore, a small perturbation by adsorbed charged chemical/biological molecules on their surfaces significantly affected the charge distribution within the bulk of 1-D nanomaterials, enhancing the sensitivity and detection limits. While this nano-electronic chemical/biological sensor showed a potential for advanced technology in detection and monitoring, device fabrication and assembly for 1-D conducting polymer nanostructures still appeared challenging to be scalable and reproducible in a cost effective manner.Herein, this dissertation focused on fabrication and assembly of 1-D conducting polymer nanostructures based chemiresistive/FET chemical/biological sensors in a cost effective manner. First, lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) was used to batch-scale fabricate single PPy nanoribbon with controlled dimensions and defined location on various substrates for NH3 detection. Various bioreceptors were also surface functionalized on LPNE grown PPy nanoribbon to investigate sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, dynamic range, and detection limits towards the specific virus and the target protein. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) that recognized cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) were anchored on PPy nanoribbons for the detection of CMV. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs) specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85 complex protein (Ag85) were functionalized on PPy nanoribbons to accommodate the electrostatic screening effect caused by dissolved salt concentration in buffer solution and diluted human serum. On the other hand, template-directed electrodeposition was employed to synthesize PPy nanowires using various dopants and solvents in order to evaluate the structure dependent sensing performances for detection of Ag85B protein.

3>2>1: Investigation of Single Particle Particle and Many Body Physics in Dual-Gated 1,2,3 Layers of Graphene
Graphene, a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, has become the hottest platform for condensed matter physics and a promising next generation electronic material.  The band structures of single-, bi- and tri-layer graphene differ dramatically, yet all host chiral charge carriers with competing symmetries (such as spin, valley and orbital) that may be broken spontaneously or by an external field.  In this thesis we present comprehensive transport studies on double-gated single-, bi- and tri-layer graphene, which lead to further insight into single particle and many-body physics in this fascinating 2D system.         A prevailing motif in these studies was the use of suspended structures with the aim to eliminate extrinsic factors such as disorder, which obscure intrinsic physical phenomena. Our efforts were most successful with dual gated suspended bilayer graphene where an unprecedented sample quality was achieved.         These studies are discussed in chapters six through nine. First, we focus on the observation of a spontaneous zero conductance gap at the charge neutrality point with zero out of plane electric and magnetic fields.  By applying fields this gap can be closed with an electric field of either polarity, and grows monotonically with increasing magnetic field. These findings provide insight into the underlying symmetries of this correlated electron phenomena.	Secondly, we performed a systematic study using several devices of the minimum conductivity at charge neutrality. These devices fall into one group with finite, and another with zero minimum conductivity. Because the second group consists of only high quality samples we surmise this insulating state is intrinsic. By tuning temperature we found this gapped insulating state has a critical temperature suggesting a phase transition between insulating and conducting states. Additionally, the transition is tuned by disorder, out-of-plane electric field, or carrier density, suggesting a quantum phase transition.	Lastly, we study broken symmetry QH states at finite carrier density in the presence of zero and finite out of plane electric field. We find minute electric fields, which are commonly induced in single gated samples, significantly affect the broken symmetry states.

Physical factors affecting larval transport in Mission Bay, California
Determining trajectories of mussel larvae by in situ methods has been a long standing and difficult problem in biological oceanography because of small larval size and high larval dilution rates. To better understand particle trajectories, a hydrodynamic circulation model, ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC), is used to solve the vertically integrated shallow-water equations. A fourth-order Runge- Kutta method is combined with ADCIRC velocity output to advect particles, simulating advection of mussel larvae that originate in Mission Bay, California. Ensemble averages in particle termination locations are then taken to determine changes in trajectories in response to changes in surface stress, bottom stress, release time, and release location. Release from two separate parts of the bay, Dana Landing and Marine Sanctuary, are studied. It is found that surface stress, in the form of either a varying wind or a westward wind, advects particles toward the mouth of the bay. However, a varying wind release does not affect particles from Marine Sanctuary as much as those from Dana Landing. Increasing bottom stress is found to hinder particle advection toward the mouth of the bay for particles originating at Dana Landing or Marine Sanctuary. Particle trajectories originating from Marine Sanctuary are sensitive to release times in contrast with Dana Landing trajectories. Lastly, where particles are released in Dana Landing has no major influence on trajectories

Low prevalence of connexin-40 gene variants in atrial tissues and blood from atrial fibrillation subjects
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The atrial gap junction protein connexin-40 (Cx40) has been implicated to play an important role in atrial conduction and development of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the frequency of Cx40 mutations in AF populations and their impact on Cx40 expression remains unclear. In this study, we sought to identify polymorphisms in the Cx40 gene GJA5, investigate the potential functional role of these polymorphisms, and determine their allelic frequencies. The prevalence of nonsynonymous Cx40 mutations in blood and atrial tissue was also compared to mutation frequencies reported in prior studies.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We conducted direct sequencing of the GJA5 coding and 3&#8242; UTR regions in blood samples from 91 lone AF subjects and 67 atrial tissue-derived samples from a lone cohort, a mixed AF cohort, and several transplant donors. Reporter gene transfection and tissue allelic expression imbalance assays were used to assess the effects of a common insertion/deletion polymorphism on Cx40 mRNA stability and expression.
				
				
					
						Results
					We identified one novel synonymous SNP in blood-derived DNA from a lone AF subject. In atrial tissue-derived DNA from lone and mixed AF subjects, we observed one novel nonsynonymous SNP, one rare previously reported synonymous SNP, and one novel 3&#8242; UTR SNP. A previously noted 25 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 3&#8242; UTR was found to be common (minor allele frequency = 0.45) but had no effect on Cx40 mRNA stability and expression. The observed prevalence of nonsynonymous Cx40 mutations in atrial tissues derived from lone AF subjects differed significantly (p = 0.03) from a prior atrial tissue study reporting a high mutation frequency in a group of highly selected young lone AF subjects.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our results suggest that Cx40 coding SNPs are uncommon in AF populations, although rare mutations in this gene may certainly lead to AF pathogenesis. Furthermore, a common insertion/deletion polymorphism in the Cx40 3&#8242; UTR does not appear to play a role in modulating Cx40 mRNA levels.

The effect of Vinculin deletion on myofilament architecture and the implications for systolic force generation in the heart
Vinculin (Vcl) is a membrane-associated protein that has been shown to play key structural roles in cell adhesion sites and may affect myocardial mechanical function in a direction-dependent manner. Previous studies measured the mechanical effects of Vcl disruption using tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo and reported significant decreases in the transverse systolic strain components in a cardiomyocyte-specific vinculin knockout (cVclKO) mouse model compared with littermate controls 1. However, there was no change in systolic fiber strain in vivo 1. One possible mechanism might be alterations in sarcomeric structure; thus, the lattice spacing and sarcomere length were measured in fixed hearts using microscopy. Measurements from optical diffraction patterns generated using FFTs of electron micrographs yielded an average normalized lattice spacing of 0.0113±0.001 (SD) in end- diastolic cVclKO hearts vs. 0.0095±0.001 in controls (P< 0.05, n=3). A similar trend was observed in the barium- contracted hearts. A crossbridge model was used to compute changes in transverse and axial crossbridge forces associated with this increase in myofilament lattice spacing. A finite element model incorporating these changes in systolic material properties recapitulated key mechanical differences seen between control and mutant mice. The results suggest that Vcl ablation increased myofilament lattice spacing, which alters the crossbridge binding angle of myosin heads; this, in turn, increases the transverse component of sarcomere force and consequently decreases systolic cross-fiber strains in vivo. These results with the experimental measurements suggest that Vcl can influence myofilament architecture and systolic force generation in a direction-dependent manner

The Role of Social Capital and Collaborative Negotiations in Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plans
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Role of Social Capital and Collaborative Negotiations in Multiple Species Habitat Conversation PlansbyNancy A. JimenoDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Political ScienceUniversity of California, Riverside, June 2012Dr. Juliann Allison, ChairpersonHabitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) were established by Congress in 1982 as an amendment to the way the federal Endangered Species Act is implemented on private property. HCPs are an example of a negotiation structure that is established within a legal framework which acts as an "institutional channel" mandating collaborative negotiations and consensus-based decision making. This dissertation examines how competing stakeholders, working within a collaborative negotiation process toward a common goal, establish Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plans (MSHCP). I argue that the collaborative negotiation model inherent in the MSHCP process fosters social capital that acts as a catalyst, drawing those with divergent ideologies and opposing interests into productive negotiations and toward reaching a workable compromise. Participants negotiate their own regulatory terms, working under a strong legal framework that provides assurances that their "voices" have been heard. While the result may be a consensus that is not preferred by individual participants, it is a consensus that participants as a whole agree they are willing to live with. When a compromise is reached, it is deemed legitimate and is therefore less likely to face legal challenge.

Investigation of Conditions for Moisture Damage in Asphalt Concrete and Appropriate Laboratory Test Methods
Moisture damage is the progressive deterioration of asphalt mixes by loss of adhesion between asphalt binder and aggregate surface and/or loss of cohesion within the binder due to water. It is a complex phenomenon affected by a variety of factors, and has not been fully understood in the pavement community with major knowledge gaps in three areas: major contributing factors to moisture damage in the field, appropriate laboratory test procedures, and the effectiveness of treatments. Both field investigation and laboratory investigation were performed in this study to fill up some of the major gaps.
      Statewide condition survey and field sampling were conducted to identify factors contributing to moisture damage. Statistical analysis revealed that air-void content, mix type, pavement structure, cumulative rainfall, and pavement age significantly affect the extent of moisture damage. Laboratory experiments revealed that high air-void contents not only allow more moisture to enter mixes, but also significantly reduce the fatigue resistance of mixes wet conditions. Reduction in the binder content from the optimum binder content may significantly reduce the moisture resistance of asphalt mixes under repeated loading.
      The effectiveness of Hamburg wheel tracking device (HWTD) test to determine moisture sensitivity of asphalt mixes was evaluated by both laboratory prepared specimens and field cores. Results revealed that the current test procedure does not clearly distinguish mixes with different moisture sensitivities. The test tends to overestimate the performance of mixes containing conventional binders and underestimate the performance of mixes containing polymer modified binders. Several ways to improve the prediction accuracy of the HWTD test were suggested. As a new approach of testing, a fatigue based test procedure for evaluating moisture sensitivity was explored in this study. A typical test procedure was determined for comparative evaluation of different mixes, which is a controlled-strain flexural beam fatigue test performed at 20°C, 10 Hz and 200με on specimens pre-saturated under 635 mm-Hg vacuum for 30 minutes and preconditioned at 60°C for one day. An extension of the test procedure for use in the pavement design was also discussed.
      The long-term effectiveness of both hydrated lime and liquid antistripping agents in improving the moisture resistance of asphalt mixes was evaluated by both the tensile strength ratio (TSR) test and the fatigue beam test. Results showed that both treatments are effective even after one year’s moisture conditioning.

Photomechanical, Photothermal and Photothermomechanical Mechanisms of Interaction of Nanosecond Laser Pulses With Artificial Tissue Models and Pigmented Melanoma Cells in Medical Applications
Current therapy to remove vascular lesions involves long laser pulses to coagulate the blood vessels with partial success. Small blood vessels, with thermal relaxation time shorter than the long laser pulses, remain. Skin models incorporating light scattering were irradiated with nanosecond laser pulses. The objective is to destroy blood vessels taking advantage of the short laser pulse high intensity to induce plasma mediated cavitation bubbles. These bubbles may serve as photodisruption mechanism of blood vessels. It was found that permanent or transient bubbles were produced depending on the laser dose, number of pulses and repetition rate. Scattering added to the skin models increased the threshold fluence for plasma formation.Such fast energy deposition from nanosecond laser pulses implies mechanical effects. Laser energy is coupled to a material through a combination of linear and nonlinear absorption. The first results in heat generation and thermoelastic expansion; while the second results in an expanding plasma formation that creates a shock wave and a cavitation bubble. It was found that the shock wave emitted upon plasma formation is spherical while the pressure wave emitted by pure linear absorption has a plane and cylindrical components. For irradiation of an absorbing solution with no plasma formation, the local pressure was calculated using empirical correlations. The low local pressure explains the bubble formation at low temperature increments.When nanosecond laser pulses are applied to absorbing microspheres, thermoelastic expansion of the microparticles originates pressure waves. A melanoma detector takes advantage of this principle. Excessive energy creates bubbles around melanosomes damaging the plasma membrane. Optimum laser parameters for this application must be found. Melanoma cells were irradiated at 355 and 532 nm wavelengths to determine cell survival rate, compare the photoacoustic signal, determine the critical laser fluence for melanin leakage and study the intracellular interactions and their effect on the plasma membrane integrity. Cell survival decreased with increasing laser fluence, although the decrement is more pronounced at 355 nm. Melanin leaks from cells equally for both wavelengths. No significant difference in photoacustic signal was found between wavelengths. Damage to plasma membrane due to bubble formation was imaged.

Single-shot x-ray spectra from electron bunches produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator (LPA) 1, 2 were measured using a photon-counting single-shot pixelated Silicon-based detector 3, providing for the first time direct spectra without assumptions required by filter based techniques. In addition, the electron bunch source size was measured by imaging a wire target, demonstrating few micron source size and stability. X-rays are generated when trapped electrons oscillate in the focusing field of the wake trailing the driver laser pulse 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. In addition to improving understanding of bunch emittance and wake structure, this provides a broadband, synchronized femtosecond source of keV x-rays. Electron bunch spectra and divergence were measured simultaneously and preliminary analysis shows correlation between x-ray and

A study of the Fnr-1 transcription regulator in Geobacter sulfurreducens
In recent history, efforts towards the construction of a transcription regulatory network for Geobacter sulfurreducens have been made in order to model, and ultimately optimize its metabolic activity for bioremediation and clean energy production applications. To contribute to this effort, Fnr-1, a transcription regulator in G. sulfurreducens, was investigated via chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) and high throughput sequencing (ChIP- seq). 368 genes were identified to be regulated by Fnr-1 via ChIP-chip, and 118 genes were identified via ChIP- seq.73 genes were overlapped between both methods. Results of this study suggest that Fnr-1 functions as a global regulator since controlled genes spanned a wide array of cellular functions. However, Fnr-1 activity is not critical to G. sulfurreducens metabolism since gene deletion has no effect on growth rates. Finally, the observed variation between ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq Fnr-1 binding profiles of this study has brought into question the methods currently used for genome-wide analysis of transcription regulator function

Characterization of peptide-mediated delivery of quantum dots into cortical astrocytes
Cell-pentrating peptides have the ability to translocate across cell membranes and deliver macromolecules into cells without disruption to the membranes, making them highly desirable for either experimental or therapeutic purposes. Our interest is in utilizing the capabilities of peptides to deliver conjugated quantum dots to astrocytes in an efficient and high-throughput manner. To deliver the quantum dot to the cytoplasm of primary astrocytes, quantum dot was self-assembled with poly arginine (poly-R) peptides with a histidine tag at the C-terminal end of the peptides, which has a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. In order to deliver the quantum dot to intracellular targets, we employed signal peptides including nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The arginine length of R11 peptide compared to R8 peptide resulted in an increase of quantum dot internalization; the R11 peptide was also the most efficient peptide tested. Concentration, incubation time, buffer conditions, and temperature all affect optimal QD internalization. Transmission electron microscopy results confirmed the uptake of QDs inside cells. Overall, the work in this study provides preliminary approaches for future delivery of quantum dot based sensors into live cells utilizing cell-penetrating peptides

Application of Metagenomics for Identification of Novel Petroleum Hydrocarbon Degrading Enzymes in Natural Asphalts from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits
Recent studies on the biodiversity of asphalt deposits at the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California have revealed the existence of several hundred new species of bacteria and gene sequences encoding putative novel degradative enzymes (Kim and Crowley, 2007). The presence of fossilized extinct animal remains in the La Brea Tar Pits has led to estimations that these natural asphalt seeps have existed for at least 40,000 years (Akersten et al., 1983). These deposits consist of petroleum that has been degraded to the extent that the remaining material is comprised mainly of asphalts and heavy oils, which have saturated into the soil matrix. Since petroleum hydrocarbons are both a target and a product of microbial metabolism (Hamme et al., 2003), the role of microorganisms that inhabit this and other similar environments is directly relevant to development of technology for bioremediation, biotransformation of petroleum hydrocarbons, and microbial enhanced oil recovery for extracting and refining heavy oil.In this research, both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were used to characterize microorganisms and consortia from the La Brea Tar Pits, which are able to degrade a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene). Initial studies applied PCR-DGGE methods to identify the microbial consortia that degrade selected petroleum hydrocarbons during enrichment cultures on pure compounds or mixtures of substances found in petroleum. This study revealed a single Pseudomonas sp. that may be able to degrade multiple PAHs and biphenyl. In addition, PCR based techniques identified a naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas stutzeri that appears to function as a major degradative enzyme in this system. DNA microarray analysis further revealed the presence of a wide variety of petroleum hydrocarbon degrading genes and has verified that naphthalene dioxygenase is the most commonly found degradative enzyme in this microbial community.To further investigate the true microbial diversity of the La Brea Tar Pits, the microbial community associated with the heavy oil at Rancho La Brea was studied used a metagenomics approach. A fosmid clone library was constructed using 38 Kb fragments of DNA extracted from the asphalt-soil samples of Pit 101. This library of about 3,000 clones was then screened for DNA inserts, which contained specific genes that could be targeted using PCR based methods. One selected clone contained the 16S rRNA gene of an unclassified Rhodospirallacaea and a putative 2-nitropropane dioxygenase, which suggest that this new organism degrades persistent nitroalkanes that are common in asphalt.The current investigation of the La Brea Tar pits concluded using Illumina technologies (Illumina, Inc.) to deep sequence the metagenomic library of over 3,000 clones using a high throughput sequencer. Over 75 MB of DNA has been sequenced, from which over 650 contigs with an average length of 500 bp were assembled. Bioinformatics analysis indicated the presence of genes encoding three types of dioxygenases, one of which encoded a naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. along with two other genes that are most similar to previously reported genes encoding biphenyl and toluene dioxygenases. However, sequence analysis revealed that these genes were not significantly similar to these known dioxygenases and may thus be novel. The results of this research provide a foundation for further studies on the evolution and assembly of metabolic pathways in bacteria that have undergone long term adaptation to survival in natural asphalts.

A High-throughput Screening Approach Identifies Selective Regulators of Il12b Transcription
Detection of pathogens by cells of the innate immune system lead to the expression of a subset of inflammatory mediators that will support the clearance of the pathogen present. Pro-inflammatory gene products display a very distinct and controlled pattern of expression. It is hypothesized that there are signaling pathways that, singly or in combination, are responsible for the selective expression of pro-inflammatory factors seen in different physiological settings. It is critical that factors are only induced in the context of an active assault by microbial pathogens and that resolution of this response is complete. Many human pathologies are thought to be caused or exacerbated by the presence of inflammatory mediators expressed outside of a biological need. Two of these tightly regulated inflammatory mediators that play key roles in inflammation, inflammatory auto-immune disease, and cancer are the cytokines interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interleukin 23 (IL-23). These cytokines share a common subunit, IL12p40, which is encoded by the Il12b gene.  Transcription of Il12b can be induced in macrophages through recognition of pathogen associated molecules by Toll-like Receptors (TLRs). To better understand the signaling pathways and factors involved in the selective regulation of Il12b transcription, two cell based, high-throughput screens were performed. These screens were designed to test the hypothesis that treatments capable of modulating expression of a simple promoter reporter plasmid will generally target pathways that regulate proinflammatory gene expression in a non-selective manner, such as the NF-&#954;B and AP-1 pathways; in contrast, treatments that modulate Il12b transcription only in the context of native chromatin will target pathways involved in the selective regulation of Il12b.  To test this hypothesis, we have generated macrophage lines containing an Il12b bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene driving expression of an EGFP reporter. A basic Il12b enhancer-promoter-reporter plasmid driving expression of a DsRed gene was stably integrated into the same line. The LPS induced expression of the BAC reporter was directly compared to the expression of the basic DsRed reporter after exposure to the small molecule or siRNA libraries. The hypothesis is we will be able to enrich the pool of hits with treatments likely to be selective for Il12b by selecting hits that are selective for the chromatinized BAC. Here we present results from both the small molecule screen and the siRNA screen. One hit from the small molecule screen, &#946;2-adrenergic agonists, is further established as a selective inhibitor of Il12b transcription, dependent on the transcription factor NFIL3.

Ets2 regulates colonic stem cells and sensitivity to tumorigenesis
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in the U.S. Approximately 150,000 cases and 50,000 deaths due to the disease occurred last year. Alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway (Wnt, APC, Beta -catentin) are common in colorectal cancer. As the disease progresses mutations in K-ras, p53 and TGF-alpha also arise. Given the role of Wnt signaling in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium, colorectal cancer is likely due to a misregulation of normal developmental pathways. Ets2, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, has been identified as a Wnt target in colorectal cancer cells and in intestinal stem cells. Ets2 has also been identified as a tumor repressor of APCMin intestinal tumorigenesis in the mouse equivalent of trisomy 21. In contrast to a tumor repressive effect, previous studies in this lab have shown that Ets2 has a tumor supportive function through the tumor microenvironment in transgenic mouse mammary tumor models. This apparent paradox can be resolved if Ets2 regulates an intestinal specific tumor suppressive mechanism. Ets2 has been previously shown to activate transcription of the caudal-type homeobox 2 gene (Cdx2) by through a conserved distal region of its promoter in both trophoblast stem cells and in colon cancer cells. Since Cdx2 functions as a tumor suppressor in the distal colon, the cell autonomous role of Ets2 was examined in postnatal colon development and in suppression of tumorigenesis. Using a conditional allele of Ets2 (Ets2flox), and Cre-mediated deletion within the intestinal epithelium, the cell autonomous role of Ets2 was examined. Ets2 deficient cells had a selective advantage in populating distal colon crypts. Furthermore, Ets2 deficient crypts increased in number during the developmental period in which crypt fission rates peak. Consistent with this observation, Ets2 deficient crypts underwent fission more frequently than crypts retaining Ets2. This data suggest that Ets2 deficient stem cells have a selective advantage due to an increase in stem cell proliferation. An increase in stem cell number or proliferation may lead to an increase in tumorigenesis since stem cells are the cell of origin of intestinal tumors in mouse. To test this hypothesis, the colitis associated cancer (CAC) model was used. Tumor multiplicity was increased significantly is Ets2flox/flox VillinCre+ versus Ets2flox/+ VillinCre+ or Ets2flox/flox V-Cre- mice. Tumor size did not differ significantly between the three genotypes. These data support the conclusion that Ets2 acts as a cell autonomous tumor suppressor of intestinal tumorigenesis by inhibiting tumor initiation. To determine if Ras/MAPK activation of Ets2 is required for its tumor suppressive activity, mice carrying a hypomorphic allele defective in Ras/MAPK activation (Ets2A72) were subjected to the colitis associated cancer model. Ets2A72/A72 mice developed twice as many tumors as wild-type animals. Furthermore, induction of acute colitis revealed no significant differences in clinical or histological scoring. In addition, Ets2A72 mice subjected to multiple AOM injections in the absence of colitis had an increase in tumor incidence and multiplicity. These data indicate that activation of Ets2 by phoshorylation of Thr-72 is important for inhibiting tumor development and this affect is not likely mediated by inflammation. To gain insight into how Ets2 is regulated in human colon cancer cells, studies were conducted using the Caco2 human colon cancer cell line. Caco2 cells recapitulate many aspects of differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Increased Ets2 protein expression was found to be associated with a more differentiated state of these cells. The increase in protein levels was not due to an increase in Ets2 mRNA, suggesting that Ets2 protein levels are regulated post- transcriptionally in the Caco2 d

Endogenous short RNAs generated by Dicer 2 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 regulate mRNAs in the basal fungus Mucor circinelloides
Endogenous short RNAs (esRNAs) play diverse roles in eukaryotes and usually are produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by Dicer. esRNAs are grouped into different classes based on biogenesis and function but not all classes are present in all three eukaryotic kingdoms. The esRNA register of fungi is poorly described compared to other eukaryotes and it is not clear what esRNA classes are present in this kingdom and whether they regulate the expression of protein coding genes. However, evidence that some dicer mutant fungi display altered phenotypes suggests that esRNAs play an important role in fungi. Here, we show that the basal fungus Mucor circinelloides produces new classes of esRNAs that map to exons and regulate the expression of many protein coding genes. The largest class of these exonic-siRNAs (ex-siRNAs) are generated by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase 1 (RdRP1) and dicer-like 2 (DCL2) and target the mRNAs of protein coding genes from which they were produced. Our results expand the range of esRNAs in eukaryotes and reveal a new role for esRNAs in fungi

Characterization of Root-Knot Nematode Resistance in Cowpea and Utilization of Cross-Species Platforms in Legume Genomics
Cowpea (<italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic> L. Walp) is an important food and fodder legume worldwide. Cowpea is grown extensively in sub-Saharan Africa where it is an important staple. Root-knot nematode (RKN, <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp.) is a significant pest in cowpea. Several sources of resistance to RKN have been identified in cowpea, including the widely used <italic>Rk</italic> gene. As part of a study to elucidate the mechanism of <italic>Rk</italic> -mediated resistance, the histological response to avirulent M. incognita feeding of a resistant cowpea cultivar CB46 was compared with a susceptible near-isogenic line. It was found that the Rk-mediated resistance is a delayed response which lacked an early hypersensitive reaction (HR).  Typically in pathogen resistance HR is closely associated with an oxidative burst (OB) in infected tissue. Following a basal OB during early infection in both susceptible and resistant cowpea roots no significant OB was detected, a profile consistent with the histological observations of a delayed resistance response. As cowpea does not have a microarray platform, a readily available soybean (Glycine max) genome array was used to identify single feature polymorphisms (SFP) in cowpea. An algorithm called Robustified Projection Pursuit was used for data analysis and RNA was used as a surrogate for DNA to detect SFPs between two genetically diverse cowpea genotypes. Cowpea genomic amplicon sequencing was performed for SFP validation and a 71% validation rate was observed. This study demonstrated that the soybean genome array is a satisfactory platform for identification of SFPs in cowpea. Furthermore, this study provided an example of a method to extend genomic resources from well supported species to "orphan" crops like cowpea.Transcriptome profiles of incompatible and compatible cowpea-RKN interactions for two time points using the Affymetrix soybean GeneChip were generated. The profiles indicated that the RKN resistance pathway was still partially suppressed at 9 days post-inoculation in resistant cowpea roots. Subtle variation of ROS concentration, induction of toxins and other defense related genes were indicated to play a role in this unique resistance mechanism. Further functional analysis of these differentially expressed genes will advance understanding of this intriguing plant-nematode interaction in a more precise manner.

A CD19/Fc fusion protein for detection of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) consist of the antigen-recognition portion of a monoclonal antibody fused to an intracellular signaling domain capable of activating T-cells. CARs displayed on the surface of transduced cells perform non-MHC-restricted antigen recognition and activating intracellular signaling pathways for induction of target cytolysis, cytokine secretion and proliferation. Clinical trials are in progress assessing the use of mature T-lymphocytes transduced with CARs targeting CD19 antigen to treat B-lineage malignancies. CD19 is an attractive target for immunotherapy because of its consistent and specific expression in most of the stages of maturation and malignancies of B-lymphocyte origin, but not on hematopoietic stem cells. Antibodies against the extracellular domain of the CAR molecule (anti-Fab, Fc or idiotype) have been used for detection of CAR expression in research and clinical samples by flow cytometry, but may need development for each construct and present significant background in samples from xenograft models.
				
				
					
						Methods
					A specific reagent for the detection of anti-CD19 CAR expression was developed, a fusion protein consisting of human CD19 extracellular domains and the Fc region of human IgG1 (CD19sIg). Genes encoding CD19sIg fusion proteins were constructed by fusing either exons 1 to 3 (CD19sIg1-3) or exons 1 to 4 (CD19sIg1-4) of the human CD19 cDNA to a human IgG1Fc fragment. These fusion proteins are intended to work in similar fashion as the MHC Tetramers used for identification of antigen-specific T-cells, and may also have other applications in studies of activation of anti-CD19 CAR bearing cells. The CD19sIg proteins were produced from 293&#160;T cells by stable lentiviral vector transduction and purification from culture medium.
				
				
					
						Results
					ELISA assays using several different monoclonal antibodies to CD19 demonstrated dose-related specific binding by the fusion molecule CD19sIg1-4, but no binding by CD19sIg1-3. Conjugation of the CD19sIg1-4 fusion protein to Alexa Fluor 488 allowed specific and sensitive staining of anti-CD19 CAR-bearing cells for flow cytometry assays, detecting as low as 0.5% of CAR-modified primary cells with minimal background staining.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This fusion molecule is a sensitive reagent for detection of anti-CD19 CAR derived from any monoclonal antibody present in CAR-modified T-cells.

Biological-physical interactions in marine plankton : the effects of small-scale turbulence on grazing, growth, and swimming of sea urchin larvae
Many benthic marine invertebrates have a planktonic larval stage in their life cycle. Larval growth is partly determined by environmental factors that ultimately affect reproductive success of adults. The goal of this dissertation was to understand the effects of small-scale biological and physical environmental factors using both laminar and turbulent flow experimental approaches on grazing, growth, and swimming in larvae of the white urchin, Lytechinus pictus, and purple urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Predator-prey encounter models predict that ingestion increases for fluid shear levels greater than G<sub>cr</sub>, the critical shear level above which encounters due to shear are greater than those resulting from behavior alone. Ingestion rates in larvae exposed to laminar shear representing dissipation rates, Epsilon, of 0 - 1 cm² s⁻³, using simple Couette flow matched model predictions incorporating feeding current rather than swimming speed. Shear had no effect on ingestion rate for shear levels < G<sub>cr</sub>. Model predictions were also tested using turbulent rather than laminar flow, in which flow is intermittent and vorticity occurs. There was no difference in ingestion rates for dissipation rates lower than the critical level, as predicted. Turbulent flow results were similar to those using a laminar flow approach, supporting the prediction that suspension feeders such as urchin larvae do not benefit from low to moderate levels of turbulence present in the ocean. The swimming ability of larvae was investigated using laminar flow to test the hypothesis that urchin larvae do not behave as passive particles in small-scale turbulence. L. pictus larvae, which have longer arms than S. purpuratus, exhibited swimming stability at low shear levels while all larvae behaved as passive particles at higher shear levels. As swimming speed is correlated with arm length, these results suggest that swimming stability scales with swimming speed. Overall, these results support the new paradigm that larval behavior plays an important role in small-scale biological-physical interactions involved in grazing and growth. These processes are important in feeding success, duration of the larval period, dispersal potential, and recruitment success

Assessing the genetic architecture of metabolic diseases using candidate gene and genome-wide approach
Much work has targeted the detection of disease genes through genetic mapping for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other diabetes-related traits such as body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. However, the etiology of metabolic diseases remains partially understood hampering the development of more personalized diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies.This dissertation examines the association between genetic variants with risk of metabolic diseases and diabetes-related quantitative traits in both candidate gene and genome-wide scan settings. In particular, we assessed the association of genetic loci related to adiposity, inflammation, and lipid storage, with the risk of diabetes using a candidate gene approach. We also investigated biological pathways that may give rise to the development of vascular disease (T2D and/or CVD) and also further investigated genetic variants related to BMI and HbA1C levels using a genome-wide approach. Chapter 1 introduces general background on the evolution of genetic research in the arena of metabolic diseases. Chapter 2 investigates common variants in the genomic region of FABP4, CRP, TNF, IL6 and PPARG in relation to diabetes risk among postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS). Chapter 3 examines whether common variants involved in vascular disease risk are clustered in multiple pathways among African and Hispanic American participants in the WHI SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) cohort. Chapter 4 examines the association between genetic variants with BMI and HbA1C levels using a family-based genome-wide association approach among participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Our main findings are: 1) Candidate gene-based studies indicate that variation exists across even the candidate gene regions. FABP4 genotypes were associated with reduced VCAM-1 levels, though none of the common genetic variants in the FABP4 gene examined were associated with risk of T2D. We also observed modest associations between TNF genetic variants and circulating concentrations of TNF-&#945;-R2, although common variants of CRP, TNF, and IL6 genes were not associated with T2D risk. Using the example of the PPARG gene with T2D risk, however, we replicated the association between the PPARG Pro12Ala genetic variant with diabetes risk and found that haplotype-based analysis is more powerful than single-SNP analysis for identifying genetic variants. 2) Using a pathway-based analytical approach and genome-wide scan data collected among African and Hispanic American postmenopausal women, we observed that genetic variants associated with vascular disease appeared to cluster into several biological pathways including the glycerolipid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathways. 3) We found strong associations between SNPs near the LOC100507205 locus and BMI in the family-based Framingham Heart Study with three generations. We also replicated five well-validated genes that have been previously reported to be significantly associated with the BMI trait. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature in identifying genetic variants in the development of metabolic disease, further future work (e.g. in the area of structure and functional variants) are warranted to improve understanding of the genetic architecture for metabolic outcomes. Increasing integration of cutting edge genomic science into population-based epidemiologic investigation will accelerate and improve our understanding of the genetic susceptibility of complex diseases.  The work described in this dissertation represents a tip of our effort toward the ultimate improvement of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases in human populations.

A Study of Aluminum Dependent Root Growth Inhibition in Arabidopsis thaliana
Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a global agricultural problem and is one of the major factors that limit crop productivity on acidic soils.  Plant Al toxicity is involved in many hypothesized mechanisms since it can interact with many intracellular and extracellular structures of the root.  Mechanisms of Al exclusion, which confers Al-tolerance and resistance, have been studied in depth while internalized Al-tolerance mechanisms have not been fully described due to the complexity of the predicted cellular targets of Al.	Several Al hypersensitive mutants have been identified suggesting that they represent mutations in genes that are required for Al-tolerance or resistance.  One of these mutants, <italic>als7</italic> was identified as a mutation in <italic>Slow Walker2</italic>.  Molecular analysis revealed that Al hypersensitivity in <italic>als7-1</italic> is correlated with loss of expression of a factor required for methionine recycling, which leads to reduced levels of endogenous polyamines.  Further analysis shows that Al-dependent root growth inhibition is reversed by addition of exogenous spermine.  Spermine likely functions to compete with Al<super>3+</super> for binding to extra- and intracellular anionic sites, which is shown by the severe reduction in Al accumulation in spermine-treated roots.  	Several suppressor mutations were identified that masked the Al hypersensitivity of <italic>als3-1</italic>.  One of these mutations, <italic>alt2-1</italic> was isolated and represents a mutation in a WD40 protein that contains a DWD motif.  Loss of <italic>alt2-1</italic> causes the plant to fail to detect DNA damage caused by Al stress.  This prevents a halt in the cell cycle for DNA repair, which in turn maintains the quiescent center and allows the plant to tolerate high levels of Al.  Furthermore, <italic>alt2-1</italic> is hypersensitive to the interstrand and intrastrand cross-linking agents.  From <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, Al has been shown to be a DNA cross-linker, suggesting that <italic>alt2-1</italic> is required to detect DNA cross-links.  These results taken together suggest that Al is acting as a DNA cross-link mimic or a weak DNA cross-linker, which has minor immediate consequence on the plant if the cross-link is not detected.

Whole-genome resequencing of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 undergoing short-term laboratory evolution in lactate minimal media reveals flexible selection of adaptive mutations
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               Short-term laboratory evolution of bacteria followed by genomic sequencing provides insight into the mechanism of adaptive evolution, such as the number of mutations needed for adaptation, genotype-phenotype relationships, and the reproducibility of adaptive outcomes.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               In the present study, we describe the genome sequencing of 11 endpoints of Escherichia coli that underwent 60-day laboratory adaptive evolution under growth rate selection pressure in lactate minimal media. Two to eight mutations were identified per endpoint. Generally, each endpoint acquired mutations to different genes. The most notable exception was an 82 base-pair deletion in the rph-pyrE operon that appeared in 7 of the 11 adapted strains. This mutation conferred an approximately 15% increase to the growth rate when experimentally introduced to the wild-type background and resulted in an approximately 30% increase to growth rate when introduced to a background already harboring two adaptive mutations. Additionally, most endpoints had a mutation in a regulatory gene (crp or relA, for example) or the RNA polymerase.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               The 82 base-pair deletion found in the rph-pyrE operon of many endpoints may function to relieve a pyrimidine biosynthesis defect present in MG1655. In contrast, a variety of regulators acquire mutations in the different endpoints, suggesting flexibility in overcoming regulatory challenges in the adaptation.

Magnetically vectored nanocapsules for tumor penetration and remotely switchable on-demand drug release
Hollow-sphere nanocapsules containing intentionally trapped magnetic nanoparticles and defined anticancer drugs provide a powerful magnetic vector under moderate gradient magnetic fields, and enable the nanocapsules to penetrate into the midst of tumors and allow a controlled on-off switchable release of the anticancer drug cargo by remotely applied Radio Frequency (RF) magnetic field. This imageable smart drug delivery system is compact because the drug molecules and magnetic nanoparticles can all be self-contained within 801̃50 nm capsules. In vitro as well as in vivo results indicate that the nanocapsules are effective in reducing tumor cell growth. In Chapter 1, the concept of Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) and the impact of nanotechnology on Drug Delivery Systems were introduced. Triggered drug release using magnetothermally-responsive nanomaterials, magnetic nanoparticles for nanomedicine, and ordered mesoporous materials in the context of Drug Delivery System were discussed. In Chapter 2, creation of remotely controllable, On-Off switchable drug release methodology was described. In this thesis work, triggerable nanocapsules which contain magnetic nanoparticles responsive to external radio frequency (RF) magnetic field have been successfully created. This is in contrast to the regular hollow nanospheres for slow passive release of drugs. The new nanocapsule material consists of bio-inert, bio-compatible or bio-degradable material that we can be selected from a variety of materials depending on specific medical applications. In Chapter 3, study and utilization of magnetic vector for guided tumor penetration was discussed. In the presence of a moderate gradient magnetic field, a powerful magnetic vector is created that allows these nanocapsules to cross cell membranes or blood-tissue barriers and penetrate into the midst of tumors, thus overcoming the well-known problem of limited access of anti-cancer drugs to cancer cells in the interior of a tumor tissue. In Chapter 4, potential applications to Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) crossing and other therapeutics was described. In Chapter 5, the study was summarized and concluded

Development of a Scanning Probe Microscope and Studies of Graphene Grown on Copper
A description of the construction of a low noise fiber interferometer deflection sensor is presented in order to illustrate the capabilities of the developed home built scanning probe microscope (SPM). A description of the critical components and a rationale behind their implementation in the design of the sensor is provided. An analysis of an ideal interference cavity is used to understand the optimization of the deflection sensor towards achieving the highest possible sensitivity and lowest deflection noise density. The low noise interferometer can be used to detect the motion of micron sized resonators without the need for external lenses or polarization sensitive optical components, allowing for simplified implementation in a variety of circumstances. True atomic resolution imaging of muscovite mica in water by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is demonstrated using the developed sensor in the home built SPM.Results on graphene grown on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is provided. Graphene appears to grow over grains of different identities and across grain boundaries of the copper. Graphene island growth on the surface appears to depend on the underlying substrate. Temperature dependent growth studies show a significant decrease in growth rate with decreasing temperature. The graphene grown on copper is shown to be transferable to arbitrary substrates and can be suspended across perforations in a receiving substrate. The knowledge gained from the growths on copper allowed for the successful fabrication of a new type of hybrid polymeric - conductive AFM probe using patterned silicon substrates and thin copper films.Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was performed on graphene grown on copper substrates using the home built instrument. First, atomic scale STM imaging of graphene on polycrystalline copper substrates was accomplished. Graphene is shown to grow continuously over atomic steps, edges, and vertices of these corrugated copper surfaces. Continuous graphene growth is observed to exist over facets of different identities. The results on polycrystalline copper strongly suggests that the copper atoms are mobile during growth and that the underlying substrate does not limit graphene growth. In addition, STM was performed on graphene grown on copper (100) single crystals. The growth is again shown to be continuous over a wide range of surface features. The grown graphene exists in a variety of orientations with respect to the underlying copper crystal lattice. This leads to graphene overlayers which are polycrystalline in nature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to reveal the crystallinity of graphene grown on single crystals and the real space distribution of the crystal domains in grown graphene. The compiled results of graphene growth on copper suggest that understanding and controlling the nucleation at the surface will ultimately be required for wafer scale growth of monolayer single crystal graphene on copper.

Putrescine-Mediated Changes in Mammalian Intracellular Polyamine Levels Increase Spermidine/Spermine-N1-Acetyltransferase Activity and Increase Gene Expression of Several Cell Cycle-Related Genes
Polyamines are aliphatic polycations existing in all living organisms and are essential for life.  Most organisms synthesize three types of polyamines: putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.  Putrescine is the product of the rate-limiting reaction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and the amino acid ornithine.  Spermidine and spermine are downstream metabolites sequentially derived from putrescine.  In a recent landmark colon cancer chemopreventative clinical trial researchers found that combining alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a selective ODC suicide inhibitor, and sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, led to a 70% reduction of recurrence of all adenomas and a 90% reduction of recurrence of advanced and/or multiple adenomas over a 3-year treatment.  This study shows that polyamine metabolic enzymes are attractive targets for possible chemotherapeutics.  Our previous research has shown that stable ODC overexpression led to increased ODC activity, elevated intracellular putrescine levels with concomitant losses of spermidine and spermine, and increased spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) activity.  Following a genome-wide array analysis on the effects of ODC overexpression in mammalian cell lines, several cell cycle-related genes were found to be upregulated.  We investigated whether changes in polyamine levels, polyamine metabolism, and gene expression following stable ODC overexpression could be replicated following treatment with exogenously supplied putrescine.  We observed that intracellular putrescine levels following treatment with exogenous putrescine accumulated to levels observed during stable ODC overexpression.  These putrescine-mediated changes in intracellular putrescine pools also led to increased mRNA levels and activity of SSAT and to increased gene expression of ID1, c-Jun, and c-Fos in a time- and dose-dependent manner.  We also determined that the observed increases in gene expression were mediated by the accumulation of intracellular putrescine independent from the activation of key, rate-limiting polyamine metabolic enzymes.  Changes in intracellular polyamine pools, polyamine metabolism, and gene expression following the administration of exogenously supplied putrescine closely resembled the changes observed following stable ODC overexpression.

Novel lanthanide-labeled metal oxide nanoparticles improve the measurement of in vivo clearance and translocation
Abstract
				
				The deposition, clearance and translocation of europium-doped gadolinium oxide nanoparticles in a mouse lung were investigated experimentally. Nanoparticles were synthesized by spray flame pyrolysis. The particle size, crystallinity and surface properties were characterized. Following instillation, the concentrations of particles in organs were determined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The protein corona coating the nanoparticles was found to be similar to the coating on more environmentally relevant nanoparticles such as iron oxide. Measurements of the solubility of the nanoparticles in surrogates of biological fluids indicated very little propensity for dissolution, and the elemental ratio of particle constituents did not change, adding further support to the contention that intact nanoparticles were measured. The particles were intratracheally instilled into the mouse lung. After 24&#8201;hours, the target organs were harvested, acid digested and the nanoparticle mass in each organ was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The nanoparticles were detected in all the studied organs at low ppb levels; 59% of the particles remained in the lung. A significant amount of particles was also detected in the feces, suggesting fast clearance mechanisms. The nanoparticle system used in this work is highly suitable for quantitatively determining deposition, transport and clearance of nanoparticles from the lung, providing a quantified measure of delivered dose.

Analysis of Heterochromatin-Associated Genomic Instability
Heterochromatin represents special regions in the genome that have been found to be prone to breakage and rearrangements in cancer cells.  Through two separate but related projects on heterochromatin, this dissertation demonstrates the important role of heterochromatin in maintaining genomic integrity.  In the first project by transfecting non-coding heterochromatic sequences into cells, a significant increase in genomic instability was induced as demonstrated by increased Comet tails using the Comet assay. In the second project, we developed a more precise approach to measure the size of constitutive heterochromatin bands on human chromosomes. Using this new technique, we have seen increased variability of the heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1 and 9 in lymphoblastoid cells derived from breast cancer patients as compared to that of age-matched controls. These results indicate that heteromorphisms in the heterochromatin of these chromosomes may be used as a biomarker to identify women with a higher susceptibility to breast cancer.  In summary, these observations of heterochromatin- associated genomic instability suggest that heterochromatin regions are fragile sites for breakage and rearrangements and these alterations may act in a cis fashion to promote genomic instability.

Thermal Conduction in Graphene and Graphene Multilayers
There has been increasing interest in thermal conductivity of materials motivated by the heat removal issues in electronics and by the need of fundamental science to understand heat conduction at nanoscale. This dissertation reports the results of the experimental investigation of heat conduction in graphene and graphene multilayers. Graphene is a planar single sheet of <italic>sp</italic><super>2</super>&ndash;bonded carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattice. It reveals many unique properties, including the extraordinarily high carrier mobility. In order to measure the thermal conductivity of graphene we developed an original non&ndash;contact technique based on micro&ndash;Raman spectroscopy. The samples for this study were prepared by mechanical exfoliation and suspended across trenches in Si/SiO2 substrates. The number of atomic planes was determined by deconvolution of the Raman 2D band. The suspended graphene flakes attached to the heat sinks were heated by the laser light focused in the middle. The Raman G peak&rsquo;s temperature sensitivity allowed us to monitor the local temperature change produced by the variation of the excitation laser power. A special calibration procedure was developed to determine the fraction of power absorbed by graphene. Our measurements revealed that single&ndash;layer graphene has an extremely high room-temperature thermal conductivity in the range 3800 &ndash; 5300 W/mK depending on the flake size and quality. It was also found that most of the heat near room temperature is transferred by acoustic phonons rather than electrons. Theoretical studies of the phonon thermal conduction in graphene, which included detail treatment of the Umklapp scattering, are in agreement with our experiments. The measurements were also extended to few&ndash;layer graphene. It was shown that the thermal conductivity reduces with the increasing number of layers approaching the bulk graphite limit. To validate the measurement technique we investigated the thermal conductivity of the polycrystalline graphene films and reduced graphene oxide films deposited on polyethylene terephthalate substrates. In this case we obtained much smaller values of thermal conductivity, which was explained by the strong acoustic phonon scattering on the grain boundaries.  Obtained results are important for electronic applications of graphene and may lead to new methods of thermal management of nanoelectronic chips.

GEOMORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BOULDERS AND POLYGONS ON MARTIAN PERIGLACIAL PATTERNED GROUND TERRAINS
Images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment Camera onboard the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter show the surface in higher detail than previously capable. I look at a landscape on Mars called permafrost patterned ground which covers ~10 million square kilometers of the surface at high latitudes (>50°). Using the new high resolution images available we objectively characterize permafrost patterned ground terrains as an alternative to observational surveys which while detailed suffer from subjective bias. I take two dimensional Fourier transforms of individual images of Martian permafrost patterned ground to find the scale most representative of the terrain. This scale acts as a proxy for the size of the polygons themselves. Then I look at the distribution of spectral scales in the northern hemisphere between 50-70° and find correlations to previous studies and with the extent of ground ice in the surface. The high resolution images also show boulders clustering with respect to the underlying pattern. I make the first detailed observations of these clustered boulders and use crater counting to place constraints on the time it takes for boulders to cluster. Finally, I present a potential mechanism for the process that clusters the boulders that takes the specifics of the Martian environment to account. Boulders lying on the surface get trapped in seasonal CO2 frost while ice in the near surface contracts in the winter. The CO2 frost sublimates in spring/summer allowing the boulders to move when the near surface ice expands in summer. Repeated iterations lead to boulders that cluster in the polygon edges. Using a thermal model of the subsurface with Mars conditions and an elastic model of a polygon I show boulders could move as much as ~0.1mm per year in the present day.

Tomato-Potato Aphid Interactions: Insights into Plant Defense and the Aphid Pest
Aphids cause extensive economic losses to cultivated crops worldwide. Their success as pests is in part due to their complex life cycle, wide host range, and the ability of a female aphid to contain not only the developing embryos of her daughters, but also those of her grand-daughters which develop within her daughters. The latter results in build up of immense populations very quickly. Resistant plants represent an environmental friendly approach to combat aphid pests. Better understanding of plant-aphid interaction will contribute to engineering durable plant resistance. In tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>), the <italic>Mi-1</italic> gene confers resistance to potato aphid (<italic>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</italic>), root-knot nematode (RKN) (<italic>Meloidogyne</italic> sp.), whitefly (<italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>), and tomato psyllid (<italic>Bactericera cockerelli</italic>). This incompatible tomato interaction with RKN is characterized by hypersensitive response and vast transcriptional reprogramming, including differential regulation of transcription factors (TFs). Using gene knock-down approach in Chapter one, a role for <italic>SlWRKY70</italic> TF was identified in Mi-1-mediated tomato resistance against potato aphid and RKN. Gene expression analysis showed that the regulation of this TF by Salicylic acid and Jasmonic acid hormones is conserved between tomato and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The study of <italic>SlWRKY70</italic> revealed that there is no consistent nomenclature for plant WRKY TF family. For this reason a phylogenetic analysis was conducted using sequences from 15 plant species. Chapter two presents the analysis and the established orthologous relationship of WRKY TFs among these plant species. Consequently, this analysis allowed the design of a systemic nomenclature for the WRKY TF family to include the inferred orthology relationships. Chapters three and four pursued another approach to understand plant-aphid interactions. These chapters focused on identifying the aphid effectors and putative lineage-specific set of genes through sequencing the aphid and its salivary gland transcriptomes. In Chapter three sequencing and annotation of the potato aphid transcriptome enabled us to conduct comparative sequence analysis with three other aphid species, as well as seven additional species of insects from different clades and a planktonic crustacean. This analysis identified a set of aphid-specific genes, which may contribute to aphid's unconventional biology. The transcripts of a subset of these aphid-specific genes were expressed in the salivary glands suggesting that they are involved in aphid-host interactions. To study this interaction in more detail, the potato aphid salivary gland transcriptome was sequenced in Chapter four. This enabled identification of secreted proteins based on prediction of secretion signal peptides. In planta functional characterization of eight of these putative aphid secreted proteins identified roles for two, Me10 and Me23, in altering tomato responses to the aphid's advantage.

[rest, repressor, cell, re1]

Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Roles of the Transcription factor REST
The neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), also known as repressor element -1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor (REST), is known to act as a transcriptional repressor of neuron-specific genes in nuclei of non- neuronal cells. REST binds a DNA sequence known as neuron- restrictive silencer elements (NRSEs/RE1s) and recruits co -repressors to carry out silencing chromatin modifications. Recent REST ChIP-seq publications have shown that REST binding is not limited to the canonical RE1 sequence, but binds multiple variations of it across the genome. This study focuses on determining REST's capacity to act as a repressor based on the binding site's degree of correspondence to the canonical RE1 motif. I show that the RE1 right half site acts as a REST- recruiting repressive element. I have also begun studying differential recruitment of REST protein and its cofactors between human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hESC- derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on a genome-wide scale using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing of DNA tags (ChIP-seq). I also present preliminary data suggesting that REST may have a second function as a post-transcriptional activator. Increased luciferase expression is observed when reporter constructs were cotransfected with high levels of REST in mouse Neuro2A (N2A) cells. I show that this concentration dependent function of REST is due to the cell's limited capacity to transport and/or retain REST in the nucleus, where it acts as a repressor. With increasing concentrations of REST, a large fraction remains in the cytoplasm, where REST may bind and stabilize the luciferase transcript and/or enhance its translation

From Ions to Intrinsic Connectivity Networks:  The Neuroscience That Bio-Sociology Needs to Know
In 1995 sociologist J. Richard Udry wrote an article entitled, "Sociology and Biology: What Biology do Sociologists need to Know?"  Although Udry's article represents an important early step in the development of the biosocial perspective, the full impact of his thesis is blunted by the fact that he fails to discuss in sufficient detail the mechanisms underlying the biosocial relationships he identifies.  Nor, for that matter, does Udry provide a sufficient metatheoretical/metamethodological explanation for how biological data can and should be incorporated into existing social science theory and research.  Finally, and of no fault of his own, Udry's article was published a few years before several extremely important discoveries regarding the neurological foundations of many psycho-sociological processes fundamental to micro-sociological theory.  This dissertation is intended to serve as a follow-up to Udry's (1995) original essay in that it seeks to overcome the above limitations by both broadening and deepening the scope of the `biology that sociology needs to know," as well as articulating a framework for how said insights can be incorporated into sociological research.The integrated meta-framework developed here is designed to create two sets of analytical tools to guide the construction of biosocial theory and to carry out biosocial research.  The first of these are the taken-for-granted substantive positions provided by the life sciences regarding the biological mechanisms underlying how the `body' generates `mind', as well as the substantive questions every biosocial theory must answer.  The second set of analytical tools contains the substantive and methodological working strategies that provide the conceptual definitions, operational definitions, scope conditions, and empirical referents that serve as the building blocks for biosocial theories.  Moreover, the biosocial meta-framework also specifies two sets of analytical processes for creating the above tools.  The first of these sets specified how to transform one or more discursive social theories into a format that is conducive to the integration of biological data.  The second set, in turn, specified how to gather biological data about a psycho-social process and then integrate it into a social theory.

[odor, receptor]

Computational Analysis of Receptor-Odor Interactions and Prediction of Behavior-Modifying Chemical Space
Coding of information in the peripheral olfactory system and resulting olfactory dependent behavior is thought to depend primarily on two fundamental factors: the interaction of individual odors with different subsets of the odor receptor (Or) repertoire, and the mode of signaling that an individual receptor-odor interaction elicits, activation or inhibition. In order to better understand these processes, we design and implement a structure-based virtual screening approach that identifies common structural features that are highly correlated with odor activity for individual receptors. We then apply these features to rapidly screen for putative ligands <italic>in silico</italic> from a large untested odor space (>240,000 putative volatiles) for the majority of odor receptors in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna, allowing for analysis of odor coding for the majority of receptors for the first time. Functional experiments support a high success rate (~71%) for the screen and we validate numerous new activators and inhibitors for the receptors. Following our initial application in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we extend our approach to predict activating and inhibiting odors for a large number of important pest and disease vector species including 50 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> Ors (65% validated accuracy), the CO2 receptors of multiple species (48% validated accuracy), 9 newly identified Citrus Psyllid ORNs, and a large number of functionally distinct mammalian receptors. We next extended our in silico screening approach to identify shared structural features important for a behavioral response for DEET-like repellents which the molecular target has not yet been identified, identify ~150 natural compounds as candidate repellents. We select 4 candidates, 3 approved as safe for human food use, and demonstrate that they are strong olfactory and gustatory repellents to both mosquitoes and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As only a small region of odor space has been explored, there remains potential to uncover previously unidentified patterns of odor coding. Through a combination of in silico and electrophysiology screens, we identify odors with ultra-prolonged termination kinetics that are delayed for several minutes, resulting in a memory trace that affects subsequent odor detection. Finally, we successfully perform structure- based virtual screen, identifying potential inhibitors of an important Tuberculosis drug target EthR.

A Functional Study of Arabidopsis Argonaute10 in Floral Determinacy and Small RNA Pathways
microRNAs (miRNAs) play regulatory roles in various developmental processes including stem cell maintenance and differentiation, which are central to animal and plant development. miRNAs function within a miRNA-protein complex termed RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). In plants, miRNAs and the core protein component of RISC, argonaute proteins, have been shown to regulate the maintenance of stem cells. In Arabidopsis, the maintenance of floral stem cell fate is controlled both spatially and temporally. One aim of my Ph.D. thesis research was to uncover the mechanisms that underlie the programmed termination of floral stem cell maintenance. My studies show that miR165/166 and the argonaute protein that it associates with <italic>in vivo </italic>, AGO10, are both involved in the regulation of floral stem cells. This work is reported in Chapter I of the thesis. One intriguing observation made during my studies was that AGO10 represses the levels of miR165/166 in vivo, which is contrary to the expectation that argonaute proteins stabilize their associated miRNAs and implies the existence of a currently unknown mechanism regulating miRNA homeostasis. My research towards elucidating this regulatory mechanism is reported in Chapter II. Although the work has not been completed, I have accumulated evidence that AGO10 decreases the stability of miR165/166. Taken together, my thesis research has demonstrated that regulation of miRNA stability through a specialized argonaute protein is critical to the regulation of stem cells in plant development.

[myc, gcn5, interaction, staga]

Characterization of Physical and Functional Interactions Between the MYC Oncoprotein and the Acetyltransferase GCN5
MYC is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, and MYC is known to play a role in many important biological processes such as cell death and cell proliferation. Heterodimerizing with the obligatory partner protein, MAX, the MYC and MAX dimer binds a specific DNA sequence, called an E box (CACGTG), through its basic helix-loop-helix zipper domain. MYC N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) has been shown to interact with proteins that are potential regulators of MYC transactivation and transformation activities. Among them, the TRRAP protein has been shown to contribute to the transformation activity of MYC through associations with the MYC box (MB) II and MBI-containing sequences. Importantly, TRRAP is also a subunit of several multiprotein complexes that possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, such as the STAGA (SPT-TAF-GCN5 Acetylase) coactivator complex. GCN5, another subunit of STAGA, is a HAT that acetylates lysine residues in histone H3 and non-histone proteins. MYC has been also identified as a target of GCN5, although the functional consequences of MYC acetylation by GCN5 remain to be investigated. In this work, we identify MYC K323 as the major site of acetylation by GCN5 and then demonstrate that GCN5 stabilizes MYC in a K323- and HAT domain-dependent manner. Interestingly, we also find that GCN5 enhances MYC ubiquitination in a HAT domain/activity-independent manner. Subsequently, we investigate which subunits of the STAGA complex directly interact with MYC, and then analyze the role of the MYC-STAGA interactions in the biological functions of MYC. We identify GCN5 as another STAGA subunit that directly associates with MYC. The direct interaction of MYC with GCN5 facilitates the interaction of MYC with the STAGA complex, acetylation of MYC, binding of MYC to the human TERT promoter, and activation of human TERT transcription. Lastly, we unexpectedly find a physical interaction between MYC and the tumor suppressor p53 that has not been reported previously, despite decades of intense research investigation on their functions. Based on our preliminary results, we suggest a prospective model in which MYC and p53 influence each other`s transcription regulatory activities via a direct physical interaction. These results further deepen our understanding of MYC biological functions and its role in cancer, and could eventually lead to the development of new therapeutic targets against cancer.

Chirality control via double vortices in asymmetric Co dots
Reproducible control of the magnetic vortex state in nanomagnets is of critical importance. We report onchirality control by manipulating the size and/or thickness of asymmetric Co dots. Below a critical diameterand/or thickness, chirality control is achieved by the nucleation of a single vortex. Interestingly, above thesecritical dimensions, chirality control is realized by the nucleation and subsequent coalescence of two vortices,resulting in a single vortex with the opposite chirality as found in smaller dots. Micromagnetic simulations andmagnetic force microscopy highlight the role of edge-bound half vortices in facilitating the coalescence process.

Solution Phase Routes to Functional Nanostructured Materials  for Energy Applications
Solution-phase processing presents an attractive avenue for building unique architectures from a wide variety of materials that exhibit functional properties, making them ideal candidates for various energy applications.  The most basic building block or precursor in solution-based syntheses is a soluble species that can either self-assemble, or coassemble with a structure directing agent or template, to create a unique architecture.  Soluble inorganic-based building blocks ranging from atomic-scale charged molecular complexes to nanometer-scale preformed nanocrystals are utilized to construct functional inorganic materials.  These nanostructured materials are excellent candidates for integrating into electronic and energy-storage devices, including photovoltaics and pseudocapacitors.       The goal of this work is to create inorganic nanostructured materials from solution-based methods.  This work is divided into two parts: the first involves the synthesis of inorganic semiconductor-based nanostructured materials; the second focuses on developing porous metal oxide-based pseudocapacitors.       The first part describes three distinct synthetic approaches to nanostructured semiconductors:  the synthesis of complex metal chalcogenide semiconductors produced from highly soluble hydrazinium-based precursors using a porous template; low-temperature melt processing of an organic-inorganic hybrid semiconductor into porous templates to produce vertically-aligned arrays with a concentric multilayered structure; and solution-phase assembly of semiconductor nanocrystals of CdSe into nanoporous architectures via polymer templating.  These nanostructured semiconductors are electrically interconnected through intimate contact between the molecular or nanoscale precursors achieved during solution-phase synthesis, making them suitable for a range of applications.     In the second part, porous metal-oxide based materials are constructed by the assembly of nanosized building blocks into 3D porous architectures via polymer templating.  Two main approaches are described:  first, a general route for templating both redox-active oxides (Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals is described; second, nanocrystal-based porous architectures of a ITO are coated with redox-active V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> via atomic layer deposition to produce nanoporous composites. The porous architectures exhibit high surface areas, providing ample redox active sites, and an interconnected open porosity, facilitating solvent/ion diffusion to those sites.  In the ITO-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> composites, the electron-transfer reactions are facilitated by the increased conductivity leading to high pseudocapacitive contributions to charge storage that are accompanied by fast charging/discharging rates.

Design, synthesis and incorporation of fluorescent thiophene-modified nucleoside analogs
The central dogma of molecular biology asserts the vastly important roles of nucleic acids in all domains of life. In order to explore and illuminate the intricate biomolecular interactions of nucleic acids with themselves and other biomolecules, isomorphic fluorescent nucleoside analogs have been developed. Fluorescence spectroscopy allows for the monitoring of molecular dynamics down to the subnanomolar concentration in real-time. In order to continue to evolve as a field, novel isomorphic fluorescent nucleoside analogs must be synthesized and implemented in a variety of ways. Thiophene-modified fluorescent nucleoside analogs have proven to be of significant utility. However, the low quantum yield of several of these modified fluorescent nucleosides leaves room for further experimentation and improvement. To increase fluorescence signal sensitivity for several biophysical assays, multiple incorporations of a single thiophene-modified nucleoside were explored. These resulted in an enhanced on-signal for duplex melting and annealing as well as mismatch dC detection. Additionally, in order to form pi-expanded chromophores, four new thiophene-modified fluorescent nucleoside analogs base on pyrrolo-cytidine (PyC) were synthesized and evaluated. Although these new nucleosides (fused and extended PyC analogs) are slightly larger than previous generations of Tor lab fluorescent nucleosides, they possess exceptional photophysical qualities such as unusually high brightness and sensitivity towards solvent polarity. Finally, a novel fluorescent nucleoside analog FRET system was explored in hopes of monitoring RNA helicase activity in real-time. After synthesizing a novel fluorescent nucleic acid construct, a number of important factors were illustrated with regard to the need for a further red-shifted excitation wavelength and a higher quantum yield in the presence of endogenous proteins and their autofluorescence. Further studies into nucleic acid- protein interactions with a fluorescent nucleoside FRET pair hold great promise

[gene, exotoxin, bacterium, sample, environmental]

Environmental reservoirs of phage-encoded exotoxin genes
Exotoxins are virulence factors produced by some bacteria and are sometimes encoded by mobile genetic elements like bacteriophage (phage). Phage are viruses of bacteria that carry genetic information and through horizontal gene transfer this genetic information is sometimes transferred to the bacteria they infect. When virulence genes are transferred to an avirulent bacterium, this bacterium can be transduced to virulence and gains the capability to cause disease. Through this process between the phage and bacterium, a whole host of novel human pathogens may emerge. This has significant implications in the area of human health. Using exotoxin-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), and Southern dot blot assays, over 500 environmental samples were screened for the presence of four phage-encoded exotoxin genes : cholera toxin (ctx), diphtheria toxin (dtx), Staphylococcus enterotoxin A (sea), and shiga toxin (stx). A minimum of one gene was found in 1̃5% of the samples screened. These genes were found in the phage fraction of some of the positive samples; suggesting these genes are mobile within the environment. The gene most frequently observed in the environmental samples was stx. The samples that were positive for an exotoxin gene were spread throughout environmental type and there was no correlation with presence of exotoxin genes and sample type. Identification of some bacterial environmental isolates from samples positive for an exotoxin gene, showed that the bacterium carrying the exotoxin gene was not the known pathogen and was indeed an alternative host for the gene(s). This was shown for environmental isolates carrying the sea and stx genes. The data generated from this dissertation indicate that exotoxin genes are widespread in the environment and that these genes can be carried by alternative hosts

A Characterization of Quiescent Behavior and Profiling of the Brain Transcriptome During Larval Development of the Holometabolous Insect, Manduca sexta
The holometabolous insect Manduca sexta has served as one of the primary model systems for the study of the neuroendocrine regulation of the insect molt.  It has long been observed that during the molting period prior to cuticle shedding during its larval-larval stage transitions, M. sexta displays an extended period of quiescent behavior.  This behavior has been called the "molt-sleep", and has been described anecdotally as a non-moving, non-feeding state; but it has never been characterized.  We observed that molting larvae respond to gentle handling and noxious stimuli with behavior resembling that observed for inter-molt larvae, and hypothesized that the quiescent behavior of larvae is similar to the sleep-like behavior observed for many adult insects, and for molting C. elegans.  We used time-lapse digital recordings to profile the rest-activity patterns of M. sexta across several larval stages, and found that larval quiescent behavior shows developmental rhythms that are reproducible both across individuals and across larval stages.  Quiescent behavior is reversible both during the inter-molt and molting periods.  Once aroused, molting larvae can locomote at rates comparable to inter-molt larvae.  Larvae that are quiescent also have increased response latencies following exposure to a noxious stimulus, resembling (in both stages) the sleep-like states of other invertebrates.  However, there are differences between inter-molt and molting quiescence, in that both feeding and quiescence seem to be homeostatically regulated during the inter-molt, but not the molting period.  We propose that molting larvae engage in an adaptive quiescent state that promotes energy conservation while retaining the ability to respond to a changing environment.  The correlation between the timing of molt-sleep onset with the estimated peak of the steroid molting hormones suggests that molting hormones might act directly or indirectly on the nervous system to bring about changes in gene expression that alter general arousal state.  To investigate possible gene products that might be involved in the induction and maintenance of the molt-sleep, we used Illumina RNA-seq to profile the brain transcriptome at several developmental time points both during and surrounding the onset of the molt-sleep.  This study is the first to profile the transcriptome of any M. sexta nervous tissue.  We developed a novel method for identifying transcripts, which entailed the mapping of translated reads onto the proteome of Bombyx mori, the most closely related species for which a genome is known.  10,664 unique proteins were mapped by Illumina reads during at least one stage of development.  Between 2.8%-7.8% of all genes were differentially-expressed in the brain at a given stage when compared to mid-inter-molt reference levels.  Cluster and enrichment analysis reveals a dominance of processes related to trachea cuticle synthesis and degradation.  In addition, many of the differentially-expressed transcripts encode neuropeptides, enzymes involved in the synthesis of small neurotransmitters, ligand-gated ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and other products associated with neural activity.  Possible roles for these gene products in the modulation of larval arousal-state are described.

Understanding the distribution of the Spiroplasma heritable bacterial endosymbiont in Drosophila
Symbiosis can be a major source of evolutionary innovation and a driver of ecological diversification. Insects, in particular, partner with a diversity of heritable bacterial endosymbionts that affect them in myriad ways, ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. Species of the genus Drosophila, however, harbor only Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. While Wolbachia infections in Drosophila are well characterized, much less is known about the consequences of Spiroplasma infections. Spiroplasma is a male-killer in some species of Drosophila, and recent work has demonstrated that this bacterium can also confer protection against a nematode parasite in one Drosophila species. Many other species of Drosophila, however, are infected with Spiroplasma that do not cause male-killing, and their fitness effects are unclear. To discern the impacts of Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila, my dissertation work seeks to characterize the distribution of Spiroplasma among Drosophila by investigating the genetic diversity of Spiroplasma infecting Drosophila, examining the bacterial density dynamics of diverse Spiroplasma strains infecting different Drosophila species and exploring the fitness consequences of Spiroplasma infection in a cactophilic Drosophila species. Using a multilocus phylogenetic analysis, I show that there have been at least five introductions of four very different types of Spiroplasma into Drosophila, with a single origin of the male-killing Spiroplasma in Drosophila. Horizontal transmission has played an important role in driving the distribution of Spiroplasma among Drosophila, and I provide some evidence that it may be occurring within populations of certain Drosophila species. I detected no recombination, however, among Spiroplasma from different phylogenetic clades, suggesting that Spiroplasma may be similar to beneficial bacterial endosymbionts trapped in their host with no opportunity for recombination. Using quantitative PCR, I assessed the bacterial density dynamics of Spiroplasma, which vary among bacterial strain and Drosophila species. Although a number of facultative endosymbionts play a role in host plant specialization, this does not seem to be the case for the Spiroplasma strain infecting one population of Drosophila with high infection prevalence. This characterization of the Drosophila/Spiroplasma symbiosis lays much of the groundwork necessary to effectively explore the consequences of Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila

In depth comparison of an individual's DNA and its lymphoblastoid cell line using whole genome sequencing
Abstract


Background
A detailed analysis of whole genomes can be now achieved with next generation sequencing. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformation is a widely used strategy in clinical research to obtain an unlimited source of a subject&#8217;s DNA. Although the mechanism of transformation and immortalization by EBV is relatively well known at the transcriptional and proteomic level, the genetic consequences of EBV transformation are less well understood. A detailed analysis of the genetic alterations introduced by EBV transformation is highly relevant, as it will inform on the usefulness and limitations of this approach.


Results
We used whole genome sequencing to assess the genomic signature of a low-passage lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). Specifically, we sequenced the full genome (40X) of an individual using DNA purified from fresh whole blood as well as DNA from his LCL. A total of 217.33 Gb of sequence were generated from the cell line and 238.95 Gb from the normal genomic DNA. We determined with high confidence that 99.2% of the genomes were identical, with no reproducible changes in structural variation (chromosomal rearrangements and copy number variations) or insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels).


Conclusions
Our results suggest that, at this level of resolution, the LCL is genetically indistinguishable from its genomic counterpart and therefore their use in clinical research is not likely to introduce a significant bias.

Sustained and observable release of therapeutics using porous silicon based materials
The sustained delivery of therapeutics with minimal systemic side effects would be a benefit in the treatment of many diseases. Numerous nanostructured materials in various shapes and sizes have been investigated to meet this challenge. This dissertation focuses in particular on the development of nanostructured porous silicon-based materials for observable and sustained drug delivery. Previously, drugs loaded into porous silicon particles resulted in rapid drug release. In order to improve upon drug release kinetics, loading of drugs into porous silicon particles by physical adsorption and covalent attachment were compared, and the mechanism of drug release was studied. We found that drug loading by covalent attachment was able to eliminate burst release and provide extended drug release compared to previous results. One area that can benefit from such a sustained drug release system is ocular drug delivery. In this work, we investigated the use of porous silicon particles loaded with drug by covalent attachment for its potential in the treatment of the retina. Drug release was studied in a custom designed flow chamber designed to mimic the half- life of drugs in the human vitreous, and sustained drug release of up to one month was observed. In addition, the optical properties of porous silicon was used to monitor drug release. An area of concern in using porous silicon as drug delivery carriers is the reactivity between porous silicon and redox active drug molecules such as anthracyclines. We demonstrate that reactive surface hydrides on porous silicon can reduce anthracyclines and create potential toxicity. However, we show that thermal oxidation can be used as a means to prevent this reduction. Finally, the degradation and toxicity of porous silicon and silica particles were studied in vivo using a rabbit eye model. We demonstrate that porous silicon and silica particles loaded with drugs are biocompatible. In addition, the color of the particles can be readily observed by a fundus camera, showing its potential as an indicator of drug release. These studies illustrate the possibility of using porous silicon based particles as a self reporting drug carrier for the long-term release of therapeutics

Symmetry of reinforcement in social behavior
A great deal of experimental evidence supports the notion of symmetry with regards to rewarding and aversive outcomes having an equally opposite effect on behavior in non-humans (Schuster & Rachlin, 1968; Farley & Fantino, 1978) as well as in humans (Critchfield et al, 2003). Numerous studies have demonstrated a direct effect of punishment, and empirical data that support conclusions pointing toward a symmetrical law of effect, such that behavior follows the matching law (Herrnstein, 1961) in equally opposing manner when compared to reinforcing outcomes. On the other hand, the domain of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) has found that loss has a disproportionately larger effect on behavior than an equivalent gain, seeming to provide evidence contrary to the symmetry argument. The current experiments were designed to test this argument of symmetry using well- established interactions (1 - the Dictator Game, 2 - the Ultimatum Game, 3 - the Prisoner's Dilemma Game), where the stimuli at stake were tokens with one of two values: a conditioned reward stimulus (time-off a boring task) or a conditioned aversive stimulus (time-in a boring task). Both allocation and cooperative behaviors were measured and correlated significantly with Prosocial, Individualist, and Competitor Social Value Orientation across approx. N=2100 participants. Amount given of reward tokens was equal to the amount kept of aversive tokens; overall both allocation and cooperation data indicate strong support for an argument for empirical symmetry between reinforcers and punishers in social interaction settings. These findings agree with previous research observing symmetry of behavior thus reinforcing the symmetrical law of effect (Thorndike, 1911). The results also indicate the reliability of the social value orientation measure in experiments involving social interaction and division of a utility

Psychophysical Context Effects in Chickens Gallus Gallus Domesticus (Hubbards)
A quantitative frame-of-reference (FR) model that has been successfully tested in humans was examined in generalization experiments with chickens. In Experiment 1, three groups of two chickens each were trained to discriminate between cubes different in volume and tested with a series of cubes with volumes either below, surrounding, or above the training stimuli. The obtained psychometric functions support the assumption that asymmetrical testing after two stimulus-two response training leads to the changes predicted by the FR model. In Experiment 2 shifts in the context defining the test series were administered by gradually enlarging the distance between training and test stimuli. While context effects were found in both experiments these were more pronounced in Experiment 2. The results support the general hypothesis that perception in animals undergoes context effects similar to those obtained in human subjects.

Vitamin D regulates MUC17 expression in Caco-2 cells
Mucins are essential components of the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier and their downregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic GI inflammation. Calcium plays an important role in stabilizing negatively charged mucins expressed by intestinal cells. Vitamin D regulates ion homeostasis and intestinal calcium absorption, through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). MUC17 gene regulator contains a VDR responsive element. We hypothesized that lack of VDR expression would disrupt mucin expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Methods : Caco-2 cells treated with siVDR or untreated control were tested for MUC17 mRNA expression by PCR and for MUC17 levels by immunohistochemistry. Treatment with low calcium concentration by calcium switch and vitamin D3 was also studied. Results: siVDR Caco-2 cells showed significant lower levels of immunohistochemically localizable MUC17 than the Caco-2 controls (p<0.01). MUC17 mRNA expression was also diminished by a factor of 2.5 in siVDR cells. When cells were exposed to low calcium, little MUC17 was detectable and thus the effect of gene silencing was intensified. Restoration of calcium levels in the siVDR Caco-2 evoked a rapid short-lived recovery of MUC17 mRNA expression. Vitamin D3 treatment had no effect on both MUC17 mRNA and protein in siVDR Caco-2 cells. However, untreated controls expressing normal levels of VDR showed an increased MUC17 mRNA and protein expression after D3 treatment. Our data underline the importance of calcium homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium and show that vitamin D promotes mucin expression and homeostasis

Thermo-fluid Dynamics of Flash Atomizing Sprays   and Single Droplet Impacts
Spray atomization and droplet dynamics are research topics that have existed for many decades. Their prevalence in manufacturing, energy generation and other practical applications is undeniable, though researchers have often overlooked the importance of understanding the physics of atomization or droplet impact characteristics in the ongoing effort to improve efficiency. In this talk, I will address the atomization of thermodynamically unstable "flashing" sprays and the splashing mechanisms of single droplets impinging on flat, smooth surfaces. The related heat transfer phenomena for cooling applications are also addressed. These topics are motivated by efforts to improve the thermal protection provided by cryogenic spray cooling in laser dermatological procedures, increasing the throughput of the spray production of nano and micro-scale particulates used as dyes and catalysts, and in modeling of the release and dispersion of flammable or hazardous chemicals through large-scale collisions with storage containers. Through the use of high-speed video imaging, phase Doppler interferometric measurements and numerical modeling of the two-phase flow taking place within spray nozzles, a detailed picture of the processes involved in flash atomization are attained. Results reveal that flashing fluid jets under low superheats undergo many dynamic processes leading to eventual droplet formation, including the nucleation of vapor bubbles within the nozzle interior and their subsequent expansion and explosion. At high superheats, a stable "flare flashing" regime is attained resulting in very fine atomization. These insights may lead to improved nozzle designs to better control the atomization process.High-speed imaging of droplet impacts also reveals new insights into the mechanisms of splashing. The surrounding ambient air pressure, fluid viscosity, and fluid-surface affinity are found to profoundly influence the initiation and characteristics of splashing. A new analytical model explaining the mechanisms of crown splashing is developed along with correlations predicting the threshold of splashing.

Interactions of Virus Like Particles in Equilibrium and Non-equilibrium Systems
This thesis summarizes my Ph.D. research on the interactions of virus like particles in equilibrium and non-equilibrium biological systems.In the equilibrium system, we studied the fluctuation-induced forces between inclusions in a fluid membrane. We developed an exact method to calculate thermal Casimir forces between inclusions of arbitrary shapes and separation, embedded in a fluid membrane whose fluctuations are governed by the combined action of surface tension, bending modulus, and Gaussian rigidity. Each object's shape and mechanical properties enter only through a characteristic matrix, a static analog of the scattering matrix. We calculate the Casimir interaction between two elastic disks embedded in a membrane. In particular, we find that at short separations the interaction is strong and independent of surface tension.In the non-equilibrium system, we studied the transport and deposition dynamics of colloids in saturated porous media under un-favorable filtering conditions. As an alternative to traditional convection-diffusion or more detailed numerical models, we consider a mean-field description in which the attachment and detachment processes are characterized by an entire spectrum of rate constants, ranging from shallow traps which mostly account for hydrodynamic dispersivity, all the way to the permanent traps associated with physical straining. The model has an analytical solution which allows analysis of its properties including the long time asymptotic behavior and the profile of the deposition curves. Furthermore, the model gives rise to a filtering front whose structure, stability and propagation velocity are examined. Based on these results, we propose an experimental protocol to determine the parameters of the model.

TWIST1 associates with NF-kappaB subunit RELA via carboxyl-terminal WR domain to promote cell autonomous invasion through IL8 production
Abstract



Background

Metastasis is the primary cause of death for cancer patients. TWIST1, an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is a strong promoter of metastatic spread and its expression is elevated in many advanced human carcinomas. However, the molecular events triggered by TWIST1 to motivate dissemination of cancer cells are largely unknown.



Results

Here we show that TWIST1 induces the production of interleukin 8 (IL8), which activates matrix metalloproteinases and promotes invasion of breast epithelial and cancer cells. In this novel mechanism, TWIST1-mediated IL8 transcription is induced through the TWIST1 carboxy-terminal WR (Trp-Arg) domain instead of the classic DNA binding bHLH domain. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the WR domain mediates the formation of a protein complex comprised of TWIST1 and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#954;B) subunit RELA (p65/NF-&#954;B3), which synergistically activates the transcriptional activity of NF-&#954;B. This activation leads to increased DNA binding affinity of RELA to the IL8 promoter and thus induces the expression of the cytokine. Blockage of IL8 signaling by IL8 neutralizing antibodies or receptor inhibition reduced the invasiveness of both breast epithelial and cancer cells, indicating that TWIST1 induces autonomous cell invasion by establishing an IL8 antocrine loop.



Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that the TWIST1 WR domain plays a critical role in TWIST1-induced IL8 expression through interactions with and activation of NF-&#954;B. The produced IL8 signals through an autocrine loop and promotes extracellular matrix degradation to enable cell invasion across the basement membrane.

Dynamic High Pressure Measurements and Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Phase Changes and Vibrational Dynamics in Molecular Solids
The parameters of temperature and, particularly, pressure are useful tools for the investigation of the phase transitions and vibrational dynamics of condensed matter, such as molecular crystals. Building upon the design of the Merril-Bassett Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC), a Dynamic DAC was developed and shown to be able to dynamically control the pressure of the sample. Also, the dynamic phase changes of water to solid Ice VI and VII were imaged using the Dynamic DAC.Using a standard DAC, the hydrogen bonding of both N1,N1,N5,N5,3,3- hexamethylcadaverine  HBr (33HMCHBr) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylputrescine HI (TMPHI) were explored using high pressure Raman spectroscopy. Evidence of a possible phase transition for 33HMCHBr is shown along with the likely vibrational mode of the low barrier hydrogen bond in TMPHI.New single crystal x-ray crystallographic evidence is shown regarding a new crystal structure of p-terphenyl involving twinning at low temperature as well as x-ray diffraction evidence of the temperature induced phase transition in p-terphenyl.Lastly, the results of computational studies, using a previously developed forcefield, of the pentacene in p-terphenyl mixed molecular crystal are shown. The polarizations of the calculated modes of the hindered translations of pentacene along the molecular and crystallographic axes and the anharmonicity of the modes are investigated. Also, a discussion on the identification and separation of the intramolecular motions from the calculated hindered rotations spectrum is presented.

A proteomics approach to study the DNA damage checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
The DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. It is involved in the maintenance of the genome and regulation of cell cycle. Mutations in checkpoint proteins can lead to genomic instability and cancer in humans. This signal transduction pathway is composed by several kinases and adaptor proteins, and only a few substrates of these signaling transduction pathway are known. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) Mec1 and Tel1 are the two upstream kinases, homologues to ATR and ATM in humans, involved in the initial sensing of the damage DNA or the stalled replication fork. Rad9 and Mrc1, orthologs of human 53BP1 and Claspin, are the main adaptor proteins of Mec1 and Tel1, and they activate the effector kinase Rad53 and Dun1. Recent technological advances in the field of proteomics have enabled us to identify and quantify thousands of peptides in a single experiment. In these studies I developed two separate multidimensional chromatography methods which when combined with quantitative proteomics can be used to examine the global changes in protein expression or phosphorylation. In Chapter 2, my first mutidimensional chromatography method was used to quantify changes in protein expression after DNA damage. In Chapter 3, a second mutidimensional chromatography method was developed, and it allowed an in- depth mapping of the phosphoproteome. Finally, we applied these methods to identify in vivo kinase substrates of the DNA damage checkpoint

Eye Design for Depth and Distance Perception in the Pigeon: An Observer Orientated Perspective
The perception of the distance of objects with respect to an observer (egocentric distance) and the perception of the relative distance (depth) between external points was found to be optimised in the pigeon visual system according to the optical and retinal constraints of the eye. Each of these perceptual capacities is mediated by different binocular mechanisms in the frontal field, both of which appear to be designed for a stationary world. This is particularly evident in the egocentric distance estimation that occurs during the reaching movement when pecking. Here both the saccadic nature of the head movement and the convergence eye movements appear to allow constant retinal stimulation. This system of vergence signal alone is inadequate for depth perception which is instead mediated by retinal disparity. Stereopsis in the pigeon appears to be more effective for pattern decoding than for absolute spatial perception.

Biological control of vertical carbon flux in the California current and Equatorial Pacific
The "biological pump" is a key component in the global biogeochemistry of carbon dioxide that is sensitive, through a multitude of ecological interactions of euphotic zone plankton, to climatic fluctuations. In this dissertation I address the biological control of vertical carbon flux out of the surface ocean in two regions of the Pacific Ocean. I begin by addressing the hypothesis that most export production in the equatorial Pacific is derived from the primary production of picophytoplankton. Using inverse ecosystem modeling techniques to synthesize detailed rate measurements I show that eukaryotic phytoplankton are the dominant producers of eventually exported material and that export comes after processing by mesozooplankton, but that the results of inverse modeling studies are dependent upon subjective decisions about model structure, input data, and solution schemes. I then move on to studies in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), where a combination of my own in situ measurements of vertical carbon export and collaborators' measurements of key planktonic rates allow me to address the question of what constitutes sinking flux in this coastal upwelling biome. I begin with simple trophic cycling relationships that use phytoplankton growth, micro - and mesozooplankton grazing, and simple assumptions about organismal efficiency, and show that fecal pellet production could account for the magnitude and variability in carbon export measured by ²³⁴Th disequilibrium during a cruise in May 2006. I then utilize inverse modeling techniques to show that on two spring cruises the contribution of grazing products to export was substantially greater than that of gravitational sinking of phytoplankton, and also that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods do an accurate job of solving inverse ecosystem models. Finally, I use sediment trap samples to directly assess the contribution of fecal pellets to vertical flux, finding that mesozooplankton pellets were the dominant component of flux during the spring, but that during a fall cruise their contribution was variable, with flux becoming increasingly dominated by non-pigmented small material and marine snow as productivity decreased

Exploring structural and functional features of enzymes across isoprenoid biosynthesis : from archaeal isopentenyl phosphate kinase of primary metabolism to plant terpene cyclases of specialized metabolism
Isoprenoid biosynthesis constitutes an immensely diverse, highly branched network of pathways that spans both primary and secondary (specialized) metabolism in all organisms. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway or the 1-deoxy-D- xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway operate in a given organism to produce the two important building blocks for all downstream isoprenoids : isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In Archaea, the biosynthesis of these two vital building blocks remains unclear. The current hypothesis is that Archaea utilize an alternative mevalonate pathway that follows the canonical pathway up until the biosynthesis of phosphomevalonate. At this point, a decarboxylation event followed by a phosphorylation event produces the essential building block, IPP. The latter step is catalyzed by isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK). In this work, we solved the structure of IPK from M. jannaschii and successfully used it toward : 1) the design of a deeper active site pocket for binding and catalysis of longer chained isoprenoid monophosphates; 2) the identification and characterization of active IPK homologs in other kingdoms of life. This work contributes towards the design of a synthetic metabolic pathway and reveals new information about the potential existence of a bifurcated mevalonate pathway in all plants and certain other eukaryotic organisms. Farnesyl diphosphate is directly derived from the building blocks IPP and DMAPP and is an essential metabolic intermediate for a variety of downstream primary and secondary metabolic pathways including cholesterol biosynthesis and terpenoid biosynthesis, respectively. Sesquiterpene cyclases (synthases) are part of terpenoid biosynthesis and catalyze the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate into one or more sesquiterpene products; these chemicals play important biological roles in defense and communication, especially in plants. Here, we explore a variety of mutant and wild type plant sesquiterpene cyclases in attempt to understand several concepts : 1) how these enzymes traverse a defined catalytic landscape to biosynthesize disparate products without compromising their catalytic activities; 2) the structural and functional differences associated with turnover of cis- and trans-FPP by wild type and promiscuous cyclase mutants; 3) how certain sesquiterpene synthases utilize an Arg-Pro motif within the amino terminal domain to interact with the catalytic C-terminal domain and modulate product profile complexity

Water Uptake in PEMFC Catalyst Layers
Water uptake profiles of proton-exchange-membrane fuel-cell catalyst layers are characterized in the form of capillary-pressure saturation (Pc-S) curves.  The curves indicate that the catalyst layers tested are highly hydrophilic and require capillary pressures as low as -80 kPa to eject imbibed water.   Comparison of materials made with and without Pt indicates a difference in water ejection and uptake phenomena due to the presence of Pt.  The addition of Pt increases the tendency of the catalyst layer to retain water.  Dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) is used to characterize the water-vapor sorption onto Nafion, Pt/C, and C surfaces.  The DVS results align with the trends found from the Pc-S curves and show an increased propensity for water uptake in the presence of Pt.  The effect of the ion in Nafion, sodium or protonated form, is also compared and demonstrates that although the protonation of the Nafion in the catalyst layer also increases hydrophilicity, the effect is not as great as that caused by Pt.

Hybrid Porous Materials for Controlled Release and Catalysis
First reported in 1992, ordered mesoporous materials exhibit unique features, such as regular pore geometry, high surface area, and large pore volume, and have shown great potential in various applications. This dissertation combines the knowledge from the field of ordered mesoporous materials and several other research areas to design advanced hybrid porous materials for controlled release and catalysis applications.The demand for better treatment of illness has led to ever-increasing efforts in the development of efficient drug delivery system that can transport drug molecules to the targeted site and release the loading in a controlled manner. The emerging ordered mesostructured materials exhibit great potential in controlled release because of their stable structures, large surface areas, tunable pore sizes and pore volumes, well-defined surface properties, and biocompatibility. The great diversity in surface functionalization offers mesoporous silica a unique advantage in site-specific delivery and stimuli-responsive release. My research is focused on developing novel controlled release systems using physiologically compatible chemical or physical stimuli by integrating organic materials with inorganic nanostructured porous materials. The release system uses mesoporous materials as reservoir and functional organic or nanomaterials as valves to perform the controlled responsive functionalities. With this strategy, a series of stimuli responsive and physiologically compatible release systems have been developed, which provide a promising new direction in the bio-applications of nanostructured materials.Poly(4-vinyl pyridine) is coated on mesoporous silica through facile "grafting to" method. The grafted polymer nanoshell works as pH-sensitive barrier to control the release of trapped molecules from mesoporous silica. We also use nanoparticle as capping agent to block the silica mesopore by pH-responsive acetal linker to obtain acid-sensitive delivery system. By designing a polymeric network (capable of being cross-linked and de-cross-linked) as a "gatekeeper" at the pore opening of mesoporous silica-based materials, a series of hybrid porous materials for controlled release have been developed. For example, the pore of silica materials loaded with guest molecules are blocked by the addition of cystamine, a disulfide-based bifunctional primary amine, which allows polymer chains around the silica surface to be cross-linked. The polymeric network thus formed around the pore opening can be reopened by cleaving the disulfide bond of cystamine in the presence of disulfide reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), leading to the redox-controlled release. The further introduction of cyclodextrin introduced into the polymer network expands the responsive diversity by supramolecular host-guest interaction, which is sensitive to photoirradiation, redox signal, or competitive binding.. In addition, cavitands are introduced into the hybrid system and work as supramolecular releasing trigger. Sulfonated ordered mesoporous carbons have been synthesized by covalent attachment of sulfonic acid containing aryl radicals on the surface of mesoporous carbons. The hybrid materials work as novel solid acid catalysts, which show stable and highly efficient catalytic performance in biodiesel production.

[spindle, central, furrow, centrosome, actin, separation, microtubule, embryo, cell, formation]

REGULATION OF CORTICAL ACTIN DYNAMICS DURING CENTROSOME SEPARATION AND CYTOKINESIS IN THE DROSOPHILA EMBRYO
The cytoskeleton plays a variety of roles during the cell cycle, none more dramatic than the formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle and the subsequent cleavage of one cell into two. Proper centrosome separation is a prerequisite for positioning the bipolar spindle. Although studies demonstrate that microtubules and their associated motors drive centrosome separation, the role of actin in centrosome separation remains less clear. Studies in tissue culture cells indicate that actin- and myosin-based cortical flow is primarily responsible for driving late centrosome separation, whereas other studies suggest that actin plays a more passive role by serving as an attachment site for astral microtubules to pull centrosomes apart. Here we demonstrate that prior to nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) in Drosophila embryos; proper centrosome separation does not require myosin II but requires dynamic actin rearrangements at the growing edge of the interphase cap. Both Arp2/3- and Formin-mediated actin remodeling are required for separating the centrosome pairs before NEB. The Apc2-Armadillo complex appears to link cap expansion to centrosome separation. In contrast, the mechanisms driving centrosome separation after NEB are dependent of the actin cytoskeleton and compensate for earlier separation defects. Our studies show that the dynamics of actin polymerization drive centrosome separation and this has important implications for centrosome positioning during processes such as cell migration, cell polarity maintenance, and asymmetric cell division.	Another vital role for spindle formation is in positioning the site of cleavage following anaphase separation of DNA. Rappaport's experiments with sand dollar embryos showed that cleavage furrow positioning is determined by the relationship between the spindle and the actin cortex. In his embryos, astral microtubules, which extend out to the cortex were primarily responsible for initiating a furrow, however, smaller somatic cells seem to position the furrow through the overlapping antiparallel central spindle. This balance between astral and central spindle influences is not well understood however. In the early Drosophila embryo, nuclei divide within a syncytium yet invaginate cortical actin and membrane, encompassing them, in order to complete mitosis in close proximity to neighboring nuclei. These furrows are considered natural Rappaport furrows since they form at astral microtubule overlap. Upon cellularization, the furrow positioning seems to shift from astral microtubule-based to central spindle-based. Our findings show that during the syncytial divisions, key conserved central spindle components Centralspindlin complex, Polo, and Fascetto (Prc1) all localize to regions of overlap astral microtubules during furrow formation. Given that the central spindle does not induce formation of conventional cytokinesis, finding that all of these components, plus the chromosomal passenger complex (Aurora B and INCENP), also localize to the central spindle was unexpected. The lack of furrow formation at the central spindle then is explained by the fact that the syncytial divisions rely on a maternally supplied form of RhoGEF, RhoGEF2, lacking the specific domains that localize zygotically expressed RhoGEF (Pebble) to the central spindle. RhoGEF2 instead localizes to the overlap astral microtubules of the syncytial divisions. Thus, in spite of proper localization of many key furrowing components to the central spindle in syncytial embryos, the failure of RhoGEF to localize to the central spindle may preclude formation of conventional cleavage furrows bisecting the spindle. In support of this idea, we bypass the need for RhoGEF by injecting constitutively active Rho into the syncytial embryos. This generates ectopic furrows strikingly similar to conventional cleavage furrows that form perpendicular to the central spindle during the syncytial divisions. While metaphase furrow formation is myosin independent these Rho-induced ectopic furrows, like conventional furrows, require myosin in addition to microtubules. These studies demonstrate that the early Drosophila embryo is primed to form furrows at either the overlapping astral microtubules or central spindle with the shift to the latter being driven in large part by a corresponding shift from maternal-to-zygotic forms of RhoGEF.My studies predict that the delivery of RhoGEF2 to the metaphase furrows must be different than the mechanism that localizes Pebble to the central spindle (the Centralspindlin complex). Recently, it has been shown that RhoGEF2 localization to the metaphase furrows requires vesicle trafficking from the recycling endosome (RE). This vesicle trafficking is regulated by the Rab11-GTPase in the RE and its associated effector, Nuclear Fallout (Nuf). Previous observations of Nuf in the early embryo show that it accumulates at the RE from interphase to prophase during the time when furrows are being made. At prophase, Nuf is phosphorylated, which coincides with its diffusion away from the RE. I will present evidence that Nuf localization is regulated by its phosphorylation state and that the mitotic kinase, Polo directly phosphorylates Nuf, inhibiting its localization at the RE, decreasing vesicle trafficking to the furrow. I propose that this mechanism serves as a major component in timing the formation of a furrow and may provide valuable insight into timing cytokinesis in general.  	Finally, the regulation of actin dynamics in cytokinesis has been well studied in terms of actin-interacting proteins such as Cofilin and Profilin. However, the direct modifications of actin and microtubules are similarly important for stable furrow ingression and abscission. Here I will present a newly characterized gene push pop that potentially indicates methylation of actin or tubulin as a previously unappreciated mechanism of regulating the cytoskeleton as well as other potential mitotic proteins in the events of cytokinesis. 	The thesis work presented here promotes a broader understanding of cytokinetic furrow timing and positioning. On one hand, both centrosome separation and central spindle signaling are vital for proper furrow positioning. On the other hand, vesicle trafficking and folate metabolism are required for the proper timing and maintenance of a furrow during the cell cycle. A deeper understanding of both these processes of cytokinesis will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of cell division and potentially how they are perturbed in tumorigenesis.

Plasmodium sexual development and the role of Plasmepsin X in Plasmodium falciparum transmission to anopheles gambiae
This work explored sexual development of the lethal human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. A method to cultivate Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage parasites in vitro was optimized and increased ookinete yield > 20-fold over previous reports. This method was adapted for Plasmodium vivax, a neglected human malaria parasite, and found to generate Plasmodium vivax ookinetes. The method was essential for investigation of the role of a novel aspartic protease, Plasmepsin X, in sexual stage parasite development. Antibodies to Plasmepsin X were found to significantly decrease Plasmodium transmission to mosquitoes by 20-40% in vivo but did not affect ookinete development in vitro. This was the first demonstration that a non-food vacuole plasmepsin facilitated Plasmodium falciparum midgut infection of mosquitoes. Finally, the numbers of parasites generated with this method were sufficient for proteomic analysis of sexual stage parasites. The Plasmodium falciparum zygote and ookinete proteome has never before been available, and this was the first time that any stage of Plasmodium vivax has been analyzed using a proteomic approach. The ability to generate Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage parasites, especially zygotes and ookinetes, has permitted detailed molecular analyses essential for transmission-blocking vaccine studies as well as global analyses that generated insights into Plasmodium sexual stage biology

Toll-like receptor 4 signaling on CD4+ T cells plays a regulatory role in inflammatory bowel disease
Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) are a set of pathogen recognition receptors which are well characterized in dendritic cells and macrophages as important mediators of the innate immune system. With TLRs being recently identified on T cells, we show that TLR4 stimulation on CD4+ T cells regulates their ability to provoke intestinal inflammation. Using the IL-10 deficient model of colitis we show that Il10-/-/Tlr4-/- mice develop spontaneous colitis as early as 8 weeks while Il10-/- mice do not develop colitis even by 8 months. Similar results were obtained using the adoptive transfer model of colitis in which we transferred Il10-/-/Tlr4-/- or Il10-/- naïve CD4+ T cells into Rag1-/- recipients. Il10-/-/Tlr4-/- naïve CD4 + T cells induced more colitis than their Il10-/- counterparts. Mechanistically, LPS stimulation of TLR4 induces MKP-3 which inactivates ERK, resulting in less potent T cell activation. Collectively, our data suggests that TLR4 signaling plays an inhibitory role on subsequent T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and ultimately regulates activation of CD4+ T cell

Whether for constructing advanced materials and complex biological devices, or for building sophisticated coordination complexes with diverse metal-based functions, proteins are Nature's favorite building blocks. Yet, our ability to control the assembly of proteins or to use them as ligand platforms for inorganic chemistry has been somewhat limited. The goal of this thesis was to exploit the utility of a protein scaffold in both regards. First, by considering proteins as "simple" ligand platforms and controlling the metal coordination chemistry on their surfaces, we show how their self-assembly can be readily dictated by metal binding. Next, we show how having this measure of control can lead to the site-specifically localization of functional metal complexes on the surface of a proteins and peptides. While on one hand our studies have pointed out the challenges of using proteins as ligands, they have also revealed how extensive and chemically-rich protein surfaces can be

Navigating the Wnt pathway at the cilium : transport regulation and the role of Jouberin
The primary cilium is a unique cellular organelle which in recent years has proven to be a surprisingly multifaceted structure. Primary cilia are ubiquitous ; they are present on almost all vertebrate cell types and play important regulatory roles in a growing number of signaling pathways. Recently, these tiny hair-like structures have been recognized for their functions in a variety of disorders termed "ciliopathies." The ciliopathies display a broad range of phenotypes that can affect a multitude of organs at varying times in a person's life. We now know that cilia are involved in a growing array of developmental and homeostatic functions which seem to be disrupted in the ciliopathies leading to a variety of phenotypes. Understanding these disorders will require a broader understanding of the vastly diverse biological functions of cilia. To study the role of primary cilia in two overlapping ciliopathies, Joubert syndrome and nephronophthisis, I have employed a mouse model with a deletion of the Ahi1 gene. AHI1 was the first identified gene mutated in patients with Joubert syndrome, a cerebellar development disorder. Joubert syndrome patients also often display a variety of other ciliopathy phenotypes which can include nephronophthisis, a cystic kidney disorder. Chapter 2 describes the kidney phenotype of Ahi1 mutant mice and the underlying Wnt defect. Ahi1 mutant mice display decreased canonical Wnt signaling which results in abnormal injury repair and a late-onset cyst pathology. Chapter 3 describes a unique signaling role for the primary cilium in regulation of Jouberin, the protein product of Ahi1, and its role in canonical Wnt signaling. The primary cilium seems to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling at multiple steps in the pathway including through sequestration of Jouberin and beta-catenin. Finally, Chapter 4 describes the cerebellar phenotype of Ahi1 null mice and the unique role of canonical Wnt signaling in cerebellar midline fusion. Overall, these results suggest that the primary cilium regulates canonical Wnt signaling in a variety of cellular contexts through a unique subcellular mechanism involving Jouberin

While advances in software have made it simple to fit models to qualitative variables, they can sometimes be difficult to visualize and analyze because there are often no similarities between the levels of the variables. There are many approaches to overcome this difficulty. Basic concepts such as probability and linear regression can be extended to introduce a variety of methods and models for analyzing and interpreting categorical data.

Metabolic Profiling of Primary and Secondary Biosynthetic Pathways in Angiosperms: Comparative Metabonomics and Applications of Hyphenated LC-NMR and LC-MS
The goal of this dissertation was to advance plant metabolomics through optimization of biological experimental design, sampling and sample preparation, data acquisition and pre-processing, and multivariable data analysis.  The analytical platform most employed for comparative metabonomics was nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  Liquid-chromatography (LC) coupled to NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) extended metabolic profile coverage from primary into secondary metabolic pathways.  Comparative profiling of tissue extracts by LC-MS and complementary analyses by NMR were performed to establish metabolite identity and quantify responses to low-oxygen stress using the model Angiosperm, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.Angiosperms, or flowering plants, constitute the most diverse and numerous group of land plants, and the most commercially important, producing an estimated 200,000 small molecule metabolites through conserved primary metabolism and divergent secondary pathways.  No single metabolic profiling experiment has been able to quantify metabolite abundance over the relevant dynamic range (spanning seven orders of magnitude) and across the necessary structural diversity (chemical space coverage exceeds all known synthetic molecules).  Challenges in plant metabolic profiling also arise through inherent limitations in methods (availability of diverse solid-phases, solvents, pure standards), instrument performance (reproducibility, robustness, speed, sensitivity), and data management (pre-processing, modeling, data basing and sharing).  The field of plant metabolic profiling has grown steadily over the past two decades, although it is still considered an emerging technique.  Comparison of methods for sample preparation provided a foundation for one-dimensional NMR-based comparative metabonomics.  Signal overlap was alleviated by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and liquid chromatography (LC).  A combined approach involving ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), NMR, exact mass MS, and tandem MS (MS/MS) was used for dereplication.Results are presented illustrating the ability of one-dimensional NMR combined with multivariable data analysis (MVDA) to quantify responses of a model plant to a biological problem of fundamental and practical relevance: cellular respiration under oxygen-limited conditions.  The suitability of LC-NMR and LC-MS for dereplication is highlighted.  Profiling of secondary metabolites by UPLC-MS combined with MVDA was undertaken for comparison with NMR-based comparative metabonomics.  Efforts toward quantitative targeted analyses, hurdles and solutions, are highlighted.

Computational Methods for Epigenetic Studies
The epigenome has increasingly been the focus of research over the past decade. Epigenetic control occurs in two primary ways: DNA methylation and chemical modification of histones. The latter mechanism determines whether the chromatin is tightly packed, in which case gene expression is repressed, or relaxed, in which case gene expression is enhanced. DNA methylation is the addition of the methyl groups to cytocines. Methylation of DNA is involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryogenesis and development, silencing of transposable elements, and regulation of gene transcription. In our research, we developed a set of computational methods and software tools that enable genome-wide epigenetic studies. In particular, our computational methods and software tools allow for (1) the determination of dynamic nucleosome positioning and the analysis of the correlation between the nucleosome landscape and gene expression, (2) the identification of methylation patterns from raw data obtained from next-generation sequencing technologies such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, and (3) the discovery of transcription factors binding sites from data on the dynamic chromatin structure remodeling.

Discovery and characterization of human exonic transcriptional regulatory elements
We sought regulatory elements by shotgun cloning human exonic DNA fragments  into luciferase reporter vectors and assessing transcriptional regulatory activity in liver cells.  Seven elements within coding regions and three within 3' UTRs were discovered.  Putative regulatory elements were generally but not consistently evolutionarily conserved, enriched in known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and associated with several histone modifications.  Evidence of cis-regulatory potential of an element within a TUBA1B exon was established by correlating expression of TUBA1B with activation of transcription factors predicted to have binding sites within this element.  Nevertheless, no clear rules defining coding regulatory elements emerged.  We estimate that hundreds of exonic regulatory elements exist, an unexpected finding that highlights a surprising multi-functionality of sequences in the human genome.

G-NEST: a gene neighborhood scoring tool to identify co-conserved, co-expressed genes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					In previous studies, gene neighborhoods&#8212;spatial clusters of co-expressed genes in the genome&#8212;have been defined using arbitrary rules such as requiring adjacency, a minimum number of genes, a fixed window size, or a minimum expression level. In the current study, we developed a Gene Neighborhood Scoring Tool (G-NEST) which combines genomic location, gene expression, and evolutionary sequence conservation data to score putative gene neighborhoods across all possible window sizes simultaneously.
				
				
					
						Results
					Using G-NEST on atlases of mouse and human tissue expression data, we found that large neighborhoods of ten or more genes are extremely rare in mammalian genomes. When they do occur, neighborhoods are typically composed of families of related genes. Both the highest scoring and the largest neighborhoods in mammalian genomes are formed by tandem gene duplication. Mammalian gene neighborhoods contain highly and variably expressed genes. Co-localized noisy gene pairs exhibit lower evolutionary conservation of their adjacent genome locations, suggesting that their shared transcriptional background may be disadvantageous. Genes that are essential to mammalian survival and reproduction are less likely to occur in neighborhoods, although neighborhoods are enriched with genes that function in mitosis. We also found that gene orientation and protein-protein interactions are partially responsible for maintenance of gene neighborhoods.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our experiments using G-NEST confirm that tandem gene duplication is the primary driver of non-random gene order in mammalian genomes. Non-essentiality, co-functionality, gene orientation, and protein-protein interactions are additional forces that maintain gene neighborhoods, especially those formed by tandem duplicates. We expect G-NEST to be useful for other applications such as the identification of core regulatory modules, common transcriptional backgrounds, and chromatin domains.

Electronic properties of low-dimensional systems
This work deals with transport and general electronic phenomena in low-dimensional systems. The first chapter is dedicated to Variable Range Hopping. It starts with a brief review of the general hopping formalism, based on previous work. Next, new methods and results are presented and discussed. In particular, studies of both Ohmic and non-Ohmic regime are performed and the stark differences between the two are elucidated. In addition, apparent power law dependence of current on voltage in disordered one-dimensional materials is analyzed. The results obtained compare favorably with the experiments. Finally, the behavior of the conducting network in d dimensions is discussed using the percolation approach. The second chapter deals with plasmonic effects in graphene. After giving a short introduction to graphene and plasmonic behavior, current work is presented. Charge oscillations in graphene half-plane are discussed and compared with experimental results obtained from near-field microscopy. In addition, plasmonic oscillations in a "narrow-flake" geometry are analyzed analytically and numerically, showing good agreement between the two methods

Performance Optimization of Metallic Iron and Iron Oxide Nanomaterials for Treatment of Impaired Water Supplies
Iron nanomaterials including nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI), NZVI-based bimetallic reductants (e.g., Pd/NZVI) and naturally occurring nanoscale iron mineral phases represent promising treatment tools for impaired water supplies. However, questions pertaining to fundamental and practical aspects of their reactivity may limit their performance during applications.For NZVI treatment of pollutant source zones, a major hurdle is its limited reactive lifetime. In Chapter 2, we report the longevity of NZVI towards 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane (1,1,1,2-TeCA) and hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) in oxygen-free systems with various anionic co-solutes (e.g., Cl<super>-</super>, SO<sub)4</sub><super>2-</super>, ClO<sub)4</sub><super>-</super>, HCO<sub)3</sub><super>-</super>, NO<sub)3</sub><super>-</super>).  Trends in longevity provide evidence that surface-associated Fe(II) species are responsible for Cr(VI) reduction, whereas 1,1,1,2-TeCA reduction depends on the accessibility of Fe(0) at the NZVI particle surface. In Chapter 3, we show that dithionite, previously utilized for in situ redox manipulation, can restore the reducing capacity of passivated NZVI treatment systems. Air oxidation of NZVI at pH  &ge 8 quickly exhausted reactivity despite a significant fraction of Fe(0) persisting in the particle core. Reduction of this passive layer by low dithionite concentrations restored suspension reactivity to levels of unaged NZVI, with multiple dithionite additions further improving pollutant removal.In Chapter 4, measurements of solvent kinetic isotope effects reveals that optimal Pd/NZVI reactivity results from accumulation of atomic hydrogen, which only occurs in NZVI-based systems due to their higher rates of corrosion. However, atomic hydrogen formation only occurs in aged Pd/NZVI suspensions for ~2 weeks, after which any reactivity enhancement likely results from galvanic corrosion of Fe(0).  Finally, the activity of hybrid nanostructures consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes decorated with of hematite nanoparticles (&alpha-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MWCNT) is explored in Chapter 5. Sorption of Cu(II) and Cr(VI) is enhanced in hybrid nanostructure systems beyond what would be expected from simple additive sorption capacities of their building blocks. The enhanced sorption capacity is in part derived from the greater surface area of hematite nanoparticles immobilized on MWCNTs relative to aggregated hematite suspensions. The hybrid &alpha-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MWCNT may also exhibit unique surface chemistry, as supported by the tunable values of zeta potential measured as a function of the mass of &alpha-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> deposited on the MWCNTs.

The Role of Specific Retinal Cell Types in Visual Following Responses in Chicks (Gallus Gallus Domesticus)
Deficits in visually guided behavior, particularly the optomotor response, are found to follow treatment of the chicken retina with a range of toxic agonists of glutamate and aspartate receptors. These agonists include kainic acid, quisquaUc acid, homocysteic acid and N-methyl D-aspartatic acid, given either alone or in combination with chemicals which antagonise some aspects of their neurotoxic actions and so cause cell loss ofvarious degress ofspecificity. Glutamate itself, when given at a high dose, causes non-specific lesions of the retina but has less effect on the optomotor response than kainate, which causes loss of a specific class of cells. Using these retinotoxins as tools of varying specificity, it is deduced that loss of the optomotor response, together with other visual impairments, is due to loss of amacrine cells and/or displaced ganghon cells. The paper includes discussion of the cellular and neurochemical organisation of the retina, retinal projections involved in the optokinetic response, as well as a summary of the modes of action of the toxins used.

Long-Term Plasticity of Astrocytic Metabotropic Neurotransmitter Receptors Driven by Changes in Neuronal Activity in Hippocampal Slices
In addition to synaptic communication between neurons, there is now strong evidence for neuron-to-astrocyte receptor signaling in the brain. During trains of action potentials or repetitive stimulation, neurotransmitter spills out of the synapse to activate astrocytic Gq protein-coupled receptors (Gq GPCRs). To date, very little is known about the ability of astrocytic receptors to exhibit plasticity as a result of long-term changes in neuronal firing rates. Here we describe for the first time bidirectional scaling of astrocytic group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling in acute mouse hippocampal slices on a rapid timescale following either long-term blockade or increase in neuronal synaptic transmission. Plasticity of astrocytic mGluRs was measured by recording changes in spontaneous and evoked astrocyte Ca2+ elevations in both astrocytic soma as well as fine processes. In response to 4 to 6 hour blockade of CA3-CA1 neurotransmission, the following changes in astrocyte Ca2+ signaling were observed: 1) a significant increase in the percentage of astrocytes in the slice population exhibiting spontaneous Ca2+ elevations; 2) significantly faster rise times of the spontaneous Ca2+ transients; 3) a significant increase in response probability to the group I mGluR agonist; 4) significantly faster rise times of evoked Ca2+ responses; 5) significantly shorter response latencies of evoked Ca2+ responses in astrocyte microdomains; and 6) a dose-dependent shift in astrocytic responses to DHPG in TTX vs. control incubated slices. In response to 4 to 6 hour elevation of CA3-CA1 neurotransmission, the opposite effects on the previous parameters were observed. Further study using transgenic mice expressing a novel Gq GPCR suggested that the changes observed in astrocytic group I mGluR Ca2+ signaling were due to changes in expression of the group I mGluRs in astrocytes, while the intracellular signaling pathway activated by the Gq GPCRs remained unchanged. This study introduces a sensitive assay for recording changes in astrocytic Gq GPCR expression levels, and the results demonstrate active astrocytic detection of basal and elevated frequencies of neuronal action potentials that lie within a physiological range.

Semantic Representation in the Mirror Neuron System
The mirror neuron system is a fronto-parietal network of neurons that is activated both when a person performs an action and when he or she observes that action. The goal of this study was to investigate the semantic representation in this system during action language and gesture processing. This was done in a set of two behavioral experiments. Experiment 1 employed a simple priming paradigm—subjects viewed videos of symbolic gestures or landscapes, which served as the prime, followed by a word that was congruent or unrelated to the video prime, or a pseudo-word. The subject performed a lexical decision task on the target word. The study found a significant priming effect for semantically congruent target words, relative to semantically unrelated target words. However, this same priming effect was found for the video primes of landscapes.  In experiment 2 we aimed to determine whether the videos were primed through effector-specific means, that is, whether hand and arm gestures would activate mirror neurons somatotopically and lead to different priming results when comparing hand responses to foot responses. We used the same priming study as experiment 1 except that subjects made their lexical decision responses on a foot pedal rather than a keyboard. Results suggest that symbolic gestures prime in a very diffuse way, such that semantic priming occurs independent of the effector being used to respond.

Striga parasitizes transgenic hairy roots of zea Mays and provides a tool for studying plant-plant interactions
AbstractBackgroundStriga species are noxious root hemi-parasitic weeds that debilitate cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Control options for Striga are limited and developing Striga resistant crop germplasm is regarded as the best and most sustainable control measure. Efforts to improve germplasm for Striga resistance by a non-Genetic Modification (GM) approach, for example by exploiting natural resistance, or by a GM approach are constrained by limited information on the biological processes underpinning host-parasite associations. Additionaly, a GM approach is stymied by lack of availability of candidate resistance genes for introduction into hosts and robust transformation methods to validate gene functions. Indeed, a majority of Striga hosts, the world&#8217;s most cultivated cereals, are recalcitrant to genetic transformation. In maize, the existing protocols for transformation and regeneration are tedious, lengthy, and highly genotype-specific with low efficiency of transformation.ResultsWe used Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K599 carrying a reporter gene construct, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), to generate transgenic composite maize plants that were challenged with the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. Eighty five percent of maize plants produced transgenic hairy roots expressing GFP. Consistent with most hairy roots produced in other species, transformed maize roots exhibited a hairy root phenotype, the hallmark of A. rhizogenes mediated transformation. Transgenic hairy roots resulting from A. rhizogenes transformation were readily infected by S. hermonthica. There were no significant differences in the number and size of S. hermonthica individuals recovered from either transgenic or wild type roots.ConclusionsThis rapid, high throughput, transformation technique will advance our understanding of gene function in parasitic plant-host interactions.

Instrument Development and Measurements of the Atmospheric Pollutants Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrate Radical, and Nitrous Acid by Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy and Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy
Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrate radical (NO3), and nitrous acid (HONO) play important roles in the atmosphere.  SO2 is associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and contributes to acidification of the ecosystem, particulate sulfate formation and SO2 is an EPA regulated species.  NO3 is the major oxidation species at night often reacting with biogenic volatile organic hydrocarbons emitted during the nighttime air, which lead to peroxyl radical and nitric acid formation.  HONO is a major source of hydroxyl radical (OH) in the early morning.  All of these three pollutants exhibit strong absorptions in the UV and visible region and their absorption bands are exploited for measurements using the ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopy techniques, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS).  SO2 is measured by CRDS near 308 nm in the UV region with a limit of detection of 3.5 ppb/10 seconds (S/N = 2) and ambient measurements are attempted.  Instruments based on light emitting diode (LED) based BBCEAS are developed for measurements of NO3 and HONO.  NO3 is monitored using the 662 nm absorption feature with a limit of detection of 10 ppt/2 minutes (1&sigma;) and the technique is demonstrated by sampling from an environmental chamber.  HONO is measured in the UV region using the 368 nm absorption with a limit of detection of 10 ppb/2 minutes (1&sigma;).

Understanding the role of organic aerosol in the coastal and remote pacic marine boundary layer
Atmospheric aerosol particles were collected over three field experiments in the remote and coastal marine boundary layer of the eastern Pacific Ocean from aircraft, ship, and stationary platforms and were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (AMS), and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy with Near-Edge Absorption Fine Structure (STXM- NEXAFS) for organic functional groups and organic mass fragments. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-rays (SEM-EDX) analyses were used to investigate the elemental composition of the analyzed particles. The aim of these studies was to better characterize particle sources and composition in the stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL), where aerosol-cloud interactions play an important role in controlling the reflectivity of the large cloud decks. Particle composition was linked to distinct particle sources including primary marine emissions, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion. Fossil fuel combustion particles were characterized by large contributions from saturated alkane and carboxylic acid groups. Biomass burning aerosol particles were characterized as mixtures of alkane, carboxylic acid, and ketone groups, consistent with biogenic secondary organic aerosol particles observed in chamber studies. Photochemical aging of the transported smoke particles was observed on diurnal and multi-day timescales as an increase in the relative amount of oxygenated groups and oxygen-containing molecular fragments. Marine primary organic aerosol (POA) particles were observed in shipboard samples and were characterized by large contributions from organic hydroxyl groups, suggesting a carbohydrate- containing source in the ocean surface emitted during bubble bursting. Marine particles were also identified in single particle STXM-NEXAFS and were classified into four distinct categories including soluble and insoluble polysaccharides, proteins, and calcareous phytoplankton fragments. The presence of oxidized (polar) organic components--ketone, organic hydroxyl, and carboxylic acid groups--in submicron particles suggests that many of the measured particles could contribute to cloud condensation nuclei number concentration and mass in both open ocean and coastal regions. Together, these measurements show that marine POA provides a significant contribution to submicron particle mass in the clean MBL, whereas fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning emissions contribute the majority of the organic mass in coastal regions

INTERTIDAL ZONATION OF TWO GASTROPODS, NERITA PLICATA AND MORULA GRANULATA, IN MOOREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA
Intertidal zonation of organisms is a key factor in ecological community structure and the existence of fundamental and realized niches. The zonation of two species of gastropods,Nerita plicata and Morula granulata were investigated using field observations and lab experimentation. The Nerita plicata were found on the upper limits of the intertidal zone while the Morula granulata were found on the lower limits. The distribution of each species was observed and the possible causes of this zonation were examined. Three main factors, desiccation, flow resistance and shell size were tested for their zonation. In the field, shell measurements of each species were made to see if a vertical shell size gradient existed; the results showed an upshore shell size gradient for each species. In the lab, experiments were run to see if the zonation preference found in the field existed in the lab as well. This experiment confirmed that a zonation between these species does in fact exist. Additional experiments were run to test desiccation and flow resistance between each species. A difference in desiccation rates and flow resistance were found with the Nerita plicata being more resistant to both flow and desiccation. The findings of this study provide an understanding on why zonation between these two species could exist as well an intertidal community and ecosystems as a whole.

Ecological significance of bacteria associated with coral reef fish feces
Bacteria may play important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of coral reef fish feces and in the interactions between fishes and corals. This interaction potential was observed in a study of milkfish (Chanos chanos) aquaculture farms in the Philippines. Effluents from suspended fish pens created steep gradients of particulate organic carbon and other water characteristics that extended into nearby coral reefs. Highly similar bacterial phylotypes co-occurred in milkfish feces and in corals indicating the potential for transport of fecal particles and interaction with coral. In a separate study at Palmyra Atoll, bacteria abundances ranged 1̃0⁹ to 10¹¹ g⁻¹ dry wt among feces of parrotfish (Chlorurus sordidus), snapper (Lutjanus bohar), and surgeonfish (Acanthurus nigricans). Bacteria in parrotfish feces grew at a rate of 2̃ x 10⁸ cells g⁻¹ dry wt feces h⁻¹ . To improve our ability to observe growing marine bacteria, I tested a method for using the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), which becomes incorporated during DNA synthesis and can be detected using c̀lick' chemistry combined with epifluorescence microscopy. The percentage of EdU-labeled bacteria ranged from 6̃% to 18% during a time course incubation of natural seawater assemblages. Additionally, cell specific signal intensities could be quantified, demonstrating the method's potential for determining individual cell growth rate. Other studies addressed phylotype composition of feces-associated assemblages. Analyses of feces-derived 16S rRNA gene clones revealed that Vibrionaceae dominated parrotfish and snapper feces. Many of these genes clustered phylogenetically to cultured Vibrio spp. and Photobacterium spp. Other Vibrionaceae- like sequences comprised a distinct phylogenetic group that may represent 'feces-specific' taxa. PCR primers specific to this f̀ish feces vibrio-like' group (FFV-L) were used to screen 'aged' parrotfish feces. FFV-L could be detected in feces collected over several days, indicating that feces may permit persistence of FFV-L in reefs. In addition to FFV-L, other bacteria phylotypes consistently occurred in aged feces, as determined via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses. To test the responses of coral-associated bacteria during short-term interactions with feces, both in situ and aquaria experiments were performed whereby corals were challenged with acute feces doses. The results reinforce the potential for bacteria transfer between feces and corals. Meanwhile, acute challenges with parrotfish feces did not impair the overall health of three coral species

Learning During Exploration: The Role of Behavioral Topography During Exploration in Determining Subsequent Adaptive Behavior in the Sprague-Dawley Rat (Rattus norvegicus)
Two investigations examine the hypothesis that one function of exploration is to create situations in which there is an opportunityto acquire useful information. In the first, male rats {Rattus nonvgicus, Sprague Dawley strain) with enriched (EC) or impoverished ( IC) experience ( leading to differences in exploratory behavior documented previously) were given an opportunity to explore an arena with a hidden escape route on two consecutive days. On the following day, subjects were chased by a mechanical device and the time required to escape the arena was recorded. No group differences were seen in pre-chase behaviors other than those related to the hidden escape route, or in stress-related behaviors while being chased. EC rats escaped significantly more quickly than IC rats, and a composite .score derived from pre-challenge behavior in the arena was correlated significantly with escape time under challenge. In the second experiment, EC and IC subjects were chased without previous experience in the area; EC rats escaped significantly more quickly than IC rats. In an analysis of the combined results from the two experiments, both environmental history and pre-challenge arena experience were found to exert significant influence on escape time. These findings demonstrate that different behaviors during exploration can lead to functionally significant differences in the information acquired as a result of exploration.

The effects of cytoskeletal disruption and mechanical load on cardiac conduction
Myocardial disease is often associated with altered cardiac conduction and increased incidence of arrhythmia. Underlying mechanisms responsible for changes in conduction include altered calcium handling, myocardial remodeling, and mechanically induced changes in electrophysiology. The goal of this work was to utilize optical mapping experimental techniques and genetically modified mouse models to investigate two of these mechanisms: myocardial remodeling associated with disruption of the cytoskeleton, and increased mechanical load. Optical mapping was used to image electrical conduction in the isolated mouse heart. A multi-functional tandem lens optical setup was designed and built for use with a large chip, high-speed CMOS camera. Experimental and analytical techniques were developed to image conduction in the freely beating isolated mouse heart and in cardiomyocyte monolayers. Genetically modified mice provide useful experimental models of cardiac diseases. Four murine models with targeted ablation of cytoskeletal proteins each displayed altered myocardial remodeling and impaired cardiac conduction. Ablation of vinculin and desmoplakin in the heart each resulted in disruption of intercalated disc structure, disrupted myocardial conduction, and increased incidence of arrhythmias. Ablation of enigma homolog protein (ENH) and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) each resulted in disruption of conduction through the specialized cardiac conduction system, without affecting myocardial conduction. An acute increase in ventricular load has previously been shown to slow conduction in the isolated rabbit heart. In the freely beating, isolated mouse heart, we observed a similar conduction slowing with pressure loading of the left ventricle. Preliminary experiments indicate that membrane unfolding, specifically caveolae opening, may play a role in this conduction slowing by altering passive membrane electrical properties

CKS PROTEINS IN CELL CYCLE REGULATION
Eukaryotic cells coordinate the processes of cell growth and division through the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Cdks generate immense signaling specificity and complexity by modifying hundreds of substrates via reversible phosphorylation. Many Cdk substrates are multiphosphorylated, but the mechanisms underlying the enzymatic activity of Cdks toward such substrates are not fully understood. Cks1 is a small essential protein that physically associates with Cdks, possesses a phosphate-binding pocket, and acts as both a positive and negative regulator of Cdk activity. Cks1 has also been extensively studied for its ability to form domain-swapped homodimers, the formation of which is controlled by two conserved proline residues. This dissertation presents research that combined  x-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetics, and biophysical methods to demonstrate a direct role for Cks1 in targeting Cdks to multiphosphorylated substrates and develop a new hypothesis for the conservation of a proline residue that mediates domain-swapping in Cks1.

[problem, philosophical, method, text, mind, example, wittgenstein]

Method
In this dissertation, I describe and develop an investigative method inspired by Wittgenstein's works.  Wittgenstein employs a "method of examples"; he makes philosophical points by demonstrating how philosophical puzzles arise from our normal uses of so-called ordinary language.  His examples are usually simple ones: builders issue commands, people compare shades of colors, objects are given names, etc.  Whereas many philosophers investigate abstract problems and puzzles through analysis of exotic counter-examples, Wittgenstein employs tangible cases in order to examine how problems arise in the first place.  In the broadest of terms, this is his philosophical problem-solving method.  Similarly, rather than treat a general, abstract problem from the start, I address questions that arise from real world situations.  I show how understanding larger philosophical problems as collections of simple questions helps to contextualize and consequently better address and understand a more complex problem at hand.The text itself demonstrates the method, and in this sense, is an argument in favor of using it on appropriate investigative occasions.  Its unconventional structure demonstrates a way that seems useful to me for developing our understanding of philosophical problems.  The book introduces certain key ideas in the first half, gradually using certain words in a more and more regimented fashion.  Then, in the second half, I make use of these preliminary discussions in order to talk about the same ideas more technically.  Throughout, my aim is to keep my philosophical motivations on the text's surface; keeping in mind how philosophical problems arise is one way to do this, and I keep such things in mind by exercising familiar examples throughout the text.  By doing this, I am able to examine insights into some subtle issues in philosophy of language and philosophy of mind, such as meaning, intention, and thinking.

Development of hippocampal mossy fiber connectivity and its regulation by NeuroD2 mediated transcription
The assembly of neural circuits in the developing brain is critical for the establishment of nervous system function. Investigation of this process is important to understand how connectivity changes across development, maturity and in diseases states. My thesis has applied techniques ranging from molecular biology to light and electron microscopy, specifically to study the assembly of the hippocampal mossy fiber synapse. The mossy fiber synapse exhibits unique structural and functional properties, making it an ideal system to study the differentiation of synapse specific properties. To investigate the structural maturation of the mossy fiber synapse at a level not previously possible, I have utilized the novel technique of serial blockface scanning electron microscopy. This technique allows the rapid acquisition of large volumes of perfectly aligned ultrastructural data for the three- dimensional reconstruction of local mossy fiber microcircuitry. Using volumes obtained from developing stratum lucidum neuropil, I have demonstrated 1) the range of pre and post-synaptic structural diversity at this synapse, 2) developmental refinement of structural features relevant to connectivity and 3) the relationship between pre and post-synaptic elements during the establishment of mature patterns of connectivity. The assembly of mossy fiber circuitry occurs entirely during postnatal development, a time during which both genetically determined and activity-dependent processes operate. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mossy fiber synapse maturation, I have investigated the role of the calcium-activated transcription factor NeuroD2 in this process. Using NeuroD2 null mice and in vivo single cell knockdown approaches, I find that 1) Development of mossy fiber synapse structure and function depends critically on NeuroD2 mediated transcription, 2) NeuroD2 acts post-synaptically to regulate the density of post-synaptic structure at the mossy fiber synapse in vivo, 3) NeuroD2 regulates the expression of PSD95 in the developing hippocampus and 4) Knockdown of PSD95 in vivo recapitulates the effect of NeuroD2 loss of function. These experiments indicate that NeuroD2 regulates a transcriptional program that is critical for the process of mossy fiber synapse maturation identified using serial blockface scanning electron microscopy

Occurrence, Fate and Transport Behaviors of Pesticides on Urban Impervious Surfaces
Urban and residential areas are covered by impervious surfaces such as concrete. During rainfalls and irrigations, these surfaces transfer runoff directly to surface water through urban sewage. Impervious surfaces are highly possible to be contaminated with pesticides, through direct treatments or through indirect deposits from surrounding areas (e.g., lawns) via wind- or water-aided movements. Although pesticides have been widely found in urban watersheds, their persistence and runoff potential from impervious surfaces have been seldom studied. 	This dissertation includes a series of lab and field scale experiments to assess pesticide contamination on concrete surfaces, as well as different environmental and application parameters that may affect their runoff potential.	The results showed pesticide wash-off potential from concrete rapidly decreased after treatments, but low levels were constantly detected in the water from concrete with extended outdoor exposure. Immediately after treatments with pesticides in liquid formulations, concrete surfaces were equilibrated with 30 mL CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution for 10 min to mimic runoff, and <25% of applied pesticides were recovered. The wash-off percentage further decreased to <5% after 7-d. Higher wash-off potential was observed for solid formulated pesticides. The initial rapid loss of wash-off transferability was followed by a stage of sustained pesticide wash-off, which continued for over 112-d. The persistent wash-off potential was also observed for concrete repeatedly equilibrated with water once every 3-d. Most pesticides were still detectable after 10 times of washing-drying cycles.   	To explain the observed wash-off patterns, sorption/desorption and degradation of permethrin on concrete were further studied using <super>14</super>C-labeled permethrin. Although the sorption equilibrium was quickly achieved within 24-h, permethrin desorption continued for over 300-h, and around 20 % of applied <super>14</super>C still remained on concrete after 300-h. If the desorption started 7-d after permethrin treatments,  the amounts of desorbed permethrin decreased by 58 % compared the freshly spiked concrete.	Finally, field study was conducted to assess pesticide runoff following simulated and natural rainfalls. 80 % of runoff pyrethroids were found on suspended particles. Besides, a surface wiping method was developed to collect transferable particles from concrete and its potential to predict pesticide runoff prior to rainfall starts was demonstrated.

The Gauss-Pearson Decomposition and the Link Between Classical Philosophy and Modern Statistics
This article discusses the mathematical and philosophical premises of Gauss’ and Pearson’s methods for advancing science through empirical observation. At the core is the notion that an observation can be decomposed into an ideal part and a random part, and that the relation between the observation and its two parts is known. The premise, named the Gauss-Pearson decomposition, is formalized in an algebraic framework that is as general as possible. Examples illustrate how the decomposition fits naturally into the body of statistical methodology and how it can facilitate understanding of statistical methods.

The effects of pacing location on regional activation using epicardial electrical mapping
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective intervention for patients with heart failure but has a 30% non-responder rate due to a lack of predictive, mechanism- based objective criteria for patient selection. In order to fully optimize treatment outcomes, computational models can be used to predict molecular, biomechanical, and electrophysiological mechanisms of cardiac function. The methods presented in this thesis provide an efficient technique to estimate epicardial activation time parameters and thus will prove useful as the electrophysiological input for predictive patient-specific computational model development. By developing three- dimensional isochronal maps, the sequence of ventricular activation in normal hearts, hearts with heart failure, hearts with myocardial infarcts, and hearts with ventricular dyssynchrony, such as left bundle branch block (LBBB), can be visualized. Through the use of a 128- electrode sock array, it is confirmed that the local activation time is most efficiently calculated using the time of the maximum negative derivative averaged over multiple beats. Automatic determination of the activation times proved to be comparable to manual determination (the standard). It is also seen that filtering signals causes data loss and should be avoided if possible. The calculated activation times are then input into an anatomical fit geometry of the heart to create an epicardial isochronal activation map in Continuity. Inspection of these maps reveals that endocardial pacing does not always restore more ventricular synchrony when compared to epicardial pacing, specifically in the presence of tachycardia-induced heart failure and a myocardial infarct

Understanding activity from trajectory patterns
A fundamental goal of Computer Vision is to provide scene understanding and situational awareness. In order to deliver on this promise, traditional monitoring systems were designed for specific environmental situations, such as a specific time, place, or activity scenario. A well versed expert defines the events of interest by hand for the particular application. While effective, these techniques do not scale well, they typically have poor generalization, are inflexible to behavioral changes, and the analysis rules may not reflect the true nature of the scene but a priori expectations. The conventional methods to understand activities must be scaled to match growing need. Society's rapid acceptance of video use in a wide variety of locations and applications has promoted the deployment of large camera networks. These networks monitor complex scenes and deliver volumes of video data that can not be digested without automated assistance. This dissertation investigates unsupervised activity understanding by analyzing patterns of motion trajectories. A practical approach is introduced and carefully developed to overcome the difficulties with trajectory learning, namely the definition of a simple activity model that can be robustly inferred from crude measurements, the automatic determination of the number of typical activities in a scene, and methods to observe dynamic scenes over long periods. The activity analysis framework is able to process and analyze activity, providing activity characterization, prediction, and abnormality detection, in real-time for real world utility. The efficacy of the trajectory learning framework is demonstrated in three distinct arenas. Highway traffic is monitored using a single camera with the VECTOR system, multiple sensors are integrated and combined in a unified space with CANVAS, and driving maneuvers analyzed from within a moving automobile. This extension of the trajectory learning paradigm to a broad range of (untouched) application spaces further highlights the dissertation contributions. Finally, extensive performance evaluation and characterization is conducted to provide a missing benchmark for the field

Recovery of the terrestrial crab Cardisoma carnifex after burrow disturbance
The importance of disturbance ecology grows as pristine habitat becomes increasingly encroached upon by land use change. This study focuses on the behavior of the burrowing terrestrial crabCardisoma carnifex(Herbst 1794) on the island of Moorea after its semi-permanent burrow was disrupted. In the first manipulation, a set of four disturbance treatments was applied to burrows in sand and dirt substrate to examine recovery time. The second manipulation increased the intensity of the disturbance to see if the crabs’ strategies change. The results showed a significant increase in recovery time with the intensity of disturbance in dirt substrates, but not in sand. There was also a significant combined effect of treatment and substrate type on recovery. The second set of data showed the same set of recovery strategies even as the disturbances were more intense. This shows that these crabs can restore their burrows in relatively low levels of disturbance, but it remains to be seen how they and other species cope with larger scale influences such as urbanization.

Gq G Protein Coupled Receptor Mediated Potentiation of Astrocytic Glutamate Uptake
Astrocytic glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-1 (rodent analogs of EAAT1 and EAAT2, respectively) constitute the major pathway of glutamate uptake in the central nervous system. Uptake of synaptically released glutamate by astrocytes is essential for maintaining a healthy level of excitatory activity in the brain. It is also known that astrocytes in situ possess a myriad of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the Gi, Gs, and Gq families. Stimulation of glutamatergic afferents not only leads to astrocytic glutamate uptake but also has been shown to stimulate group I (Gq type) metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mediated intracellular Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes both in vivo and in situ. Activation of mGluRs has been associated with short and long-term plastic changes of glutamate transport in cultured astroglia and in Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices. This led us to hypothesize that astrocytic Gq GPCRs modulate glutamate transport. This hypothesis was tested in acute mouse hippocampal slices using two different approaches: (1) activation of astrocytic mGluRs in slices from wild-type mice using a tetanic high frequency stimulus (200Hz, 1s) applied to the Schaffer collaterals (SCs); (2) activation of a transgenic Gq GPCR (the MrgA1R) which is selectively expressed by astrocytes.  Synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents (STCs) were isolated from the total evoked astrocytic currents and analyzed for changes in amplitude, rise time, rise slope and decay time constant. High frequency stimulation (HFS) of SCs led to potentiation of the amplitude of the STCs without changes in kinetics. Similar potentiation was not observed in the presence of group I mGluRs or the PKC inhibitor, PKC 19-36, suggesting that HFS induced potentiation of glutamate uptake is group I mGluR - PKC dependent. Activation of the MrgA1Rs selectively expressed by astrocytes also potentiated the STC amplitude indicating the sufficiency of astrocytic Gq GPCR activation for potentiation of glutamate uptake.  Surprisingly, the amplitude of the slow inward astrocytic current due to potassium uptake is also enhanced following activation of either the endogenous mGluRs or the astrocyte-specific MrgA1Rs. These findings collectively suggest that astrocytic Gq GPCR activation has a synergistic modulatory effect on the uptake of both glutamate and potassium.

Germline deletion of beta2 microglobulin or CD1d reduces anti-phospholipid antibody, but increases autoantibodies against non-phospholipid antigens, in NZB/W F1 model of lupus
Abstract
Introduction
&#946;2-microglobulin (&#946;2m) is required for the surface expression of MHC class I and class I-like proteins such as CD1d, Qa1 and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), all of which may impact the development of autoimmunity. Since CD1d is known to bind and present phospholipid antigens to T cells, we asked if the deficiency of &#946;2m or CD1d will impact the development of anti-phospholipid antibodies as compared to other aspects of lupus autoimmunity.

Methods
We introgressed the &#946;2m-null genotype onto the NZB and NZW backgrounds for 12 to 14 generations to generate genetically lupus-susceptible (NZB/NZW)F1 (BWF1) mice that are &#946;2m-deficient (&#946;2m&#176;). Circulating immunoglobulins (Ig), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-DNA and anti-cardiolipin (anti-CL) antibodies, and renal disease were analyzed in these and CD1d-deficient (CD1d&#176;) BWF1 mice that we had previously generated.

Results
Whereas &#946;2m&#176; BWF1 mice had reduced serum IgG, they had increased mortality, nephritis, serum IgG anti-DNA antibody and RF as compared to heterozygous and wild-type littermates. These effects were recapitulated in CD1d&#176; BWF1 mice, except that they also had increased serum IgG as compared to control littermates. Intriguingly, both &#946;2m&#176; and CD1d&#176; mice had lower serum anti-CL antibody levels than in control littermates. Such CD1d dependence of anti-CL antibody production is not mediated by CD1d/glycolipid-reactive iNKT cells, as these cells reduced the production of RF and anti-DNA antibodies but had no effect on anti-CL antibodies.

Conclusions
We report a novel dichotomous role of &#946;2m and CD1d, whereby these molecules differently regulate autoimmunity against phospholipid versus non-phospholipid autoantigens.

A missense founder mutation in VLDLR is associated with Dysequilibrium Syndrome without quadrupedal locomotion
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Dysequilibrium syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition that combines autosomal recessive, nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with mental retardation. The condition has been classified into cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation and disequilibrium syndrome types 1 (CAMRQ1), 2 (CAMRQ2) and 3 (CAMRQ3) and attributed to mutations in VLDLR, CA8 and WDR81 genes, respectively. Quadrupedal locomotion in this syndrome has been reported in association with mutations in all three genes.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					SNP mapping and candidate gene sequencing in one consanguineous Omani family from the United Arab Emirates with cerebellar hypoplasia, moderate mental retardation, delayed ambulation and truncal ataxia was used to identify the mutation. In a second unrelated consanguineous Omani family, massively parallel exonic sequencing was used.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.2117&#8201;G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T, p.C706F) in the VLDLR gene in both families on a shared affected haplotype block.This is the first reported homozygous missense mutation in VLDLR and it occurs in a highly conserved residue and predicted to be damaging to protein function.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					We have delineated the phenotype associated with dysequilibrium syndrome in two Omani families and identified the first homozygous missense pathogenic mutation in VLDLR gene with likely founder effect in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula.

Direct observation of two-step crystallization in nanoparticle superlattice formation
Direct imaging of nanoparticle solutions by liquid phase transmission electron microscopy has enabled unique in-situ studies of nanoparticle motion and growth. In the present work, we report on real-time formation of two-dimensional nanoparticle arrays in the very low diffusive limit, where nanoparticles are mainly driven by capillary forces and solvent fluctuations. We find that superlattice formation appears to be segregated into multiple regimes. Initially, the solvent front drags the nanoparticles, condensing them into an amorphous agglomerate.  Subsequently, the nanoparticle crystallization into an array is driven by local fluctuations. Following the crystallization event, superlattice growth can also occur via the addition of individual nanoparticles drawn from outlying regions by different solvent fronts.  The dragging mechanism is consistent with simulations based on a coarse-grained lattice gas model at the same limit.

Immobilized lactate oxidase for development of a long-term implantable lactate sensor
Development of a continuous, long-term implantable lactate sensor has long been a goal in the field of biosensors. The current standard of care in treatment of diabetes mellitus involves measurement of only one metabolite, glucose, on an infrequent, discrete basis. Continuous monitoring would capture of all metabolic excursions so that treatment decisions could be made on complete time- series information. In addition, the measurement of the metabolite lactic acid would lead to an even better understanding of the patient's metabolic state. Lactate has also been shown to be of importance in many diseases involving compromised circulatory or pulmonary function, and athletes would benefit from continuous measurement of this variable. Lactate oxidase (LOx), the enzyme used in the construction of our lactate sensor, is known to be quite unstable with respect to enzymatic activity over time. This leads to reduced sensor lifetimes, which can be problematic for an implantable sensor due to the necessity for frequent replacement. This dissertation focuses on the characterization of LOx as it pertains to sensor design. LOx was immobilized in different constructs and the activity as a function of in vitro incubation time was measured. Two unique systems of immobilization were used here: one based on ionic forces and the other based on chemical cross-linking. It was found that good immobilization yield (the amount of active enzyme remaining after immobilization divided by the amount formulated) could be achieved in the ionic immobilization scheme; however, stability was lower than free enzyme in PBS in all cases. Protection of LOx via complexing with high concentrations of the oppositely charged polymer (a polycation) was essential for maximizing stability. Immobilization via chemical cross-linking in a bovine serum albumin matrix also had good process yields when minimum amounts of cross-linking agent were used. In addition, it was found that stability could be enhanced when compared to free enzyme in PBS via immobilizing the enzyme at a pH of approximately 5.5. The parameters found by experimentation were used to determine the linear range as a function of time for a sensor design model

Quantification of bone marrow lesion volume and volume change using semi-automated segmentation: data from the osteoarthritis initiative
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					To determine the validity of a semi-automated segmentation of bone marrow lesions (BMLs) in the knee.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Construct validity of the semi-automated BML segmentation method was explored in two studies performed using sagittal intermediate weighted, turbo spine echo, fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging sequences obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. The first study (n = 48) evaluated whether tibia BML volume was different across Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Scores (BLOKS) for tibia BMLs (semiquantitative grades 0 to 3). In the second study (n = 40), we evaluated whether BML volume change was associated with changes in cartilage parameters. The knees in both studies were segmented by one investigator. We performed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to determine if tibia BML volume was different between adjacent BLOKS BML scores and calculated Spearman correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between 2-year BML volume change and 2-year cartilage morphometry change (significance was p &#8804; 0.05).
				
				
					
						Results
					BML volume was significantly greater between BLOKS BML score 0 and 1 (z = 2.85, p = 0.004) and BLOKS BML scores 1 and 2 (z = 3.09, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference between BLOKS BML scores 2 and 3 (z = &#8722;0.30, p = 0.77). Increased tibia BML volume was significantly related to increased tibia denuded area (Spearman r = 0.42, p = 0.008), decreased tibia cartilage thickness (Spearman r = &#8722;0.46, p = 0.004), increased femur denuded area (Spearman r = 0.35, p = 0.03), and possibly decreased femur cartilage thickness (Spearman r = &#8722;0.30, p = 0.07) but this last finding was not statistically significant.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					The new, efficient, and reliable semi-automated BML segmentation method provides valid BML volume measurements that increase with greater BLOKS BML scores and confirms previous reports that BML size is associated with longitudinal cartilage loss.

On Why There Are So Few Comparisons in Comparative Psychology
The comparative study of behavior requires close attention to the ecologically unique details of the environmental challenges and adaptations (both behavioral and structural) of a systematically selected range of species. It offers an understanding of which aspects of behavior change and which remain constant across phylogenetic pathways and evolutionary challenges. The General Process View of Learning (also known as the principle of the transsituationality of reinforcement, and by several other names), however, militates against study of the details of behavioral adaptations, by insisting that particular behaviors may be regarded as arbitrary instances of universal associative principles. The history of behaviorism, and of contingency theory, in particular, is largely the history of the gradual emergence and dominance of this General Process View, and of the working out of its profoundly anticomparative implications. The increasingly wide repudiation of the General Process View is providing the basis for a renewal of comparative studies of behavior.

High Throughput Single Molecule Investigation of Transcription
RNA Polymerase (RNAP) is a crucial protein molecule that decodes the information stored in DNA as base pair sequences, through a process called transcription. The study of the mechanics and composition of RNAP in a cell is crucial to understanding the complex and arduous process of life. Most biological systems respond to a change by adding heterogeneity to its population states. One of the most effective ways of studying a biological system is to compare the population states of proteins as a function of time or chemical environment. Unfortunately, some of the subpopulations induced by external stimulation are too small and are hidden under ensemble averaging when using traditional methods like gel-electrophoresis. I have developed single-molecule methods capable of resolving subpopulations and monitoring the transition of individual molecules to its various function states. Using these methods we can (1) rapidly screen RNAP activity in a large reagent space and (2) map the transcription factor binding sites on DNA with ultrahigh accuracy (ó < 300base pairs) in the genomic scale with the ability to differentiate single cell variations.

Characterization of Cellular Signaling in Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors
Aberrant cellular signaling networks lie at the heart of cancer pathogenesis.  Whether stimulated by a dominant oncogene or activated receptor tyrosine kinase, these signals affect biological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis.  In the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFST), a group of pediatric bone and soft tissue malignancies, EWS/FLI1 transcriptional modulation and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling are the two main forces that drive tumorigenesis.  In order to obtain a comprehensive view of signaling, we applied a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic approach to quantify global changes in phosphorylation after IGF1 stimulation, IGF1 receptor inhibition, and EWS/FLI1 knock down.  Our analyses identified hundreds unique phosphopeptides enriched in processes such as regulation of cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization.  In particular, examination of tyrosine phosphopeptides downstream of IGF1 identified potential roles for Src family kinases and members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases in ESFT pathogenesis.  Additionally, phosphotyrosine profiling revealed a large up regulation of Stat3 phosphorylation upon EWS/FLI1 knock down.  Further investigation revealed this activation occurs through a paracrine mechanism.  Overall, phosphoproteomic profiling has uncovered novel regulators and mechanisms for ESFT signaling, allowing for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Effects of horizontal advection and vertical mixing on natural iron fertilization in Southern Drake Passage
A combination of in situ and satellite data is used to examine the effects of horizontal advection, diapycnal mixing, and mixed-layer entrainment on natural iron fertilization in a region near the Shackleton Fracture Zone in southern Drake Passage. Results from Optimal Multiparameter analysis of temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient data are consistent with a scenario in which iron-rich shelf waters from the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic peninsula are advected northward on the eastern side of the Shackleton Transverse Ridge (STR), where they interact with the low-iron waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Ona Basin. However, comparisons between sea surface height and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels in the region for the years 1997-2010 indicate that this advection process is significantly correlated with biological productivity only during the months of November and December, while high Chl -a concentrations persist through March. Enhanced diapycnal mixing and mixed-layer entrainment are considered as alternative mechanisms for delivering iron into the Ona Basin mixed layer. While fine-scale mixing estimates lack the vertical resolution to fully resolve the small-scale density fluctuations in the low- stratification regime of the Southern Ocean, microstructure measurements indicate that diapycnal diffusivities in Drake Passage are on the order of 10⁻⁴ m² s⁻¹. Based on these diffusivities, estimates of iron flux from iron concentrations measured during the summer of 2004 and winter of 2006 suggest that diapycnal mixing alone can supply iron ito the mixed layer at a rate of approximately 96±9 nmol m⁻² day⁻¹ during the winter and approximately 64±2 nmol m⁻² day⁻¹ during the summer. In addition, the Ona Basin mixed layer deepens from January into April, allowing for iron to be steadily entrained from below. Simulation of these vertical processes with a simple one-dimensional model yields an estimated mixed- layer entrainment rate of 12±9 nmol m⁻² day⁻¹, while the combined effect of mixing and entrainment can supply 176±44ñmol m⁻² day⁻¹ into the top 30 m from January to April, which is sufficient to sustain the phytoplankton bloom that persists in the basin throughout the summer months

Characterization of the Phytophthora Sojae RNA Silencing Repressors
Phytophthora sojae is an oomycete pathogen that causes soybean (Glycine max) stem and root rot, the second most destructive soybean disease. P. sojae belongs to the genus Phytophthora which includes other important plant pathogens such as the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and sudden oak death pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. These eukaryotic pathogens cause billions of dollars of crop damage each year. However, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. As many other plant pathogens, Phytophthora utilizes effector proteins to suppress host defense and cause disease. P. sojae is predicted to produce more than 400 effectors that contain the conserved host cell entry motif RxLR-dEER; however, most of these effectors are functionally uncharacterized. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying effector-mediated suppression of host defense, a screen was conducted in our laboratory to identify effectors targeting the RNA silencing pathway. Using a post- transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) assay, two Phytophthora Suppressors of RNA silencing effectors (PSRs) were indentified. The main goal of my thesis work is to investigate the virulence function of PSRs during pathogen infection. My experiments showed that PSR1 enhances the virulence of Potato Virus X in Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, PSR1 and PSR2 may also enhance the virulence of P. sojae by accelerating the sporulation of the pathogen in soybean roots. Taken together, these results suggest that Phytophthora pathogens have evolved effectors that promote infection by targeting the RNA silencing pathway in plant hosts.Understanding how these effector proteins target different functional branches of the plant immune systems would advance our understanding of Phytophthora pathogenesis. This knowledge will contribute to the development of disease resistant crops.

Seismic response to fluid injection and production in two Salton Trough geothermal fields, southern California
California hosts both the largest geothermal resource capacity and highest seismicity rate in the nation. With plans to increase geothermal output, and proven earthquake triggering in the vicinity of geothermal power plants worldwide, it is important to determine the local and regional effects of geothermal power production.  This study examines the link between fluid injection and seismicity at the Salton Sea and Brawley geothermal fields in southern California by attempting to answer three motivating questions: 1) Does fluid injection at the geothermal field change local seismicity in a measurable way?  2) Are aftershocks triggered at the same rate inside and outside of the field?  3) How do the triggered aftershocks interact with regional fault networks, specifically, could these aftershocks trigger a societally significant event on the southern San Andreas or Imperial faults? Injection and production data consist of monthly logs from 1980 to 2012 for wells at both Salton Sea geothermal fields (California Department of Conservation, 2012).  Seismic data for the same time span comes from the relocated Hauksson, Yang, and Shearer earthquake catalog for southern California (2012), which is augmented by the Southern California Seismic Network earthquake catalog (2012).  We employ an epidemic-type aftershock sequence model to predict background seismicity and aftershock rates in the geothermal fields, and use empirical earthquake relationships to measure aftershock productivity.  Background seismicity rate closely tracks net production volume at the Salton Sea geothermal field for early and late stages of field development and we find that earthquakes inside the field trigger aftershocks at a higher rate than ordinary earthquakes.  Finally, we calculate small but finite probabilities that the aftershocks of events in the geothermal fields will trigger significant earthquakes on the large, regional faults, of order 10e-5 to 10e-8 per year.

Studies towards DNA-polymer-silica-iron oxide hybrid nanoparticles as stimulus-responsive MR theranostics
Early detection and treatment of a disease is a desired goal for medical advancements. The concept of theranostics have been introduced to combine diagnosis and therapy. Developing nanoparticles for drug delivery has been considered because they increase therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects. Synthesizing particles that can promote imaging of areas before, during, and after administration into the organism is beneficial for the treatment of diseases. In this work superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized as enhancers for MR imaging by using magnetic imaging resonance. Biocompatible, stimuli-responsive polymers were physisorbed to the particles in a layer-by-layer fashion to induce aggregation of iron oxide nanoparticles site specifically and deliver increased MR signals. The surfaces of the superparamagnetic particles were first modified with silica to increase biocompatability, reduce aggregation of the iron oxide particles and allow potential encapsulation of drugs. The surface of the iron oxide silica core shell particles were next treated with APTES, a coupling agent, to help adhere polymers to the particles. In this study poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) were the polymers used for forming crosslinkable polymer shells on the particles through a layer-by-layer approach. The PMA chains were modified with thiol groups to crosslink the multiple layers deposited onto the particle surfaces. The polymer shells could easily be destabilized in the presence of reducing agents. Additionally, PMA was modified with DNA strands which would allow the silica coated iron oxide nanoparticles to aggregate and therefore increase the signal for MR imaging

Understanding the Nature of Blazars High Energy Emission with Time Dependent Multi-zone Modeling
In this thesis we present a time-dependent multi-zone radiative transfer code and its applications to study the multiwavelength emission of blazars. The multiwavelength variability of blazars is widely believed to be a direct manifestation of the formation and propagation of relativistic jets, and hence the related physics of the black hole - accretion disk - jet system. However, the understanding of these variability demands highly sophisticated theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Especially, the inclusion of the light travel time eﬀects(LTTEs) in these calculations has long been realized important, but very diﬃcult. The code we use couples Fokker-Planck and Monte Carlo methods, in a 2 dimensional (cylindrical) geometry. For the ﬁrst time all the LTTEs are fully considered, along with a proper, full, self-consistent treatment of Compton cooling, which depends on the LTTEs.

Using this code, we studied a set of physical processes that are relevant to the variability of blazars, including electron injection and escape, radiative cooling, and stochastic particle acceleration. Our comparison of the observational data and the simulation results revealed that a combination of all those processes is needed to reproduce the observed behaviors of the emission of blue blazars. The simulation favors that the high energy emission at quiet and ﬂare stages comes from the same location.

We have further modeled red blazars PKS 1510-089. External radiation, which comes from the broad line region (BLR) or infrared torus, is included in the model. The results conﬁrm that external Compton model can adequately describe the emission from red blazars.

Bio-inspired tailored hydroxyapatite-based powder composites for dental applications
This study includes two interconnected parts. The first part describes the characterization of the natural materials including the teeth of predator and preys' aspects and Arapaima gigas scale. Based on the first part, several special features presented in the natural materials were investigated. In the second part, the special procedures of the fabrication of tailored hydroxyapatite (HAP) based composites by the novel consolidation technique of spark plasma sintering are developed. These procedures are bio-inspired by the findings of the first part of the study. A natural tooth is composed of the external layer, hard enamel which has high degree of mineralization and the internal region - tough dentin which has collagen fibrils and carbonated apatite mineral. The main feature in the dentin is the tubule structure. Arapaima gigas scales serve as armor- like materials to protect Arapaima gigas from being bitten by piranha. The scales have a laminate structure with the hard external layer and soft internal layers. Besides the hydroxyapatite mineral, the main building block of the scale is collagen fibers. The structure of teeth and scale were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The chemical compound was analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Mechanical tests (microindentation, nanoindentation, tensile and compression tests) were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of those biological materials. The penetration test of piranha teeth on the arapaima scale was conducted to prove that the scale is stronger than the piranha tooth. In order to fabricate artificial dental materials inspired by the investigated structure of the natural teeth, spark plasma sintering involving high heating rates, shorter sintering times and low sintering temperatures was utilized to fabricate hydroxyapatite composites. Hydroxyapatite is widely used in biomedical applications, but its low mechanical strength limits its applications in heavy loaded implants. Carbon nanotube (CNT) - HAP composites were fabricated by spark plasma sintering and indicated that the addition of CNT can improve the mechanical strength of pure HAP. Unaxial freeze drying process was utilized to create a micro channel structure in the hydroxyapatite components. To maintain the porous structure of the tailored hydroxyapatite green specimens, a newly developed sintering process, Free Pressureless Spark Plasma Sintering(FPSPS), was used to consolidate the tailored hydroxyapatite without applying pressure. The comparison of the outcome of the treatment of hydroxyapatite components by conventional sintering and free pressureless spark plasma sintering was conducted showing that FPSPS can provide a better approach to consolidate the material with higher micro hardness

Computational inference of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes
Inference of transcriptional regulation, which includes discovering binding sites of a transcription factor (TF), identifying its direct target genes and detecting its dynamical activity, is an important step towards reconstructing transcription network. In this dissertation, I have developed three novel computational methods to tackle this task by integrating large-scale genomic data. All three methods train a probabilistic model using sequence motif, gene expression, TF binding and conservation data. This probabilistic model provides an elegant way to reduce noise in individual data by integrating multiple sources of data. Mathematically, they maximize the joint likelihood of the observable data using expectation-maximization method. The hidden variables in the models represent the identity of a gene (target or not in TRANSMODIS and CompMODEM) and the activity of a TF (in ActivMiner). The EM algorithm iteratively determines these hidden variables and the parameters in the models. The three methods have different purposes. The first two methods called TRANSMODIS and CompMODEM aim to identify binding sites and direct target genes of TFs. TRANMODIS takes into account that target genes of a TF normally share similar sequence motifs in the TF binding regions and gene expression patterns under different conditions. If only a single gene expression or TF binding experiment is available, in addition to the sequence and expression information, CompMODEM considers conservation of TF binding sites in the model because functional regulatory sites tend to be evolutionarily constrained. Both TRANSMODIS and CompMODEM assume the TF of interest is active. When such information is not available, ActivMiner aims to simultaneously infer the dynamic activity of TFs and their regulatory targets. These methods have been successfully applied to multiple species including human, worm and yeast. The studies presented in this dissertation lay the foundation of inferring gene regulatory network, which is a great challenge in the post-genome era. With the fast accumulation of genomic data, these methods will provide a set of useful tools to understand transcriptional mechanisms

Modulating Protein Homeostasis to Ameliorate Lysosomal Storage Disorders
The goal of this project has been to develop therapeutic strategies for protein misfolding diseases caused by excessive degradation of misfolded proteins and loss of protein function. The focus for this work is lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), a group of more than 50 known inherited metabolic diseases characterized by deficiency in hydrolytic enzymes and consequent buildup of lysosomal macromolecules. Gaucher’s Disease (GD) is used as a representative of the family of LSDs in this study. GD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GC) and consequent accumulation of the GC substrate, glucocerebroside. The most prevalent mutations among GD patients are single amino acid substitutions that do not directly impair GC activity, but rather destabilize its native folding. GC normally folds in the ER and trafficks through the secretory pathway to the lysosomes. GC variants containing destabilizing mutations misfold and are retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). However, evidence shows that if misfolding-prone, mutated GC variants are forced to fold into their 3D native structure, they retain catalytic activity. This study describes strategies to remodel the network of cellular pathways that maintain protein homeostasis and to create a folding environment favorable to the folding of unstable, degradation-prone lysosomal enzyme variants. We demonstrated that folding and trafficking of mutated GC variants can be achieved by modulating the protein folding network in fibroblasts derived from patients with GD to i) upregulate the expression of ER luminal chaperones, ii) inhibit the ERAD pathway, and iii) enhance the pool of mutated GC in the ER amenable to folding rescue. We also demonstrated that the same cell engineering strategies that proved successful in rescuing the folding and activity of mutated GC enable rescue of mutated enzyme variants in fibroblasts derived from patients with Tay-Sachs disease, a LSD caused by deficiency of lysosomal hexosaminidase A activity. As a result, the current study provides insights for the development of therapeutic strategies for GD based on the modulation of general cellular pathways that maintain protein homeostasis that could in principle be applied to the treatment of multiple LSDs.

Polylipid Nanoparticle, a Novel Lipid-Based Vector for Liver Gene Transfer
The clinical application of non-viral vector-based gene transfer has been hampered by less efficiency, short-term transgene expression and toxicity. Polylipid nanoparticles we have developed have been demonstrated to be highly efficient and non-toxic. The duration of effective transgene expression is long enough for a particular target window in liver disorders, such as drug toxicity, alcoholic liver injury and ischemia/reperfusion-associated donor organ damage. Moreover, a high DNA-packaging capacity, an extremely low binding rate to serum proteins, and amendable synthetic approaches for a large quantity of production confer this formulation of lipid-based transfer of antioxidant genes a great potential of clinical application. This chapter covers our experience in the synthesis, formulation, optimization and validation of the polylipid nanoparticle-mediated antioxidantgene transfer for the development of liver-based gene delivery approaches tailored for particular clinical scenarios. We also share our efforts and challenges faced in moving this potential gene transfer approach towards clinical application.

Timing Behavior and Development:  Comments on Some Animal and Human Data
This paper discusses timing behavior as measured by Fixed (FI), Differential Reinforcement of Low rate (DRL) or Differential Reinforcement Response Duration (DRRD) performances, in humans and animals at different develop stages. Infants and rats display similar behavior patterns in FI and childhood on, humans develop species-specific behavior patterns in FI, which differ from those of animal species. However, DRL patterns do follow similar trends in animals and humans. These discrepancies and similarities may by the availability of cognitive and linguistic tools in humans, and the degree od schedule constraint on behavior. Motivation and reinforcer variables as well as to a cross-specific timing mechanism (such as scalar timing) are briefly commented upon. Available data tend to show that humans shift from contingency-shaped or "animal-like" behavior, in infancy, to rule-governed behavior. This transition is progressive and does not seem to erase forms of adaptation to temporal constraints that humans share with other species.

Nicotinic cholinergic signaling determines the fate of adultborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
While nAChRs are poised to regulate adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a careful examination of the effects of nicotinic signaling on adult neurogenesis has not been performed. Here we examine, in vivo, the maturation and survival of adultborn neurons from nAChR knockout mice or mice receiving nAChR agonists. We find that endogenous, cell autonomous signaling through alpha7-nAChRs is necessary for proper maturation, synaptic integration, and survival of adultborn neurons. Nicotine exposure at levels relevant for human smokers acts through the same receptor to kill young adultborn neurons, and increase survival of the more mature population. Independent of effects on survival, nicotine enhances dendritic growth and spine formation of adultborn neurons. DMXBA, a partial alpha7-nAChR agonist, can be used to increase dendritic growth without eliciting detrimental effects on survival. These results demonstrate a profound role for nAChR signaling in controlling the fate of adultborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus

Proton NMR Studies of the Interaction of Heparin-Derived Oligosaccharide with Biological Molecules and the Cis/Trans Isomerization of Amide Bonds in Peptides and Peptide/Peptoid Hybrids
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONProton NMR Studies of the Interaction of Heparin-Derived Oligosaccharide with Biological Molecules and the Cis/Trans Isomerization of Amide Bonds in Peptides and Peptide/Peptoid HybridsByKhanh Trong NguyenDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, March 2009Professor Dallas L. Rabenstein, Chairperson	Two diverse topics in biological chemistry are the subject of this dissertation. In part I, the research focuses on heparin and the interaction of histidine-containing peptides with heparin. Heparin is a linear polysaccharide, which is formed through the linkage of variously sulfated uronic acid-(1&#61614;4)-D-glucosamine repeating disaccharide subunits by glycosidic bonds. The structure of heparin is not yet completely understood due to its extreme complexity. Consequently, details of the binding of peptides and proteins by heparin is not well understood. One approach is to use well-defined heparin-derived oligosaccharides with different structures as models to probe the question of specificity of binding.Three heparin-derived tetrasaccharides, one hexasaccharide and one octasaccharide were isolated, purified and characterized. A structurally defined tetrasaccharide was then used as a model to study heparin binding by histidine-containing peptides and related molecules. The imidazolium group of all the molecules studied was found to bind site specifically to a binding pocket formed by an iduronic acid-glucosamine-iduronic acid trisaccharide sequence. Binding constants were determined for the complexes by NMR. Binding constants and relative binding affinities were also determined for the binding of the same molecules by intact heparin by isothermal titration calorimetry and heparin affinity chromatography, respectively. In part II, the kinetics and thermodynamics of cis/trans isomerization of Xaa-sarcosine tertiary amide bonds in peptide/peptoid hybrids were studied. Xaa represents an amino acid and sarcosine is N-methyl glycine. Specifically, the affect of amino acid sequence on the kinetics and equilibria of cis/trans isomerization across Xaa-sarcosine peptide bonds in three series of peptide/peptoid hybrids having the sequences Ac-Cys-Sar-His-Xaa-(Ala)3-Cys-NH2, where Xaa is His, Gly, Lys, Phe, Asp and Glu, Ac-Cys-Sar-(Ala)x-His-(Ala)y-Cys-NH2, x = 0-4 and y = 4-0, and Ac-Cys-Sar-His-(Ala)3-Cys-NH2, Ac-Cys-His-Sar-(Ala)3-Cys-NH2, etc., were studied. The populations of the cis and trans isomers and the kinetics of cis/trans interconversion were found to depend on the amino acid preceding sarcosine.The kinetics and equilibria of cis/trans isomerization across the Xaa-Xaa secondary amide bonds in a series of peptides of the sequence Ac-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His-NH2, where Xaa is Ala, Tyr and Phe, were also studied. These peptides were studied as model peptides for oxido-reductase enzymes with the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motif. The effects of the type and position of the central Xaa residues on the kinetics and equilibria of cis/trans isomerization were examined. Rate and equilibrium constants for cis/trans isomerization together with thermodynamic parameters were determined for all the peptides and peptide/peptoid hybrids studied in both their dithiol and disulfide forms. Rate constants for interconversion between the cis and trans configurational isomers were determined by inversion-magnetization transfer NMR methods and equilibrium constants for the cis/trans isomerization were determined from resonance intensities.

Myostatin genetic inactivation inhibits myogenesis by muscle derived stem cells in vitro but not when implanted in the mdx mouse muscle
Abstract
Introduction
Stimulating the commitment of implanted dystrophin+ muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) into myogenic, as opposed to lipofibrogenic lineages, is a promising therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Methods
To examine whether counteracting myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass and a pro-lipofibrotic factor, would help this process, we compared the in vitro myogenic and fibrogenic capacity of MDSCs from wild-type (WT) and myostatin knockout (Mst KO) mice under various modulators, the expression of key stem cell and myogenic genes, and the capacity of these MDSCs to repair the injured gastrocnemius in aged dystrophic mdx mice with exacerbated lipofibrosis.

Results
Surprisingly, the potent in vitro myotube formation by WT MDSCs was refractory to modulators of myostatin expression or activity, and the Mst KO MDSCs failed to form myotubes under various conditions, despite both MDSC expressing Oct 4 and various stem cell genes and differentiating into nonmyogenic lineages. The genetic inactivation of myostatin in MDSCs was associated with silencing of critical genes for early myogenesis (Actc1, Acta1, and MyoD). WT MDSCs implanted into the injured gastrocnemius of aged mdx mice significantly improved myofiber repair and reduced fat deposition and, to a lesser extent, fibrosis. In contrast to their in vitro behavior, Mst KO MDSCs in vivo also significantly improved myofiber repair, but had few effects on lipofibrotic degeneration.

Conclusions
Although WT MDSCs are very myogenic in culture and stimulate muscle repair after injury in the aged mdx mouse, myostatin genetic inactivation blocks myotube formation in vitro, but the myogenic capacity is recovered in vivo under the influence of the myostatin+ host-tissue environment, presumably by reactivation of key genes originally silenced in the Mst KO MDSCs.

Microglial and neuronal abnormalities in the autistic brain
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of social cognition that is marked by frontally pronounced early brain overgrowth. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the regions of the brain that display the greatest overgrowth early in life, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, also demonstrate significant deficits in older children and adults with the disorder. However, there is relatively little information about the cellular abnormalities that underlie these observed macrostructural and functional alterations. A single study has directly observed altered glial morphology in the postmortem autistic frontal cortex, while a handful of studies have observed neuron loss in older subjects with autism. Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments aimed at elucidating both population and organizational abnormalities in the microglial and neuronal populations in the autistic dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In chapter II of this thesis, we use optical disector and isotropic nucleator to describe Iba-1 positive microglial density and volume in an unprecedentedly large sample of postmortem autism tissue. Our findings indicate that increased density and somal volume are present in a sizeable fraction of subjects with autism from an early age, including during the period of early brain overgrowth, and that these alterations are not attributable to seizure. In chapter III, we turn to an examination of average horizontal neuron distance in the same set of subjects. We describe an increase in horizontal neuronal spacing early in life that likely reflects an early overproduction of neuropil, while confirming previous findings of reduced horizontal distance in adults, suggesting a gradual degenerative decline. In chapter IV, we turn to spatial pattern analysis to examine whether there are alterations in neuronal and microglial organization. We discover emergent alterations in local neuron-neuron and microglia-microglia organization across the autistic lifespan, along with group differences in local microglia-neuron clustering that do not show a developmental trend. These experiments describe several novel microstructural features of the developing autistic brain, and suggest that microglial activation and neuropil overproduction are present during early brain overgrowth and are followed by gradual neuropil degeneration and loss of cellular organization in adolescents and adults that may be related at least in part to ongoing microglial activation. Further investigation of cellular and microstructural abnormalities in the autistic brain may hold the key to understanding the complex set of alterations that underlie this disorder, and point the way towards diagnostic strategies and therapeutic instruments

A signaling pathway mediating wound healing responses
The goal of tissue repair is to restore the protective barrier function of the skin upon injuries or microorganism infection, and the process relies on a tightly orchestrated system of signaling pathways. The expression of caspase-8, an essential factor in apoptotic signaling cascade, has been reported to play a crucial role mediating wound healing responses. The downregulation of caspase-8 in epidermis recapitulates inflammation and proliferation caused by wounding. Immune cell recruitment and epidermal hyperproliferation cumulatively instigate the expansion of caspase-8 null epidermis. This phenomenon is triggered by the paracrine signaling of interleukin-1 alpha. The secretion of IL-1 alpha is induced by NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a multiprotein complex coordinating the innate immune system. The assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome is the key step for immediate response of inflammation, but the mechanism mediating caspase-1, which is the critical component of NLRP3 inflammasome, is still a mystery. Here we demonstrate that the increased expression of pro-caspase-1 in wound repair process is the limiting factor to coordinate cutaneous inflammation and skin stem cell proliferation regulated by IL-1 alpha, and pro-caspase-1 is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB). Inhibition of NFkappaB significantly reduces the increased pro-caspase -1 and also prevents the release of IL-1 alpha in caspase-8 knockout and wounded skin. Next we investigated what the primary clue is to initiate the NFkappaB- caspase-1 pathway. Interestingly, we unveiled that the organization of microtubule is involved in the activation of NFkappaB, and caspase-8 colocalizes with microtubule filaments in primary keratinocytes. Furthermore, the disorganized microtubule cooresponding to the downregulation of caspase-8 induces the elevation of pro- caspase-1, and stabilization of microtubule in caspase-8 null epidermis inhibits the secretion of IL-1 alpha. Our findings reveal the intricate mechanism regulating inflammation and proliferation by caspase-8 during tissue regeneration, and it provides insights into the cause and the molecular therapy of many inflammatory disorders and cancer

Assessing the Response of <italic>Leptospira licerasiae</italic> serovar Varillal  to Fresh and Brackish Waters Using Propidium Monoazide and qPCR (PMA-qPCR)
The mechanisms by which pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> survive in the environment are poorly understood, in part due to limitations in current methodologies available to assess bacterial viability. The importance of environmental reservoirs in the transmission dynamics of leptospirosis has been difficult to establish without a mechanistic understanding of persistence. In this paper, a new method for assessing leptospiral viability is presented, and then applied to determine the salinities at which <italic>Leptospira</italic> can survive in the environment. Viable and heat-killed <italic>Leptospira</italic> were enumerated using a common dye agent, propidium monoazide (PMA), that is known for its effectiveness at removing dead bacterial DNA from qPCR amplification. Characterization of the toxicity and removal efficiency of one treatment cycle of 50 &mu;M PMA showed moderately toxic effects on samples at 25&deg;C compared to untreated samples, and equivalent removal of dead bacterial DNA at 4&deg;C, 25&deg;C, 30&deg;C, and 37&deg;C. Two treatment cycles at 50 &mu;M PMA resulted in the detection of as few as 100 viable cells in 1.0 &times; 10<super>5</super> dead cells in a 490 &mu;L sample. Comparing PMA-qPCR to traditional qPCR, PMA-qPCR detected 5 orders of magnitude fewer dead cells in samples of heat-killed cells. Motivated by leptospirosis epizootics in marine species, PMA-qPCR was applied to study the persistence of <italic>Leptospira</italic> in fresh and brackish water microcosms. An initial concentration of 9.93 &times; 10<super>6</super> cells/ml of model species <italic>Leptospira licerasiae</italic> serovar Varillal spiked into freshwater (0 ppt), low brackish (10 ppt), and high brackish (18 ppt) microcosms showed abundance of over 1.0 &times; 10<super>4</super> cells/ml at 22 days. The abundance seen in the brackish microcosms may be due to biofilm formation in <italic>Leptospira</italic>, or to the expression of genes shared by <italic>Leptospira licerasiae</italic> serovar Varillal with either of its related pathogenic or saprophytic cousins. PMA-qPCR provides a rapid, inexpensive, and efficient method for leptospiral investigation that will assist in answering critical questions about persistence and transmission of the pathogen within the environment.

Increased burst size in multiply infected cells can alter basic 
virus dynamics
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The dynamics of viral infections have been studied extensively in a variety of settings, both experimentally and with mathematical models. The majority of mathematical models assumes that only one virus can infect a given cell at a time. It is, however, clear that especially in the context of high viral load, cells can become infected with multiple copies of a virus, a process called coinfection. This has been best demonstrated experimentally for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), although it is thought to be equally relevant for a number of other viral infections. In a previously explored mathematical model, the viral output from an infected cell does not depend on the number of viruses that reside in the cell, i.e. viral replication is limited by cellular rather than viral factors. In this case, basic virus dynamics properties are not altered by coinfection.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Here, we explore the alternative assumption that multiply infected cells are characterized by an increased burst size and find that this can fundamentally alter model predictions. Under this scenario, establishment of infection may not be solely determined by the basic reproductive ratio of the virus, but can depend on the initial virus load. Upon infection, the virus population need not follow straight exponential growth. Instead, the exponential rate of growth can increase over time as virus load becomes larger. Moreover, the model suggests that the ability of anti-viral drugs to suppress the virus population can depend on the virus load upon initiation of therapy. This is because more coinfected cells, which produce more virus, are present at higher virus loads. Hence, the degree of drug resistance is not only determined by the viral genotype, but also by the prevalence of coinfected cells.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our work shows how an increased burst size in multiply infected cells can alter basic infection dynamics. This forms the basis for future experimental testing of model assumptions and predictions that can distinguish between the different scenarios.

A novel invertebrate chordate model for Alzheimer's disease using the ascidian ciona intestinalis
Research to understand Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis has involved the use of model systems to reproduce various aspects of the disease process, particularly the coordinated processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by alpha-, beta-, and gamma- secretases to generate amyloid beta (Abeta)-containing plaques, a process termed the amyloid hypothesis of AD. In recent years, a variety of invertebrate systems including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have been exploited to study the pathogenesis of AD but it is not clear as to whether lower invertebrate species can provide a direct comparison in understanding human neurological diseases. Additionally, the absence of a functional Abeta sequence and lack of equivalent beta- secretases in current invertebrate models have limited efforts in studying the amyloid hypothesis in vivo. As invertebrate chordates belonging to the subphylum Urochordata, the closest living sister group of vertebrates, the ascidian system will complement current AD research models by providing the experimental advantages of invertebrates in a chordate body plan. Here, we describe the generation of an ascidian model to study various aspects of the amyloid hypothesis including APP processing, Abeta plaque formation, and Abeta- mediated neurotoxicity. In transgenic ascidian larvae that express human APP695 (hAPP695) alone, Abeta peptides are produced that can aggregate to form Abeta-containing plaques detectable within 23 hours post fertilization. In support for conservation of the APP processing cascade, familial AD-associated mutations in hAPP695 result in a significant increase in plaque formation in vivo. Furthermore, co-expression with ascidian CiBace leads to increased amyloid deposition indicating that ascidians possess a functional beta-secretase orthologue, a finding unique among other invertebrates. Nervous system- specific expression of the processed Abeta peptide causes observable alterations in neuromuscular functioning and larval behavior, indicative by a reduction in the frequency of tail twitching and the ability to respond to light respectively. Importantly, the treatment of our AD ascidian model with an inhibitor of amyloid aggregation reduces plaque load and improves both neuromuscular function and the phototactic response. Overall, this study introduces the ascidian as an animal model that rapidly exhibits AD-like pathologies and provides the framework for understanding and possibly treating this disease and other neurological disorders

Thermal degradation of the performance of elastomeric bearings for seismic isolation
Concern about reliability of elastomeric bearings is increasing along with the rapid development in application of such devices. Studies on experimental and in-service bearings have revealed the occurrence of permanent and transient changes in engineering properties of these devices. This property loss, however, varies in quality and magnitude, depending on service or environmental conditions at which bearings are employed. Knowledge about the magnitude of the lost property and the rate of degradation is critical for the safe performance of the isolated structure. Availability of such measures helps avoid unnecessary cost and service interruptions of bridge structures by optimizing monitoring and maintenance activities. It is necessary to identify the service and environmental conditions contributing in such degradation phenomenon. A literature review does not indicate the availability of complete and comprehensive studies on this topic. The focus of this research study is to identify and quantify property loss of elastomeric bearings, particularly due to heat, when they are subjected to cyclic lateral load under different environmental conditions. This research also proposes a methodology for a precise and accurate prediction of the temperature profile within the body of an elastomeric bearing. This methodology can be incorporated with the existing numerical models to assess the adequacy of performance of such bearings through seismic events. The reversible changes in characteristics of lead plugs, which take place mainly due to heat, were found to represent the main sources of transient changes in characteristics of an elastomeric bearing. Elastomeric bearings are also subjected to irreversible degradations such as stiffening of bearings as a result of hardening of rubber as when they are exposed to high temperature. High temperature is the result of generation of heat through hysteresis action of lead plugs

Simultaneous scattering from electron-plasma waves and ion -acoustic waves is used to measure local laser-produced plasma parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution including electron temperature and density, average charge state, plasma flow velocity, and ion temperature. In addition, the first measurements of relativistic modifications in the collective Thomson scattering spectrum from thermal electron-plasma fluctuations are presented 1. Due to the high phase velocity of electron- plasma fluctuations, relativistic effects are important even at low electron temperatures (T/e < 1 keV). These effects have been observed experimentally and agree well with a relativistic treatment of the Thomson scattering form factor 2. The results are important for the interpretation of scattering measurements from laser produced plasmas. Thomson scattering measurements are used to characterize the hydrodynamics of a gas jet plasma which is the foundation for a broad series of laser-plasma interaction studies 3, 4, 5, 6. The temporal evolution of the electron temperature, density and ion temperature are measured. The measured electron density evolution shows excellent agreement with a simple adiabatic expansion model. The effects of high temperatures on coupling to hohlraum targets is discussed 7. A peak electron temperature of 12 keV at a density of 4.7 x 10²⁰ cm⁻³ are measured 200 mum outside the laser entrance hole using a two-color Thomson scattering method we developed in gas jet plasmas8. These measurements are used to assess laser-plasma interactions that reduce laser hohlraum coupling and can significantly reduce the hohlraum radiation temperature

Teleseismic Imaging of the Crust and Upper Mantle in the Western United States
High-resolution seismic images of lithospheric structures allow us to infer the tectonics that modified the lithosphere. We apply such methods to understand Cenozoic modification of the lithosphere by tectonic and magmatic processes in the tectonically active western United States. Using USArray Transportable and Flexible Array data, we present high-resolution images for three regions in this thesis. (1) In the Mendocino triple junction, we use a joint inversion of Rayleigh-wave dispersion data and receiver functions to obtain a new crust and upper Vs model to ~150km depth. The model shows four distinct, young lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary systems. A low-Vs anomaly beneath the Great Valley-Sierra Nevada reconciles existing slab window models with the mantle-wedge geochemical signatures in Coast Range volcanics, and explains the ~3 Myr delay of the onset of volcanism after slab removal. Uppermost mantle low velocities provide evidence for forearc mantle serpentinization extending along the Cascadia margin. (2) In the Colorado Plateau, a Rayleigh wave tomography model sheds light on the volcanism along the margins and plateau uplift. Strong upper mantle heterogeneity across the plateau edge results from the combined effect of a ~200-400 K temperature difference and ~1% partial melt. A ring of low velocities under the plateau periphery suggests that the rehydrated Proterozoic lithosphere is progressively removed by convective processes. Particularly, a high-Vs anomaly imaged beneath the western plateau adds evidence for a downwelling/delamination hypothesis Levander et al., 2011. Thermo-chemical edge-driven convection causing localized lithospheric downwelling provides uplift along the margins and magmatic encroachment into the plateau center. (3) In the final study, we developed a 3-D teleseismic scattering wave imaging technique based on the Kirchhoff approximation and 3-D inverse Generalized Radon Transform. Synthetic tests demonstrate higher resolution imaging for continuous, irregular interfaces or localized scatterers, in comparison to conventional methods. Applied to the High Lava Plains dataset, the transmission coefficient structure shows a deepening Moho near 117.6°W and three negative events that correlate well with the Rayleigh wave low-Vs zones. Images made with the Mendocino data clearly show rapidly decreasing lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary depths from the subduction to transform regime.

The Mechanisms of Monocyte Recruitment by Graft Endothelium in Response to HLA I Antibody Binding
Successful organ transplantation is challenged by the recipient's immune responses against the donor's polymorphic HLA molecules. The humoral response produces antibodies against mismatched HLA class I and class II molecules, which have a significant negative impact on long-term graft survival. Antibody-mediated rejection is characterized by intragraft macrophages, which may be elicited by HLA I antibody-induced endothelial cell activation. Given that the presence of intragraft macrophages significantly correlates with poor graft outcome, we investigated the mechanisms of HLA I antibody leading to recruitment of monocytes by endothelial cells, to determine effective therapeutic strategies to reduce infiltration into the graft. First, we determined the effect of endothelial cell activation by crosslinking of HLA I. Using an in vitro system with human endothelial cells stimulated with murine monoclonal HLA I antibodies, we found that HLA I ligation triggers endothelial exocytosis via calcium signaling, leading to increased cell surface P-selectin, which was required for increased monocyte adherence. We confirmed these results using an in vivo murine model of antibody-mediated rejection, where monocyte infiltration was significantly increased in allografts treated with donor specific MHC I antibodies. Macrophage accumulation in the graft could be prevented by therapy with the P-selectin antagonist rPSGL-1. Next, we explored the contribution of antibody-Fc receptor interactions to recruitment. Adhesion was stimulated by HLA I antibodies through P-selectin, irrespective of the isotype of HLA I antibody. Further, HLA I antibodies of an isotype with a high affinity for human Fc receptors elicited significantly more monocyte binding, and predominantly utilized FcgRI. Firm adherence to ICAM-1 on the endothelium required monocyte Mac-1 but not LFA-1. Finally, we investigated the activation of monocytes to a pro-adhesive state. Monocytes required intact calcium, Src and PI3 kinase signaling to adhere to HLA I antibody-treated endothelial cells, but not Rho kinase. Crosslinking of the P-selectin receptor PSGL-1, or of Fc receptors, triggered stable adhesion to ICAM-1. Deposition of low titer HLA I antibody on cytokine-activated endothelial cells enhanced monocyte binding, likely due to antibody-Fc receptor interactions. To conclude, we have elucidated the mechanisms of how HLA I antibody binding to endothelium promotes monocyte recruitment.

Mesoscale Eddies in the Gulf of Alaska: Observations and Implications
Mesoscale eddies in the Gulf of Alaska are thought to contribute to the shelf-slope exchange of nutrients and plankton, enhancing biological production. We report on a study of two anticyclonic mesoscale eddies in this region observed through in situ sampling during August and September 2007. Both eddies exhibited in their cores theta-S profiles with warmer, fresher water relative to the properties of the ambient basin water between 150 and 300 m depth. Hydrographic properties and satellite altimetry data were analyzed to identify likely formation regions for each feature. One eddy, sampled near Yakutat, Alaska, originated in the Sitka formation region (221-223&deg; E); the second eddy, sampled south of Kodiak Island, originated near the Kenai Peninsula, southeast of the Kennedy and Stevenson entrances to Cook Inlet &mdash; an area not previously studied as a formation region. Subsequent analysis of 16 years of satellite altimeter data (from 1992 to 2008) with an algorithm designed to identify and track eddies revealed approximately 6 Kenai eddies that have formed in this region. Although this number constitutes only 3.2% of the 188 eddies identified by the algorithm during this period, it represents 15.4% of the 39 eddies that formed in or propagated westward into the Alaskan Stream.

Engineering the Intracellular Micro- and Nano-environment via Magnetic Nanoparticles
Single cells, despite being the base unit of living organisms, possess a high degree of hierarchical structure and functional compartmentalization. This complexity exists for good reason: cells must respond efficiently and effectively to its surrounding environment by differentiating, moving, interacting, and more in order to survive or inhabit its role in the larger biological system. At the core of these responses is cellular decision-making. Cells process cues internally and externally from the environment and effect intracellular asymmetry in biochemistry and structure in order to carry out the proper biological responses. Functionalized magnetic particles have shown to be a powerful tool in interacting with biological matter, through either cell or biomolecule sorting, and the activation of biological processes. This dissertation reports on techniques utilizing manipulated magnetic nanoparticles (internalized by cells) to spatially and temporally localize intracellular cues, and examines the resulting asymmetry in biological processes generated by our methods. We first examine patterned micromagnetic elements as a simple strategy of rapidly manipulating magnetic nanoparticles throughout the intracellular space. Silicon or silicon dioxide substrates form the base for electroplated NiFe rods, which are repeated at varying size and pitch. A planarizing resin, initially SU-8, is used as the substrate layer for cellular adhesion. We demonstrate that through the manipulations of a simple external magnet, these micro&ndash;fabricated substrates can mediate rapid (under 2 s) and precise (submicron), reversible translation of magnetic nanoparticles through cellular space. Seeding cells on substrates composed of these elements allows simultaneous control of ensembles of nanoparticles over thousands of cells at a time. We believe such substrates could form the basis of magnetically based tools for the activation of biological matter.We further utilize these strategies to generate user-controllable (time-varying and localizable), massively parallel forces on arrays of cells mediated by coalesced ensembles of magnetic nanoparticles. The above process is simplified and adapted for single cell analysis by precisely aligning fibronectin patterned cells to a single flanking micromagnet. The cells are loaded with magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticles, which are then localized to uniform positions at the internal edge of the cell membrane over huge arrays of cells using large external fields, allowing us to conduct composed studies on cellular response to force. By applying forces approaching the yield tension (5 nN / &mu; m) of single cells, we are able to generate highly coordinated responses in cellular behavior. We discover that increasing tension generates highly directed, PAK-dependent leading-edge type filopodia that increase in intensity with rising tension. In addition, we find that our generated forces can simulate cues created during cellular mitosis, as we are consistently able to generate significant (45 to 90 degree) biasing of the metaphase plate during cell division. Large sample size and rapid sample generation also allow us to analyze cells at an unprecedented rate &mdash; a single sample can simultaneously stimulate thousands of cells for high statistical accuracy in measurements. We believe these approaches have potential not just as a tool to study single-cell response, but as a means of cell control, potentially through modifying cell movement, division, or differentiation. More generally, once approaches to release nanoparticles from endosomes are implemented, the technique provides a platform to dynamically apply a range of localized stimuli arbitrarily within cells.   Through the bioconjugation of proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, or whole organelles a broad range of questions should be accessible concerning molecular localization and its importance in cell function.

Evaluating cell-free expression of human integral membrane proteins for structural studies by NMR spectroscopy
A significant amount of the genome codes for integral membrane proteins, and they are involved in various cellular interactions. However, three-dimensional structures of only a small fraction of human integral membrane proteins (hIMPs) have been determined due to insufficient levels of expression and solubilization. To overcome these problems, a cell-free expression system was used to express and evaluate 45 hIMPs. Expression levels measured using SDS-PAGE and Western blot indicated that 26 hIMPs showed good level of expression, while another 14 had fair levels of expression. To obtain solubilization information, a detergent screen was conducted using seven detergents. LMPG proved to be the most effective by completely solubilizing 39 hIMPs. To test for NMR suitability, ¹H¹⁵N-TROSY spectra were measured for 32 hIMPs - 13 hIMPs had good quality spectra, while another 9 had fair quality spectra. Based on the evaluation of the hIMPs, hIMP#9 was selected for structure determination. Each amino acid in its sequence was assigned to a peak in the TROSY spectra using the combinatorial dual-labeling strategy, selectively labeled NMR samples, and traditional sequential assignment. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data was used to calculate a preliminary structure of hIMP#9, which has three transmembrane helices. Further structural studies are still needed to obtain a higher resolution three-dimensional structure; however the assignment of the amino acid backbone provides information for future functional studies as well. The evaluation of the hIMPs serves as a good foundation for future structural or functional studies, which can lead to potential therapeutic or pharmaceutical developments

Systems analysis of human brain gene expression: mechanisms for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and common pathways with Alzheimer¿s disease
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) infection frequently results in neurocognitive impairment. While the cause remains unclear, recent gene expression studies have identified genes whose transcription is dysregulated in individuals with HIV-association neurocognitive disorder (HAND). However, the methods for interpretation of such data have lagged behind the technical advances allowing the decoding genetic material. Here, we employ systems biology methods novel to the field of NeuroAIDS to further interrogate extant transcriptome data derived from brains of HIV&#8201;+&#8201;patients in order to further elucidate the neuropathogenesis of HAND. Additionally, we compare these data to those derived from brains of individuals with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) in order to identify common pathways of neuropathogenesis.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					In Study 1, using data from three brain regions in 6 HIV-seronegative and 15 HIV&#8201;+&#8201;cases, we first employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to further explore transcriptome networks specific to HAND with HIV-encephalitis (HIVE) and HAND without HIVE. We then used a symptomatic approach, employing standard expression analysis and WGCNA to identify networks associated with neurocognitive impairment (NCI), regardless of HIVE or HAND diagnosis. Finally, we examined the association between the CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE) of antiretroviral regimens and brain transcriptome. In Study 2, we identified common gene networks associated with NCI in both HIV and AD by correlating gene expression with pre-mortem neurocognitive functioning.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Study 1: WGCNA largely corroborated findings from standard differential gene expression analyses, but also identified possible meta-networks composed of multiple gene ontology categories and oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Differential expression analysis identified hub genes highly correlated with NCI, including genes implicated in gliosis, inflammation, and dopaminergic tone. Enrichment analysis identified gene ontology categories that varied across the three brain regions, the most notable being downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial functioning. Finally, WGCNA identified dysregulated networks associated with NCI, including oligodendrocyte and mitochondrial functioning. Study 2: Common gene networks dysregulated in relation to NCI in AD and HIV included mitochondrial genes, whereas upregulation of various cancer-related genes was found.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					While under-powered, this study identified possible biologically-relevant networks correlated with NCI in HIV, and common networks shared with AD, opening new avenues for inquiry in the investigation of HAND neuropathogenesis. These results suggest that further interrogation of existing transcriptome data using systems biology methods can yield important information.

[state, pseudogap, frequency, oscillation, quantum, pocket, order, cuprate, fermi, surface]

Theory of Quantum Oscillations in Cuprate Superconductors
Cuprate supercoductors show pseudogap state below its transition temperature $T^*$. The pseudogap state is distinct from superconducting state(critical temperature $T_c < T^*$). Two states may coexist and superconductivity developes from the pseudogap state which can be explained by commensurate and incommensurate $d$-density wave ($d$DW) orders. Quantum oscillations help us to understand the pseudogap state. Hall coefficient, magnetization, conductance and specific heat oscillate as a function of external field in $Y Ba_2 Cu_3 O_{6+\delta}$ (YBCO), $Nd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4$ (NCCO) and other cuprates. The oscillation frequency $F$ is proportional to the area of closed-orbits in reconstructed Fermi surface. High magnetic field for quantum oscillation experiment suppresses superconductivity. Therefore, quantum oscillations measure reconstructed Fermi surface of pseudogap state.Electron-doped cuprate superconductor NCCO shows only hole pocket frequency peak. Experimental results can be explained by period-2 $d$DW order and white-noise disorder. Disorder in the system removes electron pocket frequency and adjusts the amount of magnetic breakdown effect corresponding to very high frequency. Period-8 density wave order can explain quantum oscillations in the pseudogap state of hole-doped $YBCO$. Only electron pocket frequency is observed. Period-8 $d$DW order generates small but many hole pockets in the reconstructed Fermi surface. Small hole pocket frequency is too slow to be observed.

Search for a Lorentz-violating sidereal signal with atmospheric neutrinos in IceCube
A search for sidereal modulation in the flux of atmospheric muon neutrinos in IceCube was performed. Such a signal could be an indication of Lorentz-violating physics. Neutrino oscillation models, derivable from extensions to the Standard Model, allow for neutrino oscillations that depend on the neutrino's direction of propagation. No such direction-dependent variation was found. A discrete Fourier transform method was used to constrain the Lorentz and CPT-violating coefficients in
one of these models. Due to the unique high energy reach of IceCube, it was possible to improve constraints on certain Lorentz-violating oscillations by three orders of magnitude with respect to limits set by other experiments.

Syntheses and Characterizations of Modified Nucleosides and Their Incorporation into Oligodeoxynucleotides

Both compounds can generate the same intermediate upon metabolic activation by cytochrome P450, which can then form mutagenic DNA adducts.  These adducts have been detected in the DNA of lung cancer patients.   One of the most persistent and abundant adduct that has been detected in several tissues of rats that have been treated with NNN, is O2-(pyridyloxobutyl)-thymidine (O2-POBdT).  N3-POBdT a new adduct that has never been detected in genomic DNA.  Chapter 2 of this dissertation reports on the syntheses of O2-POBdT and N3-POBdT and their incorporation into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) for conducting biological studies.	5-Hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (hmdC) is a modified nucleotide that has recently been detected genomic DNA.  Tet enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (mC) to generate hmdC.  Recently, it has been discovered that hmdC plays a crucial role in stem cell development.  Like hmdC, 5-formyl-dC (fdC) has also recently been detected in genomic DNA.  Its levels are lower than hmdC and its exact role remains to be determined.  Chapter 3 of this dissertation reports on the syntheses of hmdC and fdC and their incorporation into ODNs.	8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) is an oxidized lesion found in genomic DNA.  It is weakly mutagenic in vitro and in vivo, causing G&#8594;T transversions.  2'-Deoxyribonolactone (dL) is an oxidized abasic site found in damaged DNA.  If left unrepaired it can produce single- and double-strand breaks, and dL is also mutagenic.  Generation of the dL in short ONDs can be readily be accomplished from insertion of a precursor, 7-nitroindole, d(7-Ni), followed by UV irradiation.  Chapter 4 of this dissertation reports on the syntheses of 8-oxodG and d(7-Ni) and their incorporation into ODNs.

Posttranslational regulation of caveolin by small- ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins
In this dissertation, I identify the covalent modification of caveolin-3 with small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins and its interactions with components of the sumoylation machinery. Caveolins are the principal protein components of caveolae membrane microdomains and function as scaffolds that compartmentalize and regulate multiple signaling proteins, their downstream effectors and associated proteins. Caveolin-3 is a muscle-specific caveolin family member that is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac myocytes. Beta 1- and beta 2- adrenergic receptors (betaARs) use distinct pathways to regulate contraction in cardiac myocytes. Caveolar localization and interaction with caveolin-3 is required for signaling by the beta₂AR but not the beta₁AR. beta₂ARs and beta₁ARs also desensitize through distinct pathways in response to agonist stimulation. Evidence presented here suggests that sumoylation of caveolin-3 is involved in the regulation of agonist- induced desensitization of beta₂ARs. Sumoylation is a highly dynamic and reversible posttranslational modification that regulates substrates involved in many aspects of cellular function. SUMO E1, E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze the formation of covalent, isopeptide bonds with lysine side chains on target substrates while SUMO- specific proteases (SENPs) remove SUMO proteins from substrates. Experiments in this thesis show that caveolin- 3 is covalently modified by SUMO and poly-SUMO chains in multiple cell types. In vitro and in vivo sumoylation assays demonstrate that modification of caveolin-3 by poly -SUMO-3 chains is enhanced by co-expression of the SUMO E3 ligase PIASy in a dose-dependent manner. Co-expression of SENP1 or SENP2 dramatically reduced modification of caveolin-3 by SUMO-3. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the preferred site of sumoylation and create a sumoylation-deficient mutant to probe the biological function of SUMO modification. Co-expression of caveolin-3 or the sumoylation-deficient mutant with betaARs showed differential effects on the stability of beta₂AR, but not beta₁AR, expression levels in the presence of prolonged agonist stimulation. This effect on beta₂ARs was attenuated by the betaAR antagonist (-)-propranolol. Taken together, the data in this dissertation identify sumoylation as a novel mechanism for the regulation of caveolin and its interactions with its signaling partners, including effects on the agonist-induced desensitization of beta₂ARs

Comparative Analysis of Microbial Community Composition Throughout Three Perennially Ice-Covered Lake Systems in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica and its Relationship With Lake Geochemistry
The McMurdo Dry Valley lakes are the closest analog on Earth to extraterrestrial environments that may harbor life.  Phylogenetic analysis of its bacterial communities offers insight into the origins of life and its evolution.  In this study, we determined the bacterial community composition throughout the water column of the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes.  While these bacterial communities were largely stable on an inter-annual basis, the spatial patterns in bacterial diversity were strongly linked with physical and chemical gradients in the lakes, indicating that bacterial activity modulates ecosystem function in extreme environments.  Investigation of acetate and glucose utilizers in the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes imply that even minor components of the overall bacterial community may play important roles in the nutrient cycling of these lakes.

Throwing a wrench in the translational machinery : discovery of RNA ligands by fluorescence techniques
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are underexplored as targets for therapeutics. To date, drug research has focused primarily on protein targets. Inhibition of functional RNA is an alternative approach which can avoid some of the problems of resistance. A few RNAs of interest are the bacterial ribosome, HIV RRE and Tar, human thymidylate synthase mRNA, and the Hepatitis C Virus Internal Ribosome Entry Site. Fluorescently-modified oligoribonucleotides are a relatively cheap method of quickly determining changes in the structure of the RNA. During chemical synthesis, fluorescent modifications can be placed in virtually any position and used to report on local structural changes. This technique was applied to the ribosomal A-site, and expanded to encompass alternative fluorophores and RNA sites. To identify compounds bound to HCV IRES domain IIa, fluorescent and FRET-based constructs were designed. After screening a small compound library in these systems, several were identified as binding. A structure activity relationship based on one class of these binding compounds was determined for the IRES IIa. In order to study the chemical components of RNA binding affinity, fluorescent methods for identifying RNA ligands to two RNA targets were devised. Extension of an oligonucleotide construct based on the ribosomal A site allows monitoring of an additional ligand binding site. FRET-based distance measurements in a viral RNA allow discrimination between functional and nonfunctional conformations, and therefore can be used to identify compounds that stabilize a nonfunctional conformation

The Role of the Huntingtin N17 Domain and its Modifications in Modulating Protein-Protein Interactions and Huntington's Disease Pathogenesis
Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric deficits. Despite the discovery of the huntingtin (htt) gene more than 19 years ago, the biological function of normal and mutant huntingtin (Htt) protein still remain unclear in HD pathogenesis. We performed a spatiotemporal proteomic profiling of proteins co-immunoprecipitated with full-length Htt in BACHD and wildtype mouse brains to identify 747 Htt-interacting proteins that are highly enriched with known Htt interactors. In order to obtain an unbiased interpretation of this Htt interactome, we applied Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analyses (WGCNA) to define protein correlation relationships among the Htt interactors across 30 independent tissue (cortex, striatum, cerebellum), genotype (Wt vs BACHD), and age (2m vs 12m) conditions. The analysis established a verifiable rank of proteins based on their correlation strength with Htt, and also revealed the organization of Htt-interacting protein networks, with one such network containing Htt itself, 19 known Htt interactors, and 12 novel genetic modifiers of HD. Our study demonstrates a novel systems biology approach to interpret in vivo proteomic interactomes derived from complex tissues such as the brain, and the value of such an approach in illuminating known and novel molecular targets for HD. Recent studies suggest that the N-terminal 17 amino acids of Htt (N17 domain) immediately preceding the polyQ domain may constitute a critical domain for Htt function and HD pathogenesis. Biochemical characterization, proteomic profiling, and WGCNA network analysis of the full-length Htt interactomes from novel BAC transgenic mouse models of HD expressing human huntingtin with 97 glutamines, with 1) phosphomimetic Ser13 and Ser16 mutations (SD mice), 2) phosphoresisant Ser13 and Ser16 mutations (SA mice), and 3) deletion of Htt aa 2-16 (BACHD-&#8710;N17 mice) reveal critical insights into how this domain regulates Htt nuclear toxicity, protein aggregation, and protein-protein interactions.

Ellipsis reconsidered
I present an analysis of antecedent mismatch effects under ellipsis based on information structure, in which apparent syntactic parallelism effects are explained as a consequence of an information structural constraint requiring topic/comment parallelism for contrastive topics. Experimental findings in support of this hypothesis demonstrate first that the penalty associated with antecedent mismatch is greater in contrastive topic structures as compared to simple focus structures and next that mismatched contrastive topics show reduced acceptability in both ellipsis and non-ellipsis contexts. Online reading time results further support this hypothesis showing that mismatched antecedents induce disproportionately larger processing costs in contrastive topic structures as compared to simple focus structures, as evidenced by increased reading times in regions both preceding and following the ellipsis site. The findings that mismatched contrastive topics lead to reduced acceptability offline in the absence of ellipsis and that mismatched contrastive topics disrupt online processing prior to the ellipsis site are consistent with the hypothesis advanced in this thesis but pose a challenge to models which have instead attributed mismatch effects to special-purpose processes supporting antecedent reconstruction or repair

Coordinated Eph-ephrin signaling guides migration and axon targeting in the avian auditory system
AbstractBackgroundIn the avian sound localization circuit, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) projects bilaterally to nucleus laminaris (NL), with ipsilateral and contralateral NM axon branches directed to dorsal and ventral NL dendrites, respectively. We previously showed that the Eph receptor EphB2 is expressed in NL neuropil and NM axons during development. Here we tested whether EphB2 contributes to NM-NL circuit formation.ResultsWe found that misexpression of EphB2 in embryonic NM precursors significantly increased the number of axon targeting errors from NM to contralateral NL in a cell-autonomous manner when forward signaling was impaired. We also tested the effects of inhibiting forward signaling of different Eph receptor subclasses by injecting soluble unclustered Fc-fusion proteins at stages when NM axons are approaching their NL target. Again we found an increase in axon targeting errors compared to controls when forward signaling was impaired, an effect that was significantly increased when both Eph receptor subclasses were inhibited together. In addition to axon targeting errors, we also observed morphological abnormalities of the auditory nuclei when EphB2 forward signaling was increased by E2 transfection, and when Eph-ephrin forward signaling was inhibited by E6-E8 injection of Eph receptor fusion proteins.ConclusionsThese data suggest that EphB signaling has distinct functions in axon guidance and morphogenesis. The results provide evidence that multiple Eph receptors work synergistically in the formation of precise auditory circuitry.

               Coral reefs belong to the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems on our planet. Yet, they are under steady decline worldwide due to rising sea surface temperatures, disease, and pollution. Understanding the molecular impact of these stressors on different coral species is imperative in order to predict how coral populations will respond to this continued disturbance. The use of molecular tools such as microarrays has provided deep insight into the molecular stress response of corals. Here, we have performed comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH) with different coral species to an Acropora palmata microarray platform containing 13,546 cDNA clones in order to identify potentially rapidly evolving genes and to determine the suitability of existing microarray platforms for use in gene expression studies (via heterologous hybridization).

               Our results showed that the current microarray platform for A. palmata is able to provide biological relevant information for a wide variety of coral species covering both the complex clade as well the robust clade. Analysis of the fraction of highly diverged genes showed a significantly higher amount of genes without annotation corroborating previous findings that point towards a higher rate of divergence for taxonomically restricted genes. Among the genes with annotation, we found many mitochondrial genes to be highly diverged in M. faveolata when compared to A. palmata, while the majority of nuclear encoded genes maintained an average divergence rate.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               The use of present microarray platforms for transcriptional analyses in different coral species will greatly enhance the understanding of the molecular basis of stress and health and highlight evolutionary differences between scleractinian coral species. On a genomic basis, we show that cDNA arrays can be used to identify patterns of divergence. Mitochondrion-encoded genes seem to have diverged faster than nuclear encoded genes in robust corals. Accordingly, this needs to be taken into account when using mitochondrial markers for scleractinian phylogenies.

Characterization of the short-term oxygen sensor signal response
Recent advances in biosensor technology resulted in the development of biosensors that can be implanted in living tissue for prolonged periods of time to monitor concentration of oxygen, glucose, and other metabolites. The implanted sensors function by electrochemical consumption of the metabolite producing continuous current signal that is proportional to blood metabolite concentration. Despite these advances, precise correlation of the sensor signal to the metabolite concentration still remains to be a challenge. Tissue signals are often contaminated by local fluctuations in metabolite concentration and no efficient algorithm that allows for characterization and removal of the signal noise has been developed. Characterization of the different types of variations observed in the in vivo tissue signals would be of tremendous value not only for implanted sensors, but also to stem cell implants, b-cell islet constructs and for various other tissue engineered cellular devices. The objective of this project was to design an algorithm that correlates the in vivo short-term oxygen sensor signal response to the blood oxygen levels. In vivo oxygen signals were pre-acquired from sensors implanted in hamster and pig animal models. Using these signals, we first identified and classified various fluctuations observed within the oxygen signals. The signal variations were classified as biological or non- biological based on a review of the physiological ranges of oxygen fluctuation within tissue. Next, a filtering algorithm was designed to specifically remove the non- biological signal features from the oxygen signal to prevent the signal analysis from being distorted and contaminated by the these unwanted features. Finally, digital and statistical signal processing, and time series analysis methods were used to characterize the filtered oxygen signal. The power spectrums of the filtered oxygen signals were estimated, and interestingly, an oscillatory pattern was identified that supports a fundamental frequency of 10 +/- 5 mHz for arteriolar vasomotion within the tissue. Correlation analysis revealed periodic cycles of regional tissue oxygen perfusion ranging from 0.29 to 2.1 mHz. The signals were also analyzed using continuous wavelet transforms, and the short-term oxygen signals were determined to be both stationary and non-stationary. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the short- term oxygen signals are composites of many different types of biological variations which occur at different time intervals within the tissue. Significantly, probability distribution analysis showed that the oxygen signals collected from the same sensor array share the same non- Gaussian probability distribution properties. Using these characterizations, the effect of the local heterogeneous tissue environment can be removed from the short-term in vivo oxygen signals creating an oxygen signal representative of the global blood oxygen environment. Therefore, the design of an algorithm to characterize the tissue sensor signal variations is extremely valuable and will ultimately lead to design of highly accurate implantable metabolite tissue sensors

Silicon infrared photodetector using sub-bandgap transitions
This dissertation details the use of silicon as near- infrared photodetectors based on two different optical sub -bandgap transition mechanisms: band to surface state transition and band to sub-bandgap transition. For maximizing these effects and realizing ultra-high resolution imager arrays, a vertical nanowire structure is used. Nanoimprinting Lithography (NIL) is used to practically obtain nano-scaled patterns on a large area. In the case of band to surface state transitions, vertical silicon nanowire arrays have been fabricated through the use of UV NIL and conventional etching technology. They have an ability to detect pico watts level of light per nanowire at 1550nm IR light and a femto watt level at 635nm visible light. Their broad band detection spectrum and high sensitivity arise from the high surface to volume ratio. The high surface to volume ratio induces a built-in field in the radial direction, which confines the carriers in the core of the wire and substantially increases the lifetime of the confined carriers. These effects allow us to obtain a responsivity of 100A/W per nanowire to 1550nm light at 170K. Measurement results of our silicon nanowire arrays also show the limitation for the application of commercial products due to the high dark current at room temperature and the surface state uncertainty. Thus, we propose a core shell structure which frees the device characteristics from surface state effects while enormously enhancing the gain and reducing the dark current. IR detection in core shell nanowires can also occur by sub-bandgap transitions. To validate the core shell structure for the detection of IR wavelengths, the absorption coefficient model by sub-bandgap transition is proposed. To enhance absorption coefficients at IR wavelengths, the Franz-Keldysh effect, the spatial confinement effect, and the impurity state and quasi-2D state transition are considered in our physical model. To validate our proposed model, we also provide the method to measure the absorption coefficient value using a lossy medium model. The measured value is close to the simulation results, with an absorption coefficient of 10/ cm at 1480nm. These model and measurement results are very beneficial in designing high responsivity silicon IR detectors

Phylogenomics of strongylocentrotid sea urchins
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Strongylocentrotid sea urchins have a long tradition as model organisms for studying many fundamental processes in biology including fertilization, embryology, development and genome regulation but the phylogenetic relationships of the group remain largely unresolved. Although the differing isolating mechanisms of vicariance and rapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins have been proposed, a stable and robust phylogeny is unavailable.
				
				
					
						Results
					We used a phylogenomic approach with mitochondrial and nuclear genes taking advantage of the whole-genome sequencing of nine species in the group to establish a stable (i.e. concordance in tree topology among multiple lies of evidence) and robust (i.e. high nodal support) phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Strongylocentrotidae. We generated eight draft mitochondrial genome assemblies and obtained 13 complete mitochondrial genes for each species. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondrial sequences failed to provide a reliable phylogeny. In contrast, we obtained a very well-supported phylogeny from 2301 nuclear genes without evidence of positive Darwinian selection both from the majority of most-likely gene trees and the concatenated fourfold degenerate sites: ((P. depressus, (M. nudus, M. franciscanus), (H. pulcherrimus, (S. purpuratus, (S. fragilis, (S. pallidus, (S. droebachiensis, S. intermedius)). This phylogeny was consistent with a single invasion of deep-water environments followed by a holarctic expansion by Strongylocentrotus. Divergence times for each species estimated with reference to the divergence times between the two major clades of the group suggest a correspondence in the timing with the opening of the Bering Strait and the invasion of the holarctic regions.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Nuclear genome data contains phylogenetic signal informative for understanding the evolutionary history of this group. However, mitochondrial genome data does not. Vicariance can explain major patterns observed in the phylogeny. Other isolating mechanisms are appropriate to explore in this system to help explain divergence patterns not well supported by vicariance, such as the effects of rapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins on isolating populations. Our findings of a stable and robust phylogeny, with the increase in mitochondrial and nuclear comparative genomic data, provide a system in which we can enhance our understanding of molecular evolution and adaptation in this group of sea urchins.

[growth, nanowire, nus, mechanism, crystal, phase]

Nanostructured magnetic materials
A series of four distinct growth phases of nanostructured Ni have been demonstrated in a chemical vapor deposition process. Controlled isolation of these four distinct growth phases has been made possible through a thorough understanding of the relevant growth mechanisms and the corresponding experimental growth parameters. The growth phases include core-shell structured Ni-NiO nanowires, horizontally oriented nanowires, vertically oriented nanowires, and fully isometric cubic crystals of Ni all obtained upon an amorphous SiO₂IISi growth substrate from a single metal-halide precursor. Transmission electron microscopy indicates the horizontally- and vertically- oriented nanowire products to be high quality single- crystals with a preferred growth axis along the <001> direction while the Ni-NiO core-shell nanowires are polycrystalline metal at the center and surrounded by an outer oxide. The differing crystal structures are reflected in the magnetic response of each NW type as evidenced by magntoresistance measurements. The general mechanism responsible for achievement of vertically oriented Ni nanowires involves the introduction of trace Si amounts prior to appreciable Ni deposition. Evidence suggests the Si acts as a sink for Ni adatoms upon the substrate surface and in turn dictates a single point with high Ni crystallization rate. When crystal growth is mediated by the Si/Ni system and proceeds at an adequate rate such a site becomes the source of growth anisotropy resulting in high aspect ratio nanowire structures. As growth parameters are tuned to alter behavior such as adatom flux, diffusion length, and arrival order transitions in the overall growth behavior take place. In this way the four growth phases outlined above can be obtained in isolation of one another. Detailed discussion of the formation mechanisms leading to each of the four nanostructured Ni products is presented. A general application of this non-epitaxial approach to forming metallic nanostructures of other transition-metals is possible since the mechanisms and processes discussed are generic and not material specific. The chemical vapor deposition of CoxNiy alloy nanowires, as well as CrxSiy nanowires with a vertical orientation will be presented as both a confirmation of the general nanowire formation mechanism proposed and also as a demonstration of the flexibility of the technique

Sifting through genomes with iterative-sequence clustering produces a large, phylogenetically diverse protein-family resource
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					New computational resources are needed to manage the increasing volume of biological data from genome sequencing projects. One fundamental challenge is the ability to maintain a complete and current catalog of protein diversity. We developed a new approach for the identification of protein families that focuses on the rapid discovery of homologous protein sequences.
				
				
					
						Results
					We implemented fully automated and high-throughput procedures to de novo cluster proteins into families based upon global alignment similarity. Our approach employs an iterative clustering strategy in which homologs of known families are sifted out of the search for new families. The resulting reduction in computational complexity enables us to rapidly identify novel protein families found in new genomes and to perform efficient, automated updates that keep pace with genome sequencing. We refer to protein families identified through this approach as &#8220;Sifting Families,&#8221; or SFams. Our analysis of ~10.5 million protein sequences from 2,928 genomes identified 436,360 SFams, many of which are not represented in other protein family databases. We validated the quality of SFam clustering through statistical as well as network topology&#8211;based analyses.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We describe the rapid identification of SFams and demonstrate how they can be used to annotate genomes and metagenomes. The SFam database catalogs protein-family quality metrics, multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, and phylogenetic trees. Our source code and database are publicly available and will be subject to frequent updates (http://edhar.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/sifting_families/).

Myeloid cells in tumor inflammation
Abstract
				Bone marrow derived myeloid cells progressively accumulate in tumors, where they establish an inflammatory microenvironment that is favorable for tumor growth and spread. These cells are comprised primarily of monocytic and granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) or tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are generally associated with a poor clinical outcome. MDSCs and TAMs promote tumor progression by stimulating immunosuppression, neovascularization, metastasis and resistance to anti-cancer therapy. Strategies to target the tumor-promoting functions of myeloid cells could provide substantial therapeutic benefit to cancer patients.

Interferon regulatory factor 8/interferon consensus sequence binding protein is a critical transcription factor for the physiological phenotype of microglia
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Recent fate-mapping studies establish that microglia, the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the CNS, are distinct in origin from the bone marrow-derived myeloid lineage. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8, also known as interferon consensus sequence binding protein) plays essential roles in development and function of the bone marrow-derived myeloid lineage. However, little is known about its roles in microglia.
				
				
					
						Methods
					The CNS tissues of IRF8-deficient mice were immunohistochemically analyzed. Pure microglia isolated from wild-type and IRF8-deficient mice were studied in vitro by proliferation, immunocytochemical and phagocytosis assays. Microglial response in vivo was compared between wild-type and IRF8-deficient mice in the cuprizon-induced demyelination model.
				
				
					
						Results
					Our analysis of IRF8-deficient mice revealed that, in contrast to compromised development of IRF8-deficient bone marrow myeloid lineage cells, development and colonization of microglia are not obviously affected by loss of IRF8. However, IRF8-deficient microglia demonstrate several defective phenotypes. In vivo, IRF8-deficient microglia have fewer elaborated processes with reduced expression of IBA1/AIF1 compared with wild-type microglia, suggesting a defective phenotype. IRF8-deficient microglia are significantly less proliferative in mixed glial cultures than wild-type microglia. Unlike IRF8-deficient bone marrow myeloid progenitors, exogenous macrophage colony stimulating factor (colony stimulating factor 1) (M-CSF (CSF1)) restores their proliferation in mixed glial cultures. In addition, IRF8-deficient microglia exhibit an exaggerated growth response to exogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (colony stimulating factor 2) (GM-CSF (CSF2)) in the presence of other glial cells. IRF8-deficient microglia also demonstrate altered cytokine expressions in response to interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide in vitro. Moreover, the maximum phagocytic capacity of IRF8-deficient microglia is reduced, although their engulfment of zymosan particles is not overtly impaired. Defective scavenging activity of IRF8-deficient microglia was further confirmed in vivo in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model in mice.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This study is the first to demonstrate the essential contribution of IRF8-mediated transcription to a broad range of microglial phenotype. Microglia are distinct from the bone marrow myeloid lineage with respect to their dependence on IRF8-mediated transcription.

Comparison of low and high dose ionising radiation using topological analysis of gene coexpression networks
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               The growing use of imaging procedures in medicine has raised concerns about exposure to low-dose ionising radiation (LDIR). While the disastrous effects of high dose ionising radiation (HDIR) is well documented, the detrimental effects of LDIR is not well understood and has been a topic of much debate. Since little is known about the effects of LDIR, various kinds of wet-lab and computational analyses are required to advance knowledge in this domain. In this paper we carry out an &#8220;upside-down pyramid&#8221; form of systems biology analysis of microarray data. We characterised the global genomic response following 10&#8201;cGy (low dose) and 100&#8201;cGy (high dose) doses of X-ray ionising radiation at four time points by analysing the topology of gene coexpression networks. This study includes a rich experimental design and state-of-the-art computational systems biology methods of analysis to study the differences in the transcriptional response of skin cells exposed to low and high doses of radiation.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Using this method we found important genes that have been linked to immune response, cell survival and apoptosis. Furthermore, we also were able to identify genes such as BRCA1, ABCA1, TNFRSF1B, MLLT11 that have been associated with various types of cancers. We were also able to detect many genes known to be associated with various medical conditions.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               Our method of applying network topological differences can aid in identifying the differences among similar (eg: radiation effect) yet very different biological conditions (eg: different dose and time) to generate testable hypotheses. This is the first study where a network level analysis was performed across two different radiation doses at various time points, thereby illustrating changes in the cellular response over time.

Time-Domain Terahertz Spectroscopy of Water
The dielectric spectrum of D<sub>2</sub>O between 15 GHz and 2 THz was measured using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy.  The motivation of this work is to gain an understanding of liquid water dynamics on a molecular level.  To achieve this, we use a correction to the dielectric response of polar molecules known as the reduced polarization.  This correction allows us to relate the macroscopic quantity of the permittivity to the microscopic correlation function in a manner appropriate for polar liquids.  Similar to previous studies on H<sub>2</sub>O, evidence is shown of correlated and anti-correlated dipole-dipole interactions in liquid D<sub>2</sub>O.  More interestingly, the spectra also reveal dynamics that could be intimately related to the density anomaly of water.

Whole genome sequencing of phage resistant Bacillus anthracis mutants reveals an essential role for cell surface anchoring protein CsaB in phage AP50c adsorption
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Spontaneous Bacillus anthracis mutants resistant to infection by phage AP50c (AP50R) exhibit a mucoid colony phenotype and secrete an extracellular matrix.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					Here we utilized a Roche/454-based whole genome sequencing approach to identify mutations that are candidates for conferring AP50c phage resistance, followed by genetic deletion and complementation studies to validate the whole genome sequence data and demonstrate that the implicated gene is necessary for AP50c phage infection.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Using whole genome sequence data, we mapped the relevant mutations in six AP50R strains to csaB. Eleven additional spontaneous mutants, isolated in two different genetic backgrounds, were screened by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the csaB gene. In each spontaneous mutant, we found either a non-synonymous substitution, a nonsense mutation, or a frame-shift mutation caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms or a 5 base pair insertion in csaB. All together, 5 and 12 of the 17 spontaneous mutations are predicted to yield altered full length and truncated CsaB proteins respectively. As expected from these results, a targeted deletion or frame-shift mutations introduced into csaB in a different genetic background, in a strain not exposed to AP50c, resulted in a phage resistant phenotype. Also, substitution of a highly conserved histidine residue with an alanine residue (H270A) in CsaB resulted in phage resistance, suggesting that a functional CsaB is necessary for phage sensitivity. Conversely, introduction of the wild type allele of csaB in cis into the csaB deletion mutant by homologous recombination or supplying the wild type CsaB protein in trans from a plasmid restored phage sensitivity. The csaB mutants accumulated cell wall material and appeared to have a defective S-layer, whereas these phenotypes were reverted in the complemented strains.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Taken together, these data suggest an essential role for csaB in AP50c phage infection, most likely in phage adsorption. (The whole genome sequences generated from this study have been submitted to GenBank under SRA project ID: SRA023659.1 and sample IDs: AP50 R1: SRS113675.1, AP50 R2: SRS113676.1, AP50 R3: SRS113728.1, AP50 R4: SRS113733.1, AP50 R6: SRS113734.1, JB220 Parent: SRS150209.1, JB220 Mutant: SRS150211.1).

Evolution of Male Coloration in The Wild: The Role of Sex Linkage and Selection
Male secondary sexual characters can be quite distinct, striking, and elaborate in nature. Despite many advances in the field of sexual selection, much remains to be known regarding why some organisms evolve these features more than others. Since Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, many studies have measured the strength of natural selection in the wild showing that it is often strong and rapid (Both and Visser 2001; Pelletier et al. 2007; Kinnison et al. 2008; reviews: Hendry and Kinnison 1999; Reznick and Ghalambor 2001; Stockwell et al. 2003; Strauss et al. 2008; reviews: Endler 1986; Kingsolver et al. 2001; Hairston Jr. et al. 2005). Despite all these examples, a recent review has shown that very few of the traits measured in these studies involve secondary selected traits (Svensson and Gosden 2007). This is unfortunate because secondary selected traits often represent the most complex, elaborate traits in a variety of taxa including plants (eg. Geber, Dawson, and Delph 1998), insects (ex. Stubblefield and Seger 1994), fish (eg. Basolo and Trainor 2002), birds (eg. Hill and McGraw 2006), and reptiles (eg. Schulte-Hostedde and Schank 2009). Moreover, the evolution of one these particular traits in nature, male guppy coloration, represents one of our best examples of rapid evolution (Endler 1980).   Adaptation requires both inheritance and selection, however most studies in rapid evolution either ignore heritability and concentrate on selective pressures or assume a particular mode of inheritance. Theoretical models have long established the importance of genetic architecture through sex linkage in sex-limited or sexually selected traits. However, empirical research in this topic is rare. In this thesis I present a comprehensive experimental study of how ecology and sex-linkage may interact to maintain the genetic variation and complex polymorphism in a sexually antagonistic, sex-limited trait in the wild.   First I use a standard multivariate animal model to evaluate the heritability of two sub-traits of male coloration known to be linked to male fitness; orange and black body coloration. I also partition phenotypic variance of two introduced populations of guppies Poecilia reticulata) into its environmental and genetic components. The genetic components are then further partitioned into Y-linked versus non Y-linked variance to test the idea that sexually selected male traits are generally linked to the Y-chromosome where evolution is presumed to be faster as established by theory. I also studied genetic correlations among the two color patterns, and use all findings to predict the future trend of evolutionary change in this novel introduction. Using a quantitative genetics approach in this manner can help extract the genetic parameters affecting evolutionary change, and to my knowledge is the first study that separates Y-linked from non Y-linked quantitative genetic variance using a wild pedigree. Results show high proportion of Y-linked to non-Y linked genetic variance and that overall variation in Y-linkage accounts for most of the phenotypic variation in both introduction sites. Both sub-traits are also highly heritable and so combined with the abrupt change in selection pressure with the introduction I predict evolutionary change to be rapid in these populations.    Second, following the results garnered in Chapter 1, here I track changes in adaptive divergence in both introduction sites bimonthly for one year post-introduction to see if our predictions were sound. My goal in this chapter was to investigate how variation in different selective pressures, such as predation and stream canopy cover, affect rates of divergence in a sexually selected polymorphic trait. Guppies were introduced from environments where they coexist with predators to two novel environments where there are no predators. In addition to the abrupt change in predation pressure, I also manipulated the canopy cover in one introduction site, hence doubling productivity in that environment. Results show rapid phenotypic and genotypic divergence in male coloration as expected, to date the fastest measure of change in wild guppies. Results also demonstrate that abrupt changes in habitat as well as predation-mediated mortality rates affect variation in rates of evolution of secondary sexual characters, an idea previously proposed but never formally tested.    In the third Chapter I test the idea that microgeographic variation in sex-linkage occurs in multiple high- versus low-predation guppy populations, the first step needed to test theory regarding interactions between sex-linkage and selection. I examine a hypothesis that high-predation guppies have mainly Y-linkage of color patterns whereas low-predation guppies have color patterns linked to both the X- and Y-chromosome. In my thesis chapter I examine multiple high- and low-predation natural population using hormone assays in female guppies (which normally do not show coloration, and do not have a Y-chromosome) to test for differences in X-/autosomal linkage. I presume that changes in the amount of non-Y linked inheritance are combined with changes in Y-linkage. I also examine three introduction populations (from high- introduced into low predation sites) to see if these differences in linkage relationship respond rapidly to selection pressure. Results show that indeed low-predation guppies show a significantly higher amount of non-Y linked color patterns compared to high-predation guppies, and that this variation in linkage relationship can evolve in a matter of few guppy generations.

The role of vinculin in mechanosensitive myogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells
Mechanical signals have been shown to have an essential role in regulating stem cell fate. Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation can be regulated by the stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), via the process of mechanotransduction, in which specific mechanosensors at focal adhesion (FA) convert mechanical cues into intracellular biochemical signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction still remain elusive. Vinculin is reported to be capable of undergoing conformational changes exposing a cryptic mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) binding site on the head domain of vinculin when subjected to physiological forces generated from myosin contraction, suggesting that vinculin, among other FA proteins, may be sensitive to physical ECM properties and thus able to relay information leading to regulation on stem cell differentiation by mechanotransduction. In this thesis, endogenous vinculin in hMSCs was knocked-down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), resulting in a 70% decrease in MyoD muscle differentiation marker expression after four days of growth on matrices with stiffness that mimics muscles (11kPa). Addition of full-length vinculin or just the head domain back into cells was shown to be able to restore MyoD expression; addition of the vinculin tail domain was not able to rescue myogenesis. Together the results suggest that the MAPK1 binding site on vinculin may be important for regulating myogenesis

Nitrogen fertilizer use in California: Assessing the data, trends and a way forward
Nitrogen fertilizer is an indispensable input to modern agriculture, but it also has been linked to environmental degradation and human health concerns. Recognition of these trade-offs has spurred debate over its use. However, data limitations and misinformation often constrain discussion, cooperative action and the development of solutions. To help inform the dialogue, we (1) evaluate existing data on nitrogen use, (2) estimate typical nitrogen fertilization rates for common crops, (3) analyze historical trends in nitrogen use, (4) compare typical nitrogen use to research-established guidelines and (5) identify cropping systems that have significant influence on the state’s nitrogen cycle. We conclude that a comprehensive grower self-monitoring system for nitrogen applications is required to improve nitrogen-use information and to better support evidence-based decision making. The discussion here presents a primer on the debate over nitrogen fertilizer use in California agriculture.

Biomimetic Electrostatics for Submerged Oceanic Sensing, Communication, and Coordination
Navigation, localization, and targeting while completely submerged in the ocean are all extremely difficult due to the lack of a proficient sensor. The highly conductive nature of salt-water results in severe radio-wave attenuation precluding the use of RADAR. Naturally occurring noise sources, high energy costs, long-wavelengths, and surface turbidity restrict the use of SONAR imaging to low resolutions, depths, and far fields. The ocean's dark, turbulent, and silty disposition impedes optical imaging.Nature knows another better way. Apteronotus Albifrons is a nocturnal oceanic fish that cannot rely upon optical notions of vision to navigate, hunt, or avoid predators. Instead, it relies upon an electroreceptive capability achieved through a dense grid of electric field (Voltage) sensors arrayed along both sides of the body and concentrated around the head. It emits an electric field into the water and senses the self-induced forces down its sides. Objects in the vicinity that differ in conductivity from the background ocean environment disturb the field, redistribute the current, and hence the spatial distribution of voltages measured by the fish.This dissertation chronicles the effort to produce an engineered sensor which mirrors the biological phenomenon of electroreception and demonstrate its ability to "visualize" targets with different conductivities from the background ocean environment at very high resolution by detecting perturbations in a quasi-static electric field (electrostatics). This culminates in the first Biomimetic Electrostatic Images (BEI) and demonstrates the potential of the technology to provide significant advances in underwater scientific enterprises, military applications, as well as in medicine.

Computer Simulation as a Tool to Enable Decision-Making in a Pandemic Influenza Response Scenario
Introduction: We sought to develop and test a computer-based, interactive simulation of a hypothetical pandemic influenza outbreak. Fidelity was enhanced with integrated video and branching decision trees, built upon the 2007 federal planning assumptions. We conducted a before-and-after study of the simulation effectiveness to assess the simulations’ ability to assess participants’ beliefs regarding their own hospitals’ mass casualty incident preparedness.
      
         Methods: Development: Using a Delphi process, we finalized a simulation that serves up a minimum of over 50 key decisions to 6 role-players on networked laptops in a conference area. The simulation played out an 8-week scenario, beginning with pre-incident decisions. Testing: Role-players and trainees (N=155) were facilitated to make decisions during the pandemic. Because decision responses vary, the simulation plays out differently, and a casualty counter quantifies hypothetical losses. The facilitator reviews and critiques key factors for casualty control, including effective communications, working with external organizations, development of internal policies and procedures, maintaining supplies and services, technical infrastructure support, public relations and training. Pre- and post-survey data were compared on trainees.
      
         Results: Post-simulation trainees indicated a greater likelihood of needing to improve their organization in terms of communications, mass casualty incident planning, public information and training. Participants also recognized which key factors required immediate attention at their own home facilities.
      
         Conclusion: The use of a computer-simulation was effective in providing a facilitated environment for determining the perception of preparedness, evaluating general preparedness concepts and introduced participants to critical decisions involved in handling a regional pandemic influenza surge.

Localization of lipoprotein lipase and GPIHBP1 in mouse pancreas: effects of diet and leptin deficiency
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins and enables uptake of lipolysis products for energy production or storage in tissues. Our aim was to study the localization of LPL and its endothelial anchoring protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) in mouse pancreas, and effects of diet and leptin deficiency on their expression patterns. For this, immunofluorescence microscopy was used on pancreatic tissue from C57BL/6 mouse embryos (E18), adult mice on normal or high-fat diet, and adult ob/ob-mice treated or not with leptin. The distribution of LPL and GPIHBP1 was compared to insulin, glucagon and CD31. Heparin injections were used to discriminate between intracellular and extracellular LPL.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					In the exocrine pancreas LPL was found in capillaries, and was mostly co-localized with GPIHBP1. LPL was releasable by heparin, indicating localization on cell surfaces. Within the islets, most of the LPL was associated with beta cells and could not be released by heparin, indicating that the enzyme remained mostly within cells. Staining for LPL was found also in the glucagon-producing alpha cells, both in embryos (E18) and in adult mice. Only small amounts of LPL were found together with GPIHBP1 within the capillaries of islets. Neither a high fat diet nor fasting/re-feeding markedly altered the distribution pattern of LPL or GPIHBP1 in mouse pancreas. Islets from ob/ob mice appeared completely deficient of LPL in the beta cells, while LPL-staining was normal in alpha cells and in the exocrine pancreas. Leptin treatment of ob/ob mice for 12 days reversed this pattern, so that most of the islets expressed LPL in beta cells.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					We conclude that both LPL and GPIHBP1 are present in mouse pancreas, and that LPL expression in beta cells is dependent on leptin.

The effects of past, present and future climate change on range-wide genetic diversity in northern North Atlantic marine species
It is now accepted that changes in the Earth’s climate are having a profound effect on the distributions of a wide variety of species. One aspect of these changes that has only recently received any attention, however, is their potential effect on levels of within-species genetic diversity. Theoretical, empirical and modelling studies suggest that the impact of trailing-edge population extirpation on range-wide intraspecific diversity will be most pronounced in species that harbour the majority of their genetic variation at low latitudes as a result of changes during the Quaternary glaciations. In the present review, I describe the historical factors that have determined current patterns of genetic variation across the ranges of Northern North Atlantic species, highlight the fact that the majority of these species do indeed harbour a disproportionate level of genetic diversity in rear-edge populations, and outline how combined species distribution modelling and genetic analyses can provide insights into the potential effects of climate change on their overall genetic diversity.

Application of Mass Spectrometry on Quantitative Proteomics and Histone Post-Translational Modifications
Mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with highly developed sample preparation and separation techniques, has served as one of the most powerful analytical technique. In this dissertation, we focus on the application of MS in two important areas, quantitative proteomics and protein post-translation modification (PTM) analysis. In Chapters 2 and 3, we report the use of mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in HL-60 and K562 cells that were untreated or treated with a clinically relevant concentration of arsenite or imatinib. Our results revealed that, among more than 1000 quantified proteins, 56 and 73 proteins including many important enzymes had significantly altered levels of expression by arsenite and imatinib treatment, respectively. With the down-stream pathway analysis, our results provided potential biomarkers for monitoring the therapeutic intervention of leukemia and offered important new knowledge for gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms of action of anti-cancer drugs.In Chapters 4 and 5, we obtained relatively comprehensive mappings of core histone post-translational modifications in two important model eukaryotic organisms, Neurospora crassa and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We used several mass spectrometric techniques, coupled with HPLC separation and multiple protease digestion, to identify the methylation, acetylation and phosphoration sites in core histones. Our analysis provides potentially comprehensive pictures of core histones PTMs, which serve as foundations for future studies on the function of histone PTMs in these organisms.In Chapter 6, we observed an unusual discrepancy between MALDI-MS/MS and ESI-MS/MS on the methylation of trimethyllysine-containing peptides. It turned out that the discrepancy could be attributed to an unusual methyl group migration from the side chain of trimethyllysine to the C-terminal arginine residue during peptide fragmentation. The results highlighted that caution should be exerted while MS/MS of singly charged ions is employed to interrogate the PTMs of trimethyllysine-containing peptides.

[cell, sall4, stem, pathway]

Functional analysis of Sall4 in modulating embryonic stem cell fate
Cell fate decisions of embryonic stem (ES) cells are dictated by repression and activation of lineage-specific genes. How are those regulators important in activating a stem cell to begin differentiating into a specific cell type regulated by the cellular and molecular signals? Understanding how these lineages arise during development will illuminate efforts to understand the establishment and maintenance of the stem cell state and the mechanisms that restrict stem cell potency. Sall4 has been reported to be part of the core transcriptional network in embryonic stem cells; however, how Sall4 regulates ES cell fate is still unknown. I utilized mass spectrometry to generate whole ES cell proteomes and phosphoproteomes of human and mouse ES cells. The whole cell proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis provides us a large repertoire of protein lists to unmask the regulatory elements in ES cells. Moreover, I generated a novel list of Sall4-binding proteins by modifying a previously established enrichment protocol. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using a synthetic crosslinker, DSP, to enrich for weak and transient Sall4 interacting protein complexes. Working with molecular weight cut-off columns, allows us to identify new Sall4 binding partners, leading to a better understanding of the regulatory machinery behind the self- renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. Pathway analysis indicates that Sall4-binding proteins are involved in Wnt signaling pathway, FGF signaling pathway, and p53 pathway. Our data indicates that the ES cell proliferation defect may be regulated by Integrin, TGF-beta, Cadherin, and PI3K signaling pathways. Furthermore, the interactome has led me to explore a possible novel function of Sall4 in microRNA biogenesis. By understanding how Sall4 regulates cell fate determination can substantially push ESC research forward

The TCT motif, a core promoter element for the translational machinery
The RNA polymerase II core promoter is a diverse and complex region of DNA that contains the transcription start site. Core promoter elements are conserved DNA sequences within the core promoter that direct transcription to the start site and function in the regulation of gene expression. Here I describe the TCT motif, a newly discovered core promoter element that encompasses the transcription start site and is conserved among the ribosomal protein genes. Mutational analysis of three ribosomal protein gene promoters, RpLP1, RpS12, and RpS15, demonstrates the importance of this DNA element. A severe down-regulation of transcription is seen when the wild-type sequence is mutated, with positions 3-5 (+3 to + 5 relative to the +1 transcription start site) being the most important. I also show that the TCT does not work synergistically with other previously characterized core promoter elements, and the RpLP1 promoter is not bound by Transcription Factor IID (TFIID). The TCT is a necessary core promoter element for the transcription of the ribosomal protein genes. Its inability to work synergistically with other known promoter elements, along with its inability to bind TFIID, may suggest a parallel mechanism of RNA polymerase II transcription for the ribosomal protein genes that is independent of the mechanism used for all previously studied genes

Studies of Atmospheric Chemistry and Reaction Mechanisms Using Optical Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry
This thesis mainly focuses on (1) development and applications of cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) to study atmospheric trace gases; (2) reactive intermediates in the alkene ozonolysis reactions using photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS); and (3) development of new methods using CRDS for thin film studies.Specifically, CRDS based instruments are developed to measure and characterize peroxy radicals in atmosphere. By combining the chemical amplification detection of peroxy radicals (PERCA) with CRDS, the peroxy radical detection sensitivity can achieve ~10pptv/60s with a single channel CRDS instrument and ~1.2pptv/10s with a dual channel CRDS instrument. Ambient measurements of the peroxy radicals were carried out. The same dual channel instrument is also used for measurements of opticalextinction of atmospheric aerosols, which is in good agreement with the Mie theory with a sensitivity of 0.24 Mm-1(1&#963;).To detect the early transient reactive intermediates and investigate the mechanisms of initial steps of ozonolysis of alkenes, the gas-phase ozonolysis reactions are carried out in a fast flow reactor under the conditions of low pressure (7-10 Torr) and room temperature. The alkenes investigated include cis-2-butene, tetramethylethylene, cyclohexene, isoprene and &#61537;- and &#61538;-pinenes. CO is used as an OH scavenger to minimize the reactions between the OH byproduct and alkenes. After a short reaction time of ~25 to ~ 200 &#956;s, the initial products, both free radical intermediates and stable species, are detected by the 118-nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization TOFMS. Mass peaks corresponding to the Criegee intermediates or their isomers are identified.This thesis also presents a novel method for determining the thickness of a non-absorbing nanoscale thin film on a nearly transparent substrate through the analysis of the transmittance signal measured using CRDS near the Brewster angle. An optical model is developed and demonstrated for a organic polymer thin film.This dissertation is a part of my research work.

Protein kinase C-delta regulates HIV-1 replication at an early post-entry step in macrophages
AbstractBackgroundMacrophages, which are CD4 and CCR5 positive, can sustain HIV-1 replication for long periods of time. Thus, these cells play critical roles in the transmission, dissemination and persistence of viral infection. Of note, current antiviral therapies do not target macrophages efficiently. Previously, it was demonstrated that interactions between CCR5 and gp120 stimulate PKC. However, the PKC isozymes involved were not identified.ResultsIn this study, we identified PKC-delta as a major cellular cofactor for HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Indeed, PKC-delta was stimulated following the interaction between the virus and its target cell. Moreover, inhibition of PKC-delta blocked the replication of R5-tropic viruses in primary human macrophages. However, this inhibition did not have significant effects on receptor and co-receptor expression or fusion. Additionally, it did not affect the formation of the early reverse transcription product containing R/U5 sequences, but did inhibit the synthesis of subsequent cDNAs. Importantly, the inhibition of PKC-delta altered the redistribution of actin, a cellular cofactor whose requirement for the completion of reverse transcription was previously established. It also prevented the association of the reverse transcription complex with the cytoskeleton.ConclusionThis work highlights the importance of PKC-delta during early steps of the replicative cycle of HIV-1 in human macrophages.

CCR7-Dependent T Cell-Mediated Immunity During Toxoplasma gondii Infection
Infection with the protozoan parasite, <italic> Toxoplasma gondii </italic> is one of the most prevalent human infections and has been targeted by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as a priority for public health action. Its been recognized as a ``silent killer'' because of its ability to cause a latent infection in the host brain without any significant symptoms, unless the host is immunocompromised. Thus, it is an important concern to the ever-increasing AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) community or people on immunosuppressive therapies. In addition, immune responses following Toxoplasma infection in an immunocompetent host represent finely tuned host immunity that grants the parasite survival but robust enough to provide protection against the parasite and thus, avoiding serious illness. A thorough understanding of the key components of this balanced protective immunity may help to design efficient strategies to maximize immune responses for the host benefit.Chemokines are a family of small molecules secreted by host cells and can induce diverse biological responses in nearby responsive cells. They are important immunomodulatory agents coordinating leukocyte migration during homeostasis and inflammation. This dissertation highlights a lymphoid chemokine receptor CCR7 (C-C chemokine receptor 7) as an essential component of the host protective immunity during both the acute and the chronic phase of Toxoplasma infection although through separate mechanisms. Host protective immunity during Toxoplasma infection is mainly T cell-mediated. This dissertation demonstrates that CCR7 is an absolute requirement for the generation of protective immunity during the acute phase of infection. CCR7-deficient mice succumb in the early phase of infection due to a delay in T cell priming. Further investigation reveals that the requirement of CCR7 to optimize T cell priming is eventually compensated during the chronic phase of infection, however, CCR7 is required for T cell migration <italic> within </italic> the infected CNS that influences their ability to control the parasite burden at this stage. Although there is no defect in the antigen-specificity or the influx of effector T cells in the infected brain, CCR7-deficient mice are unable to mount protective memory responses following secondary infection. This dissertation provides new insights about the hallmarks for protective immunity in such a balanced chronic infection scenario as well as reveals new mechanisms as to how this lymphoid chemokine signaling influences important immunological processes in the peripheral tissues particularly in the CNS.

Assessing the genetic architecture of metabolic diseases using candidate gene and genome-wide approach
Much work has targeted the detection of disease genes through genetic mapping for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other diabetes-related traits such as body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. However, the etiology of metabolic diseases remains partially understood hampering the development of more personalized diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies.This dissertation examines the association between genetic variants with risk of metabolic diseases and diabetes-related quantitative traits in both candidate gene and genome-wide scan settings. In particular, we assessed the association of genetic loci related to adiposity, inflammation, and lipid storage, with the risk of diabetes using a candidate gene approach. We also investigated biological pathways that may give rise to the development of vascular disease (T2D and/or CVD) and also further investigated genetic variants related to BMI and HbA1C levels using a genome-wide approach. Chapter 1 introduces general background on the evolution of genetic research in the arena of metabolic diseases. Chapter 2 investigates common variants in the genomic region of FABP4, CRP, TNF, IL6 and PPARG in relation to diabetes risk among postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS). Chapter 3 examines whether common variants involved in vascular disease risk are clustered in multiple pathways among African and Hispanic American participants in the WHI SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) cohort. Chapter 4 examines the association between genetic variants with BMI and HbA1C levels using a family-based genome-wide association approach among participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Our main findings are: 1) Candidate gene-based studies indicate that variation exists across even the candidate gene regions. FABP4 genotypes were associated with reduced VCAM-1 levels, though none of the common genetic variants in the FABP4 gene examined were associated with risk of T2D. We also observed modest associations between TNF genetic variants and circulating concentrations of TNF-&#945;-R2, although common variants of CRP, TNF, and IL6 genes were not associated with T2D risk. Using the example of the PPARG gene with T2D risk, however, we replicated the association between the PPARG Pro12Ala genetic variant with diabetes risk and found that haplotype-based analysis is more powerful than single-SNP analysis for identifying genetic variants. 2) Using a pathway-based analytical approach and genome-wide scan data collected among African and Hispanic American postmenopausal women, we observed that genetic variants associated with vascular disease appeared to cluster into several biological pathways including the glycerolipid metabolism and PPAR signaling pathways. 3) We found strong associations between SNPs near the LOC100507205 locus and BMI in the family-based Framingham Heart Study with three generations. We also replicated five well-validated genes that have been previously reported to be significantly associated with the BMI trait. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature in identifying genetic variants in the development of metabolic disease, further future work (e.g. in the area of structure and functional variants) are warranted to improve understanding of the genetic architecture for metabolic outcomes. Increasing integration of cutting edge genomic science into population-based epidemiologic investigation will accelerate and improve our understanding of the genetic susceptibility of complex diseases.  The work described in this dissertation represents a tip of our effort toward the ultimate improvement of the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases in human populations.

Identification and Control of the Jet in Crossflow
The research in this dissertation explores active control of a jet injected into quiescent surrounding or into a crossflow, a flowfield also known as the transverse jet. Periodic acoustic actuation is used to perturb the temporal jet injection profile about a mean in order to enhance important characteristics of the flow, such as mixing and penetration of the jet into the crossflow. In practice, nonlinear actuation system dynamics make it difficult to shape the injection profile to match a periodic reference. Discrete sinusoidal inputs necessary for periodic reference tracking produce harmonics that fall directly on the neighboring harmonic frequencies of the reference. At low forcing amplitudes, approximately less than 0.5m/s RMS, a feedback controller designed from a linear model of the actuation system compensates the coupling between harmonics. A modulated-demodulated controller with feedback from a hotwire placed at the jet exit tracks the first N Fourier coefficients of the reference that fall within the actuation bandwidth. A fundamental improvement to modulated-demodulated control, dynamic phase compensation in place of static phase compensation, is presented to reduce sensitivity function peaking in the neighborhood of the frequencies targeted for rejection or tracking. Above 0.5m/s RMS, however, the harmonic coupling destabilizes modulated-demodulated control designed from a linear model of the actuator dynamics.An alternative approach creates a stabilizing feedback control based on a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) empirical model of the harmonic coupling. Transforming the system into baseband coordinates by demodulating the velocity measurement at the harmonic frequencies of the reference waveform simplifies the model to the point the harmonic coupling can be reasonably modeled as a linear MIMO gain. The static model accurately captures the relationship between each harmonic frequency in the neighborhood of an operating point close to a desired reference. The stable feedback loop asymptotically drives the jet velocity to its reference. This control method is applied to the equidensity jet in crossflow to track pulse-like references at jet to crossflow velocity ratios of R=6.4 and R=2.2. The closed-loop waveforms are symmetric with little ringing and have sharp transitions between the low and high velocity regions of the pulse. Initial experiments with planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) flow diagnostics are also presented. These results show the pulsed jet in crossflow with optimized temporal pulse widths increases the jet spread compared to the unforced and sinusoidally forced jet in crossflow. Additionally, the pulsed jets increase the centerline scalar concentration decay in the near field but become approximately equal with the unforced jet in the far field.

A Historical Profile of the Higgs Boson
The Higgs boson was postulated in 1964, and phenomenological studies of its possible pro- 
duction and decays started in the early 1970s, followed by studies of its possible production 
in e+ e,  pp and pp collisions, in particular. Until recently, the most sensitive searches for 
the Higgs boson were at LEP between 1989 and 2000, which have been complemented by 
searches at the Fermilab Tevatron. The LHC has recently entered the hunt, excluding a 
Higgs boson over a large range of masses and revealing a tantalizing hint in the range 119 to 
125 GeV, and there are good prospects that the existence or otherwise of the Higgs boson 
will soon be established. One of the most attractive possibilities is that the Higgs boson 
is accompanied by supersymmetry, though composite options have yet to be excluded. 
This article reviews some of the key historical developments in Higgs physics over the past

Signaling from the asters and spindle midzone is required to promote cytokinesis in the early C. elegans embryo
Cytokinesis is the final step of the cell division that physically separates a single cell into two daughter cells following chromosome segregation. In order to insure that each daughter cell receives the proper genetic complement, cytokinesis must be both spatially and temporally coupled to chromosome segregation. Cytokinesis is accomplished by formation and constriction of a contractile ring made up of actin, myosin, anillin, and the septins. One of the critical questions in the field is how does the cell maintain precise spatial and temporal control over the assembly and constriction of the contractile ring? Although the precise molecular signals are still being debated, it is known that signals from the anaphase spindle are critical for furrow formation and ingression. Using the early C. elegans embryo I have found that integration of signals from astral microtubules and the spindle midzone is critical for the formation of a single furrow during cytokinesis. During early anaphase, astral microtubules provide an inhibitory signal to prevent accumulation of contractile ring proteins in the anterior and posterior of the cell, leading to their enrichment in the equatorial region. Proper separation of the asters is important for this early signal, since delaying or preventing aster separation disrupts the equatorial enrichment of anillin and myosin and delays furrow formation. Following this initial signal from the astral microtubules, a positive signal from the midzone - mediated by Centralspindlin and the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) - drives furrow ingression and completion. Although the initial patterning of contractility and the timing of furrow formation are unaffected, depletion of Centralspindlin or the CPC leads to a decrease in the rate of ingression and failure of cytokinesis. My work has also shown that Centralspindlin and the CPC are involved in distinct pathways to promote furrow ingression. The key role of the Centralspindlin complex is to inactivate the small GTPase, Rac, whereas the role of the CPC is likely through promoting contractile ring disassembly through regulation of anillin and/or septin

Live Imaging Study on Cytokinin Function and Regulation in Stem-cell Homeostasis
Stem-cell homeostasis is mediated by multifaceted networks involving plant hormones and local cell-cell communication. Earlier studies have implicated cytokinins in regulating shoot apical meristem (SAM) growth. However, the precise role of cytokinin in SAM remains largely unknown because cytokinins have been implicated in several developmental processes and merely studying the terminal phenotypes may not reveal their function in actively developing SAMs. The live-image technology allows studying the function of any given regulator immediately after its perturbations in transient experiments. The live-imaging work presented here provides: 1) Functional analysis of SAM-enriched cytokinin activating enzymes, 2) The live-image study on key regulators in cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling, 3) The function of SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM).The cell-type specific genomics has predicted and RNA in situ analysis has confirmed the enrichment of cytokinin activating enzymes in the SAM-stem cell niche. Knock-out three centrally expressed members alters phyllotaxy. Transient manipulation of cytokinin results in organ positioning defects within the peripheral zone (PZ) of SAMs. The levels of cytokinin are correlated to auxin responses. Moreover, external application of auxin fails to induce auxin responses suggesting that cytokinins are required for activating auxin response pathway components. Cell division analyses reveal that cell mitotic activities are correlated to the levels of cytokinins. We conclude that cytokinin controls phyllotaxy by regulating auxin signaling, auxin transport and cell division rates. We find that WUSCHEL (WUS) regulates a type-B response regulator, ARR1. Then, we have studied the effects of positive cytokinin signaling by using inducible activation of constitutively active forms of ARR1 coupled with live-image technology. This analysis has revealed that constitutive activation of cytokinin signaling results in expansion of stem-cell domain leading to de-differentiation of differentiating cells and this process is WUS dependent. Genetically, stm mutant phenotype implies that STM function is required for SAM initiation and fulfills a complementary role to that of WUS. Inducible inactivation of STM has shown that it is required for preventing the CZ cells from responding to auxin. Furthermore, other differentiation markers were also found to be mis-expressed in the CZ cells. These findings lead to conclude that STM prevent the stem-cell domain from differentiation.

Inter- and Intra-Specific Correlates of Habitat and Locomotion in Snakes
It is often thought that locomotion is the behavior that most shapes organismal form andfunction. Among tetrapods, differences in locomotor ability both within and amongspecies are often thought to be the result of variation in the limbs and other aspects of theappendicular skeleton. Snakes are both elongate and completely without limbs. Whilethis bauplan has served snakes well, it is nevertheless subject to constraint at severallevels--particularly with reference to friction and the effects of gravity. Severalfunctional hypotheses have been put forth attempting to relate variation in snake anatomyand physiology with movement through particular types of habitat, but none have beenconducted in a strict, phylogenetic context.This dissertation will address several of these hypotheses in an evolutionarycontext to ask whether variation in snake anatomy and physiology is determined byadaptive mechanisms, or is a consequence of phylogenetic history. I also examinevariation in locomotor performance in the corn snake, Pantherophis guttata.I first address a long-standing hypothesis that the heart position in arboreal snakesis an adaptive feature related to head up postures during climbing. I use aphylogenetically diverse sample of snakes from several habitats to address the source ofthe variation in heart position. We found a trend opposite previous studies and found thatphylogenetic effects were equally important as ecological effects. I also present aresponse to criticism of this study in chapter two.I then use a similar approach to that of chapter one to address whether variation inthe musculature in snakes is associated with adaptations to particular habitats. I use aninformation-theoretic approach to develop and compare models that incorporatemorphological, behavioral, ecological and phylogenetic variables. I found evidence that amodel containing all variables best fit my data.Finally, I examined whether there was variation in locomotor performance in thecorn snake, Pantherophis guttata.

Hand Preferences in New World Primates
Studies ofhand preference s in the platyrrhine species are reviewed. Hand preferences of the New World species have been recorded during feeding activities, visuospatial reaching, haptic discrimination, tool use and in a variety of routine tasks using the hands. Of the New World species tested so far, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchiis) and squirrel monkeys {Saimiri sciureus), appear to be the only species that do not display handedness in feeding activities: at the population level both species display a symmetrical distribution of hand preferences. It appears that only one New World primate species, the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), displays left handedness during feeding while the other species are right handed or have no handedness. Thus,tlie findings for hand use in feeding do not support the Postural Origins hypothesis of MacNeilage et al. (1987) as it predicts left handedness rather than right in the arboreal platyrrhine species. Overall, tlie reports of handedness for tasks requiring complex visuospatial or tactile processing in the New World primates concur with those reported for humans, who have left handedness in haptic discrimination and complex visuospatial tasks and right handedness for manipulative tasks. Squirrel monkeys are left handed when reaching for moving objects and capuchins display left handedness in haptic discrimination tasks, and right handedness during sponging tasks. There is strong evidence of an effect of posture on the strength of hand preferences, and some affects of age and gender on hand use have also been reported. However, these variables do not influence hand preferences consistently across species or across tasks conducted with the same species.

Molecular phylogeny of grunts (Teleostei, Haemulidae), with an emphasis on the ecology, evolution, and speciation history of New World species
AbstractBackgroundThe fish family Haemulidae is divided in two subfamilies, Haemulinae and Plectorhynchinae (sweetlips), including approximately 17 genera and 145 species. The family has a broad geographic distribution that encompasses contrasting ecological habitats resulting in a unique potential for evolutionary hypotheses testing. In the present work we have examined the phylogenetic relationships of the family using selected representatives of additional Percomorpha based on Bayesian and Maximum likelihood methods by means of three mitochondrial genes. We also developed a phylogenetic hypothesis of the New World species based on five molecular markers (three mitochondrial and two nuclear) as a framework to evaluate the evolutionary history, the ecological diversification and speciation patterns of this group.ResultsMitochondrial genes and different reconstruction methods consistently recovered a monophyletic Haemulidae with the Sillaginidae as its sister clade (although with low support values). Previous studies proposed different relationships that were not recovered in this analysis. We also present a robust molecular phylogeny of Haemulinae based on the combined data of two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes. All topologies support the monophyly of both sub-families (Haemulinae, Plectorhinchinae). The genus Pomadasys was shown to be polyphyletic and Haemulon, Anisotremus, and Plectorhinchus were found to be paraphyletic. Four of seven presumed geminate pairs were indeed found to be sister species, however our data did not support a contemporaneous divergence. Analyses also revealed that differential use of habitat might have played an important role in the speciation dynamics of this group of fishes, in particular among New World species where extensive sample coverage was available.ConclusionsThis study provides a new hypothesis for the sister clade of Hamulidae and a robust phylogeny of the latter. The presence of para- and polyphyletic genera underscores the need for a taxonomic reassessment within the family. A scarce sampling of the Old World Pomadasys species prevents us to definitively point to a New World origin of the sub-familiy Hamulinae, however our data suggest that this is likely to be the case. This study also illustrates how life history habitat influences speciation and evolutionary trajectories.

La-doped SrTiO3 films with large cryogenic thermoelectric power factors
The thermoelectric properties at temperatures between 10 K and 300 K of La-doped SrTiO3 thin films grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on undoped SrTiO3 substrates are reported. Below 50 K, the Seebeck coefficients exhibit very large magnitudes due to the influence of phonon drag. Combined with high carrier mobilities, exceeding 50 000 cm2 V-1s-1 at 2 K for
      the films with the lowest carrier densities, this leads to thermoelectric power factors as high as 470 µWcm-1K-2. The results are compared with other promising low temperature thermoelectric materials and discussed in the context of coupling with phonons in the undoped substrate.

Computational Methods for  Analysis and Redesign of Enzyme Active Sites
The rational design of enzymes and understanding of enzyme  mechanisms both present a tremendous challenge in terms of both computational and experimental methodologies. In this work, we review the current state-of-the-art techniques in enzyme design and present a new computational method for active site redesign, called SABER (Selection of Active/Binding sites for Enzyme Redesign). This program was used to analyze both an existing enzyme redesign from the literature, o-succinyl benzoate synthase, and to predict new scaffolds that might be redesigned function similarly to a designed Kemp elimination enzyme. The logic behind the program is discussed in detail with examples taken from the code. Next, SABER was applied to the problem of predicting catalytic functionality in enzyme active sites. This methodology was used to analyze the active sites from two well-studied enzyme families, the serine proteases and the tyrosine phosphatases, and was found to predict catalytic function with high accuracy. It was then used to analyze the active site of orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, an enzyme with an unknown mechanism, and used to support of an imminium-based mechanism of catalysis. Finally, a very challenging rational enzyme design process to catalyze an aromatic Claisen rearrangement is discussed. This led to the design and synthesis of six enzymes, none of which showed any rate acceleration versus the background reaction. During this work, an aromatic Claisen substrate that rearranges rapidly in water was discovered and characterized. This was used to highlight the difficulties in both the enzyme design process and in prediction of hydrogen-bond catalyzed reaction rates in water.

Development and Use of Particle into Liquid Sampling Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PILS-ToF) for Characterization of Aerosol Particles
This dissertation introduces and makes use of the Particle-into-Liquid-Sampler coupled to a Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (PILS-ToF), a new instrumental method used here to provide new chemical characterization information on secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  The PILS-ToF instrument improves upon drawbacks found in current state-of-the-art mass spectral chemical characterization methods to include lack of time resolution and ion fragmentation by electron impact ionization in the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS).  The functionality of the PILS-ToF for collection and response to SOA particle formation is validated against a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), a widely accepted and standardized physical chemical characterization instrument, for a well characterized SOA formation experiment, dark ozonolysis of á-pinene.  The PILS-ToF is also used to lend insight into oligomer growth during the NO photo-oxidation of isoprene.  It is of atmospheric importance to study SOA formation from isoprene as it is globally the most abundant non-methane hydrocarbon in the  ambient.  SOA from isoprene is further studied using the PILS-ToF as part of the suite instrumentation at the University of California, Riverside, College of Engineering, Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) atmospheric chamber providing a complete chemical and physical characterization of SOA formed by isoprene with various oxidants under a myriad of oxidant concentration conditions.  In addition, the PILS-ToF is used, again in tandem with other chemical and physical characterization methods at CE-CERT, to probe temperature effects on SOA formation from isoprene under many different oxidizing conditions.  Finally, the PILS-ToF is used to provide new mechanistic information on SOA formation from trimethylamine and tributylamine, two tertiary amines emitted from anthropogenic and animal husbandry processes.  For these two teriary amines the PILS-ToF provides evidence of oligomerization giving a potential explanation to the high SOA yields from these parent compounds.

Characterization of EER4 and SAR1 in Relation to Their Role in Ethylene Signaling and Dampening Responses
Ethylene is a plant hormone important for many agriculturally significant developmental processes such as fruit ripening.  In Arabidopsis, two mutants with an enhanced ethylene response, eer4 and sar1-7, result in decreased gene expression of AtEBP, an ethylene inducible gene.  EER4 encodes a transcription factor related to TAF12.  In Drosophila, TAF12's  associate with the TFIID and SAGA complexes.  The TFIID complex regulates expression of housekeeping genes, while the SAGA complex regulates expression of stress inducible genes.  Genetic analysis determined that EER4 acts downstream of CTR1 and EIN2.  The eer4;ein3-1 has a greater response than ein3-1 alone, indicating the reset mechanism is EIN3 independent.  EER4 interacts with the EIN3 and ERF1 transcription factors possibly regulating expression of ethylene inducible genes.  EER4 is also responsible for the regulation of the ethylene dampening mechanism independent of EIN3.  SAR1 encodes a nucleoporin originally identified for its ability to restore auxin responsiveness to the auxin resistant mutant, axr1-12.  SAR1 has pleiotropic effects due to the fact loss of function alleles of SAR1 have also been pulled out using screens for enhanced ethylene response and altered cold tolerance.  This is not surprising because loss of function sar1 alleles accumulate poly A mRNA in the nucleus.  Genetic analysis indicates SAR1 acts downstream of CTR1.  Again, the sar1-7;ein3-1 double has a greater response than ein3-1 alone further supporting the ethylene reset mechanism is EIN3 independent.  Due to sar1-1's involvement with auxin response, it was tested to whether this is a synergistic relationship between auxin signaling and level of ethylene response.  Auxin response is a negative regulator of ethylene dampening response.

Dynamic surface topography influences cell function
Micro- and nano-scale changes in surface topography can modulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation; rough surfaces have been shown to induce osteogenesis to varying degrees depending on the scale and nature of the topographical features. However, in the in vivo environment, topography is constantly changing due to remodeling by cells within the niche. To better understand how mesenchymal stem cells respond to changes in topography over time, we developed a soft polyacrylamide hydrogel with magnetic nickel microwires randomly oriented in the surface of the material. Varying the magnetic field around the microwires can reversibly induce their alignment with the direction of the field, causing the smooth hydrogel surface to develop small wrinkles. By varying the density of wires in the hydrogel, surface roughness changes, R_RMS, ranged from 0.09 um (wire-free substrates) to 0.52 (maximum wire density) a custom displacement mapping software. Time-dependent topographical changes were achieved by oscillating the field around the microwires using step function or cyclic changes. Smooth muscle cells plated onto these substrates changed morphology by shrinking within minutes of inducing a step change in topography. However, on a longer time scale characterized by a continual modulation of topography, cells show no appreciable response, likely due to their propensity to remodel over longer time scales. Being able to dynamically study how cells respond to changes in topography will improve our current understanding of topography-driven effects on cell behavior, and eventually, on stem cell differentiation

A role for RNA post-transcriptional regulation in satellite cell activation
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Satellite cells are resident skeletal muscle stem cells responsible for muscle maintenance and repair. In resting muscle, satellite cells are maintained in a quiescent state. Satellite cell activation induces the myogenic commitment factor, MyoD, and cell cycle entry to facilitate transition to a population of proliferating myoblasts that eventually exit the cycle and regenerate muscle tissue. The molecular mechanism involved in the transition of a quiescent satellite cell to a transit-amplifying myoblast is poorly understood.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Satellite cells isolated by FACS from uninjured skeletal muscle and 12 h post-muscle injury from wild type and Syndecan-4 null mice were probed using Affymetrix 430v2 gene chips and analyzed by Spotfiretm and Ingenuity Pathway analysis to identify gene expression changes and networks associated with satellite cell activation, respectively. Additional analyses of target genes identify miRNAs exhibiting dynamic changes in expression during satellite cell activation. The function of the miRNAs was assessed using miRIDIAN hairpin inhibitors.
				
				
					
						Results
					An unbiased gene expression screen identified over 4,000 genes differentially expressed in satellite cells in vivo within 12 h following muscle damage and more than 50% of these decrease dramatically. RNA binding proteins and genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation were significantly over-represented whereas splicing factors were preferentially downregulated and mRNA stability genes preferentially upregulated. Furthermore, six computationally identified miRNAs demonstrated novel expression through muscle regeneration and in satellite cells. Three of the six miRNAs were found to regulate satellite cell fate.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The quiescent satellite cell is actively maintained in a state poised to activate in response to external signals. Satellite cell activation appears to be regulated by post-transcriptional gene regulation.

Computational and comparative proteogenomics : annotating genomes and proteomes using tandem mass spectrometry
Next generation sequencing techniques will soon lead to an explosive growth in the number of sequenced genomes and will turn manual gene and protein annotations into a luxury that can be afforded for only a small fraction of the newly sequenced genomes. In this work, we show that mass spectrometry can be a viable alternative high- throughput approach for accurate proteogenomic annotation. We present advances in statistical analysis of the reliability of peptide and protein identifications from mass spectrometry, and demonstrate how comparative analysis of multiple species or multiple experimental samples can provide additional insights for new biological discovery. We apply these approaches for correcting gene boundaries, discovering programmed frameshifts, N-terminal methionine cleavages, signal peptide cleavages and other in-vivo regulatory proteolytic events, post-translational modifications, analyzing specificity of individual proteases, detecting neuropeptides in brain tissue, and improving operon predictions. Based on this work, we recommend complementing genome sequencing projects by mass spectrometry-based proteogenomics

Optimization algorithms for biological data
High-throughput techniques in biology have enabled the generation of enormous amount of data allowing researchers to reveal systems level information deciphering the underlying dynamics and mechanisms of the cell. In the last few decades, the immense databases containing DNA, RNA and protein sequences, structures and abundance estimates have been available to researchers. Research in bioinformatics necessitates the use of advanced efficient algorithms to analyze and interpret those biological data. A common characteristic of high-throughput biological data is that it is often incomplete, noisy and inconsistent due to the biases and inefficiencies induced by the laboratory methods. That is why several of the problems defined on biological data can be viewed as constrained optimization problems. In this dissertation, I address different optimization problems that arise in the analysis of biological data: RNA structural alignment, protein interaction network querying, micro-array expression data clustering, protein quantification and protein modification site assignment. The dissertation begins with an overview of the basic concepts of molecular biology and an introduction to the optimization problems to be addressed. Then, each problem is discussed in detail in a separate chapter along with our contribution in the solution of the problem and our results on biological data opening a way for biological discoveries

Upper ocean processes observed by underwater gliders in the California Current System
Spray glider surveys in the California Current System (CCS) resolve upper ocean processes at scales from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers over monthly to interannual timescales. These observations are used to understand eddies and effluent transport, the structure and variability of poleward currents, the regional effects of El Niño, and thermohaline structure. Repeated glider surveys of the greater San Pedro Bay region within the Southern California Bight (SCB) are used to describe coastal processes during the fall of 2006. Elevated subsurface chlorophyll levels within a small cyclonic eddy correspond to an inferred increase in nitrate availability to the euphotic zone. The low-salinity signature of the effluent plume from a coastal ocean outfall is used to show that the plume was advected poleward while remaining subsurface. Glider observations and a numerical state estimate are used to describe the mean and variability of poleward flows in the CCS. Persistent poleward currents are observed near Point Conception, within the SCB, and offshore of the SCB. The poleward current offshore of the SCB migrates westward with across-shore wave number and frequency that are consistent with first-mode baroclinic Rossby dynamics. This westward propagation is tied to westward propagating density anomalies originating in the SCB during the spring-summer upwelling season. The effects of the 2009--2010 El Niño in the CCS are investigated using glider observations. Positive upper ocean temperature anomalies and depression of isopycnals coincide with equatorial SST anomalies, while isopycnal salinity and alongshore transport anomalies are shown to be insignificant. Glider observations rule out advection of subtropical waters into the CCS during the 2009--2010 El Niño and suggest that an atmospheric teleconnection was important. Glider observations show the distribution of temperature and salinity variations along isopycnals at mesoscales and submesoscales. Along-isopycnal salinity variance is used to identify distinct layers; increased variance is found in the seasonally restratifying layer and within a layer below the thermocline. Adjoint passive tracer calculations in a numerical state estimate show the differing histories of waters in each layer

[genome, pulmonate, opisthobranch, mitochondrial, basal]

Phylogeny and taxonomy of the marine false limpets in the genus Siphonaria (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Siphonariidae)
Background: Reconstructing the higher relationships of pulmonate gastropods has
been difficult. Morphology is problematic due to high homoplasy. Molecular studies have
suffered from low taxon sampling. Forty-one complete mitochondrial genomes are
available for gastropods, seven of which are pulmonates. Ten new complete
mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates are presented here: Salinator rhamphidia
(Amphiboloidea); Auriculinella bidentata, Myosotella myosotis, Ovatella vulcani, and
Pedipes pedipes (Ellobiidae); Peronia peronii (Onchidiidae); Siphonaria gigas
(Siphonariidae); Succinea putris (Stylommatophora); Trimusculus reticulatus
(Trimusculidae); and Rhopalocaulis grandidieri (Veronicellidae). Also, 94 new
pulmonate-specific primers across the entire mitochondrial genome are provided, which
were designed for amplifying genomes through simultaneous, short reactions.
Results: The structural features of the 10 new mitochondrial genomes are summarized.
All genomes share similar gene orders. Phylogenetic analyses were performed
including the 10 new genomes and 16 genomes from Genbank (outgroup,
opisthobranch, and other pulmonate species). Bayesian Inference and Maximum
Likelihood analyses produced the same topology, based on the concatenated amino
acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding genes. The pulmonates are paraphyletic and
basal to the opisthobranchs that are monophyletic at the tip of the tree. Siphonaria,
traditionally regarded as a basal pulmonate, is nested within opisthobranchs.
Pyramidella, traditionally regarded as a basal (non-euthyneuran) heterobranch, is
nested within pulmonates. Several hypotheses are rejected, such as the
Systellommatophora, Geophila, and Eupulmonata. The Ellobiidae is polyphyletic, but
the false limpet Trimusculus reticulatus is closely related to some ellobiids.
Conclusions: Despite recent efforts for increasing the taxon sampling in euthyneuran
gastropods (opisthobranchs and pulmonates) phylogenies, most deep nodes are still
uncertain, mainly due to low support values as well as some incongruence between
analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes and those based on individual
genes (18S, 28S, 16S, CO1). Additional genomes are still needed, especially for
veronicellids, ellobiids, freshwater pulmonates, taxa for which no genome is currently
available (Williamia, Otina, and, Smeagol), as well as basal heterobranchs, closely
related to euthyneurans. Step by step, however, new relationships are being unveiled,
such as the close relationships between the false limpet Trimusculus reticulatus and
ellobiids, the fact that a pyramidelloid is nested within pulmonates, and that Siphonaria
is closely related to sacoglossan opisthobranchs.

Assaying proline hydroxylation in recombinant
collagen variants by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry
AbstractBackgroundThe fabrication of recombinant collagen and its prescribed variants has enormous potential in tissue regeneration, cell-matrix interaction investigations, and fundamental biochemical and biophysical studies of the extracellular matrix. Recombinant expression requires proline hydroxylation, a post-translational modification which is critical for imparting stability and structure. However, these modifications are not native to typical bacterial or yeast expression systems. Furthermore, detection of low levels of 4-hydroxyproline is challenging with respect to selectivity and sensitivity.ResultsWe have developed a new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method to evaluate proline hydroxylation in recombinant collagen. This assay was tested in different Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression systems to evaluate the effect of gene ratio between prolyl-4-hydroxylase and collagen on the extent of hydroxylation. These systems used a human collagen III gene that was synthesized de novo from oligonucleotides. The LC-MS assay does not require derivatization, uses only picomoles of sample, and can measure proline hydroxylation levels in recombinant and native collagen ranging from approximately 0% to 40%. The hydroxylation values obtained by LC-MS are as accurate and as precise as those obtained with the conventional method of amino acid analysis.ConclusionsA facile, derivatization-free LC-MS method was developed that accurately determines the percentage of proline hydroxylation in different yeast expression systems. Using this assay, we determined that systems with a higher collagen-to-hydroxylase gene copy ratio yielded a lower percentage of hydroxylation, suggesting that a specifically balanced gene ratio is required to obtain higher hydroxylation levels.

Moloney murine leukemia virus glyco-gag facilitates xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus replication through human APOBEC3-independent mechanisms
AbstractBackgroundOne of the unique features of gammaretroviruses is that they contain an additional extended form of Gag, glyco-gag, which initiates in the leader sequence. MuLV glyco-gag, gPr80Gag, promotes retrovirus replication and disease progression. Although virtually all infectious MuLVs encode glyco-gag, XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) lacks the classical gPr80Gag sequence. We examined XMRV to determine if its leader sequence contains glyco-gag activity, whether the presence of conventional gPr80Gag affects replication of XMRV, and we describe the evolution of glyco-gag-deficient MuLVs in Mus.ResultsWe introduced several mutations disrupting two putative but noncanonical glyco-gag proteins in the leader sequence region in XMRV and found that those mutations did not affect virus release nor susceptibility to the antiviral activity of hA3G (human APOBEC3G). A chimeric XMRV encoding the Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) leader sequence (MXMRV) demonstrated that M-MuLV glyco-gag facilitated MXMRV release and increased infectivity. Infectivity assays with several cell lines showed that glyco-gag increases XMRV infectivity in all cell lines tested, but the level of this increase varies in different cell lines. Because MuLV glyco-gag counteracts mouse APOBEC3, we investigated whether M-MuLV glyco-gag enhances XMRV infection by counteracting human APOBEC3. Comparison of hAPOBEC3 isoforms expressed in different cell lines indicated that hA3B was the most likely candidate for a restrictive hA3. However over-expression of hA3B showed no enhanced restriction of infection by XMRV compared to MXMRV. Endogenous MuLVs in the sequenced mouse genome were screened for canonical glyco-gag, which was identified in two clades of xenotropic MuLVs (X-MuLVs) and ecotropic MuLVs, but not in other X-MuLVs or in any polytropic MuLVs.ConclusionsM-MuLV glyco-gag facilitates XMRV replication, and the leader sequence region in XMRV does not encode proteins equivalent to M-MuLV glyco-gag. The fact that the ability of glyco-gag to enhance XMRV infection varies in different cell lines suggests a glyco-gag sensitive restrictive factor that further reduces XMRV infectivity. The M-MuLV glyco-gag enhancement for XMRV replication is through a hAPOBEC3 independent mechanism. The absence of glyco-gag in MuLVs carried by western European mice suggests that loss of this sequence is a relatively recent event with limited subspecies distribution.

Coloring triangle-free graphs and network games
A proper vertex coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to all vertices such that adjacent vertices have distinct colors. The chromatic number chi(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring. In this dissertation, we give some background on graph coloring and applications of the probabilistic method to graph coloring problems. We then give three results about graph coloring. * Let G be a triangle-free graph with maximum degree Delta(G). We show that the chromatic number chi(G) is less than 67(1 + o(1))Delta; log Delta. This number is best possible up to a constant factor for triangle-free graphs. * We give a randomized algorithm that properly colors the vertices of a triangle- free graph G on n vertices using O(Delta(G)/ log Delta(G)) colors. The algorithm takes O(n Delta² log Delta (G)) time and succeeds with high probability, provided Delta(G) is greater than log¹⁺epsilon) n for a positive constant epsilon. We analyze a network(graph) coloring game. In each round of the game, each player, as a node in a network G, randomly chooses one of the available colors that is different from all colors played by its neighbors in the previous round. We show that the coloring game converges to its Nash equilibrium if the number of colors is at least Delta(G) + 2. Examples are given for which convergence does not happen with Delta(G) + 1 colors. We also show that with probability at least 1 - delta, the number of rounds required is O(log(n/delta))

Magnetic Control in Crystal Growth from a Melt
Control of bulk melt crystal growth techniques is desirable for producing semiconductors with the highest purity and ternary alloys with tunable electrical properties. Because these molten materials are electrically conducting, external magnetic fields are often employed to regulate the flow in the melt. However, complicated by the coupled flow, thermal, electromagnetic and chemical physics, such magnetic control is typically empirical or even an educated guess. Two magnetic flow control mechanisms: flow damping by steady magnetic fields, and flow stirring by alternating magnetic fields, are investigated numerically.
Magnetic damping during optically-heated float-zone crystal growth is modeled using a spectral collocation method. The Marangoni convection at the free melt-gas interface is suppressed by applying a steady magnetic field, measured by the Hartmann number Ha. Using normal mode linear stability analyses, suppression of detrimental flow instabilities is quantitatively determined in a range applicable to experiments (up to Ha = 300 for Pr = 0.02, and up to Ha = 500 for Pr = 0.001). The hydrodynamic flow instability for small Prandtl number P r float-zone is confirmed by energy analyses.
Rotating magnetic field stirring during confined crystal growth in an ampoule is also modeled. Decoupled from the flow field at small magnetic Reynolds number, the electromagnetic field is solved in a finite element solver. At low AC frequencies, the force is only in the azimuthal direction but penetrates deep into the melt. In contrast, the magnetic shielding effect is observed at high alternating current (AC) frequencies, where the external magnetic field penetrates only by a skin depth into the electrically conducting media within the short AC cycle. As a result, the electromagnetic body force is primarily confined to the ampoule surface. At these high AC frequencies the magnetic flux lines are drastically distorted within the melt. The body force is fully three-dimensional and is much stronger than at low AC frequencies, but is confined to near the ampoule surface due to the magnetic shielding effect.
These models promote fundamental understanding of flow dynamics regulated by electromagnetic body forces. They provide quantitative guidance for crystal growth to minimize trial and error experimentation that is slow and expensive.

[fluid, non-newtonian]

The effects of non-Newtonian fluids on Purcell's Scallop Theorem
Many common fluids such as blood, oils and shampoos exhibit non-Newtonian properties, and low Reynolds flow is ubiquitous in micro-scale swimmers such as flagellum and bacteria. Purcell's Scallop Theorem states that locomotion via a single time-independent degree of movement through low Reynolds flow is impossible as the effects of momentum are negligible. Experimentation was performed to prove that propulsion, via a singular rotational, or linear degree-of-freedom, is possible by employing the normal stresses and shear thinning capabilities of non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. This study also discusses non- Newtonian fluid rheometry, as well as the design and control of the swimming robots

Individual glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction and aversion in Drosophila
In the Drosophila olfactory system, as in many other organisms, different odorants activate specific patterns of glomeruli, but the mechanisms by which these patterns are transformed and eventually read out to lead to behavior remain unknown. One outstanding question is the degree to which the responses of the second order projection neurons are derived from direct receptor input, as opposed to interneurons that receive input from multiple glomeruli. Using mutants for two receptors in conjunction with PN imaging, we found that the cognate receptor neurons are the main driver of PN responses. To address the question of how glomerular patterns elicit behavior, we used genetic tools to dissect the contribution of each glomerulus that is activated by the food odorant apple cider vinegar. This odorant triggers robust innate attraction at a low concentration, which activates six glomeruli. We found that two of these glomeruli were necessary and sufficient for this behavior. At a higher concentration, apple cider vinegar becomes markedly less attractive. We found that one glomerulus, which is activated by the higher concentration, was responsible for the switch in behavior. These results show that innate attraction and repulsion to a food odorant is mediated by individual glomeruli rather than the combination of activated glomeruli

Health Hazards in Indoor Air
Indentifying pollutants that pose a potential hazard indoors is an important first step to reducing risks. We reviewed key published studies reporting measurements of chemical pollutants in residences. Summary results were compiled and used to calculate representative mid-range and upper-bound concentrations relevant to chronic exposures for over 300 pollutants and peak concentrations relevant to acute exposures for a few episodic activity-associated pollutants. For the over 100 pollutants with available criterions, the measured concentrations are compared to available chronic and acute health-hazard standards and guidelines. Fifteen pollutants are identified as potential chronic or acute health hazards for many homes. A subset of pollutants are identified as priority chemical pollutants and suggestions are made for effectively reducing indoor concentrations.

Experimental Studies on Dehydration Embrittlement of Serpentinized Peridotite and the Effect of Pressure on Creep of Olivine
The origin of intermediate depth earthquakes has been debated for 90 years yet is still under active discussion. These earthquakes are localized in double seismic zones in descending lithosphere; both zones originate very close to oceanic trenches. A leading proposed initiation mechanism for these earthquakes since 1968 has been dehydration embrittlement of serpentine under stress.  Despite the considerable evidence favoring this mechanism, a major argument against it has been that the lower seismic zone initiates at ~40 km depth almost immediately below trenches and there does not appear to be a vehicle to carry water sufficiently deep to hydrate otherwise dry lithosphere.  To directly address this problem, an experimental study has been carried out to investigate the minimum amount of serpentine that is required to trigger the dehydration embrittlement instability in serpentinized peridotite at high pressure (1-3 GPa) and temperature (720-750&#730;C). The results show that embrittlement occurs during dehydration of antigorite (the phase of serpentine stable at elevated pressure) in a wide range of compositions but both nearly dry peridotite and extensively altered peridotite are ductile.  Fresh, unaltered, synthetic harzburgite and harzburgite with 4 vol% distributed antigorite are ductile, as are specimens with greater than 65% antigorite.  Only compositions between 8 vol% and 65 vol% antigorite develop the instability. We suggest that very small degrees of serpentinization do not release sufficient H2O to trigger the instability and that extensive serpentinization avoids the instability because soft, ductile, antigorite becomes the interconnected matrix with olivine and pyroxene existing only as isolated crystals.  In that case, dehydration simply facilitates flow.These systematics suggest that small amounts of H2O transported down deep normal (bending) faults at trenches are sufficient to enable the instability in the lower seismic zones, thus providing additional support for dehydration embrittlement as the mechanism of intermediate-depth earthquakes.  At the other end of the spectrum of serpentinization, these results are consistent with previous suggestions that extensive dehydration of altered subducting crust and mantle release copious amounts of H2O that rise to the surface of the descending slab and react with the cool mantle of the overlying plate to lead to extensive serpentinization, thereby explaining serpentine diapers in the forearc and lack of seismicity along the plate interface deeper than about 35 km.Another long-lived controversy in mantle geophysics involves the pressure dependence of creep in olivine, the most abundant and softest phase in unaltered mantle rocks. The pressure dependence of any thermodynamically-controlled phenomenon is commonly expressed as the activation volume, &#8710;V*.  Previous experimental investigations on the effect of pressure on creep in olivine have produced bimodal results. &#916;V* obtained from solid-medium (Griggs) and gas-medium (Paterson) deformation apparatus at relatively lower pressures is ~15 cm3/mol or higher. In contrast, higher-pressure studies using multianvil apparatus at sites of synchrotron X-radiation (D-DIA apparatus) report a &#916;V* near zero. To decipher this enigma and to provide a much-needed calibration of stress in the D-DIA apparatus, I have conducted systematic experiments on a synthetic, iron-free, forsterite at 1200 &#730;C and pressure between 1 and 2.5 GPa using the UCR 5 GPa modified Griggs apparatus, the only apparatus capable of performing these experiments. Our results show a robust &#916;V* value of 12 ± 2 cm3/mol, indicating a fairly significant pressure dependence of creep in olivine to pressures of ~3 GPa (approximately 100 km). In collaboration with other experimentalists, we plan to measure the &#916;V* for creep of this material over a pressure range of 2-8 GPa in the D-DIA apparatus to both calibrate stress measurement in the D-DIA and resolve the question of change in &#916;V* at higher pressures.

Analysis of Shear-horizontal Vibrations of Crystal Plates for Acoustic Wave Resonators and Sensors
In this work, theoretical analysis of shear-horizontal vibrations of crystal plates under lateral electric field excitation (LFE) without and with a fluid layer is presented. A crystal plate with separated electrodes under thickness electric field excitation (TFE) in contact with a fluid layer is also analyzed.We have started with analyzing the coupled face-shear (FS) and thickness-twist (TT) motions of piezoelectric plates with lateral electric fields, using the Mindlin's first-order theory of piezoelectric plates. Solutions for propagating waves, and for free and electrically-forced vibrations are obtained, leading to basic vibration characteristics for resonator applications including dispersion relations, frequency spectra, and motional capacitance. Numerical results are presented for AT-cut quartz plates. We have then studied the coupled face-shear (FS) and thickness-twist (TT) motions of a piezoelectric plate with mass layers on the central parts of the plate surfaces, driven by a lateral electric field. An analytical solution is obtained. Numerical results are presented for an AT-cut quartz plate, including the motional capacitance of the plate as a resonator and vibration modes trapped under the mass layers in the central portion of the plate. The relationship between the dimensions of the mass layers and the number of trapped modes is examined.We have studied the thickness-shear vibration of a rotated Y-cut quartz crystal plate whose one surface is in contact with a fluid layer. In this study, two configurations are considered. For the first configuration, we have analyzed the plate vibrations driven by a lateral electric field, using both the theory of piezoelectricity and the theory of Newtonian fluids. The solutions for both free and forced vibrations are obtained. Approximate expressions for the frequency shifts in the crystal plate due to the fluid are presented. The admittance of the structure is also calculated. The results illustrate the impacts of the thickness, the density and the viscosity of the fluid layer on the frequency shifts in the plate. In the second configuration, the fluid is under an electrode separated from the crystal plate and the driving electric field is in the plate thickness direction. This configuration qualitatively describes the effect of the liquid permittivity on the frequency shifts in a real LFE liquid sensor.Finally, I studied the propagation of shear-horizontal waves in a piezoelectric plate in contact with a fluid layer as an acoustic wave sensor for measuring fluid viscosity or density. Mindlin's first-order theory of piezoelectric plates and the theory of Newtonian fluids are used. Two kinds of fluid layers are considered. One is with finite thickness, and the other is semi-infinite. Approximate dispersion relations for long face-shear and thickness-twist waves are given analytically. In the first one, numerical results only show the effects of the fluid on wave characteristics. In the other, numerical results showing the effects of the fluid and the piezoelectric coupling in the plate on wave characteristics are presented.

Phenotypic and Genomic Analysis of Hypervirulent Human-associated Bordetella bronchiseptica
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						B. bronchiseptica infections are usually associated with wild or domesticated animals, but infrequently with humans. A recent phylogenetic analysis distinguished two distinct B. bronchiseptica subpopulations, designated complexes I and IV. Complex IV isolates appear to have a bias for infecting humans; however, little is known regarding their epidemiology, virulence properties, or comparative genomics.
				
				
					
						Results
					Here we report a characterization of the virulence of human-associated complex IV B. bronchiseptica strains. In in vitro cytotoxicity assays, complex IV strains showed increased cytotoxicity in comparison to a panel of complex I strains. Some complex IV isolates were remarkably cytotoxic, resulting in LDH release levels in A549 cells that were 10- to 20-fold greater than complex I strains. In vivo, a subset of complex IV strains was found to be hypervirulent, with an increased ability to cause lethal pulmonary infections in mice. Hypercytotoxicity in vitro and hypervirulence in vivo were both dependent on the activity of the bsc T3SS and the BteA effector. To clarify differences between lineages, representative complex IV isolates were sequenced and their genomes were compared to complex I isolates. Although our analysis showed there were no genomic sequences that can be considered unique to complex IV strains, there were several loci that were predominantly found in complex IV isolates.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Our observations reveal a T3SS-dependent hypervirulence phenotype in human-associated complex IV isolates, highlighting the need for further studies on the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of this B. bronchiseptica lineage.

Adsorption of Carbon, Silicon, and Germanium Adatoms on Graphene Sheet
Film growth is characterized by the making and breaking of chemical bonds. Other interactions such as Van der Waals and electrostatic forces are secondary if not negligible. The primary purpose of this thesis is to provide an assessment on how epitaxial growth on an inert substrate, i.e. no dangling bonds, can proceed. This is done by calculating the adsorption energy of carbon (C), silicon (Si), and germanium (Ge) adatoms at different sites on graphene sheet and mapping their potential energy surface. We observe that adsorption energy of carbon on graphene is the strongest, 1.45 eV more than that of silicon and 1.56 eV more than germanium. The second part of this thesis is observing how C, Si and Ge dimers behave on graphene. Carbon dimer still displays the strongest interaction with graphene, yet the binding strength of germanium dimer surpasses that of silicon's in these dimer simulations. All calculations are done by the ab-initio density functional theory.

A brief primer on microRNAs and their roles in angiogenesis
Abstract
				Development of the vasculature is a complex, dynamic process orchestrated by a balance of pro and anti-angiogenic signaling pathways. The same signaling pathways are mis-regulated and exploited during pathological angiogenesis in cancer, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases and contribute to disease progression. In the last decade, small non-coding RNA molecules termed microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as key regulators of several cellular processes including angiogenesis. It is becoming clear that miRs function in complex networks and regulate gene expression both at the mRNA and protein levels thereby altering cellular signaling responses to specific stimuli. In the vasculature, miRs can function either in a pro-angiogenic manner and potentiate angiogenesis or act as anti-angiogenic miRs by enhancing cell death and decreasing endothelial proliferation. This review aims to provide an update on how microRNAs regulate gene expression and illustrate miR function in the vasculature with a discussion of potential applications of miRs as anti-angiogenic therapeutics.

Chromosomal aneuploidy in the developing mammalian cortex
Although aneuploidy, variations in chromosome number from haploid genome multiples, is a feature of several nervous system diseases, aneuploid cells have been found in the non-diseased developing and adult brain. This genetic mosaicism may contribute to the phenotypic and functional diversity in the central nervous system. This dissertation aims to characterize aneuploidy in embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) over a time frame that coincides with neurogenesis, and to identify functional consequences of this phenomenon. As neurogenesis proceeds, neurons are produced from two genetically distinct progenitor populations. In the studies described in Chapter 2, we tested the hypothesis that these molecular differences will be reflected in changes in the rate of aneuploidy in the developing cortex. Metaphase spread analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization determined that aneuploid NPCs were present throughout neurogenesis, with peak levels found in dividing cells during the middle stage of neurogenesis. Our results revealed that lagging chromosomes, a mitotic defect that leads to aneuploidy, are evident in various stages of embryonic cortical development. The finding that aneuploidy increases during stages of cortical development when the most functionally and phenotypically varied cortical projection neurons are produced suggests that there is positive selection for cells with favorable aberrant karyotypes as a means of generating a great amount of diversity in a limited time. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) represents inactivation of a wild-type allele that renders the cell homozygous or hemizygous for a deleterious allele. Given that hyperploidy is the most common form of aneuploidy observed in NPCs, it is likely that LOH via chromosome loss may lead to changes in the developing brain. The analyses outlined in Chapter 3 determined whether mosaic aneuploidy, through LOH, influences leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR)-mediated astrocyte differentiation of NPCs. Using flow cytometry, we have shown that loss of chromosome 15, on which the LIFR allele resides, reduced the ability of cortical NPCs to generate astrocytes in response to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). In summary, this work demonstrates that aneuploidy is a normal feature of NPCs across cortical neurogenesis, and one potential outcome of this variation is a change in the balance of neural and glial cell fates

Understanding Fermentative Glycerol Metabolism and its Application for the Production of Fuels and Chemicals
Due to its availability, low-price, and higher degree of reduction than lignocellulosic sugars, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for the production of fuels and reduced chemicals.  However, this high degree of reduction of carbon atoms in glycerol also results in significant challenges in regard to its utilization under fermentative conditions.  Therefore, in order to unlock the full potential of microorganisms for the fermentative conversion of glycerol into fuels and chemicals, a detailed understanding of the anaerobic fermentation of glycerol is required.  The work presented here highlights a comprehensive experimental investigation into fermentative glycerol metabolism in Escherichia coli, which has elucidated several key pathways and mechanisms.  The activity of both the fermentative and respiratory glycerol dissimilation pathways was found to be important for maximum glycerol utilization, a consequence of the metabolic cycle and downstream effects created by the essential involvement of PEP-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) in the fermentative glycerol dissimilation pathway.  The decoupling of this cycle is of central importance during fermentative glycerol metabolism, and while multiple decoupling mechanisms were identified, their relative inefficiencies dictated not only their level of involvement, but also implicated the activity of other pathways/enzymes, including fumarate reductase and pyruvate kinase.  The central role of the PEP-dependent DHAK, an enzyme whose transcription was found to be regulated by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP)-cAMP complex, was also tied to the importance of multiple fructose 1,6-bisphosphotases (FBPases) encoded by fbp, glpX, and yggF.  The activity of these FBPases, and as a result the levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, a key regulatory compound, appear to also play a role in the involvement of several other enzymes during fermentative glycerol metabolism including PEP carboxykinase.  Using this improved understanding of fermentative glycerol metabolism as a platform, E. coli has been engineered to produce high yields and titers of ethanol (19.8 g/L, 0.46 g/g), co-produced along with hydrogen, and 1,2-propanediol (5.6 g/L, 0.21 g/g) from glycerol, demonstrating its potential as a carbon source for the production of fuels and reduced chemicals.

A CRTC2 Repressor Role Regulates DNA Damage Response Genes in Germinal Center B-cells
Post-DNA damage survival is regulated by ataxia-telengiectaia mutated (ATM) in the germinal center (GC) B-cell and is necessary for continued plasma cell development. Cell survival regulation is critical for the prevention of oncogenic transformation, as the gain of this trait is seen in many cancers. 90% of follicular lymphomas acquire resistance to apoptosis by a chromosomal translocation of the anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 gene onto the active IGH enhancer element. Bcl-2 is among a set of pro-survival genes that increase in expression at the end of a GC B-cell ATM initiated DNA damage response pathway; these genes will be referred to as DNA damage response (DDR) genes throughout this proposal. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these genes indicates that they are involved in cellular proliferation, cellular physiological processes, cell cycle, and apoptosis. ChIP-chip data reveal CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) binding to these genes prior to DNA damage, suggesting that CRTC2 has a role to repress gene expression in the absence of damage stimulus. I hypothesize that CRTC2 has a novel role to repress pro-survival genes before DNA damage in GC B-cells, and that CRTC2 repressor function on Bcl-2 can reverse the transformed state of t(14;18)-positive lymphoma cells. These studies may point to CRTC2 as a novel tumor suppressor, and provide a new target for lymphoma therapy.

Reprogramming scleroderma-specific and normal fibroblast gene subsets using single versus multiple transcription factors
The recent successes of reprogramming iPS cells and other cell types offer a novel platform that can be used to treat numerous diseases. These studies reveal that transcription factors can be used to alter gene expression, thereby reprogramming a new cellular phenotype that is eventually maintained by endogenous transcription factors. With this information, we believe it is possible to reprogram the altered phenotype of a diseased cell back to its normal state. Scleroderma in particular, is a non- curable scarring disease with a distinct phenotype that can be defined by its unique gene expression pattern. Here we report the successful induction of a subset of scleroderma-specific genes using predicted and endogenous transcription factors. Microarray data of scleroderma patients was analyzed finding 165 differentially expressed genes. Both DiRE and SynoR were bioinformatic tools employed to determine upstream regulators and downstream gene targets, respectively. Gain of function experiments were carried out as transcription factors were transiently transfected using overexpression vectors in multiple cell types and gene expression was measured via qPCR. 22% of total scleroderma-specific downstream targets were differentially expressed using predicted transcription factors. Additionally, 33% of predicted downstream targets were differentially expressed using endogenously expressed transcription factors. Our data suggest that primary sequence analysis of clusters of transcription factors binding sites in promoters is more predictive than evolutionary and conservation-based approaches alone. Our study represents a novel approach to treating and even curing disease by way of cellular reprogramming

On the dynamic behavior of mineralized tissues
Mineralized tissues, such as bone and antler, are complex hierarchical materials that have adapted over millennia to optimize strength and fracture resistance for their in vivo applications. As a structural support, skeletal bone primarily acts as a rigid framework that is resistant to fracture, and able to repair damage and adapt to sustained loads during its lifetime. Antler is typically deciduous and subjected to large bending moments and violent impacts during its annual cycle. To date, extensive characterization of the quasi-static mechanical properties of these materials has been performed. However, very little has been done to characterize their dynamic properties, despite the fact that the majority of failures in these materials occur under impact loads. Here, an in depth analysis of the dynamic mechanical behavior of these two materials is presented, using equine bone obtained post-mortem from donors ranging in age from 6 months to 28 years, and antler from the North American Elk. Specimens were tested under compressive strain rates of 10⁻³, 10⁰, and 10³ sec⁻¹ in order to investigate their strain rate dependent compressive response. Fracture toughness experiments were performed using a four-point bending geometry on single and double-notch specimens in order to measure fracture toughness, as well as observe differences in crack propagation between dynamic (2̃x10⁻⁵ MPa·m¹/²/s) and quasi-static (0̃.25 MPa·m¹/²/s) loading rates. After testing, specimens were analyzed using a combination of optical, electron and confocal microscopy. Results indicated that the mechanical response of these materials is highly dependent on loading rate. Decreasing quasi- static fracture toughness is observed with age in bone specimens, while dynamic specimens show no age trends, yet universally decreased fracture toughness compared to those tested quasi-statically. For the first time, rising R- curve behavior in bone was also shown to exist under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. Antler demonstrated itself to be extremely resistant to impact loading, often requiring multiple impacts to fracture a specimen. Microscopy observations of deformation and crack propagation mechanisms indicate that differences in mechanical behavior between bone and antler, and at varying strain rates, are the result of subtle differences in bulk composition and active microstructural toughening mechanisms

Surface preparation for ALD of High-k dielectrics on InGaAs
The key for a successful gate-first process is when subsequent processing steps cannot degrade the semiconductor, the dielectric, or the oxidesemiconductor interfaces. For silicon, the only commercial ALD high-k fabrication process, which avoids processing induced damage, is a replacement gate process (a type of gate-last process). While preparing silicon for gate-last processing is straightforward, the key to a gate-last process for III -V semiconductors is the order and cleanliness of the III- V channel prior to dielectric deposition. Aggressive oxide thickness reduction (equivalent oxide thickness, or EOT, scaling) is needed to fabricate small gate length devices with small subthreshold swings. Furthermore, aggressive EOT scaling requires a very high uniform ALD nucleation density, with no pinholes due to surface contaminants. The key barrier to solving a very practical problem is a surface chemistry challenge: develop a chemical process which removes nearly all air induced defects and contaminants and leaves the III-V surface flat and electrically active for high nucleation density ALD gate oxide deposition, which unpins the Fermi level. The following study uses scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) to observe the removal of the oxide layer and restoration of the clean InGaAs surface reconstruction with atomic hydrogen cleaning, allowing for a gate-last or replacement-gate process. Along with surface cleaning STM and STS was used to characterize the initial passivation of InGaAs surfaces via ALD of trimethyl aluminum (TMA). The substrate temperature and initial surface reconstruction was critical to forming an unpinned passivation layer with a high nucleation density. A method was developed to use Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) as a tool for insightful feedback on the electrostatics of scaled MOSFET devices. KPFM is a unique technique for providing two- dimensional potential profiles inside a working device. A procedure is described to obtain high-resolution KPFM results on ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaved III-V MOSCAPs

The Effects of Surfactant Pretreatment and Xylooligomers on Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Cellulose and Pretreated Biomass
There is a vital need to reduce enzyme costs to facilitate production of cost-competitive cellulosic ethanol and other products. End-product inhibition, declining substrate reactivity, enzyme denaturation, and non-productive binding of enzyme to lignin are among the factors that could account for the loss of enzyme effectiveness as enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass proceeds. In addition, lignin and hemicelluloses, the other two most abundant components in lignocellulosic biomass besides cellulose, are believed to be responsible for high recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass to biological conversion. This study focused on investigating the effects of hemicelluloses on enzymatic hydrolysis and developing possible strategies to overcome their negative impacts. In the first part of the study, we identified that xylooligomers released from biomass during pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis are stronger inhibitors than long known for glucose and cellobiose.  Furthermore, mixtures of xylooligomers of varying chain length were shown to dramatically decrease enzymatic conversion rates and yields of both pure cellulose and pretreated biomass. To clarify the relative importance of different xylooligomers, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was applied to separate xylooligomers according to their chain length, and selected fractions were added to pure cellulose hydrolysis to determine their relative influence on rates and yields. The degree of inhibition was found to increase with xylooligomer degree of polymerization (DP), and cellulase exhibited a greater binding affinity for birchwood xylan than pure cellulose. All of these observations suggest that xylooligomers could competitively adsorb on cellulase, thereby reducing enzyme accessibility to cellulose and cellooligomers. Consequently, applying hemicellulase to hydrolyze xylooligomers to much less inhibitory xylose prior to adding cellulase reduced this undesirable binding and was more beneficial than adding hemicellulase and cellulase together.

An investigation into the anthelmintic properties and synergistic potential of Cry5B
To examine the anthelmintic properties of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal proteins, this thesis investigates the therapeutic effects of Bt crystal protein 5B (Cry5B) as a single dose therapy against a roundworm infection in mice, and considers the synergistic potential of Cry5B in combination with a current anthelmintic. In order to examine the therapeutic effect of crude Cry5B spore crystal lysate (SCL), mice infected with Heligmosomoides bakeri L3 larvae were treated with a single dose of 50 mg/kg Cry5B SCL on day 15 post infection. The compound's effectiveness was determined by the reduction in fecal egg output and the final worm burden in treated versus placebo-treated control animals. This study finds Cry5B SCL to be highly efficacious in vivo. A follow-up experiment suggests that the crystals of Bt SCL are solely responsible for this therapeutic effect. This thesis further examines the therapeutic potential of Cry5B and levamisole against H. bakeri, using loss of motility as a marker of drug efficacy, and finds that the two compounds demonstrate strong synergy in vitro when combined at a 1:1 efficacious dose based upon their Fa30s. Further studies are warranted for an evaluation of any synergism between the two compounds in an in vivo system. Finally, the maintenance of Ancylostoma ceylanicum is detailed. This thesis confirms Cry5B's effectiveness as a therapeutic compound for the treatment of gastrointestinal nematode infections and establishes different systems in which to further test its efficacy and synergistic potential

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma modulation and lipogenic response in adipocytes of small-for-gestational age offspring
Abstract


Background
Small-for-gestational age (SGA) at birth increases risk of development of adult obesity and insulin resistance. A model of SGA rat offspring has been shown to exhibit increased adipose tissue expression of a key adipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), and increased fatty acid de novo synthesis during the nursing period, prior to onset of obesity. PPAR&#947; agonists have been studied for potential use in the prevention of insulin resistance. Moreover, SGA adipocytes exhibit age-dependent differences in lipogenesis as mediated by PPAR&#947;. The effects of PPAR&#947; modulators on lipogenic gene expression and de novo lipogenesis on the age-dependent changes in SGA adipocytes are not known. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the adipogenic and lipogenic potential in SGA adipocytes at postnatal day 1 (p1) and day 21 (p21), 2) to determine how the PPAR&#947; activator- and repressor-ligands affect the lipogenic potential, and 3) to determine the fatty acid metabolic response to PPAR&#947; activator-ligand treatment.


Methods
Primary adipocyte cultures from p1 and p21 SGA and Control male offspring were established from a known maternal food-restriction model of SGA. Cell proliferation and Oil Red O (ORO) staining were quantified. Adipocytes were treated with increasing doses of rosiglitazone or bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether (BADGE). PPAR&#947; and SREBP1 protein expression were determined. De novo lipogenesis with rosiglitazone treatment at p21 was studied using 50% U13C-glucose and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.


Results
At p1 and p21, SGA demonstrated increased cell proliferation and increased ORO staining. At p21, SGA demonstrated increased lipogenic gene expression and increased glucose-mediated fatty acid de novo synthesis compared with Controls. In response to rosiglitazone, SGA adipocytes further increased glucose utilization for fatty acid synthesis. SGA lipogenic gene expression demonstrated resistance to BADGE treatment.


Conclusions
SGA adipocytes exhibit an enhanced adipogenic and lipogenic potential in early postnatal life. By p21, SGA demonstrated resistance to PPAR&#947; repressor-ligand treatment, and selective response to high dose PPAR&#947; activator-ligand treatment in adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression. p21 SGA adipocytes revealed increased fatty acid de novo synthesis through a complex relationship with glucose metabolism.

A fungal phylogeny based on 82 complete genomes using the composition vector method
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               Molecular phylogenetics and phylogenomics have greatly revised and enriched the fungal systematics in the last two decades. Most of the analyses have been performed by comparing single or multiple orthologous gene regions. Sequence alignment has always been an essential element in tree construction. These alignment-based methods (to be called the standard methods hereafter) need independent verification in order to put the fungal Tree of Life (TOL) on a secure footing. The ever-increasing number of sequenced fungal genomes and the recent success of our newly proposed alignment-free composition vector tree (CVTree, see Methods) approach have made the verification feasible.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               In all, 82 fungal genomes covering 5 phyla were obtained from the relevant genome sequencing centers. An unscaled phylogenetic tree with 3 outgroup species was constructed by using the CVTree method. Overall, the resultant phylogeny infers all major groups in accordance with standard methods. Furthermore, the CVTree provides information on the placement of several currently unsettled groups. Within the sub-phylum Pezizomycotina, our phylogeny places the Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes as sister taxa. Within the Sordariomycetes, it infers that Magnaporthe grisea and the Plectosphaerellaceae are closely related to the Sordariales and Hypocreales, respectively. Within the Eurotiales, it supports that Aspergillus nidulans is the early-branching species among the 8 aspergilli. Within the Onygenales, it groups Histoplasma and Paracoccidioides together, supporting that the Ajellomycetaceae is a distinct clade from Onygenaceae. Within the sub-phylum Saccharomycotina, the CVTree clearly resolves two clades: (1) species that translate CTG as serine instead of leucine (the CTG clade) and (2) species that have undergone whole-genome duplication (the WGD clade). It places Candida glabrata at the base of the WGD clade.
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               Using different input data and methodology, the CVTree approach is a good complement to the standard methods. The remarkable consistency between them has brought about more confidence to the current understanding of the fungal branch of TOL.

Atypical rearrangement involving 3¿-IGH@ and a breakpoint at least 400 Kb upstream of an intact MYC in a CLL patient with an apparently balanced t(8;14)(q24.1;q32) and negative MYC expression
Abstract
				The t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), the cytogenetic hallmark of Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma, is also found, but rarely, in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Such translocation typically results in a MYC-IGH@ fusion subsequently deregulating and overexpressing MYC on der 14q32. In CLL, atypical rearrangements resulting in its gain or loss, within or outside of IGH@ or MYC locus, have been reported, but their clinical significance remains uncertain. Herein, we report a 67&#8201;year-old male with complex cytogenetic findings of apparently balanced t(8;14) and unreported complex rearrangements of IGH@ and MYC loci. His clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features were consistent with the diagnosis of CLL.Interphase FISH studies revealed deletions of 11q22.3 and 13q14.3, and an extra copy of IGH@, indicative of rearrangement. Karyotype analysis showed an apparently balanced t(8;14)(q24.1;q32). Sequential GPG-metaphase FISH studies revealed abnormal signal patterns: rearrangement of IGH break apart probe with the 5&#8217;-IGH@ on derivative 8q24.1 and the 3&#8217;-IGH@ retained on der 14q; absence of MYC break apart-specific signal on der 8q; and, the presence of unsplit 5&#8217;-MYC-3&#8217; break apart probe signals on der 14q. The breakpoint on 8q24.1 was found to be at least 400 Kb upstream of 5&#8217; of MYC. In addition, FISH studies revealed two abnormal clones; one with 13q14.3 deletion, and the other, with concurrent 11q deletion and atypical rearrangements. Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) detected a 7.1&#8201;Mb deletion on 11q22.3-q23.3 including ATM, a finding consistent with FISH results. While no significant copy number gain or loss observed on chromosomes 8, 12 and 13, a 455 Kb microdeletion of uncertain clinical significance was detected on 14q32.33. Immunohistochemistry showed co-expression of CD19, CD5, and CD23, positive ZAP-70 expression and absence of MYC expression. Overall findings reveal an apparently balanced t(8;14) and atypical complex rearrangements involving 3&#8217;-IGH@ and a breakpoint at least 400 Kb upstream of MYC, resulting in the relocation of the intact 5&#8217;-MYC-3&#8217; from der 8q, and apposition to 3&#8217;-IGH@ at der 14q. This case report provides unique and additional cytogenetic data that may be of clinical significance in such a rare finding in CLL. It also highlights the utility of conventional and sequential metaphase FISH in understanding complex chromosome anomalies and their association with other clinical findings in patients with CLL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLL reported case with such an atypical rearrangement in a patient with a negative MYC expression.

Interplay of superconductivity, magnetism, and density waves in rare-earth tritellurides and iron-based superconducting materials
Superconductivity, charge- and spin-density waves are collective electronic phenomena that originate from electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and the concept of Fermi surface competition between these collective states is one of the most fundamental problems of condensed matter physics. High pressures provide a clean method to tune the electronic properties that determine the superconducting, magnetic or charge-ordered ground states of complex materials. The charge-density wave, magnetic and superconducting ordered states of the rare-earth tritellurides system, and the interplay between the spin-density wave, localized magnetism and superconductivity in the recently discovered Fe-based high -temperature superconductors, have been investigated under extreme conditions of pressure, magnetic field and low temperatures

Targeting choroid plexus epithelia and ventricular ependyma  for drug delivery to  the central nervous system
Abstract
Background
Because the choroid plexus (CP) is uniquely suited to control the composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), there may be therapeutic benefits to increasing the levels of biologically active proteins in CSF to modulate central nervous system (CNS) functions. To this end, we sought to identify peptides capable of ligand-mediated targeting to CP epithelial cells reasoning that they could be exploited to deliver drugs, biotherapeutics and genes to the CNS.

Methods
A peptide library displayed on M13 bacteriophage was screened for ligands capable of internalizing into CP epithelial cells by incubating phage with CP explants for 2 hours at 37C and recovering particles with targeting capacity.

Results
Three peptides, identified after four rounds of screening, were analyzed for specific and dose dependant binding and internalization. Binding was deemed specific because internalization was prevented by co-incubation with cognate synthetic peptides. Furthermore, after i.c.v. injection into rat brains, each peptide was found to target phage to epithelial cells in CP and to ependyma lining the ventricles.

Conclusion
These data demonstrate that ligand-mediated targeting can be used as a strategy for drug delivery to the central nervous system and opens the possibility of using the choroid plexus as a portal of entry into the brain.

Elucidating the Roles of XPMC2H and Spin3 in Mitosis
Mitosis is a highly regulated set of events that culminates in cell division and the segregation of an equal amount of genetic material to two daughter cells. XPMC2H is a protein that has been implicated in cell division, but its exact role is uncertain. It is linked to suppressing tumors by correcting mitotic defects, regulating transcription, and modifying ribosomes. The Spin3 protein is associated with mitotic spindle organization and stability; however, its physiological function is also unknown. To clarify the roles of XPMC2H and Spin3 in cell division, their complexes were purified so that their protein interactors could be identified. In addition, the cellular consequences of modulating the protein levels of XPMC2H and Spin3 were analyzed in human cancer cells. XPMC2H was found to localize to the nucleus, specifically to the DNA, while Spin3 was found to localize to the mitotic spindles. Lowering the expression levels of either protein causes human cells to become irregularly shaped, abnormally sized, and multi-nucleated. Lastly, I discovered that Spin3 interacts with the PRMT5 complex.

Calcium imaging and the neurovascular unit : challenging the role of astrocytes as mediators of neurovascular coupling
Historically, experimental methods to investigate astrocyte function in the intact brain have been limited by the fact that glia are electrically silent. This has led to a heavy reliance on calcium imaging techniques in the study of astrocyte function. In the past decade, the widespread use of this technique, particularly in vivo, has pushed the boundaries of what can be accomplished with fluorescent imaging. This series of studies is dedicated to taking that boundary a step further, utilizing the technology currently available to ask fundamental questions regarding the neurovascular unit (NVU), and concluding with some perspectives on the advances still needed to fully elucidate the functional role of astrocytes within the NVU. In considering the vascular aspect of the NVU, we compare the in vivo temporal characteristics of the cerebral blood vessel dilation and the astrocytic calcium response to increased neuronal activity. We provide evidence of a significant temporal mismatch that challenges the popular idea of a calcium- dependent astrocytic role in triggering neurovascular coupling. In considering the metabolic aspect of the NVU, we report here the first application of 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) to functional imaging of intrinsically fluorescent ß-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as a means to visualize single cell metabolism in vivo. We demonstrate that astrocytes respond rapidly to evoked neuronal activity. We suggest that astrocytes are actually very sensitive to neuronal activity, and do respond on a relevant time scale, but do not necessarily act as mediators in translating neuronal activity to the vasculature. Given their prominent yet mysterious place within the NVU, there is a great need to identify suitable methodologies to describe the large repertoire of astrocytic calcium dynamics, ranging from subcellular compartments to network-level waves. Toward this end, we report on the application of optical flow image analysis to calcium signaling dynamics in spontaneously forming networks of astrocytes and neurons. By using information gained from a reduced preparation in conjunction with the whole animal approach, we hope to contribute to the set of tools that will be necessary to accurately assess the role(s) of astrocytes within the NVU

Nano fabrication approaches for patterned magnetic recording media
Bit patterned media (BPM) have received increased attention in recent years as the primary candidate for 1 Terabit/in2 or higher recording density. A patterned media consists of an array of well-defined magnetic nanostructures, each of which can store one bit of data. In the simplest scheme, the structures could be magnetic pillars and dots with a single easy axis of magnetization. The direction of magnetization is interpreted as a binary 1 or 0. Some of the main technical issues in the BPM include the difficulty in fabricating small nano-island arrays in a periodic fashion over large areas, reliability /reproducibility of magnetic bit characteristics, wear and head flyability issue which is associated with the media surface roughness, and processing cost. This thesis deals with investigation of various fabrication approaches, nanostructural features, and magnetic properties for the bit patterned media. In Chapter 1, the science and technology of patterned magnetic recording media are discussed. In Chapter 2, fabrication of an array of high- coercivity magnetic Co/Pd multilayered islands using pre- patterned Si nanopillars template is described. The Si nanopillars have been prepared by advanced electron beam lithography (EBL) and reactive ion etching (RIE). In Chapter 3, the flying instability of the read/write recording head-slider on the topographically rough surfaces of the nano-patterned media is discussed, and technical approaches to overcome such a problem is described, such as planarization of nanopatterned topography by refilling the trenches and flatten the surface of the BPM. I have investigated the head flyability on BPM by fabricating nano pillar geometry with different topography. For flyability testing that requires a relatively large area, I have also fabricated nano pillars on 2.5 inch glass disks with a distribution of pillar size and periodicity using the "silver ball-up process" and RIE. The process, structure and properties of planarized vs. non-planarized nano fabricated and imprinted BPM, are described in Chapter 4. A Si substrate was spin-coated with a thin PMMA layer, and a periodic island array was made by nano-imprinting lithography (NIL) with the patterned nanofeatures. The subsequent pattern transfer to the Si substrate was performed by using RIE process. A Co/Pd multilayer film was sputtered on the pre- patterned substrate. A HSQ layer was first spin coated on the patterned media to fill the trenches and subsequently re-etched by RIE to remove the overfilled regions on the substrate for planarization. In Chapter 5, the effect of magnetic island geometry on switching field distribution is discussed

From Seed Banks to Communities: Effects of Plant Invasions and Nitrogen Deposition on Desert Annual Forbs
Desert ecosystems in California have been negatively impacted by the invasion of exotic plant species and increased nitrogen inputs due to anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition acts as an artificial fertilizer in nutrient-poor desert soil, often increasing the growth of invasive species. This can alter species composition, soil nutrient cycling, and fire risk. Although several studies have focused on the impacts of increased nitrogen deposition on invasive species, fewer studies have examined its impact on native annual species and how nitrogen affects their interactions with invasive species. The purpose of this dissertation research was to understand how nitrogen deposition affects native and invasive annual species in the desert from the level of the seed to the community. A seed bank study demonstrated that, although aboveground percent cover of invasive plants can increase under nitrogen fertilization, the soil seed bank was not affected. Rather, invasive plant seeds overwhelmed the seed bank in both unfertilized and fertilized plots. A follow-up study explored seed germination responses to a range of soil nitrogen concentrations and found that species identity may be more important in determining germination differences than soil nitrogen concentration. A greenhouse study measured the growth of native and invasive annuals under a combination of nitrogen and watering treatments. This study showed that both native and invasive species could benefit from increased soil water and nitrogen availability and highlighted the importance of sufficient water in order for natives to take advantage of excess nitrogen. The invasive forb, <italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic>, was able to utilize increased nitrogen with less sensitivity to water availability. Finally, a field-fertilization and invasive removal study was used to elicit the effects of increased nitrogen on native annuals in the field and their competitive interactions with invasive annuals. The results demonstrated that native annuals could make use of increased nitrogen in years with sufficient precipitation and that natives can coexist with invasive species at low densities, even with high nitrogen inputs. Understanding how the annual plant community is affected by nitrogen deposition and exotic invasion is essential for the conservation and restoration of ecosystem function in California's deserts.

Algerian Ivy Removal Techniques along a Riparian Zone in Berkeley, California
Algerian ivy is an invasive non-native vine that limits native plant biodiversity. In this study I examined three removal techniques for managing Algerian ivy: manual removal, foliar herbicide application (round up® Pro), and cut-stem herbicide application. I hypothesized that cut-stem herbicide application would be the most effective removal technique and that both herbicide applications would not affect native seedling growth. I measured plots monthly for ivy and native seedling growth and analyzed results using a random complete block design, tukey-Kramer analysis, and Simpson’s diversity Index (SdI). I found no significant difference in ivy re-growth among treatments and no significant difference in native seedling growth between plots. However, manual removal plots had an SdI double that of other treatments (0.7652). Based on these results, I recommend that further use of herbicides be ceased until investigations into the effects of herbicide on native plant diversity have been completed.

Mesoscale coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks in boundary current systems
The focus of this dissertation is on studying ocean- atmosphere (OA) interactions in the Humboldt Current System (HCS) and Kuroshio Extension (KE) region using satellite observations and the Scripps Coupled Ocean- Atmosphere Regional (SCOAR) model. Within SCOAR, a new technique is introduced by implementing an interactive 2-D spatial smoother within the SST-flux coupler to remove the mesoscale SST field felt by the atmosphere. This procedure allows large-scale SST coupling to be preserved while extinguishing the mesoscale eddy impacts on the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This technique provides insights to spatial-scale dependence of OA coupling, and the impact of mesoscale features on both the ABL and the surface ocean. For the HCS, the use of downscaled forcing from SCOAR, as compared to NCEP Reanalysis 2, proves to be more appropriate in quantifying wind-driven upwelling indices along the coast of Peru and Chile. The difference in their wind stress distribution has significant impact on the wind-driven upwelling processes and total upwelling transport along the coast. Although upwelling induced by coastal Ekman transport dominates the wind-driven upwelling along coastal areas, Ekman pumping can account for 30% of the wind-driven upwelling in several coastal locations. Control SCOAR shows significant SST-wind stress coupling during fall and winter, while Smoothed SCOAR shows insignificant coupling throughout, indicating the important role of ocean mesoscale eddies on air-sea coupling in HCS. The SST-wind stress coupling however, did not produce any rectified response on the ocean eddies. Coupling between SST, wind speed and latent heat flux is insignificant on large-scale coupling and full coupling mode. On the other hand, coupling between these three variables are significant on the mesoscale for most of the model run, which suggests that mesoscale SST affects latent heat through direct flux anomalies as well as indirectly through stability changes on the overlying atmosphere, which affects surface wind speeds and thus latent heat flux. In the KE region, differences in the strength of coupling between the Control and Smoothed SCOAR runs indicate how the spatial scale of SST fronts affects the OA coupling via two distinct mechanisms, the vertical mixing mechanism (VMM) and the pressure adjustment mechanism (PAM). Intuitively, one might expect that the VMM would be most active on the ocean mesoscale and less significant on the large scale. Instead, the model revealed that the VMM, expressed through the coupling between downwind SST gradient and wind stress divergence, acts strongly on both the large scale and mesoscale. In contrast, coupling between crosswind SST gradients and wind stress curl is seen on the mesoscale, but extinguished over large-scale SST gradients, revealing the vital role of ocean mesoscale. For PAM, one might expect the large-scale coupling to be dominant in establishing the PAM. Instead, model results suggest that in PAM, the coupling between the Laplacian of sea level pressure and surface wind convergence are active on both the mesoscale and the large scale, though the coupling strength nearly doubles with the inclusion of ocean mesoscale. Ocean mesoscale imprints are also seen on precipitation anomalies, for which their differences are more aligned with the differences in SST gradients and surface wind convergence rather than SST anomalies

Microbe-metazoan interactions at Pacific Ocean methane seeps
Methane seeps host a diversity of metazoans that co-occur with chemoautotrophic Bacteria and Archaea, providing a model system to study trophic microbe-metazoan interactions. The goal of this dissertation is to characterize and quantify the types of microbial production consumed by methane-seep fauna. Through combined laboratory and field studies from four methane seep locations (11 New Zealand sites; Eel River; Hydrate Ridge; and Costa Rica's Mound 12), I found that aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria and the syntrophic partnership which mediates the anaerobic oxidation of methane are consumed within metazoan food webs. In New Zealand, two communities were largely fueled by methane : (1) a sponge which provided a habitat and trophic conduit of methane- derived production to a diversity of fauna and (2) ampharetid polychaete beds. These ampharetid beds formed a distinct community which was fueled by aerobic methane- oxidizing bacteria, as shown through stable isotopic and fatty-acid analysis coupled to a mass-specific mixing model. The Dorvilleidae, a polychaete family which excels at inhabiting areas with high microbial production, provided a ideal taxa to study metazoan trophic linkages to Archaea. In the laboratory, I raised Ophryotrocha labronica, a dorvilleid, from egg to reproduction on monocultures of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic food sources. This demonstrated that all domains of life can support viable metazoan populations. In contrast to current biomarker paradigms, this species exhibited isotopic enrichment (not composition) which was food- source specific whereas fatty-acid signature was largely not; a finding that explained many of the patterns observed in the field studies. Although archaeal biomarkers were not transferred from diet to consumer, sulfate-reducing bacteria, a member of the assemblage responsible for the anaerobic oxidation of methane, provided a mechanism that identified archaeal aggregates as a food source for dorvilleids in both authigenic- carbonate and soft-sediment habitats. As a final example of microbial-metazoan interactions, during the formal description of a novel species of Yeti crab, I identified how this crab farms chemosynthetic-epibiotic bacteria by waving its bacteria-covered setae in methane-seep fluid. This research demonstrates the ubiquity of strong trophic links between chemoautotrophic microbes and heterotrophic metazoans while highlighting how these interactions vary among site and habitat at seeps

Particle dynamics in nanopore systems
In this dissertation, I discuss various aspects of the dynamics of charged particles in nanopore systems. In recent years, there have been numerous studies of organic and inorganic nanopores. Nonetheless, there is still much to be understood about these systems. I begin by summarizing some of the important literature on nanopore systems as well as the dynamics of ions in aqueous solutions. An important tool for studying these systems at the nanoscopic level has been molecular dynamics. Some of the techniques and methods of molecular dynamics will be discussed. Additionally, theoretical calculations of electronic transport have been demonstrated to be potentially useful for predicting the conductivity of a DNA base between two electrodes in a nanopore. These electronic current calculations will be discussed. I continue by discussing the effect of noise on DNA sequencing via transverse electronic transport. Although previous theoretical studies have shown that measuring the transverse current across DNA strands while they translocate through a nanopore or channel may provide a statistically distinguishable signature of the DNA bases, and may thus allow for rapid DNA sequencing, fluctuations of the environment, such as ionic and DNA motion, introduce important scattering processes that may affect the viability of this approach. Theoretical calculations and modeling are used to address this issue. Next, I will present a study of the dynamics of ions in a nanopore system under an alternating electric field. In this case, a nanopore in ionic solution acts as a capacitor with memory (memcapacitor) at various frequencies and strengths of the electric field. Most importantly, the hysteresis loop of this memcapacitor shows both negative and diverging capacitance as a function of the voltage. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simple, physically motivated model is presented to explore this phenomenon. Finally, I will discuss an aspect of ionic conduction in nanopores. Making an analogy to classical Coulomb blockade, where the electrostatic interactions of electrons causes an increased resistance of a device with a tunnel junction, I discuss the buildup of ions at the neck of a nanopore and the effect of this on ionic conduction. Molecular dynamics simulations and a rate model will be employed to study this effect

               Recent studies in genomics have highlighted the significance of structural variation in determining individual variation. Current methods for identifying structural variation, however, are predominantly focused on either assembling whole genomes from scratch, or identifying the relatively small changes between a genome and a reference sequence. While significant progress has been made in recent years on both de novo assembly and resequencing (read mapping) methods, few attempts have been made to bridge the gap between them.

We propose a novel graph construction that builds upon the well-known de Bruijn graph to incorporate the reference, and describe a simple algorithm, based on iterative message passing, which uses this information to significantly improve assembly results. We validate our method by applying it to a series of 5 Mb simulation genomes derived from both mammalian and bacterial references. The results of applying our method to this simulation data are presented along with a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of this technique.

Circadian Gene Networks In Bone Regeneration
BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that vitamin D played a significant role in bone regeneration, facilitating the establishment of implant osseointegration. A whole genome microarray study further suggested that the vitamin D axis might involve circadian rhythm gene expression in the bone peripheral tissue.OBJECTIVES: To identify key gene networks involved with vitamin D receptor in the bone regeneration process and to explore any correlation with circadian rhythm gene expression in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMSC). METHODS: The available whole gene microarray data was analyzed using the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) R package and Cytoscape software. Any gene expression correlation was examined for vitamin D receptor (VDR) as well as circadian rhythm genes. Separately, Per 1 luciferase transgenic Wistar rats were then applied for in vitro evaluation on BMSC circadian rhythm. Per1::luc BMSCs were seeded on 35mm dishes and forskolin-synchronized luminescence was recorded across different media conditions. The recording media included growth medium containing F12 (10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% Pen-Strep and antibiotic) supplemented with or without 1 nM 1,25D. Luminescence was also recorded in F12 growth medium containing bone differentiation factors (beta glycerophosphate, Ascorbic acid and Dexamethasone) supplemented with 0, 1 or 10 nM 1,25D. RESULTS: A total of 47 gene network modules, based on the correlation between gene significance values and module membership, were generated. The "Blue" module contained VDR. With a threshold of 17 and median of 13, VDR exhibited 35 gene connections as well as correlation values of 0.31 and 0.55 for OSV+ (vitamin D sufficient condition) and OSV- (vitamin D insufficient condition) respectively. NPAS2, CLOCK, BMAL1 and casein kinase 1 were directly connected to VDR. Per1-3 and cry1-2 were each found in a different module with generally low correlation values. In vitro luminescence measures of Per1::luc rat BMSC showed a dose dependent sustained increase in Per 1 expression with the addition of 1,25D to the F12 growth medium as well as osteogenic differentiation medium. The baseline subtracted luminescence data indicated that the circadian pattern of BMSC was maintained with 1,25D supplementation.  CONCLUSION: The WGCNA data suggests that VDR may serve as the main coordinator, or hub gene, strongly correlated with the identified circadian rhythm genes. The forskolin-synchronized expression of Per1::luc exhibited circadian expression in BMSC in vitro. 1,25D supplementation significantly and dose dependently increased the baseline expression of Per1::luc, whereas the circadian rhythm was maintained. We postulate that the physiological regulation of vitamin D may mediate gene network organization via circadian rhythm gene hubs during the bone regeneration or remodeling process.

Airfoil sampling of a pulsed Laval beam with tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry: Application to low--temperature kinetics and product
detection
A new pulsed Laval nozzle apparatus with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron
photoionization quadrupole mass spectrometry is constructed to study low-temperature radicalneutral
chemical reactions of importance for modeling the atmosphere of Titan and the outer
planets. A design for the sampling geometry of a pulsed Laval nozzle expansion has been
developed that operates successfully for the determination of rate coefficients by time-resolved
mass spectrometry. The new concept employs airfoil sampling of the collimated expansion with
excellent sampling throughput. Time-resolved profiles of the high Mach number gas flow
obtained by photoionization signals show that perturbation of the collimated expansion by the
airfoil is negligible. The reaction of C2H with C2H2 is studied at 70 K as a proof-of-principle
result for both low-temperature rate coefficient measurements and product identification based
on the photoionization spectrum of the reaction product versus VUV photon energy. This
approach can be used to provide new insights into reaction mechanisms occurring at kinetic rates
close to the collision-determined limit.

Early Tumor Detection by  Active Feedback MR Molecular Imaging
Sensitive imaging of superparamagnetic nanoparticles or aggregates is of great importance in magnetic resonance molecular imaging and medical diagnosis. For this purpose, a conceptually new approach, termed "active feedback magnetic resonance", was developed. In the presence of the Zeeman field, a dipolar field is induced by the superparamagnetic nanoparticles or aggregates. Such dipolar field creates a spatial and temporal (due to water diffusion) variations to the precession frequency of the near-by water 1H magnetization. Sensitive imaging of magnetic nanoparticles or aggregates can be achieved by manipulating the intrinsic spin dynamics by "selective self-excitation" and "fixed-point dynamics" under active feedback fields. Phantom experiments of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, in vitro experiments of brain tissue with blood clots, and in vivo mouse images of colon cancers labeled by magnetic nanoparticles suggest this new approach provide enhanced, robust, and positive contrast in imaging magnetic nanoparticles or aggregates for early lesion detection.

Enzyme Mediated Synthesis of a Semiconducting Metal Oxide
Enzymes are an important class of biological molecules, their specific functionality being exploited to perform tasks beyond the reach of conventional chemistry. Because they are operational under environmentally friendly, ambient conditions, the adaptation of these biomacromolecules can be used to replace current energy intensive and environmentally harsh synthesis methods for materials applications. One possible use of the enzyme urease is to modify the solution environment of a water soluble and stable TiO2 precursor under benign conditions. The intended result of this process would be to yield TiO2 nanostructures of controlled size. These TiO2 nanostructures can be utilized for numerous engineering applications such as low cost photovoltaics and photocatalysis. The motivation behind this work is to produce titanium dioxide using an ambient temperature, near neutral pH, one-pot synthesis method. Furthermore to make this process suitable for industrial application this work also focuses on immobilizing the enzyme for increased stability and reusability.

Sites of self-pollen tube inhibition in Papaveraceae (sensu lato)
Angiosperms prevent inbreeding with a number of molecular mechanisms. Papaver rheoas (Papaveraceae) has a gametophytic self-incompatibility system that is well- characterized at the molecular level. In Papaver, self pollen is arrested immediately upon contact with the stigma. Immediate pollen arrest may be required because Papaver flowers have stigmatic rays directly on top of the ovary and no style. There is much variation in floral structures among Papaveraceae and self-incompatibility is widespread. However, except for Papaver, no documentation of the site of self-pollen tube inhibition within the family exists. We examined the site of self-pollen tube inhibition in four species of Papaveraceae representing a broad phylogenetic and morphological sample. We used two types of tissue preparation. Squash preparation was used for species with soft stigmas while woody tissue was sectioned with a cryostat and panels were stitched into a mosaic to visualize whole stigmas. In three species, self- pollen tube inhibition appeared similar to that described for P. rheoas, despite variation in the architecture of female tissues. Self-tubes were arrested early and usually did not grow longer than 100 Mu. In Argemone munita, self pollen tubes progressed further, growing up to 500 Mu. However, growth appeared to occur along the stigmatic hairs and ceased once tubes contacted the stigma surface. Despite variation in floral architecture, rapid death of self-pollen tubes occurs before or just after penetration of female tissue in all species examined. This is consistent with the hypothesis that members of the family share the same incompatibility mechanism

Role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in neonatal lung development under hypoxic stress
Hypoxia is a condition associated with many pulmonary diseases and can induce tissue and vascular remodeling, which can result in many pathological conditions. Since Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP) family can alter the components of the matrix and thus is an important facilitator of the remodeling process; we chose to study the impact of MMP-9, a member of the MMP family that has been shown to be involved in many hypoxia-induced diseases, in hypoxia-induced lung remodeling in immature mice. MMP - 9 knockout (KO) mice and FVB controls (background for MMP- 9 KO) were both ex- posed to either 11%O2 or room air from postnatal days 2 to 17. At P17, mice were sacrificed and lungs were processed for protein and histology. In hypoxia, the survival rate of MMP-9 KO mice was significantly lower than MMP-9 WT mice. MMP-9 KO mice that survived hypoxia exposure were significantly smaller than MMP-9 WT mice. Histology revealed that MMP-9 KO mice that survived hypoxia had increased muscularized vessels and larger alveolar diameter than MMP-9 WT mice. Protein analysis demonstrated significant changes in ECM and overall increased in MMP expression in MMP-9 KO mice compared to MMP-9 WT exposed to chronic hypoxia. Our study indicates that MMP-9 may play a critical role in hypoxia-induced tissue and vascular remodeling. Deletion of this protein results in increased mortality that may be associated with increased smooth muscle proliferation and increased alveolar diameter

SOX2 Co-Occupies Distal Enhancer Elements with Distinct POU Factors in ESCs and NPCs to Specify Cell State
SOX2 is a master regulator of both pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and multipotent neural progenitor cells (NPCs); however, we currently lack a detailed understanding of how SOX2 controls these distinct stem cell populations. Here we show by genome-wide analysis that, while SOX2 bound to a distinct set of gene promoters in ESCs and NPCs, the majority of regions coincided with unique distal enhancer elements, important cis-acting regulators of tissue-specific gene expression programs. Notably, SOX2 bound the same consensus DNA motif in both cell types, suggesting that additional factors contribute to target specificity. We found that, similar to its association with OCT4 (Pou5f1) in ESCs, the related POU family member BRN2 (Pou3f2) co-occupied a large set of putative distal enhancers with SOX2 in NPCs. Forced expression of BRN2 in ESCs led to functional recruitment of SOX2 to a subset of NPC-specific targets and to precocious differentiation toward a neural-like state. Further analysis of the bound sequences revealed differences in the distances of SOX and POU peaks in the two cell types and identified motifs for additional transcription factors. Together, these data suggest that SOX2 controls a larger network of genes than previously anticipated through binding of distal enhancers and that transitions in POU partner factors may control tissue-specific transcriptional programs. Our findings have important implications for understanding lineage specification and somatic cell reprogramming, where SOX2, OCT4, and BRN2 have been shown to be key factors.

Vortices in Brain waves
Interactions by mutual excitation in neural populations in human and animal brains cre- ate a mesoscopic order parameter that is recorded in brain waves (electroencephalogram, EEG). Spatially and spectrally distributed oscillations are imposed on the background activity by inhibitory feedback in the gamma range (30–80 Hz). Beats recur at theta rates (3–7 Hz), at which the order parameter transiently approaches zero and micro- scopic activity becomes disordered. After these null spikes, the order parameter resurges and initiates a frame bearing a mesoscopic spatial pattern of gamma amplitude modu- lation that governs the microscopic activity, and that is correlated with behavior. The brain waves also reveal a spatial pattern of phase modulation in the form of a cone. Using the formalism of the dissipative many-body model of brain, we describe the null spike as a singularity, the following amplitude pattern as a ground state, and the phase cone as the manifestation of a stabilizing vortex.

The role of macrophage chemoattractant signaling in cancer cell migration, metastasis and neovascularization
Tumor-associated macrophages possess the potential to contribute to cancer progression by modulation of immune function, angiogenesis, and cell metastasis. However, understanding of the chemokine signaling networks that regulate this process is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of CT26 colon cancer cells with RAW 264.7 macrophage conditioned media induces cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Genetic profiling indicated that chemokines SDF-1alpha and VEGF are upregulated in tumor- stimulated macrophages and contribute to tumor cell migration in vitro. Macrophages also showed a robust chemotactic response towards tumor-derived chemokines. Microarray analysis and functional testing revealed CSF-1 as the major chemoattractant for macrophages. In the in vivo CAM model, RAW macrophages localized specifically to the tumor periphery where they were found to increase CT26 tumor growth, microvascular density, vascular disruption, and lung metastasis suggesting these cells home to actively invading areas of the tumor, but not the hypoxic core of the tumor mass. Additionally, hypoxic conditions down-regulated CSF-1 production in several tumor cell lines and decreased macrophage migration in vitro. Taken together our findings suggest that normoxic tumor cells release CSF-1 to recruit macrophages to the tumor periphery where they secrete mitogenic and angiogenic factors that facilitate tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis

Controlled nanostructures for enhanced biological responses and release of incorporated biomolecules
In terms of biomaterial development and implant technology, the cellular response can be affected by topographical circumstances. In the field of in vitro cell biology, there is a growing body of data that shows how cells respond positively to substrate topography, particularly in the nanoscale regime. The role of a substrate is more than merely providing mechanical support; it acts as an intelligent surface providing physical, chemical and topographical signals, which guide and control cellular behavior. Fabricating nanostructures on surfaces provides features that are on the same scale as cellular features and biological entities. Influencing cell behavior using substrate nanotopography is an attractive strategy for regenerative medicine applications and advanced tissue engineering. New fabrication technologies and new nanotechnologies have provided biomaterial scientists with enormous possibilities when designing customized tissue culture supports and scaffolds with controlled nanoscale topography. The goal is to effectively design scaffolds by choosing the appropriate combination of biomaterials, surface chemistry, geometric design, and physical properties to be able to (a.) tailor towards applications as challenging and complex as stem cell differentiation and to be able to (b.) release incorporated biomolecules for therapeutically enhancing cellular environments. This work has emphasis on the observed effects of nanostructured surfaces on various cell behaviors, specifically morphological modulation, enhanced functionality, and guided stem cell differentiation into lineage specific cell types using nanotubes and nanopillars. Additional discussion will focus on sustained, improved bioavailability of drugs incorporated in surface nanostructured "motherships" for long term drug release. Lastly, new scaffold topographic designs and surface structure variations are considered with unique approaches to further i) control cell behavior for tissue engineering therapies and implant designs and ii) tailor release of biomolecules for therapeutic applications

Antitumor effects of L-BLP25 Antigen-Specific tumor immunotherapy in a novel human MUC1 transgenic lung cancer mouse model
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					L-BLP25 antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic agent is currently in phase III clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer. Using a novel human MUC1 transgenic (hMUC1.Tg) lung cancer mouse model, we evaluated effects of L-BLP25 combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) pretreatment on Th1/Th2 cytokine production and antitumor activity.
				
				
					
						Methods
					A chemically-induced lung tumor model was developed in hMUC1.Tg C57BL/6 mice by administering 10 weekly 0.75-mg/g doses of the chemical carcinogen urethane by intraperitoneal injection. Serum cytokines associated with Th1/Th2 polarization and inflammation were measured by multiplex cytokine assay during tumorigenesis. Antitumor activity of L-BLP25 (10&#160;&#956;g) with CPA (100&#160;mg/kg) pretreatment was evaluated following either one or two eight-week&#160;cycles of treatment by preparing lung whole mounts and counting tumor foci, and assessing IFN-&#947; production by ELISpot assay.
				
				
					
						Results
					During the carcinogenesis phase, no detectable Th1- or Th2-associated cytokine responses were observed, but levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased with distinctive kinetics. A single cycle of L-BLP25 consisting of eight weekly doses was ineffective, whereas adding a second&#160;cycle given during tumor progression showed a significant reduction in the incidence of tumor foci. Administering two cycles of L-BLP25 induced Th1 cytokines IL-12, IL-2 and IFN&#947; at 24&#160;h after the last dose, while Th2 and inflammatory cytokines were elevated to a lesser extent.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Urethane-induced lung tumors in hMUC1.Tg mice can be used as a model to assess the efficacy of the MUC1 antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic agent L-BLP25. The results indicate that the antitumor response to L-BLP25 requires at least two cycles and pre-treatment with CPA. In addition, monitoring pro-inflammatory serum cytokines may be useful as a biomarker of L-BLP25 response. Taken together, the preclinical lung tumor model can be utilized for determining effective combinations of L-BLP25 with chemotherapy and/or other immunotherapies.

The Nature of Low-ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs
The tight correlations between properties of galaxy bulges and their central supermassive black holes have been reproduced successfully in simulations of galaxy collisions if feedback processes are invoked. Mergers of gas-rich galaxies of comparable size have been shown to trigger starbursts, fuel the central black holes, and transform disks into ellipticals. Feedback from the black hole accretion in the form of extreme outflows has need suggested as the mechanism by which the black hole stop its own growth and quenches the star formation in the galaxy by expelling the gas supply. Such winds have been detected in Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSOs.  However, observational evidence that BAL QSOs may be an evolutionary link between mergers and QSO is missing.In this thesis, we provide the first detailed study of the spectral energy distributions and host galaxy morphologies of a statistically significant volume-limited sample of 22 optically-selected low-ionization Broad Absorption Line QSOs (LoBALs) at 0.5 < z < 0.6.  By comparing their mid-IR spectral properties and far-IR SEDs with those of a control sample of 35 non-LoBALs (non-LoBALs) matched in M_i, we investigate the differences between the two populations in terms of their infrared emission and star formation activity.  We model the SEDs and decouple the AGN and starburst contributions to the far-infrared luminosity in LoBALs and in non-LoBALs. We estimate star formation rates (SFRs) corrected for the AGN contribution to the FIR flux and find that LoBALs have comparable levels of star formation activity to non-LoBALs when considering the entire samples.  Overall, our results show that there is no strong evidence from the mid- and far-IR properties that LoBALs are drawn from a different parent population than non-LoBALs. We conducted the first high-resolution morphological analysis of LoBALs using observations obtained with the {Hubble Space Telescope} Wide Field Camera 3 in two channels.  Signs of recent or ongoing tidal interaction are seen in 59% of the host galaxies, including interacting companions, tidal tails, bridges, asymmetries, plumes, and boxy isophotes. The presence of a second nucleus within ~1" (6.4 kpc) is revealed in seven of the systems. A detailed two-dimensional surface brightness analysis with GALFIT indicates that the majority (73%) have prominent early-type (bulge, n>4) morphology and only four systems have exponential disk profiles (n<2). Two of the disks and one bulge are better described as pseudobulges (n<2.2). The dominance of bulges and unambiguous signs of tidal interaction strongly suggests that the population LoBALs are QSOs that result from major mergers. Nevertheless, most of the merger-induced start formation is already quenched.  This sample of LoBALs represents merger systems at various stages of the interaction process, hence, either the outflows which characterize these systems persist for as long as the interaction signs are observable in the galaxy, or very short-lived outflows are triggered and die out during various stages of the merger process.  Overall, our results are consistent with LoBALs representing the last stages of the blowout phase when QSO winds have already quenched the star formation.

Light-driven uncoupling of nitrogenase catalysis from ATP hydrolysis
The Haber-Bosch process carries an enormous industrial and agricultural importance but also has a largely negative economic and environmental impact. Understanding the mechanistic details of biological nitrogen fixation catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase would be beneficial both for designing cleaner or more efficient catalysts for small molecule activation and for understanding biological multi-electron/proton redox processes. The enzyme's catalytic mechanism, however, is poorly understood because it relies upon ATP hydrolysis and complex protein-protein interactions to coordinate electron transfer and substrate activation. We have proposed that uncoupling MoFeP catalysis from ATP- and FeP-dependent electron transfer, specifically through light-driven electron injection, would enable the direct study of catalysis at the enzyme active site and the population of discrete reaction intermediates for structural or spectroscopic investigation. The experimental results discussed herein describe the design and characterization of a photosensitized MoFeP capable of reducing substrates independent of ATP hydrolysis and FeP, which have previously been believed essential for catalytic turnover. To achieve light-driven electron injection and substrate activation, MoFeP variants were labeled with a Ru photosensitizer at three different exposed cysteine residues on the protein surface. A particular MoFeP-Ru construct with the Ru photosensitizer located directly above the P-cluster was found to catalyze the 2-electron reduction of protons and acetylene in a light-dependent manner. A modified version of the same construct was able to catalyze the 6-electron reduction of HCN into CH₄ and likely also NH₃. Currently, none of the MoFeP-Ru constructs can catalyze the light-driven reduction of N₂ to NH₃, most likely as a result of inefficient electron transfer to the FeMoco in the absence of FeP. In light of recent findings that certain amino-acid substitutions in MoFeP may enable efficient electron transfer into the MoFeP active site (FeMoco) in the absence of FeP, we have initiated efforts focused on modifying the MoFeP through site-directed mutagenesis. Incorporating these substitutions into our MoFeP-Ru constructs should increase the efficiency of electron transfer to FeMoco such that light-driven N₂ reduction is realized and discrete catalytic intermediates for this reaction can be populated in sufficient quantities for structural or spectroscopic examination

Endothelial nuclear hormone receptors in atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a disease of dysregulated inflammation and metabolism. Many nuclear receptors have established roles in regulating metabolism and inflammation through various tissues and cell types, making them attractive therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pharmaceutical ligands for nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARgamma), are used to improve insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. Recently their effect on coronary heart disease has been called into question. PPARgamma has been shown to be athero-protective in mice via the macrophage by enhancing cholesterol efflux and suppressing inflammation, but its role in lesion smooth muscle and endothelial cells is unknown. Some reports suggest PPARgamma can suppress oxidation, hypertension and inflammation in the endothelium. Thus, endothelial PPARgamma would be predicted to play a protective role in atherosclerosis. To test this, PPARgamma-flox, Tie2- cre, LDLr-/- mice were irradiated and reconstituted with wildtype PPARgamma bone marrow to generate an endothelial-specific PPARgamma knockout atherogenic model. Endothelial PPARgamma deficiency resulted in significantly increased lesion area and greater macrophage infiltration. Gene expression of pro-atherosclerotic chemokines and adhesion molecules was increased in primary endothelial cells from PPAR gamma-deficient mice relative to wildtype, both in vivo and with TLR ligand challenge in vitro. In agreement with this support for an anti- inflammatory role, PPARgamma ligand could suppress monocyte adhesion to both human and mouse primary endothelial cells. While PPARgamma ligand did not suppress classic endothelial adhesion molecules such as VCAM and ICAM, it did suppress the membrane-bound chemokine, fractalkine (CX3CL1). This molecule is strongly chemotactic and deficiency of its cognate receptor has been shown to improve atherosclerosis in LDLr-/- mice. Immunohistochemistry, luminex assay and neutralizing antibodies are being employed to determine the contribution of fractalkine to atherosclerosis in the endothelial PPARgamma-deficient model. In an effort to identify additional nuclear receptors as potential targets for cardiovascular disease treatment, primary endothelial gene expression was compared between wildtype mice and LDLr-/- mice fed atherogenic diet. Expression of several nuclear receptors was significantly altered in the atherogenic model and investigation of their function in this context is underway

MeCP2 modulates gene expression pathways in astrocytes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Mutations in MECP2 encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) cause the X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome patients exhibit neurological symptoms that include irregular breathing, impaired mobility, stereotypic hand movements, and loss of speech. MeCP2 protein epigenetically modulates gene expression through genome-wide binding to methylated CpG dinucleotides. While neurons have the highest level of MeCP2 expression, astrocytes and other cell types also express detectable levels of MeCP2. Recent studies suggest that astrocytes likely control the progression of Rett syndrome. Thus, the object of these studies was to identify gene targets that are affected by loss of MeCP2 binding in astrocytes.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					To identify gene targets of MeCP2 in astrocytes, combined approaches of expression microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation of MeCP2 followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) were compared between wild-type and MeCP2-deficient astrocytes. MeCP2 gene targets were compared with genes in the top 10% of MeCP2 binding levels in gene windows either within 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site, or the &#8216;gene body&#8217; that extended from transcription start to end site, or 2 kb downstream of the transcription end site.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					A total of 118 gene transcripts surpassed the highly significant threshold (P &lt; 0.005, fold change &gt; 1.2) in expression microarray analysis from triplicate cultures. The top 10% of genes with the highest levels of MeCP2 binding were identified in two independent ChIP-seq experiments. Together this integrated, genome-wide screen for MeCP2 target genes provided an overlapping list of 19 high-confidence MeCP2-responsive gene transcripts in astrocytes. Validation of candidate target gene transcripts by RT-PCR revealed that expression of Apoc2, Cdon, Csrp and Nrep were consistently responsive to MeCP2 deficiency in astrocytes.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The first MeCP2 ChIP-seq and gene expression microarray analysis in astrocytes reveals a set of potential MeCP2 target genes that may contribute to normal astrocyte signaling, cell division and neuronal support functions, the loss of which may contribute to the Rett syndrome phenotype.

Marine Natural Products: Synthesis, Niche Environments, and Chemical Probes
This dissertation describes various aspects of marine natural product chemistry from compound discovery and elucidation to the development of lead scaffolds, and ultimately the use of natural products to probe biological questions. A wide range of techniques are utilized including solid phase peptide synthesis, novel mass spectrometry methods, and vertebrate microbiota to explore the secondary metabolic potential of intestinal flora. In addition to these techniques, various whole cell and bacterial screens were used to identify bioactive compounds. The first chapter provides a historical introduction to marine natural products as drugs leads and chemical probes. The latter half of the chapter discusses a future prospective for the field. Chapters 2 through 4 focus on the almiramide class of natural products isolated from a Panamanian cyanobacteria. The second chapter details the structure activity relationships (SAR) for this class of linear lipopeptides and the selectivity indices against the kinetoplastid parasites Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma brucei, and mammalian Vero cells. In chapter 3, synthetic derivatives were derivatitized to create activity based protein profiling probes to elucidate the mechanism of action against T. brucei. Chapter 4 details the use of the almiramide scaffold in conjunction with direct analysis in real time (DART) mass spectrometry to visualize peptides directly from various types of solid supports. The method was extended to include other organic scaffolds and can be used to monitor reaction progress for a number of well know organic transformations. Chapters 5 and 6 examine the use of vertebrate-derived microbiota as a novel source of actinomycetes. The bacteria collected from the stomach contents of various freshly dead commercially available marine fish were phylogenetically analyzed, and in one instance provided a bacteria with 97% sequence identity to its closest culturable bacteria in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. This bacterium produced a novel bioactive lipid, which displayed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, as well as, common fish pathogens. In the final chapter, the fish microbiome was assayed in a high content Vibrio cholerae screen to uncover a Rhodoccous sp. which produced a bile acid that modulates biofilm formation in V. cholerae. Secondary biological studies were undertaken to deduce the mechanism by which biofilms were being inhibited.

                  Background
               
               Few microarrays have been quantitatively calibrated to identify optimal hybridization conditions because it is difficult to precisely determine the hybridization characteristics of a microarray using biologically variable cDNA samples.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Using synthesized samples with known concentrations of specific oligonucleotides, a series of microarray experiments was conducted to evaluate microarrays designed by PICKY, an oligo microarray design software tool, and to test a direct microarray calibration method based on the PICKY-predicted, thermodynamically closest nontarget information. The complete set of microarray experiment results is archived in the GEO database with series accession number GSE14717. Additional data files and Perl programs described in this paper can be obtained from the website http://www.complex.iastate.edu under the PICKY Download area.
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               PICKY-designed microarray probes are highly reliable over a wide range of hybridization temperatures and sample concentrations. The microarray calibration method reported here allows researchers to experimentally optimize their hybridization conditions. Because this method is straightforward, uses existing microarrays and relatively inexpensive synthesized samples, it can be used by any lab that uses microarrays designed by PICKY. In addition, other microarrays can be reanalyzed by PICKY to obtain the thermodynamically closest nontarget information for calibration.

New insights into single-particle mixing state using aircraft aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry
Atmospheric aerosols strongly influence the energy balance of the Earth and the hydrological cycle by scattering and absorbing radiation and acting as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. The climate and human health impacts of aerosols are strongly dependent on particle size, chemical composition, and mixing state. During transport in the atmosphere, aerosol particles undergo physical and chemical transformations (atmospheric aging) through heterogeneous reactions with trace gases and gas-particle partitioning of semivolatile species. The size-resolved chemical composition of individual particles may be examined in real-time using aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS). A smaller ATOFMS with increased data acquisition capabilities was developed for aircraft- based studies. Particle volatility was examined through ground-based measurements during the Study of Organic Aerosols in Riverside, CA (SOAR), and vertical mixing state profiles and cloud residues were examined through flight-based measurements during the Ice in Clouds Experiment - Layer Clouds (ICE-L). An automated thermodenuder (TD) was coupled to the aircraft (A)-ATOFMS to provide the first real-time, individual-particle size and volatility-resolved chemical composition measurements. This work provided insight into the volatility of secondary species, as well as the sources and chemistry of ambient particle cores. Seasonal differences in the volatility of amine species were attributed to the formation of aminium sulfate and nitrate salts in the summer. Oligomeric species were detected in real-time for the first time in individual ambient aerosol particles; increased oligomer ion intensities were associated with increased particle acidity and heating. During ICE-L, vertical profiles of particle types, such as soot, mixed with secondary species, such as sulfuric acid, were examined. For cloud sampling, a counterflow virtual impactor was utilized in series with the A-ATOFMS to examine the residues of cloud droplets and ice crystals. This resulted in the first in-situ detection of biological particles in high altitude ice clouds influenced by long- range transported dust. Playa salts were observed to serve as cloud condensation nuclei and were preferentially observed as residues of large droplets

Mechanisms underlying spontaneous activity in the developing retina :
Many circuits in the developing nervous system generate spontaneous activity. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in the developing retina. Before vision is possible in the retina, neighboring retinal ganglion cells, the retina's projection neurons, spontaneously fire correlated bursts of action potentials separated by long periods of silence. This bursting activity propagates across the retina in the form of "retinal waves". My overall goal was to elucidate the transient features of the developing retina that are the synaptic basis of retinal waves. In the adult retina, circuitry is organized vertically, such that signals travel from the light- sensitive photoreceptors, through a class of excitatory interneuron known as bipolar cells, to retinal ganglion cells, whence the signal is transmitted to the brain. Hence, in the adult retina, each point in visual space is represented by excitation in a small group of cells, with minimal lateral communication among neighboring groups of cells. In contrast, during development, retinal waves propagate laterally across many degrees of visual space. Using a combination of transgenic mice and physiological recordings from acutely isolated mouse retinas, I tested two hypotheses regarding how activity propagates laterally across the retina during development. First, I tested whether extrasynaptic glutamate provides a source of coupling among neighboring bipolar cells. Second, I tested whether specific neuronal connexins, which are the proteins that form electrical synapses, are involved in wave generation. These experiments will help us to better understand the mechanisms by which cells in the brain form the correct connections during development. The knowledge gained from these experiments may help to explain congenital defects of the visual system and could be used to help reestablish connections in the injured brain

The evolution and ecology of interspecific territoriality: Studies of Anolis lizards and North American wood-warblers
Competition among species, whether mediated through shared resources or direct behavioral interactions, has significant evolutionary effects. Ecological and agonistic character displacement (ECD and ACD) are processes by which competition drives evolutionary shifts in resource use and interspecific aggression, respectively. Recent contact zones provide opportunities to study these processes. In Chapters 1-3, we used the invasion of Florida by two lizards, Anolis sagrei and A. cristatellus, to investigate the role of interspecific competition in their evolution. First, we asked whether ECD has occurred in these species. We measured morphology and bite force in sympatric and allopatric populations, and found that A. cristatellus had a more robust head and greater bite force in sympatry. This shift results in phenotypic divergence, consistent with ECD. Next, we asked whether interspecific fights have driven shifts in aggressive behavior through ACD. We found that male A. sagrei were less aggressive toward heterospecifics in sympatry than in allopatry, while male A. cristatellus were behaviorally dominant. A. sagrei's reduced heterospecific aggression in sympatry may represent an adaptation to avoid fights with A. cristatellus. Finally, the effects of competition depend on its intensity, so we used a species-removal experiment to ask whether A. sagrei and A. cristatellus were competing in South Miami. While the two species' habitat use differed significantly, the removals did not influence their habitat use, movements, or body condition. In summary, the morphology and behavior of A. sagrei and A. cristatellus suggest that competition may have influenced their evolution, but we found little evidence of contemporary competition between them. In Chapter 4, we present a comparative analysis of the ecological and evolutionary factors underlying interspecific territoriality (IT) in North American warblers (Parulidae). We searched the literature for records of IT and compared species that exhibited IT with species that did not. Over half of North American parulids showed IT. Species exhibiting IT were more similar to one another in morphology, feeding guild, and habitat than expected by chance, but phylogenetic relatedness was a better predictor of IT than any of these factors, highlighting the role that evolutionary history plays in current ecological interactions.

Impact of Solar Heat Gain on Radiant Floor Cooling System Design
Radiant floor cooling systems are increasingly being used in transition spaces with large glazed surfaces, such as atria, airports, and perimeter areas. For these cases, the cooling capacity can increase significantly according to the scientific literature. However, current design standards and test methods provide only limited guidance on sizing of radiant floor cooling systems and their associated air systems in the presence of solar radiation. The goals of this study are to 1) review current radiant surface cooling capacity estimation approaches; and 2) evaluate the impact of solar heat gain on radiant floor cooling capacity. Sensitivity simulation studies were conducted to investigate the influence of window-to-wall ratio, orientation, building aspect ratio, shading options, and floor material shortwave absorptivity. Review of current radiant system design standards showed that existing radiant cooling capacity estimation methods are insufficient when the system is exposed to solar radiation because shortwave radiation generated by lighting and solar are not considered. Radiant cooling capacity ratio (RCCR), defined as the ratio of the EnergyPlus simulated radiant cooling capacity to the values calculated using ASHRAE Handbooks (2012) and ISO 11855 (2012) methods, were reported to gauge the impact of solar radiation. The simulation results showed that 1) the median of the RCCRISO is 1.7 and 1.3 for RCCRASHRAE, and the enhancement is attributed to shortwave radiation (both direct and diffuse) absorption; 2) RCCR is most sensitive to shading options and slightly sensitive to shortwave absorptivity of the floor surface material.

Synthesis and characterization of visible emission from rare-earth doped aluminum nitride, gallium nitride and gallium aluminum nitride powders and thin films
A three-step solution-based process had been used synthesize powders of GaN, AlN and their alloys. The complete solid solubility and tunable nature of these nitride band gaps in the visible spectrum were the motivation of these studies due to their application in solid state lighting. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the reduction in oxygen content for the GaN powders to as low as 4 atom % with an 8 % oxygen to nitrogen ratio. Relative to commercial GaN powders, the bandedge of the powders synthesized by such approach also shifted to higher energy, which indicated fewer defects, as observed from reflectance measurements. Inspired by the use of rare-earth elements as color emitters in fluorescent lamp phosphors, these elements were also used as activators in our nitride material. Visible emission was demonstrated through photoluminescence measurements in AlN powders activated with rare-earth elements Eu³⁺, Tb³⁺, Tm³⁺. These ions showed emission in the red, green and blue regions of the visible spectrum, respectively. Eu³⁺ and Tb³⁺ co-activation was also observed in an AlN sample that indicated successful energy transfer from the host to sensitizer, and subsequently to another activator. Tb³⁺ emission was observed under cathodoluminescence in GaN powders synthesized by the same method, and a concentration study showed no effect of concentration quenching up to 8 atom %. Using the same source powder, a pulsed-laser deposited thin film was fabricated that showed both band gap emission and activator-related emission, suggesting a reduction of defects when the powders were deposited as thin films. Additionally, GaN: Tb³⁺ films were also fabricated using metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy using precursors with and without oxygen ligands. Tb³⁺ emission was only observed in the sample fabricated from the precursor with oxygen ligand, suggestion that oxygen may be required for effective rare earth luminescence. Finally, Ga₁-xAl/xN alloy powders ( x = 0.5) and Ga₁-x-yAl/xDy/yN (x = 0.10, 0.30, y = 0.01) powders were synthesized using the solution method while incorporating a stainless steel pressure vessel, which increased the synthesis pressure and aided the formation of a single phase hydroxide precursor. This in turn produced a single phase alloy nitride in the final step. Dy³⁺ emission that was not observed in GaN powders was also observed in the Ga₁-x-yAl/xDy/yN powder. This suggested that the incorporation of aluminum enabled rare- earth emission in the nitrides synthesized for these experiments. However, attempts to sputter nitride alloy thin films via radio frequency sputtering were unsuccessful; only very minor peak shifts in the X-ray diffraction patterns were observed. Nevertheless, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicates the presence of Al in the Ga₀.₅Al₀.₅N film deposited on a Si substrate. This suggested that Al atoms may have segregated from the alloy lattice during the deposition process, with only a small amount of Al atoms incorporated into the GaN lattice

Natural DNA sequencing by synthesis
DNA sequencing is used in a vast array of applications including pharmacogenetics, cancer research, biodiversity studies and genotyping. With an increasing demand for faster, more accessible DNA sequencers, current next- generation technologies have made astonishing advances that promise to break the $1,000 per human genome barrier. Here we present a novel DNA sequencing strategy called Natural DNA Sequencing by Synthesis (nSBS). The key aspect of nSBS is the incorporation of a small percentage of a non-terminating fluorescently labeled nucleotide along with the natural nucleotide in the cyclic nucleotide-by- nucleotide DNA synthesis process for sequence detection. The sparse incorporation and subsequent removal of the fluorescent labels minimizes the modification of the natural structure of the extending DNA template, ensuring that subsequent DNA synthesis will be mostly natural and un-perturbed. Our platform allows scaling to high-density arrays for genome sequencing due to the decoupling of the sequencing reaction from the detection step. A theoretical model of the nSBS process has been developed, utilizing Monte Carlo simulations with random sequences from the human genome to assess the feasibility of the method. The model revealed that homopolymer stretches up to 20 bases long can be sequenced with high accuracy and Q20 (with 99% accuracy) read lengths of up to 1,000 bases can be achieved with less than 10,000 copies of DNA templates and 10% labeled incorporation. A major challenge to the implementation of nSBS was the design and construction of an automated sequencing platform. An overview of the hardware and software of this system is given. Finally, results from the implementation of nSBS are provided beginning with a study of the kinetics of the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides. In addition, we demonstrate fractional labeling of a synthetic DNA template. By combining the best proven aspects of SBS with streamlined methods for DNA amplification and high-speed fluorescence imaging, nSBS can provide a platform for inexpensive genome resequencing and de novo sequencing

Function of Bearded family proteins in Notch signaling during mechanosensory organ development in Drosophila melanogaster
The Notch pathway is a cell-cell signaling pathway conserved in metazoans and utilized extensively during development to mediate cell fate decisions. Signaling is initiated by a functional interaction between the transmembrane Notch (N) receptor on the surface of one cell with a transmembrane ligand on a neighboring cell. Stimulation of the N receptor leads to transcriptional activation of N-target genes in signal-receiving cells. Many N-dependent processes also rely on the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Neuralized (Neur), in the signal- sending cell. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Neur activates the signaling capability of the N ligands Delta (Dl) and Serrate (Ser) by directing their ubiquitination-mediated endocytosis. The activity of Neur is inhibited by a family of N-target genes known as the Bearded (Brd) family. In Chapter 1, we demonstrate that Brd proteins and the N ligand Dl use a common protein motif, which we call the NXXN motif, to directly interact with Neur. We show that the NXXN motifs of Dl are required in vivo for its Neur-dependent endocytosis. In Brd proteins, we find that NXXN motifs are required to disrupt an in vitro Neur-Dl interaction and inhibit Neur activity in vivo. In Chapter 2, we find that the basic amphipathic alpha-helix, or B domain, of Brd proteins mediates an in vitro interaction with PI(3)P. The B domain is necessary for Brd proteins to colocalize with Neur in PI(3)P- positive endosomes in vivo. Using additional markers of endocytic compartments we observe that Brd protein/Neur endosomes also colocalize with the late endosomal and lysosomal proteins Rab7 and LAMP1, suggesting Brd proteins mediate the targeting of Neur to lysosomes for degradation. In Chapter 3, we describe several generated null alleles of Brd family genes. Cells mutant for Brd genes are found to be sensitized to levels of Neur activity. We show that Brd genes act redundantly to inhibit Neur activity in non-SOP cells of the proneural cluster during lateral inhibition

An in vivo biosensor for neurotransmitter release and In situ receptor activity : acetylcholine and the M1 muscarinic receptor
From moment to moment, dynamic patterns of neurotransmitter release and surface receptor activity determine the function of the central nervous system. Fundamental to neuroscience is the ability to measure these patterns. However, the tools to make these measurements at a physiologically relevant temporal and spatial resolution are largely unavailable. Recent advances in genetically encoded optical biosensors have begun to allow direct visualization of molecular events previously only indirectly inferable. The aim of the work presented in this dissertation is to develop and characterize a novel in vivo cellular biosensor that takes advantage of current optical biosensor technology as well as standard cell-based assays used in high-throughput screening by the pharmaceutical industry. The biosensors are named Cell-based Neurotransmitter Fluorescent Engineered Reporters (CNiFERs). In this initial realization, we express the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the fluorescent Ca²⁺ indicator TN-XXL in cultured HEK293 cells. Activation of the M1 receptor by acetylcholine leads to an increase in HEK293 cytosolic Ca²⁺ then reported by TN-XXL. In vivo, M1-CNiFERs are implanted with control-CNiFERs: HEK293 cells expressing TN -XXL and the non-functional fluorescent protein mCherry, but not M1. M1- but not control-CNiFERs respond robustly, up to 40% signal change, to endogenous acetylcholine release evoked via electrical stimulation of Nucleus Basalis Magnocellularis (NBM). The response is a single peak initiated within 2 s with a half-maximal rise time as short as 1̃ s and a full width at half maximal amplitude of < 10 s. As expected for NBM stimulation, we observe an inverse correlation between M1-CNiFER response and electrocorticogram delta band power. The cholinergic nature of this response is further verified by enhancement with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine and suppression with the muscarinic antagonist atropine. The pharmaceutical industry has made such extensive use of the cell-based assay in part because of its modularity. By simply expressing a different receptor, CNiFERs can be built to detect the release of a large number of endogenous neurotransmitters and signaling molecules implicated in a wide variety of central nervous system functions

Formation of Porous Layers by Electrochemical Etching of Germanium and Gallium Arsenide for Cleave Engineered Layer Transfer (CELT) Application in High Efficiency Multi-Junction Solar Cells
This thesis investigates a method to reduce substrate costs of multi-junction solar cells by recycling handle wafers through Cleaved Engineered Layer Transfer (CELT) using porous Ge and GaAs.  Multi-junction solar cells based on GaAs and Ge substrates are the most efficient photovoltaic devices with a world record efficiency of 43.5%, more than double that of common terrestrial solar cells.  In order for multi-junction solar to expand to terrestrial power generation, significant reduction in device cost must be achieved; substrate costs represent up to 50% of the cell costs making substrate recycling an opportunity for significant cost reductions. Ge and GaAs wafers are subjected to electrochemical etching with the goal of creating a porous layer that is suitable for epitaxial growth and Cleave Engineered Layer Transfer (CELT) for high efficiency III-V devices.  Both n and p type Ge and GaAs were investigated with the doping concentration ranging from 1017-1019 cm-3.  Electrolytes at various concentrations were tested including HCl, HF, and H2SO4.  In addition, current profile, density, and etch time were changed to optimize porous layer formation.  After electrochemical etching, samples were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine pore size, morphology, layer thickness, and substrate dissolution rate.  Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was also used to find the chemical composition of the porous layer, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine crystallography of the porous layer.  Finally, the effect of annealing on porous layer surface morphology and composition were investigated.The results of this work showed that both n-Ge and p-GaAs yield inhomogeneous low-density pores that are not suitable for CELT.  Heavily doped p-Ge (1018 cm-3 or greater) yields a uniform pore structure on the nm scale that potentially could be used in a layer transfer process.  However, this porous layer includes a significant portion of germanium oxide (< 10 atomic % oxygen).  Subsequent annealing in an atmospheric envi4ronment did not remove this oxide, though annealing in a reducing atmosphere such as hydrogen has not yet been investigated. Etching of p-type GaAs in concentrated HF yielded nm sized porous layer that was completely devoid of any gallium content.  This contradicts the claims made by Rojas et al.. who show a similar porous layer using the same etching parameters, but stated it was composed of stoichiometric GaAs without presenting any chemical composition data to support this assertion.The most promising results were realized with n-GaAs doped between 1-4x1018 cm-3.  Uniform pore nucleation is achieved using 5% H2SO4 with a 300 mA/cm2 current pulse for 1.4 s followed by 20 mA/cm2 for 1 hour.  This profile creates primarily (111) oriented pores on the order of hundreds of nm in size.  In addition, the electrochemical etching leaves a high density of pyramid shaped arsenic oxide structures on the surface, which are then removed by a 20 min dip in 17.5% HCl.  After the HCl treatment, EDS showed the porous layer to be comprised of 3% O, 48% Ga, and 49% As by atomic percent, which could be suitable for high quality epitaxial growth to be carried out on the porous surface.  Annealing of the GaAs porous layer at 450 °C for over 80 hours covered by a GaAs proximity cap showed minimal surface reorganization as well as a decrease in the layer's As content, which is due to the high vapor pressure of As as compared to Ga.These results demonstrate that the electrochemical etching of n-GaAs can create a porous layer that could reduce the cost of high efficiency multi-junction solar cells through a CELT process.  This was achieved with n+-GaAs etched in sulfuric acid with a short duration high current pulse followed by a long duration low current pulse.  Additionally a dip in hydrochloric acid is needed to remove arsenic oxide that forms on the surface.  Furthermore this work shows that pores made in p-type GaAs with HF primarily consist of arsenic oxide and are not useable for a layer transfer application.

Ecology of microbe/basaltic glass interactions : mechanisms and diversity
Submarine basaltic glass constitutes a major part of the oceanic crust and contains a number of bio-essential nutrients including Fe and Mn. Substantial biological activity can be inferred from bio-alteration textures that dominate basaltic glass alteration. However, the role of basaltic glass in fueling diverse chemolithotrophic communities within deep-sea ecosystems remains enigmatic. Little is known about the key mechanisms and potential ecological advantages that drive basaltic glass colonization, the extent to which microbial activity may affect alteration rates and the biogeochemical cycling of elements in particular along the basalt/water interface. The nutrient and energy availability in basalt is considered to facilitate these processes. Seamounts are substantial outcrops of the oceanic lithosphere and offer natural laboratories for the study the ecology of microbe/ basaltic glass interactions. Studies of natural rock surfaces and hydrothermal metal-oxy-hydroxides from different hydrothermal settings at Vailulu'u Seamount (American Samoa), resulted in a detailed characterization of microbial communities and the isolation of a large number of metabolically diverse microbes. One of these strains, Pseudomonas stutzeri VS-10, was chosen as a model organism to study the processes of microbe/basaltic glass interactions. It was isolated from a rhyolite microbial trap and exhibits elevated growth under nutrient limited conditions in the presence of basalt. Key metabolic traits of VS-10 include heterotrophic Fe (II)-oxidation and siderophore production. I investigated this strain with respect to a number of metabolic processes, including the oxidative transformation of Fe and Mn, the production of metabolic byproducts (e.g. organic acids) and secondary metabolites (siderophores) along with their effects on the bio-alteration of the glass. Methods employed include Scanning Electron and Atomic Force Microscopy (SEM and AFM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and microbial fuel cells (MFC). Fe availability and direct contact of the bacterium with the rock surface was shown to significantly facilitate growth of the strain suggesting basaltic glass as an important substratum in supporting metabolically diverse microbial communities in deep-sea ecosystems

The role of costameric proteins in cardiac force transmission and signaling
Costameres are adhesion complexes that link cardiomyocytes to the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the costamere, beta1D integrin links the plasma membrane to the ECM, and vinculin creates a bridge to the actin cytoskeleton. In the heart, vinculin and beta1D integrin may be important for force transmission and mechanotransduction. The overall goal was to study how disruption of the costamere led to changes in ventricular mechanics, myocardial passive stiffness, and cellular hypertrophic signaling. Decoupling of ECM-cell interactions may alter ventricular regional mechanics particularly in the sheet plane and cross-fiber direction. A technique was developed to calculate 3D ventricular strain distributions in mice using tagged MRI. End-systolic strains in vinculin deficient hearts showed that sheet extension and interlaminar shear were reduced. Structural abnormalities from costamere disruption may also affect force transmission through the costamere, which may manifest as altered material properties of the myocardium. Stretching of vinculin deficient papillary muscles revealed that a defect in the costamere resulted in more compliant tissue. In addition to its role in direct force transmission, the costamere is critical for mechanotransduction. Disruption of beta1D integrin function resulted in decreased transverse stretch-induced hypertrophic signaling. In conclusion, abnormal costameres can alter LV mechanics, passive stiffness, and hypertrophic signaling. These changes can contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and the eventual onset of heart failure

New Insights Into Regulation of Ethylene Responsiveness
Ethylene is a simple phytohormone known to be involved with many processes crucial to plant development, including fruit ripening and tissue senescence. In an effort to identify novel factors involved in ethylene signaling, a screen was conducted for lines that display an enhanced ethylene response (eer). This resulted in isolation of fer-2, which demonstrates increased ethylene sensitivity. Map-based cloning revealed that fer-2 results from T-DNA insertion in the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER), which is involved with pollen tube growth. Genetic analysis indicates that fer-2 is capable of signaling in the absence of EIN2, supporting a model for EIN2-independent ethylene response mechanisms. fer-2 also displays decreased sensitivity to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in etiolated hypocotyls, indicating that FER is required for proper BR response in dark-grown seedlings. This has led to development of a model where signaling by ethylene and low concentrations of BR in etiolated hypocotyls is finely balanced, with ethylene inhibiting growth and BR promoting growth in a FER-dependent manner.A second screen was conducted for mutants that are weakly insensitive to ethylene by isolation of suppressors that restore wt response to ethylene in eer5-1. This led to identification of a new allele of ERS1, ers1-4, which results in reduced ethylene sensitivity in a semi-dominant manner. The reduction in sensitivity in the suppressor, ers1-4;eer5-1, is correlated with restored expression of AtEBP, supporting a role for AtEBP as a negative regulator of ethylene response. Sequencing of ers1-4 revealed an amino acid subsitution in the third transmembrane domain of ERS1, similar to the previously characterized etr1-2. Unlike ers1-4, etr1-2 does not strongly suppress eer5-1 and does not greatly affect expression of AtEBP, indicating a divergence of functions between the receptors. Furthermore, loss of RTE1 does not have as strong of an effect in ers1-4 as it does in etr1-2. Additional genetic analysis indicates that while signaling by ers1-4 is largely independent of ETR1, EIN2 is required for effective signaling. The evidence suggests that while there may be some crossover, ETR1 and ERS1 are capable of using distinct mechanisms to dampen the ethylene response, with ERS1 acting through AtEBP and ETR1acting through RTE1.

In-Situ Bioremediation of Perchlorate in Groundwater and Soil
Historical, uncontrolled disposal practices have made perchlorate a significant threat to drinking water supplies in the United States.  In-situ bioremediation (ISB) technologies are cost effective and provide an environmental friendly solution for treating contaminated groundwater and soil.  In situ bioremediation was considered as an option for treatment of perchlorate in groundwater and soil in Lockheed Martin Corporation's Beaumont Site 2 (Beaumont, CA).  Based on the perchlorate distribution and concentration in the ground, in-situ remediation within the site was divided into three parts (groundwater plume, source area groundwater remediation and vadose zone soil remediation).  In both groundwater remediation studies, biological reduction of perchlorate was readily achieved within one week by amending electron donating substrates.  In both column studies, perchlorate reductions were observed within two weeks operation and emulsified oil substrate (EOS) had the best performance as electron donor in terms of effectiveness and longevity in both column studies.  In the vadose zone remediation study, perchlorate degradation did not occur in 20% moisture content microcosms.  However, perchlorate reduction occurred under saturated conditions with the same soil and both EOS and glycerin as electron donors.  To investigate the impact of soil moisture condition on perchlorate remediation, soil microcosm studies were conducted with different soils under different mass water contents.  Optimum soil moisture content for perchlorate bioremediation varied significantly in different soils.  Anaerobic respiration processes other than denitrification were all limited by unsaturated moisture condition in the soil.  Dominant electron acceptor in the unsaturated microcosms was oxygen.  However, eliminating oxygen in the soil system using an anaerobic chamber did not result in perchlorate reduction.  Addition of humic acid as an electron shuttling mediate reduced soil redox potential significantly but was not able to promote perchlorate reduction under unsaturated condition.  In-situ bioremediation of perchlorate was readily achieved in groundwater but it was more challenging in vadose zone.  Soil moisture was identified as a key factor in perchlorate remediation and optimum moisture condition in different soil had large variation.

STM Study of Dynamics and Pattern Formations of Adsorbates on Cu(111)
The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) is well known as the best spatially resolved microscope today. Due not only to its microscopic ability, but also to its ability to manipulate individual atoms or molecules, it has been used as a very powerful tool to lead to the miniaturization of nano devices.  In this study, arene molecules on Cu(111) at low temperature in ultra-high vacuum(UHV) conditions are systematically investigated using a home-built STM. By changing the size of the molecular body and functional groups, the control of their dynamics and pattern formation was successfully achieved. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to support and interpret experimental results.

[synzyme, catalytic]

Designing novel synthetic enzyme-like structures with inducible dynamic catalytic properties
Over the past three decades considerable efforts have been made to create synthetic versions of enzymes, sometimes called synzymes. Most have failed, and the few so-called successes are at best only marginal exhibiting properties that can barely be described as catalytic. While these synthetic nano-structures look similar to the enzyme active site, they do not have the unique mechanical or dynamic catalytic properties to transform a substrate molecule into the desired product molecule with turnover capability. In our study, a series of synzymes that mimics the active catalytic site of proteases which utilizes serine/hydroxyl, cysteine/sulfhydryl, histidine/imidazole and aspartate/carboxyl groups were designed and fabricated. The acetylation and the deacylation kinetics of the synzyme peptides were studied through molecular modeling and UV/Vis spectrophotometry. The intramolecular interactions of synzyme residues were measured with proton NMR. These synzymes were shown to be able to hydrolyze p- nitrophenyl acetate esters and acetic anhydride. Synzymes with phenylalanines between the cysteine and histidine yield a significantly higher deacylation rate, suggesting that the large bulky R-groups of phenylalanine bends the backbone of the synzyme, thus bringing the cysteine thiol group and the histidine imidazole group closer for acetyl exchange. When oscillating pulse electric field was applied to the synzymes, an increase in acetylation rate is observed, suggesting the possibility that PEF treatment aids the electroconformation change of the synzyme during the catalysis process, which in turn increased its deacylation ability and turnover rate

Physical and Statistical Models in Deformation Geodesy
Geodetic techniques involving spaceborne measurement have revolutionized scientific understanding of Earth surface deformation, and this thesis presents several independent methodological developments concerning such data.  The primary results are: a more general method for the optimal design of geodetic networks; an algorithm for detecting transient deformation events in large geodetic datasets;  the identification of a previously unmapped fault in the San Francisco Bay Area, California; a new approach to quantifying the permeability structure of shallow, near-surface, strike slip faults; and a regional evaluation of correlated seasonal deformation in the Bay Area.  These results are not strictly related, however, several themes are present throughout.  Particular emphasis is placed on the development of statistical and numerical methodology.  Although the results presented in this thesis are not strictly related, they represent a significant contribution to our scientific understanding of Earth surface deformation phenomena.

Flexible finite-element modeling of global geomagnetic depth sounding
Time-varying primary magnetic fields generated outside Earth by the magnetospheric ring current induce electrical currents in Earth's interior, which give rise to secondary magnetic fields with a complementary geometry. Geomagnetic depth sounding involves the analysis of magnetic field data to compute frequency-dependent response functions which yield information about the electrical conductivity of Earth's interior. I explore methods and results of forward-modeling global electromagnetic induction under a variety of assumptions about Earth conductivity and the spatial structure of the primary field. I begin by developing computational tools to perform time- and frequency-domain simulations of global induction in models with arbitrary conductivity and primary field structure using FlexPDE, a general-purpose software package that employs the finite-element method to solve partial differential equations. The method is shown to produce solutions with better than 1% accuracy when the simulated fields and response functions are compared to analytic solutions for a variety of problems in electromagnetic induction, and to qualitatively reproduce fields and response functions measured by satellites and observatories. The technique is employed in combination with analytic methods to explore the effect on the response of Earth models to primary fields with asymmetric structure. Standard methods of producing response functions from scalar and vector magnetic data are compared, and scalar methods are found to generate responses with significantly greater spatial bias for models with non-zonal fields. I develop the mathematical formulation for including Earth-rotation in the forward models, and use it to calculate frequency-dependent estimates of the amount of non-zonal structure required to produce previously reported local-time bias in empirical satellite response functions. Because it is difficult to validate solutions to induction problems that lack analytic solutions, we participate in an ongoing project with other researchers who simulate the global induction problem with different methods. We compare the synthetic fields calculated with the FlexPDE method to those calculated with the integral equation method and with the time-domain spectral method for a variety of conductivity models

Retrotransposition of gene transcripts leads to structural
variation in mammalian genomes
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               Retroposed processed gene transcripts are an important source of material for new gene formation on evolutionary timescales. Most prior work on gene retrocopy discovery compared copies in reference genome assemblies to their source genes. Here, we explore gene retrocopy insertion polymorphisms (GRIPs) that are present in the germlines of individual humans, mice, and chimpanzees, and we identify novel gene retrocopy insertions in cancerous somatic tissues that are absent from patient-matched non-cancer genomes.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Through analysis of whole-genome sequence data, we found evidence for 48 GRIPs in the genomes of one or more humans sequenced as part of the 1,000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, but which were not in the human reference assembly. Similarly, we found evidence for 755 GRIPs at distinct locations in one or more of 17 inbred mouse strains but which were not in the mouse reference assembly, and 19 GRIPs across a cohort of 10 chimpanzee genomes, which were not in the chimpanzee reference genome assembly. Many of these insertions are new members of existing gene families whose source genes are highly and widely expressed, and the majority have detectable hallmarks of processed gene retrocopy formation. We estimate the rate of novel gene retrocopy insertions in humans and chimps at roughly one new gene retrocopy insertion for every 6,000 individuals.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               We find that gene retrocopy polymorphisms are a widespread phenomenon, present a multi-species analysis of these events, and provide a method for their ascertainment.

[contrast, induction, discrimination, activity, effect]

Contrast induction and visual cortex
Our goal was to determine where in the visual pathway the coding of contrast changes from a veridical signal to a representation of the illusory percept associated with Contrast Induction. We recorded Contrast Discrimination Thresholds for targets in a 5% and a 95% contrast surround. Thresholds in the 95% surround were significantly higher than for the 5% surround. We also demonstrated the attenuating effect of Contrast Induction on perception. We then recorded Contrast Response Functions for each surround using fMRI. BOLD activity in V1 shows no difference between the surrounds. V2 & V3 show the 95% contrast surround reduced BOLD activity to a greater degree than the 5% contrast surround. A Contrast Matching experiment was performed simultaneously to the fMRI experiment. The 95% surround reduced the appearance of contrast more than the 5% surround. To determine if any early visual areas respond in a way reflecting the psychophysical effect of Contrast Induction on Contrast Discrimination and Contrast Matching we used Heeger's Normalization model. V1 activity can reasonably predict the overall shape of the empirical TvCs, but cannot show the subtle differences between the surrounds. V1 cannot predict the Matching data. V2 has shown to under predict, accurately predict, and over predict the Contrast Induction effect on perception. V3 activity can accurately predict or over predict the effect. The activity of V2 and V3 in this study cannot predict Contrast Discrimination Thresholds. This evidence suggests that Contrast Discrimination and Contrast Matching are not performed by the same mechanism and are not executed in the same area of cortex. It appears that Contrast Discrimination can be predicted from cortex as early as V1. Our V2 and V3 predictions for Contrast Discrimination are inconclusive. We found no evidence that V1 can predict the altered perceptual effect of Contrast Induction. We suggest that the process of Contrast Discrimination is carried out as early as V1, but that Contrast Matching is not possible in V1 and must be achieved in V2 or higher. Accordingly, V1 contains the veridical representation of the target stimulus, while V2 and above represent the illusory percept associated with Contrast Induction

The role of Twist1 in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis by regulation of invadopodia formation
Metastasis is a multistep process during which cancer cells gain the ability to invade through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to disseminate to distant organs. Cancer cells can degrade ECM by forming invasive structures called invadopodia which concentrate protease activities to areas of the cell in contact with the ECM. Twist1 is a key transcription factor known to promote the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis. We find that Twist1 promotes local invasion in metastasis by inducing invadopodia formation via transcriptional regulation of platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM12). We find that Twist1 is both necessary and sufficient for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation in multiple cell lines. Twist1 induces PDGFRalpha expression, which in turn activates Src, to promote invadopodia formation. We demonstrate that Twist1 and PDGFRalpha are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals. Induction of PDGFRalpha and invadopodia is essential for Twist1 to promote tumor metastasis. Consistent with PDGFRalpha being a direct transcriptional target of Twist1, co-expression of Twist1 and PDGFRalpha predicts poor survival in breast tumor patients. Therefore, invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation is a key function of Twist1 in promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, we find that the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM12 is strongly induced by Twist1 and localizes to both invadopodia and focal adhesions. Knockdown of ADAM12 reduces both migration and invasion while increasing adhesion and focal adhesion number. We show that ADAM12 is required for formation of invadopodia and gelatin degradation. Using a series of ADAM12 mutants, we find that the disintegrin domain of ADAM12 is involved in both regulation of focal adhesions and invadopodia while the metalloprotease domain is specifically required for efficient invadopodia formation. Functionally, ADAM12 is required for efficient metastasis of tumor cells to the lung in a human xenograft breast cancer metastasis model in mice. Our work defines a novel role for Twist1 in regulating ECM degradation during tumor invasion and metastasis. These results could lead to new biomarkers and targeted therapeutics for invasive and metastatic breast cancer

Nanoscale Biosensors for Environmental Monitoring and Biological Detection
Biosensors, comprised of a bioreceptor and a signal transduction system, have become one of the most popular analytical methods. In this dissertation, the fabrication of biosensors of high selectivity and sensitivity is accomplished via two means - adapting functional DNAs as bioreceptors and employing innovative nanomaterials as a signal transduction system.   In chapter 2, 3 and 4, functional DNAs of high selectivity are employed to recognize heavy metal ions for environmental monitoring. With the presence of Pb2+, 8-17bp DNAzymes can cleave the substrates at the phosphodiester bond between the ribonucleic adenine (rA) and the deoxyribonucleic guanine (G). This cleavage releases the single stranded-DNAs, which are then adsorbed onto single walled-carbon nanotubes, resulting in fluorescence quenching. The decrease in fluorescence is proportional to the Pb2+ concentration and therefore can be designed into a sensitive Pb2+ biosensor. Another DNA probe was designed to combine T-rich sequence for Hg2+ binding and G-quadruplex for colorimetric signaling. Without sample preparation or analytical instrument involved, Hg2+ in the environmental water can be facilely detected on the blotting membrane. In chapter 5, 6 and 7, the biomoleuclar recognition event is signaled via cation exchange amplification (CXAmp) in ionic nanoparticles. Zn2+ encapsulated in 5 nm ZnSe nanocrystals can be replaced by free Ag+, rapidly and completely. The freed Zn2+ in turn ignites FluoZin-3, a non-fluorescent Zn-specific dye, resulting in intense fluorescence signal. When ZnSe nanocrystals are attached to the bioreceptors, i.e., the antibodies, the target molecule can be amplified significantly because thousands of Zn2+ ions are freed from one single nanoparticle. The superior labeling efficiency allowed the sensitive detection of IgE at a concentration as low as 1 ng/mL. Further, the size-dependent Zn2+ release property in large porous ZnS nanocrystal clusters (NCCs) is explored. High Zn release efficiency is obtained in 45 nm ZnS NCCs with the assistance of microwave irradiation for only 2 min. By offering an improved labeling efficiency, 5 pg/mL (~33 fM) IgE is detected. Compared with the enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay, a gold standard for immunoassay, our assay provides sensitivity 1,000 times higher. Besides, the CXAmp is combined with DNA amplification techniques like rolling circle amplification for more challengeable miRNA detection with the detection limit in the attomole range.

Models of Chemical Structure and Dynamics via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Ab Initio Computational Chemistry
The combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ab initio calculations has become one of the most powerful tools to solve important structural and energetic problems in the field of chemistry.  Chemical shifts observed in NMR present detailed information about local electronic structure while dynamic NMR allows us to extract kinetic and thermodynamic properties without perturbing equilibrium.  Ab initio calculations are able to interpret the chemical shifts in terms of the chemical structure and provide detailed analysis of the energetic components that make up the process probed by dynamic NMR.  This work involves three important applications of this powerful combination tool.First, we present a combined X-ray, solid-state NMR, and ab initio study of the 140 kDa enzyme tryptophan synthase that allows for the determination of chemical structure for the key enzymatic intermediates in the enzyme cycle.  The results support the ketoenamine and dipolar forms that are in fast exchange with each other in the quionoid intermediate, a result that we believe has mechanistic implications.  The structural characterization of this enzymatic intermediate provides insight into the energetic and chemical transformations responsible for biological function.  Second, the combination of NMR and ab initio calculations has been applied to the field of catalysis.  We find that specific position of the peripheral substitutions outside the central chiral pocket accounts for most of the discrepancies in fundamental physicochemical properties among related cinchona alkaloids via a combination of energetic and entropic effects.  These differences in physicochemical properties are ultimately responsible for the differences in chemical reactivity that make each molecule so unique. Finally, we make use of dynamic NMR and ab initio calculations to investigate the rotational barriers of a series of pyridine thiocarboxamides, and identify different electronic and structural factors that contribute to changes in the energetic processes.  Comparison between thiocarboxamides and their corresponding amide analogues highlights the important role of the resonance interaction proposed by the canonical amide resonance model.

Tumor versus Matched-Normal Sequencing Analysis and Data Integration
Cancer research is a study of tragic complexity. The more we discover about this disease, the more we realize how much we have to learn. It relentlessly unravels new complications, justifying the difficulty we have had in ridding cancer from the human experience. Nevertheless, we strive to conquer it. To accomplish this noble goal, we require tools to understand a patient's specific tumor in as comprehensive a manner as possible. The methods presented here aim to provide a complete assessment of a tumor's genome, discovering the alterations made to the patient's germline genome that may have given rise to cancer. Mutations both large and small are identified and integrated using various techniques to discover the events and elements specific to the tumor genome. The methods will be used on whole genome sequencing data of several tumors, revealing the structural events that occurred in multiple tumors. Double minute chromosomes in GBM tumors will be discovered computationally and confirmed experimentally. Finally, techniques that expose tumor clonality will be described and used to infer whole genome, allele-specific copy number profiles of all major clones comprising a tumor population from a single tumor biopsy.

Single-cell dynamics of mammalian gene regulation
Observation of single-cell behavior has become increasingly important to our understanding of complex biological systems given the highly dynamic nature of underlying regulatory processes which is often obscured by population-level observation. The focus of this dissertation is to explore gene regulatory dynamics in individual mammalian cells with the use of microfluidic technology and synthetic biology. First, I develop a novel microfluidic device platform which enables dynamic stimulation of mammalian cells during long-term perfusion culture. The device incorporates an innovative cell- loading method which uses a temporary on-chip vacuum to capture cells in culture regions isolated from detrimental effects of fluid-induced shear stress. Second, I use this device to characterize the single-cell NFkappaB response to dynamic stimulation with TNFalpha. The induction of cells with a linear temporal gradient compared to a step impulse reveals significant differences in timing variability and amplitude of the response for the two modes of stimulation. Finally, I follow a synthetic biology approach to construct artificial negative and positive transcriptional feedback gene circuits in mammalian cells and I explore the potential of this architecture to generate oscillatory expression behavior

The Mechanisms of Proactive Interference and Their Relationship with Working Memory
Working memory (WM) capacity – the capacity to maintain and manipulate information in mind – plays an essential role in high-level cognitive functions. An important determinant of WM capacity is the ability to resolve interference of previously encoded but no longer relevant information (proactive interference: PI). 
Four different mechanisms of PI resolution involving binding and inhibition have been proposed in the literature, although debate continues regarding their role. Braver et al. (2007) introduced an important distinction in the PI resolution literature, proposing two general types of PI control mechanisms that occur at different time points: proactive control (involves preparation in advance of the interference) and reactive control (occurs after interference occurs). This thesis proposed that among these four functions involving binding and inhibition, item inhibition and binding could be involved in proactive control, while familiarity inhibition and episodic inhibition could be involved in reactive control. The question is which mechanism in each pair is indeed involved in proactive control and reactive control respectively, and how these proactive control and reactive control mechanisms work together to resolve PI. In addition, do these mechanisms play a role in the relationship between PI resolution and WM?
In an individual differences study, individuals’ ability to resolve PI was assessed in memory tasks, with two versions of each that encouraged the use of either proactive or reactive control. In addition, measures were obtained of individuals’ ability of binding and inhibition in tasks that had minimal memory demands. Regression analyses showed contributions of binding and inhibition to PI resolution and WM. Moreover, these functions are responsible for the correlation between PI resolution and WM. In a neuroimaging study, the neural basis of proactive control was examined by comparing two memory tasks that differed in their demand on binding and inhibition. In addition, the brain regions engaged in reactive control was examined by contrasting trials involving interference or not. The thesis showed that item inhibition carried out by the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) is involved in proactive control while episodic inhibition carried out by the left IFC and the posterior parietal cortex is involved in reactive control.

Since the development of the standard model over 40 years ago, one of the chief endeavors of particle physics has been to understand the Higgs sector of the theory. Still experimentally undetected despite great efforts, the Higgs sector remains a mystery, and ideas of what lies beyond have flourished. The aim of the research described here has been to explore non-perturbatively ideas of greatest interest which are within reach of current non- perturbative methods and resources and beyond the current reach of rigorous perturbative investigation. The first is the relationship between the Higgs boson mass and the energy scale of new phenomena expected to appear at higher energies due to a peculiar property of Higgs models known as triviality. The second is nearly conformal gauge theory and its role in the possible explanation of the Higgs as a composite state, again linking to new phenomena at higher energies, namely extended technicolor. The imminent advent of the Large Hadron Collider makes the discovery and understanding of new physics at higher energies a tangible possibility.

Abiotic Oxidation Rate of Chalcopyrite: Implications for Seafloor Mining
<italics>In situ</italics> mining of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits will have consequences thus far not quantified.  On land, interaction of mined sulfide minerals with surface and groundwaters yields acid mine drainage.  Pulverization of SMS on the ocean floors will produce highly reactive sulfide mineral surface areas, leading to the localized potential for seafloor acid generation.  Chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>) is one of several ore minerals found in SMS deposits whose oxidation kinetics need to be quantified to estimate the significance of acid production.	To constrain the oxidation rate of chalcopyrite in seawater, the initial rate experimental method was employed and combined with the isolation method to derive a rate law.  Data collected from batch reactor experiments without abundant precipitates (pH <4.5), between 7&deg;C and 25&deg;C, and P<sub>O2</sub> from 0.10 to 0.995 atm were incorporated into the rate law.  The molal specific rate law is:Rsp = - 10<super>-9.38</super>(P<sub>O2</sub>)<super>1.22</super>(H+)<super>0.36</super>Chalcopyrite oxidizes slowly in seawater relative to other sulfide minerals like pyrrhotite (Fe<sub>1-x</sub>S), so data from this study establishes a minimum rate of abiotic SMS weathering by oxidation.  The slow rate of oxidation of chalcopyrite observed here has positive implications for seafloor mining.  Not only will this sulfide not be the main culprit for acid production, but the copper ore will arrive at the surface with minimal dissolution and loss of metal value.  Constraining the oxidation rates of individual sulfide mineral species will be useful in modeling SMS mining repercussions, as well as quantifying rates of natural chemical weathering in the oceans over geologic time.  This information will be applicable to interpreting the Cu/Fe ratios of VMS deposits.The potential for local acid generation can be viewed as a microcosm of the global problem of ocean acidification caused by dissolution of anthropogenic atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.  Data show sulfide mineral oxidation rates increase with lower pH, implying that a worldwide drop in ocean pH may amplify the dissolution of SMS deposits, changing the marine ecosystem.

NELL-1 regulates BMSC osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation by interacting with Integrin and regulating cell focal adhesion
Previous studies demonstrated that NELL-1 promoted osteogenic differentiation of bone marrowl stromal cells (BMSCs). BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts and the signaling pathways involved are poorly understood. We hypothesized that NELL-1 binds to Integrin and promotes osteogenic differentiation through FAK signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined the physical interaction of NELL-1 with Integrin beta-1 and inhibition of NELL-1's cell binding and adhesion using knockdown of Integrin beta-1 siRNA. We also assayed for phosphorylation of FAK as well as expression of osteogenic differentiation markers (OCN, OPN, ALP staining) and adiopogenic differentiation markers (ORO staining) in BMSC. We found that NELL-1 physically binds to Integrin beta-1 and Integrin beta-1 siRNA knockdown reduced NELL-1 cell binding significantly. NELL-1 stimulated expression of Integrin beta-1 and activated FAK phosphorylation. Finally, NELL-1 enhanced expression of osteogenic genes, whereas it inhibited expression of adiopogenic genes. Taken together, our results suggest that NELL-1 may initiates transduction signals through Integrin, and FAK pathway may play an important role in regulating NELL-1 induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSC.

Mechanisms of axon pathfinding and survival
The development of functional neuronal circuits occurs via a series of complex events including axon pathfinding and synapse formation followed by selective pruning and refining of these circuits by means of programmed cell death and axon degeneration. The precise molecular machinery that dictates these exquisite development events is not well understood. My thesis study examines the role of Wnt signaling throughout nervous system development. Wnts have recently been identified as axon guidance molecules but the signaling pathways that mediate growth cone turning have yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, is there a connection between these guidance events and subsequent developmental pruning? To study the role of Wnt signaling through these events, I employed a variety of techniques including analysis of genetically modified mice, ex utero electroporation of rat spinal cord cultures, and pharmacological and genetic manipulation of dissociated neuronal cultures. Throughout this study, we will demonstrate that indeed, Wnt signaling mediates multiple events critical for appropriate nervous system development including appropriate anterior-posterior axon guidance of both spinal cord commissural neurons and monoaminergic neurons in the brainstem. In addition, I explored the potential role for an axon guidance pathway in mediating neuron survival. Here I investigate the role of atypical PKC (aPKC) signaling in the survival of developing cortical neurons. Inhibition of aPKC resulted in rapid axon fragmentation. We posit that not only does Wnt proteins serve as guidance cues in the developing nervous system, but that these attractive cues might also serve as trophic signals to developing axons

Proposal to Observe the Nonlocality of Bohmian Trajectories with Entangled Photons
Bohmian mechanics reproduces all statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, which ensures that entanglement cannot be used for superluminal signaling. However, individual Bohmian particles can experience superluminal influences. We propose to illustrate this point using a double double-slit setup with path-entangled photons. The Bohmian velocity field for one of the photons can be measured using a recently demonstrated weak-measurement technique. The found velocities strongly depend on the value of a phase shift that is applied to the other photon, potentially at spacelike separation.

Structural studies of bacteriophage Hong Kong 97 Prohead I and development of nano-particle applications
Virus capsid assembly requires recruiting and organizing multiple copies of protein subunits to correctly form a closed shell for genome packaging that leads to infectivity. Many viruses encode scaffolding proteins to promote subunit interactions and to stabilize assembly intermediates. HK97 lacks an explicit scaffolding protein, but the capsid protein (gp5) contains a scaffold-like N- terminal segment termed the delta domain directing 420 subunits to form a procapsid named Prohead I. Prohead I can be disassembled and reassembled under mild conditions but cannot mature further. When the virally encoded protease (gp4) is co-expressed with gp5, it is incorporated into the capsid and digests the delta domain followed by auto-proteolysis to produce the meta-stable Prohead II that matures through multiple intermediates to form the polyhedral Head II capsid. A version of Prohead I (Prohead I+P) was isolated by co-expressing gp5 and an enzymatically inactive mutant of gp4. Prohead I and Prohead I+P were compared by biochemical methods, revealing that the inactive protease stabilized the capsid from disassembly in vitro. The crystal structure of Prohead I+P was determined at 5.2Å and distortions were observed in the subunit tertiary structures similar to those observed previously in Prohead II. Prohead I differed from Prohead II due to the presence of the delta domain and the resulting repositioning of residues 104-130, explaining why Prohead I can be reversibly dissociated but cannot mature. Low-resolution x-ray crystal diffraction data (100-10Å) enhanced the density of the relatively dynamic delta domains, revealing their quaternary arrangement and suggesting how they drive proper assembly. Next-generation nanodevices are under development for delivering therapeutic agents to specific tissues more effectively than conventional strategies to reduce toxicity and side effects. HK97 capsid system was employed to utilize its multi-valency and stability for this purpose. We developed a method of packaging various fluorescent proteins by expressing them as fusion proteins with the HK97 protease. We observed that mCherry-protease fusion protein retains its enzymatic activity after packaging. Thus, the mCherry-containing capsid can be matured, producing a fully cross-linked particle carrying specific cargo. Furthermore, we engineered HK97 capsid for tumor cell-specific targeting. A combination of genetic and chemical engineering methods were developed and applied to generate dual-labeled particles displaying transferrin and fluorescent labels. The targeting properties of transferrin-conjugated particles were evaluated in in vitro experiments using different cancer cell lines. We found that HK97-tranferrin formulations were effectively targeted to cancer cells in vitro via the transferrin receptor. These studies highlight the utility and facilitate the further development of HK97-based VNPs for targeted protein delivery

Investigations into the Mechanisms of Wolbachia Induced Parthenogenesis and Sex Determination in the Parasitoid Wasp, Trichogramma
In <italic>Trichogramma</italic> parasitoid wasps, infection with the intracellular bacterium, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, alters host reproduction, inducing gamete duplication and thus the parthenogenetic production of female offspring from unfertilized eggs. Little is known about the mechanisms governing sex determination in <italic>Trichogramma</italic>. Beyond outlining the basic mechanism of gamete duplication, few studies have investigated the interactions between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and its host which allow parthenogenesis induction. This dissertation manipulates <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in <italic>Trichogramma kaykai</italic> to investigate the mechanisms involved in sex determination and the extent of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s role in parthenogenesis induction. The production of males and intersexes by parthenogenetic females, and the factors contributing to their formation, provide valuable insight into mechanisms of sex determination and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> manipulation. Males and intersexes regularly appeared among the offspring of aging infected females as a result of incomplete parthenogenesis induction (Chapters 3-6). Intersexes ranged from very feminine to very masculine (Chapter 2) and flow cytometry confirmed that all were of a single genetic constitution (haploid or diploid) and therefore, not mosaics (Chapter 4). Infected females also produced occasional diploid males (Chapters 4-6). Together, these findings suggest a two-step mechanism of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced parthenogenesis, requiring both gamete duplication and feminization. The complete lack of diploid males and intersexes in the absence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection strongly supports this mechanism and points to a method of sex determination consistent with the imprinting model recently proposed for <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>. Here, female development relies on a paternally derived sex allele to compensate for an imprinted maternal allele. The production of triploid daughters by diploid males strengthens this finding (Chapter 5). Factors modulating expression of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced parthenogenesis in <italic>T. kaykai</italic> were found to include host age, host genetic background, and to a lesser extent heat (Chapter 3). Quantification of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density (Chapter 6) revealed a clear relationship between bacterial density and wasp ploidy, with diploids harboring 7 times more than haploids. However, the relationship between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and sexual phenotype was not clear.

Molecular mechanisms of B cell tolerance, proliferation and motility
Chapter 1 presents our investigation on how BCR signaling is affected by self-reactivity and how the dysregulation of PIP3 generation via the loss of PTEN leads to a break in B cell tolerance. The proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes and resulting clonal expansion are essential for adaptive immunity. Chapter 2 discusses the impact of the loss of CD98 on immune responses, particularly on the expansion of antigen-activated B cells. B cells adhere and migrate in response to chemokines in order to function and to differentiate. The molecular events downstream of BCR, S1P and chemokine stimulation leading to integrin activation are not completely understood. In Chapters 3 and 4, the roles of SHEP1 and Beta1 integrin are investigated in B cells. Finally, Chapter 5 presents a research proposal on the role of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis of gout, which was written during my clinical experience in Rheumatology as a Howard Hughes Med-Into- Grad Scholar

Quantitative Analysis of Biological Effects on 18F-FDG Uptake in Tumors: from In-vitro to In-vivo Studies
Many factors, including tumor size, plasma glucose level, and the time course of 2-18Ffluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)  in plasma can affect 18F-FDG uptake in tumors. The objective of this research work was to systematically investigate the effects of these biological factors on FDG uptake in tumors and to develop methodologies both to overcome measurement problems encountered and to account for the discovered effects to improve the value of FDG PET imaging. In vitro tumor cell line studies were first performed using a PSAPD-coupled microfluidic cell culture chip (microfluidic beta camera). A novel medium infusion strategy--a switching strategy was used to extract the kinetic parameters of FDG uptake in tumor cells. Results showed that the switching strategy could provide reliable estimates of cellular FDG transport and uptake constants and the reliability of the model parameters can be further improved with an optimal design of fewer switching cycles. The experimental results also indicated that K1 (FDG transport constant into cells) and Ki (FDG uptake constant in cells) estimates of glioma cell line U87 and prostate cancer cell line CaP8 were inversely proportional to the glucose concentration in the medium, while the values of k2 (FDG transport constant out of cells), k3 (FDG phosphorylation rate constant in cells) and cellular glycolytic rate were not affected by the medium glucose level. Cellular FDG uptake studies were also performed on multi-well cell culture plates to investigate the effects of medium glucose levels and free fatty acid levels on FDG uptake in cell lines of three different tumor types. It was found that FDG uptake in the tumor cell lines all decreased with increased medium glucose levels, but no effect was seen due to free fatty acid level changes. However, the relationships between FDG uptake and medium glucose level are different among different tumor types, i.e. the FDG uptake in mammary cell line MDA-MB-231 is not affected as much by medium glucose level over the normal physiological glucose range as those of U87 and PC3.Based on the results from in vitro studies, a set of longitudinal quantitative mouse FDG-PET studies in tumor-bearing mice were launched to investigate whether the in-vitro findings are translatable to in vivo settings. Two tumor types, U87 and MDA-MB-231, were implanted in SCID mice. FDG time activity curves in plasma were derived from dynamic PET images and were used to estimate the tumor FDG kinetic parameters.  A multivariate analysis was used to account for multiple factors (plasma glucose level, tumor size, tumor age) at the same time. The results show that the plasma glucose level affected tumor FDG uptake in ways consistent with the findings obtained in in-vitro experiments. Furthermore, the tumor FDG uptake constant was found to be stable for the two tumor types studied as tumor grew in size (before tumor necrotic core appeared).  The study also demonstrated that quantitative longitudinal mouse FDG PET studies can be done in cancer research to provide valuable biological information. In summary, new kinetic methods have been developed in this study to improve the quantitation of FDG uptake kinetics in tumors, both in-vitro and in-vivo.  Findings from the quantitative studies have added new understandings of FDG uptake in tumors that have direct implication on improving the reliability of FDG PET studies in clinical settings.

The effect of statin therapy on innate immune clearance of bacteria
Phagocytic leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, play a key role in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Classically, they are thought to kill bacteria through a combination of phagocytosis, oxidative burst and degranulation. Recently, leukocytes have been found to produce extracellular webs of DNA, known as extracellular traps (ETs). These structures play an important role in host defense, and represent a fundamentally new mechanism of bacterial clearance. Serum has been found to inhibit ETs in a concentration dependent manner. We have found that serum contains heat-stable nucleases that are capable of degrading traps. These findings have important implications for the visualization and identification of extracellular traps. Statins are amongst the most widely- used chronic medication in the world. They act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Several recent clinico-epidemiologic studies have revealed that patients receiving statin therapy have reduced mortality associated with severe bacterial infection. We studied the pharmacological effect of statins on the innate immune capacity of phagocytic cells, focusing on the leading human bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. These studies revealed a beneficial effect of statins on S. aureus clearance using in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models of phagocyte function, although paradoxically both phagocytosis and oxidative burst were inhibited. Probing instead for an extracellular mechanism of killing, we found statins boosted the production of ETs by human and murine neutrophils and also monocyte/ macrophages, representing the first report of the ET phenomenon in the later cell type. The effect of statins to induce phagocyte ETs was linked to sterol pathway inhibition by RNA interference and specific pharmacologic inhibitors. We conclude that statins, a drug therapy taken chronically by tens of millions of individuals, alters the functional behavior of phagocytic cells, which could have ramifications for susceptibility and response to bacterial infections in these patients. In sum, our findings have important implications for our understanding of ETs, the cell biological processes that lead to their production and their clinical relevance in the context of bacterial infections

Methods for measurement of heterogeneous materials with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is an analytical tool that can be used in a wide range of applications. By focusing a laser pulse onto a small area, material is ionized and heated to 10,000 to 20,000 K. As the plasma cools, atoms emit light. The light contains atomic information about the sample and is analyzed by a spectrometer. In this work, a fundamental study will examine the relationship between ablation and LIBS enhancement in dual-pulse LIBS. Also, an application of LIBS to identify trace metals in molten salt will be presented. The first experiment will look closely at how spectral enhancement of zinc and copper in brass is influenced by plasma temperature and ablation particles from a dual- pulse laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (DP-LIBS) compared with single-pulse LIBS. The work presented will look at a dual-pulse scheme using two pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. First, a pulse was focused parallel and above the surface forming a pre-ablative plasma in air. A second pulse is then fired to form an ablative (analytical) plasma on a surface while intersecting the volume of the pre-ablative plasma. Two parameters were studied in the DP -LIBS experiments, the inter-pulse delay and the pre- ablative flunce. Both these parameters have an effect on the emission intensity of zinc and copper and the ablation volume. Single-pulse experiments were also conducted by varying the fluence, which also has an effect on the emission intensity of zinc and copper and the ablation volume. In experiments varying the inter-pulse delay, a 90 mJ pre-ablative laser pulse followed by a 30 mJ ablative (analytical) laser pulse were used. Using this scheme with an inter-pulse delay of 20 mus resulted in a 5 fold increase in intensity for Cu at 521 nm and a 7 fold increase in intensity for Zn at 481 nm compared to single- pulse LIBS. A thirty fold increase in ablation was observed in this DP-LIBS scheme compared to single-pulse LIBS at an inter-pulse delay of 20 mus. With a constant inter-pulse delay there is a mild increase in emission intensity for both zinc and copper with increasing pre- ablation fluence, however, a decrease in ablation volume is also observed with increasing fluence. The single-pulse experiments involved the use of only the ablative analytical pulse. Emission intensity increased with increasing fluence for both Cu and Zn; however, there was a sharp decrease in ablation volume with increasing fluence. The electron temperature was calculated for all experiments using the Boltzmann plot. It was found that emission intensities of Cu and Zn correlated well with the electron temperature; however, considering ablation particle volume along with the electron temperature improved this correlation. The results of this experiment suggest that both particle volume and electron temperature play a significant role on the emission intensity. The second project involves the use of LIBS to analytically detect trace elements in a molten salt environment. Here an apparatus was built to simulate an electrorefiner and its enclosure. Electrorefiners are used to reprocess nuclear fuel for recycle through electrolysis in a molten salt bath. This is an important application that demonstrates ability of LIBS to analytically detect elements in hostile environments and on liquid surfaces. Chromium, cobalt, and manganese where measured in a eutectic potassium-lithium-chlorine molten salt mixture. Calibration curves were successfully constructed for cobalt (CoCl₃) and manganese (MnCl₃), while chromium (CrCl₃) was used to demonstrate the resolution of the spectrometer. Theoretical detection limits were determined to be 0.04, 0.5 and 0.3 percent mass for CrCl₃, CoCl₃ and MnCl₃, respectively

Measurement of Neutral Pions and Direct Photons in Cu + Cu Collisions at 62.4 GeV Center of Mass Energy
Direct-photons measured with the PHENIX detector at RHIC, in Au+Au collisions, have been found to scale with the number of binary (nucleon-nucleon) collisions at large transverse momenta. In contrast, earlier measurements from RHIC, using charged and neutral hadron spectra, showed a clear suppression with respect to pp collisions. That suppression was interpreted to be due to the energy loss of scattered partons in the produced dense medium in heavy-ion collisions. Thus, it is concluded that such an energy loss is not evident for direct-photons. In order to understand the turn-on of these effects, similar measurements have been subsequently made for Cu+Cu collisions at various collision energies. This work will present a new measurement of direct photons in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 62.4 GeV. The smaller system size may provide new insight into the system size dependence of photon production. These data will be compared to pp collision data, as well as neutral pion spectra from the same collision data, to check for modification of particle production due to effects of the system created in the heavy ion collisions.

Dynamics of electron transfer at the localized-to- delocalized transition of mixed valency
Investigations into the dynamics of picosecond electron transfer in a series of mixed valence systems of the type Ru₃(mu₃-O)(OAc)₆(py)(CO)-(mu₂-BL)- Ru₃(mu₃- O)(OAc)₆(py)(CO)⁻¹, where BL = 1,4-pyrazine or 4,4'- bipyridine and py = 4-dimethylaminopyridine, pyridine, or 4-cyanopyridine are described. Solvent and temperature dependence into the rate of ground state intramolecular electron transfer is probed by infrared analysis of nu(CO) bandshapes where simulated rate constants yield to rates ranging from 4 E 11 to 3 E 12 s-1. Correlations between rate constants and solvent properties including solvent reorganization energy, optical and static dielectric constants, microscopic solvent polarity, viscosity, principal rotational moments of inertia, and solvent dipolar relaxation times, have been examined. Correlations revealed a marked lack of dependence on electron transfer rates with respect to solvent thermodynamic parameters, and a strong dependence on solvent dynamic parameters. This is consistent with electron transfers having very low activation barriers that approach zero. Temperature dependent studies revealed electron transfer rates accelerated as the freezing points of solvent solutions were approached with a sharp increase in the rate of electron transfer upon freezing. This has been attributed to a localized-to-delocalized transition in these mixed valence ions at the solvent phase transition. This non-Arrhenius behavior is explained in terms of decoupling the slower solvent motions involved in the frequency factor, nuN, which weights faster vibrational promoter modes that increase the value of nuN. Solvent and temperature dependence of optically induced intramolecular electron transfer is probed by analysis of intervalence charge transfer bands in NIR spectra. The application of a semi-classical three-state model for mixed valency best describes the electronic spectra wherein is the appearance of two intervalence bands; a band which has metal-to-metal-charge-transfer character and another having metal-to-ligand-charge- transfer character. This three-state model fully captures the observed spectroscopic behavior where the MBCT transition increases in energy and the MMCT band decreases in energy as electronic communication increases through the series of mixed valence ions. The solvent and temperature dependence of the MBCT and MMCT electronic transitions is found to persist as coalescence of infrared vibrational spectra suggest ground state delocalization on the vibrational timescale. The solvent and temperature dependence of the MBCT and MMCT electronic transitions defines the mixed valence complexes as lying at the borderline of delocalization. Fine tuning the electronic coupling in the series of dimers has allowed for the resolution of a full Class II, early Class II/III, late Class II/III to Class III systems and the influence of solvent dynamics in each regime. These investigations have prompted the redefinition of borderline Class II/III mixed valency to account for outer sphere (solvent) contributions to electron transfer; in nearly delocalized systems, solvent dynamics localized otherwise delocalized electronic ground states. Further, studies explore the origins and dynamics behind spectral coalescence of vibrational nu (CO) bandshapes in Ru₃(mu₃- O)(OAc)₆(py)(CO)-(mu₂-BL)- Ru₃(mu₃-O)(OAc)₆(py)(CO)⁻¹ systems and a picosecond isomerization in square pyramidal Ru(S₂C₄F₆)(P(C₆H₅)₃)₂(CO) system

Illuminating the background : topics in cosmic microwave background polarization research
The cosmic microwave background provides a wealth of information about the origin and history of the universe. The statistics of the anisotropy and the polarization of the cosmic microwave background, among other things, can tell us about the distribution of matter, the redshift of reionization, and the nature of the primordial fluctuations. From the lensing of cosmic microwave background due to intervening matter, we can extract information about neutrinos and the equation of state of dark energy. A measurement of the large angular scale B- mode polarization has been called the "smoking gun'' of inflation, a theory that describes a possible early rapid expansion of the universe. The focus of current experiments is to measure this B-mode polarization, while several experiments, such as POLARBEAR, are also looking to measure the lensing of the cosmic microwave background. This dissertation will discuss several different topics in cosmic microwave background polarization research. I will make predictions for future experiments and I will also show analysis for two current experiments, POLARBEAR and BICEP. I will show how beam systematics affect the measurement of cosmological parameters and how well we must limit these systematics in order to get unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters for future experiments. I will discuss a novel way of using the temperature-polarization cross-correlation to constrain the amount of inflationary gravitational waves. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, I will determine how well future experiments will be able to constrain the neutrino masses and their degeneracy parameters. I will show results from current data analysis and calibration being done on the Cedar Flat deployment for the POLARBEAR experiment which is currently being constructed in the Atacama desert in Chile. Finally, I will analyze the claim of detection of cosmological birefringence in the BICEP data and show that there is reason to believe it is due to systematic effects in the data

Kinetics of codon recognition on the ribosome by tRNAs and release factors
Ribosomes translate messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) into proteins in all domains of life. During the elongation phase of protein synthesis, tRNAs bind to the ribosome in a codon dependent fashion as ternary complexes consisting of a protein elongation factor (EF-Tu), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and an aminoacylated transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). The first step in the termination of protein synthesis is the recognition of stop codons by release factor 1 or 2 (RF1 or 2) in order to hydrolyze the completely synthesized protein from the tRNA bound in the peptidyl (P) site of the ribosome. We have developed a fluorescence based method designed to monitor codon recognition by tRNAs and RFs in the aminoacyl (A) site of the 30S subunit of the ribosome. Using the change in fluorescence of a pyrene molecule attached to the 3' end of a short mRNA as a probe, we have investigated the kinetic mechanism of ternary complex and release factor binding to the A-site of the ribosome. Codon recognition by ternary complexes occurs as part of the second order association step between the ribosome and ternary complex. By interacting with the codon during the first encounter, competition between cognate and near or non-cognate ternary complexes is reduced and rapid screening of ternary complexes may occur. We have found that physiological concentrations of the polyamines spermine and spermidine stimulate ternary complex binding to the A- site of the ribosome at least as well as unphysiologically high concentrations of magnesium ions commonly used during in vitro translation experiments. We have also investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of RF1 binding to the ribosome when a stop codon or a variety of sense codons were positioned in the A-site. The relative affinity of RF1 to different sense codons and the catalysis of peptide release by the RF were not directly related. The observed disparity between binding and catalysis indicates that RF1 employs an induced fit mechanism in the discrimination of stop codons from sense codons

Enhancing the Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) Method Using a Fresnel Lens
Currently, about one in seven people worldwide lack access to clean water, and meeting the needs of a growing population will only further stress our existing resources (Gleick 2002). It is for these reasons that sustainable, cost effective, efficient water disinfection systems are needed. Therefore, the subject of this research is to explore a possible method of enhancing the Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) method by using a Fresnel lens to concentrate solar energy, with the goal of attaining pasteurization temperatures to reduce holding times for disinfection. This method will be referred to as "PULSE" - Pasteurization Using a Lens and Solar Energy. The hypotheses are that pasteurization temperatures can be reached using a Fresnel lens and, secondly, that the Fresnel lens will accelerate the rate of disinfection by causing a rapid temperature rise during the solar disinfection process.To test the first hypothesis, a Fresnel lens was used under varying weather conditions to determine its heating capabilities and conditions under which it is able to reach pasteurization temperatures. In testing the second hypothesis, disinfection rate as a function of temperature increase was established using a hot plate. Following demonstration that disinfection increases with temperature increase, an experiment utilizing PET bottles (typically employed in the SODIS method) (SODIS: How does it work? 2011) filled with water spiked with E. coli, was carried out to determine bacterial inactivation rates. Each condition (Dark, Hotplate, SODIS, and PULSE) was tested, but SODIS and PULSE were done over the summer months, when weather conditions would be similar, to ensure reproducibility of results. Temperature and E. coli numbers were monitored as a function of time. The rates of bacterial inactivation in each of the PET bottles were compared to confirm how temperature affects disinfection rates and to determine whether the Fresnel lens will speed up the solar disinfection process. The goal was to demonstrate that by achieving pasteurization temperatures, a Fresnel lens could significantly increase disinfection rates, thereby providing clean water in a much shorter amount of time.In exploring this technology approach, this research sought to lay a foundation in which the mechanism, application, and relevance of lens-enhanced solar disinfection can be more closely studied. Better designs, better materials, and a better understanding of the fundamental principles governing disinfection can be brought to the forefront with the examination of existing designs, materials, and current data that this research looks to elucidate. Ultimately, it is towards this end in which this research is directed - to help mitigate human suffering due to something well within our capability.

Lattice filtrations for G2 of a p-adic field
In this work we aim to describe, in significant detail, certain filtrations and sequences of lattices inside of the split octonion algebra O, when O is constructed over the field Q_p.  There are several reasons why one would like to consider such lattice filtrations, not the least of which is the connection that they have to certain filtrations of subgroups of the automorphism group G_2 = Aut(O).It is an eventual goal to try to uncover previously unknown supercuspidal representations of G_2 by examining representations of the subgroups making up these subgroup filtrations, which are known as Moy-Prasad filtrations.  When G_2 is constructed over Q_p, each of the filtration subgroups will be compact and open, and normal in the previous subgroup in the filtration, so that the respective quotients are all finite groups.  A basic strategy then, is to identify representations of these finite quotients, extend them to representations of the filtration subgroups, and then induce them to representations of the whole group G_2.To understand the lattice filtrations that identify the Moy-Prasad filtration subgroups, the work of W.T. Gan and J.K. Yu is indispensable.  In their article, they draw connections between certain lattice filtrations, octonion orders, maximinorante norms, and points in the Bruhat-Tits building B(G_2).  Their main idea was to use the norm-preserving quadratic form inherent in O, along with the natural 8-dimensional representation of G_2 = Aut(O), to create a canonical embedding of the building into B(SO(O)).   Since the latter building had been previously described as the set of ``maximinorante norms'' on O, they arrived at an explicit description of B(G_2) in terms of certain maximinorante norms and orders in O.The present work then attempts to describe all of these structures in detail, beginning with general composition algebras and the construction of the group G_2.  Then we will construct the Bruhat-Tits building B(G_2) via the coroot lattice of type G_2, though we will mainly concern ourselves only with the standard apartment in B(G_2).  Finally we will define our lattice filtrations and draw the connections between them and points B(G_2) , which will reveal the action of the group G_2 on its own building.  Along the way, we identify many important structures and facts about the group itself.

Myogenic differentiation of embryonic derived mesoderm progenitor cells
The ability of embryonic stem cells to differentiate into any cell type provides a potential therapy for skeletal muscle repair. A limitation to such a therapy is the susceptibility of these cells to environmental and chemical signals, making in vitro differentiation into a specific lineage difficult to control and reproduce. Soluble factors, mechanical stress, and cell-cell/matrix interactions influence the cell's commitment to certain lineages. In this study, we aim to determine the media and ECM components that best promote and support differentiation of embryonic derived mesoderm progenitor (Hues9D) cells into the myogenic lineage. Hues9D cells cultured in media supplemented with 5% FBS, N2, and hydrocortisone stained positive for Myf5 when analyzed using immunofluorescent staining. Also, immunofluorescent staining revealed positive Myf5 staining of cells grown on collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin. MyoD was expressed in cells grown on laminin and collagen I coated wells. Collagen I and laminin were determined to best support myogenic differentiation of Hues9D cells, while fibronectin best supported proliferation

Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution of Cetaceans with Emphasis on the Rapid Radiation of Oceanic Dolphins (Delphinidae)
Cetaceans are remarkable among mammals for their numerous adaptations to an aquatic existence, yet many aspects of their phylogeny and molecular evolution remain unresolved. Olfactory receptor (OR) subgenomes of eight cetacean species from four families were sequenced and a multigene tree constructed. Phylogenetic analyses of OR pseudogenes using both gene-tree reconciliation and supermatrix methods yielded resolved, consistently-supported relationships among members of four delphinid subfamilies. Novel DNA sequence data for six nuclear loci and three mitochondrial genes provided an independent test of OR trees. Nucleotide substitutions and indels in OR pseudogenes showed a very low degree of homoplasy in comparison to mitochondrial DNA and, on average, provided more variation than single-copy nuclear DNA. I also merged 37 new sequences from RAG1 and PRM1 with most published molecular data for Cetacea and generated a supermatrix consisting of 42,335 characters. The great majority of these data have never been combined. Model-based analyses of the supermatrix produced a consistent phylogenetic hypothesis for 87 cetacean species. Bayesian analyses corroborated odontocete monophyly, stabilized basal odontocete relationships, and completely resolved branching events within Mysticeti and Delphinidae. The brain development gene microcephalin (MCPH1) was sequenced in 38 cetacean species. Alignments of these data and a published complete sequence from the common bottlenose dolphin with primate MCPH1 were utilized in phylogenetic analyses and to reconstruct patterns of selection intensity using site, branch, and clade models of molecular evolution. I found evidence for positive selection on the lineage leading to Tursiops and a parallel trend of adaptive molecular evolution in hominid primates. However, the strongest signal of positive selection was identified in the hypervariable exon 8 region of MCPH1 from baleen whales. Finally, I combined existing and newly generated sequences from four mitochondrial (mt) genes and 20 nuclear (nu) genes to reconstruct a well supported phylogenetic hypothesis for Delphinidae. This study compared multiple concatenated methods with Bayesian concordance analysis (BCA). Despite finding discordance between mtDNA and individual nuDNA loci, the concatenated matrix recovered a completely resolved and robustly supported phylogeny that was also broadly congruent with BCA trees.

Nitrogen and Phosphorus Biogeochemistry of Watersheds Along the Western Slope of the Sierra Nevada
Human activities have more than tripled the amount of N and P available to ecosystems, resulting in complex effects on the environment.  The objectives of this study are to evaluate the N saturation status of chaparral ecosystems exposed to elevated atmospheric N deposition and identify mechanisms for the destabilization of P in soils and lacustrine sediments that may be contributing to the eutrophication of high-elevation Sierra Nevada lakes.  The N saturation status of a chaparral catchment was assessed through an N budget including atmospheric N inputs, hydrologic and gaseous N outputs, belowground N dynamics, and isotopic separation of streamwater nitrate sources.  Phosphorus pools in soil and lake sediment were identified and monitored seasonally to understand how changes in physicochemical conditions and hydrology affect the transport of P to Sierran lakes.  In chaparral, seasonal transitions, microbial C limitation, and the asynchrony between N availability and plant N demand modulated the kinetic N saturation of the catchment. The transition from dry to wet soil conditions induced rapid nitrification of ammonium leading to large hydrologic and gaseous N losses.  However, during the growing season, N losses were minimal highlighting the limitations of applying standard N-saturation theory to xeric landscapes.  In high elevation catchments, P is tightly bound by Al and atmospheric P inputs and rock weathering during the Holocene are the primary sources of present day soil and sediment P.  Lake sediments represent a strong sink for P in high elevation lakes even during periods of anoxia. During snowmelt, 27% of the soil P cycles between the inorganic and organic pools raising the possibility that changes in snowpack dynamics could potentially explain long-term trends in P supply to lakes.  Although intrinsic differences exist between chaparral and subalpine catchments, they respond similarly to the Mediterranean climate of California.  The loss of tight biological control of N and P during seasonal transitions in the Sierra Nevada is similar to the response of ecosystems to periodic disturbances like fire and logging.  Thus, nutrient limitation of these terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their sensitivity to anthropogenic pollution is tightly linked to interannual and long-term changes in climate.

Invasive Plant-Soil Feedbacks and Ecosystem Resistance and Resilience: A Comparison of Three Vegetation Types in California
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONInvasive Plant-Soil Feedbacks and Ecosystem Resistance and Resilience: A Comparison of Three Vegetation Types in CaliforniaBy Sara Jo DickensDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Plant BiologyUniversity of California, Riverside, December 2010Dr Edith B. Allen, ChairpersonEcosystem processes are strongly dependant on plant-soil feedbacks. The invasion of exotic plant species can result in the introduction of novel traits capable of de-coupling native plant-soil feedbacks and leading to altered nutrient cycling and availability and microbial community composition.  In general the degree to which an invading species will impact the system it invades is dependant on how much it differs from plant species native to that system. However, there are examples in which invasion of an exotic plant similar to natives has led to significant alterations of ecosystem processes. The objective of this work was to examine the impacts of a single suite of exotic annual plants invading three very different vegetation types in southern California, grasslands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. I predicted that invasion of exotic annuals would have greater impacts on shrubland systems than grasslands due to the greater disparity in plant traits between the exotic annuals and the shrub species. Comparisons of invasion impacts, however must consider factors other than vegetation type such as soil parent material, pH and soil moisture as mechanisms by which a native system may be more or less resistant to changes associated with invasion and recover following native vegetation re-establishment. In order to examine vegetation type resistance to invasion and soil resilience of these systems, I analyzed soils for total carbon and nitrogen, extractable phosphorus and nitrogen, nitrogen mineralization, soil respiration and microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Long and short-term restorations were sampled concurrently with the invaded and native vegetation types to assess resilience of soils. Regardless of vegetation type nitrate was reduced by invasion, seasonality of sampling was a greater driver of microbial community composition than invasion or restoration and abiotic factors proved to be important to microbial species composition and soil nutrient availability. Individual chemical pools and functional groups of microbes responded differently in each vegetation type. However, the degree to which invading species differed from natives did not predict the level to which invasion would impact the system.

Search for new Physics with Long-Lived Particles Decaying to Photons and Missing Energy in pp Collisions at a Center-of-Mass Energy of 7 TeV with the CMS Experiment at the LHC
We perform a search for long-lived neutral particles decaying into a photon and invisible particles in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. In the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry with the lightest neutralino as the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and the gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle, the neutralino can decay into a gravitino and a photon with a non-zero lifetime. The impact parameter of the photon relative to the beam-beam collision point can be reconstructed using converted photons. The method is sensitive to lifetimes of the order of $\mathcal{O}$(0.1 ns). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $2.1 \pm 0.1~\rm{fb^{-1}}$ recorded in the first part of 2011 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. The search is performed using events containing photons, missing transverse energy and jets. Upper limits at the $\rm{95\%}$ confidence level are presented on the cross section for such particles from pair-production, each of which decays into a photon and invisible particles.

The shape of things to come : examining the interplay of elasticity, activity and geometry in soft matter
This dissertation contains within an exploration of the interactions between various soft matter systems and an environmental stimulus. The natural case studies for examining soft matter using the language of thermodynamics and phase transitions are biological constituents, from slender filaments to entire collections of organisms. We first present a brief overview of soft condensed matter, couching the thesis in terms of states of matter and preparing the stage for using continuum mechanics to examine the sensitive balance between competing physical forces in determining the final state of the systems of interest. Following this we present analysis of long-range interactions in a ubiquitous soft matter system, flexible filaments. Adhesion events that occur between attractive filaments can be understood in terms of phase transitions, and herein we present a methodology for describing physical regimes where such transitions take place. Following this we present analyses of slender filaments and flexible membranes interacting with viscous fluids; of primary concern is the transduction of undulatory motion of the surface into propulsive thrust, as a model of microorganism locomotion. We show that slender filaments near walls can be shown to exhibit non-intuitive force characteristics as a fundamental consequence of the flexibility and geometry of the system, for several models of passively actuated and internally active model flagella. We then present two different active models for propulsion using a flexible membrane: the first simplifies the geometry in order to elucidate the direct consequences of internal forcing on macroscopic propulsive thrust, while the second is a proof of principle model for a microscopic vesicular swimmer. Finally, we study collective locomotion of microorganisms and active colloidal dispersions by performing a robust hydrodynamics simulation of a concentrated suspension of microswimmers. We find that global polar order persists throughout the system as a function of various microscopic swimming/ activity parameters, as well as the volume fraction

Long-term oxygen sensor implantation in the porcine subcutaneous environment
The effect of long-term implantation on metabolically active devices is of utmost importance for not only the success of implanted glucose sensors used in diabetic therapy, but also for the development of artificial tissues and encapsulated cell devices. Such devices are dependent on the constant, predictable supply of metabolites from the local vasculature. Long-term implantation leads to the formation of a foreign body capsule whose purpose is the protection of the host and isolation of the foreign material from local tissue resources. While this encapsulation is successful in protecting tissues from invading agents, metabolite flow continues, albeit at greatly reduced levels. The understanding of this encapsulation process is critical for the design and successful implementation of active implants dependent on metabolite supply. The project goal is to utilize implantable wireless telemeters designed and manufactured by Glysens, Inc. to understand changes in oxygen levels of the surrounding subcutaneous tissues over the course of implantation in pigs. This is performed in three distinct, yet interrelated parts, namely: the analysis of oxygen signals collected from the long-term implantation of telemeters, the histological analysis of serial tissue samples collected from regions adjacent to the telemeter-like shams over the course of implantation, and the investigation of an accurate model for the dynamics of metabolite supply to implanted devices over the long-term. Oxygen signals collected from sensors implanted into the subcutaneous tissues of pigs were found to contain several salient features. First, a long-term trend exhibiting exponential decay properties was discovered and is attributed to the impedance of mass transfer by the formation of a thick, avascular, fibrous foreign body capsule. The existence of such a capsule is demonstrated via histological examinations, and its impact on mass transfer of oxygen from the underlying vasculature to implant surface is investigated utilizing analytical and numerical methods. Second, a dominant frequency with a period of oscillation of 7-14 days was found for most of the signals examined. A model is proposed detailing the critical components of such an oscillations and how they might correlate with specific stages of the wound healing response. The successful completion of this project provide a better understanding of the tissue changes that occur during the foreign body reaction, and the findings will be of direct benefit to the implant and device community allowing for better design parameters and device performance

Courtship Behavior in the Male Guppy (Poecilia reticulata); A Genetic Analysis
Courtship behavior in the male guppy (Poecilia reticulata) was analyzed employing 13 behavioral sequences measured in standardized situations. The stability of these measurements allowed a systematic study of individual differences and of their origins. Factorial analyses lead to two distinguishable main categories of behaviors: one was related to gonopodial swinging; the other to sigmoid display. Variables used to describe gonopodial swinging have only environmental correlates. The additive genetic component was null when estimated by two independent genetic analyses and this result was confirmed by a nonresponse to directional selection. On the contrary, most of the variables used to describe sigmoid display exhibit significant additive genetic components and this was confirmed by the incidence of males exhibiting vs. not exhibiting this behavior in a replicated directional selection. The adaptive significance of the variables is discussed in the light of genetic and observed correlations between the phenotypes.

Requirement for Abasic Endonuclease Gene Homologues in Arabidopsis Seed Development
Arabidopsis thaliana has three genes, Ape1L, Ape2, and Arp, that show homology to abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endonuclease genes of bacterial, yeast, or animal cells. In bacteria, yeast, and animals, abasic endonucleases function in base excision repair of oxidized and other modified DNA bases. Here we report that plants with knock-out mutations in any one of Ape1L, Ape2, or Arp show no apparent differences from wild type in growth rate, growth habit, and fertility. However, coincident knock-out mutations in Ape1L and Ape2 are lethal and lead to abortion of developing embryos. Mutations of Arp are not deleterious, even in combination with one of the other two mutations. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the process of base excision repair, involving at least one intact copy of Ape1L or Ape2, is required in the process of embryogenesis.

The Pathophysiology of Hereditary Angioedema
Abstract
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) causes recurrent episodes of angioedema that may be very severe and are frequently associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. Understanding the pathophysiology of this disease is crucial for proper diagnosis and management of these patients. HAE is caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene that result in decreased plasma levels of functional C1 inhibitor. A large number of different mutations have been described that result in HAE. About 15% of patients have a mutation at or near the active site of the reactive mobile loop, resulting in a protein that lacks functional activity (type II HAE). Type I HAE is caused by a diverse range of mutations, some of which cause the nascent protein to misfold and thus to be unable to enter the secretory pathway. The primary mediator of swelling in HAE is bradykinin, a product of the plasma contact system. Bradykinin induces increased vascular permeability by activating the bradykinin B2 receptor, which results in phosphorylation of vascular endothelial cadherin. The regulation of both the bradykinin B2 receptor and peptidases that degrade bradykinin may influence HAE disease severity. HAE results from mutations in the SERPING1 gene that lead to a loss of functional C1 inhibitor. Attacks of angioedema result from generation of bradykinin, which acts on bradykinin B2 receptors to enhance vascular permeability.

Dynamics and plasticity of central vestibular nerve synapses
The vestibular system is critical for postural balance, orientation, reflexive control of eye movements, and spatial cognition, yet compared with other sensory systems little is known about its cellular basis. Head motion signals are transduced in the inner ear and carried to brainstem vestibular nuclei by vestibular nerve afferents. The nature and quality of head motion information in the central nervous system depend on the capacity of vestibular nerve synapses to influence firing in postsynaptic neurons. This dissertation examines the functional and molecular features of the vestibular nerve synapse that promote the faithful transmission of head motion signals. Experimental results revealed that these synapses are specialized to provide postsynaptic neurons with unambiguous signals that linearly relate to head velocity. Extensive refinements of cellular machinery enable reliable, fast, linear synaptic transmission while still allowing for modifications of synaptic strength. Long-term depression and potentiation of vestibular nerve synapses linearly regulate the firing responses of postsynaptic neurons and are well suited to underlie cerebellum-dependent calibration of vestibular reflex strength

Confronting bias: How targets and allies can address prejudice against gay men in the workplace
While many organizations have taken steps to protect minority individuals from the negative effects of prejudice and discrimination, such initiatives may be met with limited success. That is, prejudice and discrimination may remain major problems even with organizations who adopt organizational policies to enhance equity and reduce workplace discrimination. This dissertation examines the use of an individual-level strategy that individuals can enact in response to prejudice and/or discrimination, and that is the strategy of directly confronting the prejudice of their co-workers. This study examines the utility of confronting co-workers in the workplace with particular emphasis on the cognitions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions of third-party bystanders following witnessing a confrontation. I anticipated that the identity of the confronter (a member of the target group or an ally) and the level of conflict (high or low conflict) as well as the type of conflict (aggressive vs. calm, and personalized to the individual vs. generalized to society as a whole) in the confrontation would differentially impact outcome variables. Indeed, the results suggest that allies (versus targets) who confront elicit more positive behavioral intentions from observers to enact such strategies in the future; that high conflict (either aggressive or personalized) confrontations elicit more negative cognitions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions than do low conflict confrontations; and that targets and allies who confront have the most impact on third-party individuals if they utilize different strategies. Specifically, allies received particularly negative ratings when they confronted in an aggressive and personalized manner (compared to the other three strategies) and targets received relatively negative ratings only when confronting in an aggressive manner. These results held true in data obtained several weeks later. This research assesses the practicality of using confrontation as a prejudice-reduction tool and potentially informs future diversity management initiatives in organizations.

UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF COMPRESSION AND CONSTRAINTS ON WATER UPTAKE OF FUEL-CELL MEMBRANES
Accurate characterization of polymer-electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) requires understanding the impact of mechanical and electrochemical loads on cell components. An essential aspect of this relationship is the effect of compression on the polymer membrane?s water-uptake behavior and transport properties. However, there is limited information on the impact of physical constraints on membrane properties. In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and experimentally how the water uptake of Nafion membrane changes under external compression loads. The swelling of a compressed membrane is modeled by modifying the swelling pressure in the polymer backbone which relies on the changes in the microscopic volume of the polymer. The model successfully predicts the water content of the compressed membrane measured through in-situ swelling-compression tests and neutron imaging. The results show that external mechanical loads could reduce the water content and conductivity of the membrane, especially at lower temperatures, higher humidities, and in liquid water. The modeling framework and experimental data provide valuable insight for the swelling and conductivity of constrained and compressed membranes, which are of interest in electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells.

Evo-devo of human adolescence: beyond disease models of early puberty
Abstract
Despite substantial heritability in pubertal development, much variation remains to be explained, leaving room for the influence of environmental factors to adjust its phenotypic trajectory in the service of fitness goals. Utilizing evolutionary development biology (evo-devo), we examine adolescence as an evolutionary life-history stage in its developmental context. We show that the transition from the preceding stage of juvenility entails adaptive plasticity in response to energy resources, other environmental cues, social needs of adolescence and maturation toward youth and adulthood. Using the evolutionary theory of socialization, we show that familial psychosocial stress fosters a fast life history and reproductive strategy rather than early maturation being just a risk factor for aggression and delinquency. Here we explore implications of an evolutionary-developmental-endocrinological-anthropological framework for theory building, while illuminating new directions for research.

Salinomycin induces cell death and differentiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma stem cells despite activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Akt
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Cancer stem cells (CSC) are believed to play a crucial role in cancer recurrence due to their resistance to conventional chemotherapy and capacity for self-renewal. Recent studies have reported that salinomycin, a livestock antibiotic, selectively targets breast cancer stem cells 100-fold more effectively than paclitaxel. In our study we sought to determine the effects of salinomycin on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) stem cells.
				
				
					
						Methods
					MTS and TUNEL assays were used to study cell proliferation and apoptosis as a function of salinomycin exposure in JLO-1, a putative HNSCC stem cell culture. MTS and trypan blue dye exclusion assays were performed to investigate potential drug interactions between salinomycin and cisplatin or paclitaxel. Stem cell-like phenotype was measured by mRNA expression of stem cell markers, sphere-forming capacity, and matrigel invasion assays. Immunoblotting was also used to determine expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and Akt phosphorylation. Arrays by Illumina, Inc. were used to profile microRNA expression as a function of salinomycin dose.
				
				
					
						Results
					In putative HNSCC stem cells, salinomycin was found to significantly inhibit cell viability, induce a 71.5% increase in levels of apoptosis, elevate the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and work synergistically with cisplatin and paclitaxel in inducing cell death. It was observed that salinomycin significantly inhibited sphere forming-capability and repressed the expression of CD44 and BMI-1 by 3.2-fold and 6.2-fold, respectively. Furthermore, salinomycin reduced invasion of HNSCC stem cells by 2.1 fold. Contrary to expectations, salinomycin induced the expression of EMT markers Snail, vimentin, and Zeb-1, decreased expression of E-cadherin, and also induced phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets GSK3-&#946; and mTOR.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These results demonstrate that in HNSCC cancer stem cells, salinomycin can cause cell death and decrease stem cell properties despite activation of both EMT and Akt.

Computational mass spectrometry : algorithms for identification of peptides not present in protein databases
Mass spectrometry has revolutionized protein identification in the last decade. Efficient algorithms have been developed to identify peptides that are encoded in protein databases. This work presents novel methods for interpretation of mass spectrometry data on compounds that are not directly encoded in protein databases. One example of compounds that are not in protein databases are nonribosomal peptides. Because of the specialized machinery that synthesizes these compounds and their unique (often cyclic) structure, traditional database search tools cannot analyze these data. With new algorithmic developments, we show that mass spectrometry can speed up the process of characterization of cyclic peptides which are compounds of great interest in drug discovery. A second class of peptides that are not encoded in protein databases are peptides that are the product of fused proteins. This type of peptides can arise from cancer proteomes, where the peptide spans a fusion point. Again, traditional search tools cannot identify fusion peptides because they are not directly encoded in the databases. We also present an algorithm to identify such peptides. Finally, mutated and modified peptides are also not directly encoded in protein databases. Existing tools are particularly inefficient when searching for unexpected modifications. Although this problem has been addressed with "blind" database search tools, their running time is too demanding to be practical for large databases. We develop new methods to search for mutated and modified peptides that are orders of magnitude faster than existing tools. Overall, with new algorithmic developments we enable mass spectrometry to characterize novel compounds that evade identification with traditional MS/MS tools

The effect of surface treatment on the stress/life fatigue behavior of a titanium Ti-6Al-4V turbine fan blade alloy is investigated in the regime of 102 to 106 cycles to failure under fully reversed stress-controlled isothermal push-pull loading between 25? and 550?C at a frequency of 5 Hz.  Specifically, the fatigue behavior was examined in specimens in the deep-rolled and laser-shock peened surface conditions, and compared to results on samples in the untreated (machined and stress annealed) condition.  Although the fatigue resistance of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy declined with increasing test temperature regardless of surface condition, deep-rolling and laser-shock peening surface treatments were found to extend the fatigue lives by factors of more than 30 and 5-10, respectively, in  the high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue regimes at temperatures as high as 550?C. At these temperatures, compressive residual stresses are essentially relaxed; however, it is the presence of near-surface work hardened layers, with a nanocystalline structure in the case of deep-rolling and dense dislocation tangles in the case of laser-shock peening, which remain fairly stable even after cycling at 450?-550?C, that provide the basis for the beneficial role of mechanical surface treatments on the fatigue strength of Ti-6Al-4V at elevated temperatures.

Evolution of a horizontally acquired legume gene, albumin 1, in the parasitic plant Phelipanche aegyptiaca and related species
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Parasitic plants, represented by several thousand species of angiosperms, use modified structures known as haustoria to tap into photosynthetic host plants and extract nutrients and water. As a result of their direct plant-plant connections with their host plant, parasitic plants have special opportunities for horizontal gene transfer, the nonsexual transmission of genetic material across species boundaries. There is increasing evidence that parasitic plants have served as recipients and donors of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), but the long-term impacts of eukaryotic HGT in parasitic plants are largely unknown.
				
				
					
						Results
					Here we show that a gene encoding albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like protein, closely related to the albumin 1 genes only known from papilionoid legumes, where they serve dual roles as food storage and insect toxin, was found in Phelipanche aegyptiaca and related parasitic species of family Orobanchaceae, and was likely acquired by a Phelipanche ancestor via HGT from a legume host based on phylogenetic analyses. The KNOTTINs are well known for their unique &#8220;disulfide through disulfide knot&#8221; structure and have been extensively studied in various contexts, including drug design. Genomic sequences from nine related parasite species were obtained, and 3D protein structure simulation tests and evolutionary constraint analyses were performed. The parasite gene we identified here retains the intron structure, six highly conserved cysteine residues necessary to form a KNOTTIN protein, and displays levels of purifying selection like those seen in legumes. The albumin 1 xenogene has evolved through &gt;150 speciation events over ca. 16 million years, forming a small family of differentially expressed genes that may confer novel functions in the parasites. Moreover, further data show that a distantly related parasitic plant, Cuscuta, obtained two copies of albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like genes from legumes through a separate HGT event, suggesting that legume KNOTTIN structures have been repeatedly co-opted by parasitic plants.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The HGT-derived albumins in Phelipanche represent a novel example of how plants can acquire genes from other plants via HGT that then go on to duplicate, evolve, and retain the specialized features required to perform a unique host-derived function.

Experimental Macroeconomics: Essays on Partial and General Equilibrium Dynamics in Laboratory Economies
This study explores how macroeconomic questions can be studied in laboratory settings. A novel experimental methodology is proposed and implemented to study how partial and general equilibrium economies respond to stochastic productivity and monetary shocks under various conditions. Following the DSGE approach, subjects interact over numerous periods to converge to a steady state, then are shocked with temporary or permanent shocks. Their responses to the shocks are compared with theoretical impulse responses. Findings indicate that subjects experience considerable difficulty converging to the efficient competitive equilibrium in economies where money is present. There is a high degree of heterogeneity in how individuals react to monetary shocks and form expectations. Elicited expectations are highly adaptive but are converging in the direction of rationality over extensive stationary repetition. We fail to find evidence in both partial and general equilibrium settings that subjects exhibit money illusion.

Molecular mechanisms of ligand-dependent repression by the estrogen receptor and derepression by inflammatory signaling
Uncovering the linkage between inflammatory signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs is key to understanding the role of inflammation in homeostasis and disease. An intriguing aspect of this connection has emerged with the identification of a cohort of genes that exhibit direct negative regulation by liganded ERalpha that can be reactivated by specific inflammatory signals. We found that ERalpha-dependent repression of the BMP7 gene, which is overexpressed in up to 70% of primary breast tumors and is reactivated by inflammatory signaling, utilizes an LXXLL motif-containing orphan nuclear receptor, SHP, as a corepressor to recruit the NCoR/TAB2 complex to the BMP7 promoter. In response to inflammatory signals, transient association of the ubiquitin ligases TRAF6 and Ubc13 with the TAB2-containing NCoR complex on the BMP7 promoter catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination of TAB2, permitting promoter-specific recruitment of MEKK1 and licensing clearance of the NCoR complex. We have identified similar inflammation-induced reactivation of additional ERalpha-repressed genes, including BAK1, NCOA3, and ZNF217, which also exhibit TRAF6-dependent derepression. We suggest that this TAB2/TRAF6/MEKK1 corepressor clearance pathway regulates specific gene expression programs in response to diverse stimuli and in other cell types, including the hematopoietic and nervous systems, identifying a novel pathway for selective gene activation by inflammatory signals

Lensfree Holographic On-Chip Imaging and Three-Dimensional Tracking
Despite the rapid progress in optical imaging, most of the advanced microscopy modalities still require complex and costly set-ups that unfortunately limit their use beyond well-equipped laboratories. To provide affordable and easy-to-use microscopes for resource-limited settings, I developed a holographic on-chip imaging technology that utilizes cost-effective and compact optoelectronic components to enable the digital reconstruction of microscopic amplitude and phase images for biological cells with sub-micron resolution over a field-of-view of >24 mm^2. Without the need for any lenses, bulky optical components or coherent sources such as lasers, this partially-coherent computational imaging modality can automatically analyze thousands of cells in parallel for their cell type, concentration, structure, and dynamics. As being compact, light-weight, cost-effective, high-throughput, and highly-sensitive, this lensfree imaging technology is especially suitable for field diagnostics applications involving global health problems such as HIV, malaria, infectious diarrhea, or male infertility. Based on this lensfree imaging technology, I also devised a dual-angle dual-color holographic scheme to achieve sub-micron accuracy and sub-12-minisecond resolution for three-dimensional tracking of >1,500 human sperms in a field-of-view of >17 mm^2 and a depth-of-field of >0.5 mm. The high accuracy and high throughput of this lensfree imaging platform enabled the first observation of human sperms' tight (1-6um wide), fast (3-20 r/sec), and rare (4- 5%) helical trajectories, which surprisingly are dominated by right-handed ones (~90%) and can be significantly suppressed by seminal plasma. Such a high-throughput 3D tracking platform can also be a valuable tool for observing the statistical swimming patterns of various microorganisms, leading to new insights in their 3D dynamics.

The work is broken down into two major components: the organic aerosol mass released from biomass burning and the evolution of SOA with special emphasis on formation routes. The biomass burning work explored the evolution of organic aerosol emissions as a function of modified combustion efficiency with correlations drawn between levoglucosan emissions and wood-type, combustion type (flaming, mixed, smoldering) using high resolution aerosol mass spectrometry. The SOA work includes insights into the mechanism for SOA formation from aromatics including the impacts of temperature and particle-aging. This work conclusively demonstrates that gas-particle partitioning theory combined with enthalpies of formation are insufficient to model the formation of SOA as a function of time; that the presence of secondary reactions, in both the particle and gas-phase continue to evolve the aerosol beyond that typically simulated in environmental chambers; and that current mechanisms for SOA formation from aromatics fail to explain isotopically labeled experiments while conclusively ruling out the importance of organic nitrate products.

Geochemical and Petrological Investigations into Mantle Minerals  from Experiments and Natural Samples
This dissertation consists of a series of studies investigating geochemical and petrological aspects of mantle minerals, namely, olivine, spinel, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene.  The first study is an experimental look at the solubility of the clinopyroxene mineral diopside (CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) in natural fluids.  Results allow insight into the chemistry of high P-T fluids and the behavior of a major mantle mineral in equilibrium with such fluids.  The second study focuses on iron isotopic compositions of mantle minerals as powerful tracers for geochemical processes in the mantle, such as partial melting, metasomatism, and oxidation.  To address this, we studied inter-mineral iron isotopic fractionation of minerals from five distinct mantle-xenolith lithologies from San Carlos, Arizona.  We compared the fractionations with opposing calculations predicting equilibrium iron fractionation at high temperatures, and applied the results to implications of petrogenesis of the xenoliths.  The last study is an experimental determination of equilibrium magnesium isotope fractionation between spinel, forsterite, and magnesite from 600°C to 800°C.  In these experiments we implemented the three-isotope method with forsterite and magnesite, and with spinel and magnesite, at three different temperatures in high-pressure piston cylinder apparatus for varying lengths of time, using carbonate as the exchange medium.  The result is the first rigorous high temperature experimental calibration of magnesium isotope fractionation of mantle minerals, and is generally consistent with expectations based on crystal chemical environment of Mg in these phases.  The combination of experimental petrology with isotope geochemistry is a powerful approach for understanding mantle processes.  Comparisons of these types studies with natural samples and theoretical predictions provide new insights into Earth's mantle.

Phylogeny of tropical marine oscillatoria and correlation with biologically active secondary metabolites
The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of phylogenetics as a method of predicting secondary metabolite production. A phylogeny of 27 strains of tropical marine cyanobacteria from 5 geographic locations was constructed based on the SSU (16S) rRNA gene. Evolutionary relationships among the strains were used to predict their production of several known natural products. Two strains from Curac̦ao were successfully predicted to produce dolastatin 12 and tumonoic acid B based on secondary metabolite production by related strains, while a morphologically similar but evolutionarily more distant strain from the same geographic location was correctly predicted to not produce these compounds. However, a strain from Panama that was closely related to the dolastatin 12 and tumonoic acid producers did not produce these compounds. This suggests that while evolutionary relatedness can be a useful tool for predicting secondary metabolite production, it is possible that environmental factors affect production of specific compounds. With this in mind, a phylogeny-guided approach is still an effective method of finding existing bioactive compounds of interest, and possibly new natural analogs of those compounds

The Role of the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in the Evolution of Magnetized Relativistic Sheared Plasma Flows
We explore, via analytical and numerical methods, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in relativistic magnetized plasmas, with applications to astrophysical jets.  We solve the single-fluid relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations in conservative form using a scheme which is fourth-order in space and time.  To invert the RMHD equations, we use a highly accurate, rapidly-convergent algorithm which improves upon such schemes as the Newton-Raphson method.  Though the exact RMHD equations are marginally stable, numerical discretization renders them unstable.  Artificial viscosity restores numerical stability, but also models physical processes (momentum transfer, conductivity). We use a two-dimensional slab geometry with periodic boundary conditions in both directions.  The background velocity peaks along the central axis and vanishes asymptotically at the transverse boundaries.  Remaining background quantities are uniform, with a flow-aligned background magnetic field. In both the linear and nonlinear analysis, we have successfully unified the HD, MHD, RHD, and RMHD regimes.The early nonlinear regime corresponds to the formation of counter-rotating vortices, connected by filaments, which persist in the absence of a magnetic field.  A magnetic field inhibits the vortices through a series of stages, namely, field amplification, vortex disruption, turbulent breakdown, and an approach to a flow-aligned equilibrium configuration. Similar stages have been discussed in MHD literature.  We examine how and to what extent these stages manifest in RMHD for a set of representative field strengths.  To characterize field strength, we define a relativistic extension of the Alfvenic Mach number M<sub>A</sub>.  We observe close complementarity between flow and magnetic field behavior.  Weaker fields exhibit more vortex rotation, magnetic reconnection, jet-broadening, and intermediate turbulence.  Sufficiently strong fields (M<sub>A</sub> < 6) completely suppress vortex formation. Maximum jet deceleration, and viscous dissipation, occurs for intermediate vortex-disruptive fields, while maximum electromagnetic energy extraction occurs for the strongest fields which allow vortex formation.  Our results are qualitatively similar to observations of numerous jets, including M87, whose knots may exhibit vortex-like behavior.Highly relativistic flows destabilize the system, supporting modes with near-maximum growth at smaller wavelengths than the shear width of the velocity.  This helps to explain early numerical breakdown of highly relativistic artificial viscosity simulations, a long-standing problem.

Reliability-based framework for fatigue damage prognosis of bonded structural elements in aerospace composite structures
Fatigue-induced damage is one of the most uncertain and extremely unpredictable failure mechanisms for a large variety of structural systems (e.g., aerospace, automotive, offshore, and civil structures) subjected to stochastic and cyclic loading during service life. Among these systems, composite lightweight aerospace structures -- such as fighter aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) -- are particularly sensitive to both fatigue- induced and impact-induced damage. Within this scenario, an integrated hardware & software system capable of (i) monitoring the critical components of these systems, (ii) periodically assessing their structural integrity, (iii) predicting their remaining fatigue life (damage prognosis), and (iv) accomplishing a cost-efficient condition-based maintenance (CBM) is ultimately needed. This research contributes to the aforementioned objectives by providing a novel and comprehensive probabilistic methodology for predicting the remaining fatigue life of adhesively-bonded joints in composite structures. According to this methodology, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques and recursive Bayesian inference are repeatedly employed to update the probability distributions of damage extents and damage evolution model parameters at various damage locations after each NDE inspection. The propagation of damage is then stochastically simulated using a probabilistic model for future operational loads and a surrogate model (calibrated and validated at various damage levels using a mechanics-based model) capable of predicting the structural response quantities of interest. Finally, local and global failure criteria are considered simultaneously to compute the probabilities of failure and false-alarm at future times by abstracting the structure (or structural component) into a combination of series and parallel sub-systems. Three benchmark applications are provided in this work to exercise, verify, and validate the proposed framework. The first two benchmark applications analyze the fatigue-driven debonding propagation along a pre-defined adhesive interface in a simply supported laminated composite beam. They demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed recursive Bayesian inference scheme, show the use of the proposed component and system reliability analyses to recursively predict and update the evolution in time of the probabilities of failure and false-alarm of the structure, and illustrate the robustness of the framework. Finally, the third benchmark application validates the proposed damage prognosis methodology by using experimental fatigue test data obtained from the literature

ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE HERMIT CRAB DARDANUS PEDUNCULATUS AND ITS COMMENSAL SEA ANEMONE CALLIACTIS TRICOLOR ON MOOREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA
Crabs of the species Dardanus pedunculatus form a symbiotic relationship with Calliactis tricolor anemones on Moorea, French Polynesia. Crabs actively collect anemones for protection against octopus predation, while simultaneously giving the anemones a better habitat, defense against predators, and food as a result of the crab’s messy eating. In a laboratory setting, crabs will compete for anemones with larger crabs winning competitions. This paper examined crabs’ field collection patterns, and found that larger crabs collect more anemones, cover a greater percentage of their dorsal side with anemones, and carry a larger volume of anemones than smaller individuals. An experiment was designed to determine collection preference when unimpeded by field restrictions, and found that larger crabs show similar collection patterns as in the field, while smaller crabs cover a greater percentage of their dorsal side with anemones than in the field. This implies that abundance of anemones limits collection for this population, and that smaller crabs are being out-competed for anemones in the field. Additional behavioral experiments were designed to determine individual anemone preference patterns. Crabs show no preference for anemones they had been associated with in the field, but did show a significant preference for larger anemones. Gaining a better understanding of this symbiosis adds to the much-needed literature on the fragile coral reef ecosystem.

FAST STATIC AND DYNAMIC GRID LEVEL THERMAL SIMULATION CONSIDERING TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF SILICON
Power blurring has been developed to calculate temperature profiles in VLSI ICs, in both steady-state and transient regimes. It is illustrated that PB is very fast and accurate in steady-state thermal analysis. However, the transient method was inefficient when it was handling the temperature analysis of real workloads. A new algorithm for transient power blurring has been developed to calculate temperature profiles of real workloads. It is shown that the method can be utilized for thermal simulation at both device and architecture level. A detailed comparison is performed between the power blurring method and two of the commonly used architecture level thermal simulators, HotSpot and SESCTherm simulators. We take into account both the accuracy of the thermal simulation and the computational speed.  The results indicate  that  Power  Blurring has  the potential to be a promising  architecture level thermal simulator for fast calculation  of the temperature profile from the input  power map in a realistic package  which, in turn, is a key ingredient  for full self-consistent  simulations.Additionally, power blurring is extended so that it considers the temperature dependent thermal conductivity of silicon chips in ICs. Temperature rises of 40-50°C on the chip will reduce the thermal conductivity of silicon by 10-20%. This could affect the hot spot temperature by 5-7°C. In this work the PB approach, which is based on the superposition principle, is extended to account for the temperature-dependent material properties. Two Adaptive Power Blurring (APB) methods based on iterative procedures are proposed. In both methods, PB provides an initial temperature distribution estimation using the room temperature Si thermal conductivity. Good convergence is achieved in only 2-3 iterations in both methods. It is demonstrated that these APB methods substantially improve the accuracy at high temperature rise values, in particular at hot spots, while still being much faster than traditional finite element modeling (FEM) computations.

External Mass Injection to Reduce Energetic Ion Production in the Discharge Plume of High Current Hollow Cathodes
Hollow cathode discharge studies have shown the existence of energetic ions at high discharge currents that are likely responsible for the high erosion rates and erosion patterns observed on the keeper electrode of the hollow cathode.  This thesis uses experimental methods to study the effects of neutral gas injection in the xenon hollow cathode discharge plume on the production of energetic ions to determine the injection conditions that yield optimum hollow cathode operation and life.  Parameters considered include the flow split between the cathode internal flow and the external gas injectors, the number of external gas injection sites, the locations of these injection sites, and the orifice size of the injectors, all as a function of the discharge current level.  Two lanthanum hexaboride hollow cathodes of diameters 1.5 cm and 2 cm are studied for discharge currents of up to 100 A and 250 A, respectively.      Internal measurements of the 1.5-cm-dia. cathode with a Langmuir probe reveal plasma potential and electron temperature profiles that are characteristic of hollow cathodes and relative insensitivity to the discharge and flow conditions.  Plasma density measurements inside the cathode show that the density is sufficiently high and in contact with the entire 2.5-cm insert length only at relatively low internal cathode flow rates so that space-charge limitations on the emitted electron current density are not an issue.  At high internal cathode flows, the density peak is pushed toward the orifice plate and the plasma contact with the insert is reduced.       A retarding-potential analyzer is used to make ion energy measurements in the discharge plume of the 2-cm-dia. cathode at discharge currents of 25 to 250 A and at various gas-flow conditions.  In general, increasing discharge current increases the energetic ion production at any given flow rate or injection location.  External gas injection reduces energetic ion production with fewer energetic ions at higher external injected flow.  Further, collimated gas-jet injection performs better than point-source (distributed) injection.  Increasing cathode internal flow for constant external flow also reduces energetic ion production. The greatest reduction of energetic ion production occurs when both the internal and external flows were at their maximum values.      Lifetime estimates of the keeper electrode surface due to sputter-erosion by ion bombardment are calculated to determine the impact of the energetic ion generation on the cathode life.  High discharge current operation at low cathode gas flow produced very energetic ions that limited keeper lifetimes to less than 5,000 hours.  Applying sufficient internal cathode gas flow and external gas injection extended the keeper life to over 10,000 hours at discharge currents of up to 200 A.  For higher discharge current operation, more cathode flow and/or injected flow will be required to increase keeper life, but this could not be explored in detail due to pumping speed limitations of the current facility.

2D Dirac Materials: From Graphene to Topological Insulators
Silicon has been reaching physical limits as the semiconductor industry moves to smaller device feature sizes, increased integration densities and faster operation speeds. There is a strong need to engineer alternative materials, which can become foundation of new computational paradigms or lead to other applications such as efficient solid-state energy conversion. Recently discovered Dirac materials, which are characterized by the liner electron dispersion, are examples of such alternative materials. In this dissertation, I investigate two representatives of Dirac materials - graphene and topological insulators. Specifically, I focus on the (i) effects of electron beam irradiation on graphene properties and (ii) electronic and thermal characteristics of exfoliated films of Bi2Te3-family of topological insulators. I carried out Raman investigation of changes in graphene crystal lattice induced by the low and medium energy electron-beam irradiation (5-20 keV). It was found that radiation exposures result in appearance of the disorder D band around 1345&#8194;cm&#8722;1. The dependence of the ratio of the intensities of D and G peaks, I(D)/I(G), on the irradiation dose is non-monotonic suggesting graphene's transformation to polycrystalline and then to disordered state. By controlling the irradiation dose one can change the carrier mobility and increase the resistance at the minimum conduction point. The obtained results may lead to new methods of defect engineering of graphene properties. They also have important implications for fabrication of graphene nanodevices, which involve electron beams. Bismuth telluride and related compounds are the best thermoelectric materials known today. Recently, it was determined that they reveal the topological insulator properties. We succeeded in the first "graphene-like" exfoliation of large-area crystalline films and ribbons of Bi2Te3 with the thickness going down to a single quintuple. The presence of van der Waals gaps allowed us to disassemble Bi2Te3 crystal into the five mono-atomic sheets consisting of Te(1)-Bi-Te(2)-Bi-Te(1). The exfoliated films had extremely low thermal conductivity and electrical resistance in the range required for thermoelectric applications. The obtained results may pave the way for producing Bi2Te3 films and stacked superlattices with strong quantum confinement of charge carriers and predominantly surface transport, and allow one to obtain theoretically predicted order-of-magnitude higher thermoelectric figure-of-merit.

The fine-structure constant and wavelength calibration
The fine-structure constant is a fundamental constant of the universe -- and widely thought to have an unchanging value. However, the past decade has witnessed a controversy unfold over the claimed detection that the fine-structure constant had a different value in the distant past. These astrophysical measurements were made with spectrographs at the world's largest optical telescopes. The spectrographs make precise measurements of the wavelength spacing of absorption lines in the metals in the gas between the quasar background source and our telescopes on Earth. The wavelength spacing gives a snapshot of the atomic physics at the time of the interaction. Whether the fine-structure constant has changed is determined by comparing the atomic physics in the distant past with the atomic physics of today. We present our contribution to the discussion by analyzing three nights data taken with the HIRES instrument (High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph) on the Keck telescope. We provide an independent measurement on the fine-structure constant from the Damped Lyman alpha system at a redshift of z=2.309 (10.8 billion years ago) quasar PHL957. We developed a new method for calibrating the wavelength scale of a quasar exposure to a much higher precision than previously achieved. In our subsequent analysis, we discovered unexpected wavelength calibration errors that has not been taken into account in the previously reported measurements. After characterizing the wavelength miscalibrations on the Keck-HIRES instrument, we obtained several nights of data from the main competing instrument, the VLT (Very Large Telescope) with UVES (Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph). We applied our new wavelength calibration method and uncovered similar in nature systematic errors as found on Keck-HIRES. Finally, we make a detailed Monte Carlo exploration of the effects that these miscalibrations have on making precision fine- structure constant measurements

Feature-based attentional gain is flexibly deployed in visual cortex
Feature-based attention (FBA) is a selection mechanism implemented in the visual system that facilitates perceptual representations of behaviorally-relevant stimulus features at the expense of behaviorally- irrelevant features in order to aid decision-making. Traditional accounts of FBA indicate that this facilitation occurs via the modulation of feature- selective neurons in visual cortex: the responses of neurons that are maximally driven by (or "tuned to") the relevant feature are enhanced (termed sensory gain or attentional gain), while the responses of other neurons are suppressed. However, recent theoretical and psychophysical evidence suggests potential modifications to this longstanding model, wherein the locus of attentional gain depends not only on the shape of the neuronal tuning functions, but also on the nature of the perceptual task. For example, during a coarse discrimination task, in which an observer must discriminate a target feature (e.g., 90° oriented line) from a set of highly dissimilar distractors (e.g., 180° oriented line), neurons tuned to the target (termed on- channel or on-target neurons) are highly informative given a large change in firing rates between stimulus alternatives (i.e., greater signal-to-noise ratio or SNR). During a fine discrimination task, however, in which the target and distractors are highly similar (e.g., 90° oriented line among 85° oriented lines), on-channel neurons provide little sensory evidence since they respond nearly as well to both the target and distractors. In this case, attentional gain should be applied to neurons tuned away from the target feature (interchangeably termed off- channel or off-target neurons) that produce a greater SNR. Here, I present a set of psychophysical (Chapter 1) and neuroimaging (Chapters 2 and 3) studies in support of an optimal gain model of FBA that flexibly targets sensory inputs based on informativeness. Together, the studies suggest that human observers are able to optimally deploy attentional gain according to task demands to feature- selective populations in visual cortex. Furthermore, the level of off-channel modulation is predictive of subjects' behavioral performance on a range of difficult fine discrimination tasks, indicating that these inputs are ultimately utilized in perceptual decision-making

Dynamic State Alteration Techniques for Automatically Locating Software Errors
Software does not always behave as expected due to errors.  These errors can potentially lead to disastrous consequences.  Unfortunately, debugging software errors can be difficult and time-consuming.  Many techniques to automatically locate errors have been developed, but the results are far from ideal.  Unlike other techniques that analyze existing state information from program executions, dynamic state alteration techniques modify the state of program executions to gain deeper insight into the potential locations of errors.  However, prior state alteration techniques are generally no more effective than other techniques, and come at the expense of increased computation time.  This dissertation shows that <italic>aggressive</italic> and <italic>well-targeted</italic> state alteration techniques can be both highly effective and reasonably efficient.The <italic>Value Replacement</italic> technique performs aggressive state alterations to locate software errors by replacing the set of values used in different statement instances in failing program executions.  In a set of benchmarks, Value Replacement precisely identifies a faulty statement in 39 out of 129 cases, whereas the most effective technique previously known does so in 5 cases.  Value Replacement can be generalized to iteratively locate multiple errors.  A brute-force implementation of Value Replacement can require hours to locate a single error, but techniques are developed that can reduce this timing requirement to minutes to locate multiple errors.The <italic>Execution Suppression</italic> technique performs targeted state alterations to locate memory errors by iteratively suppressing (avoiding) the effects of statements involving known memory corruption during failing executions.  The technique is able to precisely identify the first point of memory corruption in all analyzed benchmark programs; this point is typically at or close to the location of a memory error.  Execution Suppression can be generalized to locate multithreading errors including data races.  While a software-only implementation of suppression incurs an overhead of 7.2x on average, this overhead can be reduced to 1.8x using hardware support.Finally, a machine learning technique called <italic>BugFix</italic> is developed that provides automated assistance in modifying a faulty statement to fix an error.  A case study illustrates the potential benefit of the technique.

Electrical and Thermoelectrical Transport Properties of Graphene
Graphene is a newly discovered material. It has many excellent properties, which make the research of this new material very important not only for the fundamental physics but also for the application. This thesis is a summary of our study in the electrical and thermoelectrical transport properties of graphene.  In the first part of our work, we use a layer of molecules act as the charge reservoir to control the charge environment near or on graphene, we first obtained a mobility enhancement. By set the charge back and forth between graphene and the molecules, we found the graphene mobility can be widely tuned from 4000 to 19000 cm2/Vs. This strongly supports that charge impurities scattering is the main mechanism for graphene mobility. In addition, the charge neutral point in graphene can also be tuned independently over a wide gate voltage. A large memory effect is also found in the graphene device addressed with molecules, which makes this system potentially important for graphene application, such as graphene FLASH memory. In the second part of our work, we studied the thermopower of graphene with a wide range of mobility, i. e. varying degree of disorders, along with electrical conductivity at different temperatures. We have proved that the transport properties in graphene are indeed caused by the Dirac fermions particles. Moreover, we have found that the Mott relation fails in the vicinity of the Dirac point in high-mobility graphene. By properly taking account of high-temperature effects, we have obtained good agreement between the Boltzmann transport theory and our experimental data. In low-mobility graphene where the charged impurities induce relatively high residual carrier density, the Mott relation holds at all gate voltages.

Computational prediction of type III secreted proteins from gram-negative bacteria
Abstract



Background

Type III secretion system (T3SS) is a specialized protein delivery system in gram-negative bacteria that injects proteins (called effectors) directly into the eukaryotic host cytosol and facilitates bacterial infection. For many plant and animal pathogens, T3SS is indispensable for disease development. Recently, T3SS has also been found in rhizobia and plays a crucial role in the nodulation process. Although a great deal of efforts have been done to understand type III secretion, the precise mechanism underlying the secretion and translocation process has not been fully understood. In particular, defined secretion and translocation signals enabling the secretion have not been identified from the type III secreted effectors (T3SEs), which makes the identification of these important virulence factors notoriously challenging. The availability of a large number of sequenced genomes for plant and animal-associated bacteria demands the development of efficient and effective prediction methods for the identification of T3SEs using bioinformatics approaches.



Results

We have developed a machine learning method based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences to predict novel type III effectors in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the microsymbiont rhizobia. The extracted features used in the learning model (or classifier) include amino acid composition, secondary structure and solvent accessibility information. The method achieved a precision of over 90% on P. syringae in a cross validation study. In combination with a promoter screen for the type III specific promoters, this classifier trained on the P. syringae data was applied to predict novel T3SEs from the genomic sequences of four rhizobial strains. This application resulted in 57 candidate type III secreted proteins, 17 of which are confirmed effectors.



Conclusion

Our experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning method based on N-terminal amino acid sequences combined with a promoter screen could prove to be a very effective computational approach for predicting novel type III effectors in gram-negative bacteria. Our method and data are available to the public upon request.

Single cell growth and gene expression dynamics in model organisms
The developing discipline of synthetic biology attempts to recreate in artificial systems the emergent properties found in natural biology. Progress in this field requires a thorough understanding of the basic cellular functions that underly complex biological networks. Here, we present several studies that use existing and novel methods to probe the dynamic behavior of the model organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli at the single cell level. First, we develop a microfluidic chemostat for monitoring single-cell gene expression within large populations of S. cerevisiae over many cellular generations. Second, we investigate the sources of extrinsic variability in eukaryotic gene expression using a combination of computational modeling and fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in S. cerevisiae. Third, we use an enhanced version of the microfluidic chemostat to subject a large population of S. cerevisiae to a periodically varying carbon source, uncovering a novel regulatory property of a well-characterized metabolic network. Fourth, we use fluorescence microscopy to acquire long-term volume trajectories for a large population of S. cerevisiae cells and reveal cell cycle dependent variations in protein concentration. Finally, we design and construct a synthetic signaling network in E. coli to investigate the coupling effect of "waiting lines" for enzymatic processing and discover correlated signaling through coupled protein degradation. Together, these studies illustrate the need for new approaches to studying fundamental cellular processes, in order to ultimately advance the goals of synthetic biology

Distribution of Soil Temperature Regimes and Climate Change in the Mojave Desert Region
Soil temperature plays an important role in physical, biological and microbiological processes occurring in the soil. It can be used as indicative of regional climate change. A long-term soil temperature database was collected at 75 locations in the Mojave Desert region by the Pallmann method from 1982-2000. This long-term database of soil temperature is invaluable and was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change pattern of soil temperature, and to examine the relationship between regional climate change and soil temperature over an extended period of time.The main conclusions of this research are: 1) the accuracy and consistency of the Pallmann method was good in comparison with two other temperature measurement methods: thermistor sensor and diffusion-cell method. The Pallmann method is an ideal method for studying the spatial variation in soil temperature and long-term climate changes. 2) Elevation is the dominated factor governing the spatial variation of soil temperature in the Mojave Desert region and can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of soil temperature. In the Mojave Desert region, hyperthermic soil is the most extensive one, which accounts for around 55% of the whole region. Thermic soil accounts for 38.7%. Frigid and mesic soils only occur at high elevation mountains. 3) Seasonal soil temperatures vary greatly in the Mojave Desert region and decrease linearly with elevation. The differences of the summer and winter soil temperature are around 20 °C under the same elevation. The effect of elevation on soil temperature is more pronounced in summer season than in winter season. 4) Soil and air temperature are highly correlated in the Mojave Desert region. Both of the soil and air temperature were found to be highly correlated with elevation and their spatiotemporal variations are highly positively correlated. 5) The Mojave Desert is experiencing a warming trend. Based on continued measurements across the region, the air and soil temperatures have risen at the rates of 0.79 and 0.63°C per 10 year from 1982 to 2000. The anomalies of annual precipitation were inversely correlated with those of soil temperature. The soil temperature of the Mojave Desert would be cooler than normal under El Niño conditions. 6) The climatic variables of air temperature, precipitation and evaporation had significant correlation with soil temperature. The spatial-temporal variation of soil temperature can be predicted based on the linear regression equation with air temperature and precipitation as independent variables.

To study the biochemical changes that may precede lung diseases, metabolomic effects on fetal and maternal lungs and plasma from rats exposed to ETS were compared to filtered air control animals. Genome- reconstructed metabolic pathways may be used to map and interpret dysregulation in metabolic networks. However, mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics datasets often comprise many metabolites for which links to enzymatic reactions have not yet been reported. Hence, network visualizations that rely on current biochemical databases are incomplete and also fail to visualize novel, structurally unidentified metabolites.ResultsWe present a novel approach to integrate biochemical pathway and chemical relationships to map all detected metabolites in network graphs (MetaMapp) using KEGG reactant pair database, Tanimoto chemical and NIST mass spectral similarity scores. In fetal and maternal lungs, and in maternal blood plasma from pregnant rats exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), 459 unique metabolites comprising 179 structurally identified compounds were detected by gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) and BinBase data processing. MetaMapp graphs in Cytoscape showed much clearer metabolic modularity and complete content visualization compared to conventional biochemical mapping approaches. Cytoscape visualization of differential statistics results using these graphs showed that overall, fetal lung metabolism was more impaired than lungs and blood metabolism in dams. Fetuses from ETS-exposed dams expressed lower lipid and nucleotide levels and higher amounts of energy metabolism intermediates than control animals, indicating lower biosynthetic rates of metabolites for cell division, structural proteins and lipids that are critical for in lung development.ConclusionsMetaMapp graphs efficiently visualizes mass spectrometry based metabolomics datasets as network graphs in Cytoscape, and highlights metabolic alterations that can be associated with higher rate of pulmonary diseases and infections in children prenatally exposed to ETS.

Cell cycle and DNA damage response regulation by Spy1, and the intersection of FGFR and NFkappaB pathways
Understanding the activation and regulatory functions of cyclin dependent kinases and their inhibitors is of great importance to cancer biology. Experiments from our lab and others have identified the Speedy/RINGO family of proteins as important regulators of mammalian cell cycle control. I show that Spy1 activates CDKs and stimulates p27Kip¹ degradation, thereby relieving an important cell cycle progression restraint. Using in vitro purified proteins in defined reactions, I demonstrate that Spy1 can directly activate CDK2 to phosphorylate p27 on Thr187, thereby targeting it for degradation and promoting S-phase entry. We also show that Spy1 is a component of the mammalian DNA damage response, preventing the DNA damage response and enhancing the survival of cells treated with DNA damaging agents. We show that Spy1 expression suppresses apoptosis in a p53- and p21-dependent fashion, allows for UV irradiation resistant DNA synthesis (UVDS), and inhibits the S- and G₂/M- checkpoints through inhibition of checkpoint response proteins. This leads to DNA damage tolerance and prevention of repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers through nucleotide excision repair suppression. Knockdown of Spy1 activates intrinsic damage responses, indicating that Spy1 is required to promote tolerance of endogenous and exogenous damage. The novel modes of CDK regulation by Speedy/RINGO proteins may be important during cell cycle transitions, in the tolerance of normal intrinsic damage or in response to exogenous DNA damage. Misregulation of FGFR signaling can lead to uncontrolled downstream signaling associated with many developmental syndromes and cancers. NFkappaB also regulates apoptosis and proliferation of many human cancers, and activation of inflammatory responses. Interestingly, our research identifies a novel link between FGFR signaling and the NFkappaB pathway. We show FGFR2 and FGFR4 interact with IKKbeta, a critical component of NFkappaB signaling. We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKbeta resulting from FGFR4 or FGFR2 expression, and show suppressed NFkappaB signaling upon FGFR activation, which is dependent upon FGFR kinase activity. This work provides a unique model of NFkappaB inactivation and implicates FGFR4 as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer and indicates FGFR2 may play dual roles as a tumor promoter and a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cell lines

Calcium dynamics in astrocytes : from oscillations to Alzheimer's
Astrocytes in the central nervous system engage in bi- directional signaling with neurons, and have been shown to be able to sense and modulate activity. While not electrically excitable like neurons, astrocytes display a form of calcium excitability, with complex dynamic oscillations in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration. Even though some of the biophysical details of these interactions have been observed, the systems-level role of these signals are poorly understood, with much debate as to whether they participate actively in information processing, inflammatory processes, or even how these signals arise. This thesis presents a multi-faceted attempt to further understand the role of astrocytes in central nervous system operation both under normal physiological conditions and under pathological insult, specifically focusing on Alzheimer's. Of particular interest in this work are the mechanisms and roles or intercellular calcium waves propagating through the astrocytic network. The functional role of this signaling is unknown, and this thesis attempts to shed light on astrocyte signaling through a combination of detailed mathematical modeling and experimental trials. We develop and apply models to in silico cultures of astrocytes to predict how calcium waves spontaneously form in Alzheimer's, compare to experimental results, and propose models for signal propagation within these networks. We also develop novel methods of numerically solving difficult fractional order differential equations with the goal of incorporating these techniques into our modeling of the complex interactions in the CNS

The Determinants of CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antiviral Activity Against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1
It is well established that CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are key players in the protective immune response against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1).However, there are clear differences in the effectiveness with which particular CTLcontrol viral infection. Understanding the factors that contribute to the individualdifferences in CTL antiviral efficiency will have great implications for vaccine design, assuch information will provide important insights on the mechanism of efficacious antiviralactivity against HIV-1.One key factor that affects the CTL-mediated antiviral efficiency is the cell-surfacedownregulation of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) mediated by the HIV-1 Nefprotein. While the degree of Nef interference on CTL antiviral efficiency has been shownto be epitope specific, the factors that determine the susceptibility of CTL to Nef are notclear. Previous work has indicated that, the timing of epitope expression, functionalavidity, and protein targeting as well as HLA-I restriction can have varying degrees ofinfluence on how well a CTL can recognize infected cells and suppress HIV-1replication. The primary goal of this dissertation is to better define the role these factorsplay in influencing CTL antiviral activity.This was addressed using a variety of viral constructs, and HIV-1 specific CTL clones.In Chapter Three, I first examine CTL susceptibility to Nef-mediated HLA-Idownregulation using a previously described viral suppression assay, and identifyepitope properties that determine susceptibility to Nef. Then in Chapter Four, I focus onthe role of protein targeting in CTL antiviral activity. I specifically compare the role ofGag versus Env targeting in viral suppression efficiency, using viral constructs where aGag epitope is translocated to the Env protein.The data presented in this dissertation show that the kinetics of epitope presentation arean important determinant of CTL antiviral activity. Individual epitope presentationkinetics vary independently of protein, and the earlier the epitope is presented on thecell surface before Nef-mediated HLA-I downregulation, the more effectively CTL caneliminate virus-infected cells and suppress viral replication. Factors including protein properties, HLA-I restriction of the epitope, and functional avidity, are poor predictiveproperties of Nef susceptibility and CTL antiviral efficiency. Together these resultssuggest that the properties of individual epitopes, such as epitope expression kinetics,most strongly influence CTL antiviral activity. Lastly, future research could potentiallyfocus on the role of host factors, such as T cell receptor functions, in determining CTLantiviral activity against HIV-1. A few proposed ideas are summarized in Chapter Five.

Effects of sildenafil and/or muscle derived stem cells on myocardial infarction
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Previous studies have shown that long-term oral daily PDE 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) counteract fibrosis, cell loss, and the resulting dysfunction in tissues of various rat organs and that implantation of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSC) exerts some of these effects. PDE5i and stem cells in combination were found to be more effective in non-MI cardiac repair than each treatment separately. We have now investigated whether sildenafil at lower doses and MDSC, alone or in combination are effective to attenuate LV remodeling after MI in rats.
				
				
					
						Methods
					MI was induced in rats by ligature of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Treatment groups were: &#8220;Series A&#8221;: 1) untreated; 2) oral sildenafil 3&#8201;mg/kg/day from day 1; and &#8220;Series B&#8221;: intracardiac injection at day 7 of: 3) saline; 4) rat MDSC (106 cells); 5) as #4, with sildenafil as in #2. Before surgery, and at 1 and 4&#8201;weeks, the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured. LV sections were stained for collagen, myofibroblasts, apoptosis, cardiomyocytes, and iNOS, followed by quantitative image analysis. Western blots estimated angiogenesis and myofibroblast accumulation, as well as potential sildenafil tachyphylaxis by PDE 5 expression. Zymography estimated MMPs 2 and 9 in serum.
				
				
					
						Results
					As compared to untreated MI rats, sildenafil improved LVEF, reduced collagen, myofibroblasts, and circulating MMPs, and increased cardiac troponin T. MDSC replicated most of these effects and stimulated cardiac angiogenesis. Concurrent MDSC/sildenafil counteracted cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells loss, but did not improve LVEF or angiogenesis, and upregulated PDE 5.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Long-term oral sildenafil, or MDSC given separately, reduce the MI fibrotic scar and improve left ventricular function in this rat model. The failure of the treatment combination may be due to inducing overexpression of PDE5.

Modeling Human Neural Development Using Pluripotent Stem Cells
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are derived from the developing blastocyst or through transcription factor based reprogramming. hPSCs have the capacity to self-renew and give rise to all cell types of the human body. These two defining characteristics make them attractive for a variety of uses including regenerative medicine and modeling human development and disease. While it is clear that hPSCs can differentiate into all cell types, it is unknown how similar hPSC derivatives are to cells that have undergone development in vivo. Using previously established differentiation protocols we demonstrated that both types of hPSCs could generate functional motor neurons that displayed repetitive action potentials characteristic of mature motor neurons. Furthermore, these motor neurons differentiated through a progressive and predictable induction of developmental stages, suggesting hPSC differentiation appears to obey normal developmental progression. In a comprehensive comparison of hPSC derivatives and tissue-derived counterparts, we determined that the progeny of hPSCs are most similar to a cell type found prior to 6 weeks of gestation. These hPSC derivatives continued to express genes normally found at 3-5 weeks of gestation, including LIN28; while tissue derived counterparts had already silenced these genes. In vitro function demonstrated that hPSC derivatives also acted like developmentally primitive cells. These findings suggest that developmental timing is conserved in vitro and perhaps even innate to the differentiating cell. Finally, we explored the role of the LIN28/let-7 pathway on the developmental maturity of hPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (hPSC-NPCs) as measured by their ability to generate neurons or glia. We determined that addition of let-7s into hPSC-NPCs can correct a significant number of the genes differentially expressed between hPSC derivatives and tissue-derived counterparts. Furthermore, the manipulation has a modest, but significant effect on the functional maturity of PSC-NPCs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hPSCs can serve as an excellent and tractable model of human development.

Multi-Modal Imaging Techniques for Early Cancer Diagnostics
Cancer kills more Americans under the age of 75 than any other disease. Although most cancers occur in epithelial surfaces that can be directly visualized, the majority of cases are detected at an advanced stage. Optical imaging and spectroscopy may provide a solution to the need for non-invasive and effective early detection tools. These technologies are capable of examining tissue over a wide range of spatial scales, with widefield macroscopic imaging typically spanning several square-centimeters, and high resolution in vivo microscopy techniques enabling cellular and subcellular features to be visualized. This work presents novel technologies in two important areas of optical imaging: high resolution imaging and widefield imaging. For subcellular imaging applications, new high resolution endomicroscope techniques are presented with improved lateral resolution, larger field-of-view, increased contrast, decreased background signal, and reduced cost compared to existing devices. A new widefield optical technology called multi-modal spectral imaging is also developed. This technique provides real-time in vivo spectral data over a large field-of-view, which is useful for detecting biochemical alterations associated with neoplasia. The described devices are compared to existing technologies, tested using ex vivo tissue specimens, and evaluated for diagnostic potential in a multi-patient oral cancer clinical trial.

Sialic acid O-acetylation in group B Streptococcus : impact on pathogen-host interactions
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) asymptomatically colonizes the lower gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts in 25-35% of the human population. However, in immune compromised individuals and infants, GBS is able to cause severe invasive disease and death. In newborns, GBS is the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis. GBS is surrounded by a thick capsular polysaccharide (CPS) layer. Nine antigenically distinct serotypes have been documented, all of which display a terminal alpha2-3 linked sialic acid (Sia) residue. This residue is key to GBS evasion of host immune response, and as such, is a key virulence factor for the bacterium. Terminal Sias are commonly expressed on the surface of mammalian cells and in this context serve to dampen immune response against self. This is accomplished by binding to factor H, which regulates the alternative complement pathway, as well as through interactions with Siglecs, Sia binding receptors with immunomodulatory capabilities, on the surface of immune cells. Sialic acid on the surface of GBS similarly engages these immune-suppressive mechanisms in a highly effective form of molecularly mimicry. It has only recently been discovered that GBS biochemically modifies terminal Sia residues by adding an O-acetylationetyl group to the C-7 position of the Sia moiety. Acetylation is incomplete, ranging from 5 to 40% of total surface Sia residues, and is characteristic of different serotype strains. This level is controlled by the balance in activities of the NeuD acetyltransferase and NeuA acetylesterase. Both enzymes are dual functional, being required for surface sialylation as well as acetylation. In this work we develop methodology using genetic techniques to manipulate O-acetylationetylation (O-acetylation) without impacting overall surface sialylation. Using isogenic strains with artificially high and low O-acetylation we proceed to analyze the impact of O-acetylation on various biological interactions and ultimate consequence for GBS virulence. We find that O-acetylation protects GBS surface Sias from removal by various microbial sialidases, presenting a possible benefit to in the context of colonization. Looking at Sia-dependent immune interactions, we discover that GBS O-acetylation does not impact alternative complement pathway activation, with both OAchigh and OAclow strains showing identical Sia-dependent deposition of the active opsonin C3b. O-acetylation does impair interactions with Siglec-9, thereby impairing the ability of GBS to downregulate neutrophil responses. In this regard,we document increased elastase secretion, oxidative burst and bacterial killing by neutrophils in response to the OAchigh strain. In the more complex context of ex-vivo human whole blood, these differences are enhanced, with the OAchigh strain being killed more rapidly. The OAchigh strain also shows greatly attenuated virulence in a mouse IP model of infection. Thus, in the context of invasion O- acetylation appears to be a cost to bacterial survival. Finally we document O-acetylation levels in 100 clinical and colonizing type Ia and type III GBS isolates. We find that type Ia strains consistently show very low levels of O-acetylation (5%) while type III strains display much higher O-acetylation (30%). This is correlated with the NeuD allele, possessing high or low enzymatic activity. We hypothesize that the distinct O-acetylation levels in type Ia and type III strains represent a balance between opposing forcing of selection, which differ in these different genetic backgrounds. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate these unique constraints, and their implications in disease manifestation

Phenotypic Plasticity of the Lung Surfactant System at High Altitude in Deer Mice, Peromyscus maniculatus
The pulmonary surfactant system is a multifaceted and highly complex mixture of lipids and proteins that work to reduce the surface tension created at the air-liquid interface within the lung, and provide innate immunity to the lung.  Reducing surface tension allows for lung stability, patency and functioning, a crucial task to undertake in oxygen-limiting environments, such as high altitude.  The lower partial pressures of oxygen and colder ambient temperatures found at high altitude pose a functional and metabolic challenge to the lung and possibly lung surfactant as well.  Therefore, we determined the effects of high altitude hypoxia on the lipids and proteins of the lung surfactant system in adult deer mice.  Because deer mice are known to exhibit physiological and genetic adaptations to high altitude, we hypothesized that mice would up-regulate the amounts of lipids and proteins in order to maintain lung stability and function.  Specifically, the amounts of saturated lipids will increase to aid in decreasing surface tension, thereby preventing alveolar collapse, and the proteins will have a correlated response given that lipids and proteins work in unison to lower surface tension.  Furthermore, since the cholesterol component of lung surfactant is known to increase the fluidity of surfactant layer, thereby promoting proper function, we determined the changes in cholesterol amounts under hypoxia and cold temperatures.  These questions were addressed by simple acclimation of mice to low (380 m) and high (3800 m) altitudes and cold (5°C) or warm (25°C) temperatures.  Lung surfactant was obtained via lung lavage, lipids or proteins analyzed, blood samples taken and organs dissected.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)  (PEDOT) Coated Magnesium for Nerve Regeneration
In an attempt to develop conductive, biodegradable, mechanically strong, and biocompatible nerve conduits, pure magnesium (Mg) was used as the biodegradable substrate material to provide strength while the conductive polymer, poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was used as a conductive coating material to control Mg degradation and improve cytocompatibility of Mg substrates. A series of electrochemical deposition conditions were explored to produce a uniform, consistent PEDOT coating on Mg substrates. Five cycles of CV with the potential ranging from -0.5V to 2.0V were used to produce consistent coatings for further evaluation. Scanning electron micrographs showed the micro-porous structure of PEDOT coatings. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) showed the peaks of sulfur, oxygen, and carbon, indicating  PEDOT coating. Adhesion strength of the coating was measured using ASTM-D 3359 standard tape test. The adhesion strength of PEDOT coating was within the classifications of 3B to 4B. Tafel tests of the PEDOT coated Mg showed a corrosion current (ICORR) of 6.14e-5A and critical voltage of -1.10V, as compared with ICORR of 9.08e-4A with a critical voltage of -1.35V for non-coated Mg. The calculated corrosion rate for the PEDOT coated Mg was 8.6 mm/year, much slower than 126.9mm/year for the non-coated Mg. H9 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culture studies were conducted using magnesium (Mg) coated with a conductive polymer poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to study viability for potential neural applications. Stem cells cultured indirectly with the Mg coated with PEDOT for 2 cycles were viable for a about half the amount of time when compared with the stem cells cultured with the 5 cycle PEDOT coated Mg.

Raman Nanometrology of Graphene
Graphene is a two-dimensional honey-comb lattice of carbon atoms with very unusual electron energy dispersion. Since its recent micromechanical isolation and measurements, graphene attracted tremendous attention of the physics and engineering communities. In addition to the wealth of two-dimensional electron gas physics revealed by graphene, it is a very promising material for the electronic and sensor applications. Graphene manifests extremely high charge carrier mobility at room temperature, which is far beyond the values achievable in the materials currently used in transistor designs. For this reason, graphene is considered for applications in the integrated circuits beyond the conventional silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor electronic technology. Some of the major problems associated with graphene research and applications are the difficulties of graphene identification, e.g. distinguishing it from other carbon materials, and verification of the number of graphene atomic layers. In this dissertation research we expand the use of the micro-Raman spectroscopy as the nanometrology tool for graphene material characterization. Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique, which is widely used to characterize structural and electronic properties of carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes, diamond, graphite and diamond-like carbons. Graphene's Raman spectrum has clear signatures, which allow one to identify it and determine the number of atomic layers with high accuracy. The main results of this dissertation are (i) measurement of the temperature coefficients of the G and 2D peaks in Raman spectrum of graphene; (ii) the study of the effects of different substrates on Raman signatures of graphene; and (iii) the first investigation of the ultraviolet Raman spectrum of graphene. The obtained results are important for graphene identification and device applications since electric bias and gate voltages in graphene transistors result in the device self-heating while device fabrication often requires the use of various substrates with properties different from those of the standard silicon. In addition, graphene-device characterization is conducted at different temperatures. The measurements of temperature coefficients of graphene Raman peaks was also instrumental in the study of heat conduction in graphene and shed light on its anharmonic properties.

Controlling the Biodegradation of Magnesium Implants Through Nanostructured Calcium-Phosphate Coating
Magnesium (Mg) alloys, a novel class of degradable, metallic biomaterials, have attracted growing interest as a promising alternative for medical implant and device applications due to their advantageous mechanical and biological properties. Moreover, Mg is biodegradable in the physiological environments. However, the major obstacle for Mg to be used as medical implants is its rapid degradation in physiological fluids. Therefore, the present key challenge lies in controlling Mg degradation rate in the physiological environment. The objective of this study was to develop a nanostructured-hydroxyapatite (nHA) coating on polished Mg implants to control the degradation and bone tissue integration of the implants. The nHA coatings were deposited on Mg using the Spire's patented TPA process to moderate the aggressive degradation of Mg and to improve quick osteointegration between Mg and natural bone. Nanostructured-HA coatings mimic the nanostructure and chemistry of natural bone, which will provide a desirable environment for bone tissue regeneration. Surface morphology, element compositions, and crystal structures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and x-ray diffractometry (XRD), respectively. SEM images of the deposited nHA-coating was analyzed using ImageJ's quantitative image analysis tool, to determine the nHA-coating particle size and thickness. The degradation of nHA-coated and non-coated Mg samples was investigated by incubating samples in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and revised simulated body fluid (r-SBF), under standard cell culture conditions. To mimic the in vivo cell response in the physiological environment, rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) were harvested and cultured with nHA-coated and non-coated polished Mg samples to determine cytocompatibilty.   The degradation results suggested that the nanocoatings positively mediated Mg degradation. It can therefore be concluded that nHA-coatings show promise for controlling the biodegradation of Mg-based orthopedic implants and devices. Cell studies indicated significantly improved BMSC adhesion on the surfaces of the nHA-coated and non-coated Mg samples, in comparison to the cells surrounding the Mg samples. These results indicated that the nHA-coated and non-coated Mg samples promote cell activity on the surface. However, cell experiments must be repeated on a larger number of samples with extensive short and long term cell studies, to achieve more verifiable results.

Effects of viscogenic plasma expander on cardiac and vascular function
Lowering the amount of red blood cells (RBCs) caused by blood losses or anemia leads to the reduction of tissue oxygenation and anaerobic metabolism, ultimately inducing multi-organ dysfunction. Plasma expanders (PEs) and blood are used sequentially to treat volume deficit. Recently, the systemic and microscopic recovery has been proposed to be related to the restoration of the viscosity of circulating blood to values prevailing during normovolemic conditions. Studies in an awake hamster window chamber showed that the viscosity of PE plays a role in microvascular function. High viscosity PEs (HVPEs) have been tested in conditions of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation and acute hemodilution, supporting the contention that the restoration of blood viscosity to normal value is beneficial in studies made in awake animals. Recent studies, in awake animals, have shown that polyethylene glycol conjugated to human serum albumin (PEGHSA) can achieve the similar results caused by HVPEs. However, the effects of increasing plasma viscosity on the heart performance are insufficiently explored. The hypothesis of this study was that cardiac and vascular function is enhanced when plasma viscosity is increased even though the amount of RBCs decreases. Hemorrhagic shock resuscitation and acute hemodilution protocols were performed to test this hypothesis. Cardiac function was assessed in the left ventricle with a pressure volume conductance catheter. As the modulation of plasma viscosity, the effects of shear stress-induced vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO), on cardiac function was examined. Furthermore, the effect of interaction of PE with endothelial glycocalyx on cardiac function was investigated. The results showed that HVPE and PEG-HSA demonstrated the beneficial effects on cardiac function in acute hemodilution by increased cardiac output, lowered systemic vascular resistance and sustained cardiac contractility. However, HVPE did not show any enhancement on cardiac function in hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. There was a contribution of increased NO to the beneficial effects on cardiac function as observed in the acute hemodilution with low viscosity PE. It also revealed that PEG-HSA and HVPE interacted with endothelial glycocalyx with different mechanism but they showed similar results in cardiac function, implying an important role of endothelial glycocalyx in cardiac and vascular function

The importance of metal binding in metalloprotein inhibitors
The development of novel and selective full-length inhibitors against medicinally relevant zinc metalloenzymes has been described. The diversity of zinc metalloenzymes described range from those present in humans to bacteria to viruses. The dissertation will first focus on the development of selective inhibitors against matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are Zn²⁺ hydrolytic enzymes that are present in vertebrates, invertebrates and even plants. They are responsible for the cleavage of the extracellular matrix, and this study demonstrates the importance the zinc-binding group (ZBG) plays in developing inhibitors that are selective against different MMP isoforms. The selectivity obtained from the (O,O) chelating MMP inhibitors (MMPi) was very interesting; considering the active site of MMPs are highly homologous with a conserved Zn²⁺ metal cofactor bound by three histidine residues within a conserved HEXGHXXGXXH metal binding motif. In Chapter 3, the development of full length metalloprotein inhibitors is expanded beyond MMP isoform selectivity to selectivity against another Zn²⁺ endopeptidase, Anthrax lethal factor (LF). This study shows that the potent (O,O) containing MMPi show no inhibition against LF. The bis-histidine and glutamate coordinated catalytic Zn²⁺ in LF favors the softer (O,S) donor ligands. In addition a backbone and linker SAR study shows that a thioamide linkage instead of the traditional amide linkage for backbone attachment introduces a hydrogen bond within the LF active site to enhance potency of the studied inhibitors. Chapter 4 introduces the relatively novel approach of fragment-based lead design (FBLD) in the lab toward the microwave assisted rapid synthesis of a 87-component chelator fragment library that showed potent hits with good ligand efficiencies (LEs) against both MMPs and LF. The final chapter culminates with the study of an entirely new metalloenzyme Human Immunodeficiency Virus Integrase (HIV-IN). As opposed to the mononuclear Zn²⁺ endopeptidases MMPs and LF, HIV-IN is a dinuclear Mg²⁺ endonuclease and preliminary studies show that inhibitors developed against MMPs and LF show submicromolar potencies against this structurally different metalloenzyme. Based on these results, novel HIV -IN inhibitors (HIV-INi) were generated to study the effects of different tris-chelating metal binding groups (MBGs) on this enzyme, while maintaining a constant backbone

ATG16L1 down-regulates IL-1beta signaling via neddylated- Cullin-3 mediated p62 ubiquitination
The Genome-Wide Association Studies shows that ATG16L1 mutation such as single-mutation polymorphism or miss sense mutation makes a person susceptible to Crohn's Disease, a type of inflammatory bowel diseases. Then, we examined how the loss of ATG16L1 functions effects signal transduction pathways with present of pro-inflammatory stimulus. Using in vitro experiment with mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell-line, we have checked that deletion of ATG16L1 will significantly influence the amplification of IL-1beta signaling. Then, we have expected that influence of ATG16L1 occurs in the upstream of IL-1beta signaling cascade, and our result presents that increased p62 expression in ATG16L1 knockout cells result in stronger inflammatory response due to oligomerization of TRAF6. Also the data shows that ATG16L1 is required for ubiquitination and degradation of p62 and that ATG16L1 is the essential component to neddylate Cullin-3 (Cul-3), E3 ubiquitin ligase, to bring ubiquitin to p62. These findings implicate that ATG16L1 is important factor to suppress IL-1beta signaling through down-regulation of p62 level by Cul-3 neddylation. Importantly, future study may provide therapeutic solutions to pathological conditions due to increased p62 expression level. Also, this study might give a direction for treatment in Crohn's Disease patients with susceptible allele of ATG16L1 by specifically targeting Cullin-3 and p62

Optical and mechanical behavior of the optical fiber infrasound sensor
The Optical Fiber Infrasound Sensor (OFIS) is an interferometric pressure transducer consisting of a pair of optical fibers helically wrapped about a compliant tube. While the OFIS has been successfully deployed for nearly a decade, its performance has been plagued by downtime due to polarization fading (resulting from no interference fringe intensity) and a nearly continuous change in its pressure sensitivity. This thesis explores the use of very expensive polarization maintaining fiber and inexpensive Faraday mirrors, both of which solve the polarization fading issue. Laboratory measurements of the thermal behavior of the pressure sensitivity are found to confirm field tests, but measurements of the temperature dependence of the tube's elastic modulus does not appear to adequately describe the observed behavior. Therefore, a crude analytic mechanical and optical model is explored to help investigate potential causes, however, the simple theory of compound thick cylinders was found to be problematic as a realistic model for the OFIS

Engineering bio-inspired microenvironments for stem cell proliferation and skeletal differentiation
Interactions of cells with their extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in development, disease progression, and regeneration. The material properties of ECM such as geometry, chemistry, hydrophobicity, mechanics, and microstructure play an important role in regulating various cellular processes and tissue morphogenesis. Thus there is a surge of interest in determining the effect of various material properties on cell fate and tissue formation. Beyond providing fundamental understandings, these efforts can also led to development of effective scaffolds (structural support for cell culture) as scaffold engineering is an integral part of in vitro cell cultures, tissue engineering, and transplants/implants. The central focus of this thesis is design of polymer- based biomaterials as synthetic matrices for cell culture and understands how cell-matrix interactions affect tissue formation, stem cell differentiation and self-renewal. The first two chapters focuses on synthesis and characterization of three dimensional hydrogels having interconnected macroporous network structures of poly(ethylene glycol) using cryogelation techniques, where I have developed a novel, green strategy to create monolithic structures with heterogeneous and homogenous networks. I have also developed a process to create three- dimensional structures with different internal architecture while maintaining the same porosity. These 3D structures were then used to understand effect of scaffold porosity, pore structure, etc play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue formation using cartilage tissue engineering as a model system. We also harnessed the potential of cell-matrix interactions to develop defined, synthetic matrices to expand human embryonic stem cells in vitro without introducing any detrimental effects. Employing a number of hydrogels I have determined the effect of various physico-chemical cues (bulk and interfacial properties) on adhesion, growth, colony formation, and self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells. Polyacrylamide-co-sodium 4-vinylbenzenesulfonate hydrogels having a moderate hydrophobicity (water contact angle of 23°) and bulk rigidity of 343.7kPa have supported in vitro growth of a number of hPSCs (HUES9, HUES6, and iPSCs) in defined medium (StemPro®) for more than 20 passages. These studies are discussed in chapter 4

The Surface Reactivities of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes and Their Related Toxicities
After 20 years of extensive exploration, people are more and more convinced on the great potentials of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the applications of many different areas. On the other hand, the properties and toxicities have also been closely watched for the safe utilization. In this dissertation I focus on the surface properties of SWCNTs and their related toxicities.In chapter 2, we revealed the generation of peroxyl radical by the unmodified SWCNT and the poly(ethylene glycol) functionalized SWCNT in aqueous solution with capillary electrophoresis (CE) and a reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicator, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF). According to the results, we identified peroxyl radical, ROO* as the major ROS in our system. Peroxyl radical could be produced from the adsorption of oxygen on the SWCNT surface. In chapter 3, we studied oxidation of several biologically relevant reducing agents in the presence of SWCNTs in aqueous solutions. H2DCF and several small antioxidants (vitamin C, Trolox, and cysteine), and a high-molecular-weight ROS scavenger (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were selected as reductants. We revealed that the unmodified or carboxylated SWCNT played duplex roles by acting as both oxidants and catalysts in the reaction. In chapter 4, we confirmed that SWCNTs bind to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at a site proximate to the enzyme's activity center and participating in the ET process, enhancing the activity of (HRP) in the solution-based redox reaction. The capability of SWCNT in receiving electrons and the direct attachment of HRP to the surface of SWCNT strongly affected the enzyme activity due to the direct involvement of SWCNT in ET.In chapter 5, the toxicity of SWCNTs coated with different concentrations of BSA to a human fibroblast cell line was explored. The result indicates that the toxicity of SWCNTs decrease with the higher coating degree as assumed. Then we choose mitochondrion to study the interactions between the proteins and SWCNTs. It turns out that SWCNTs coated with less BSA would have more proteins adsorbed on them, which obviously implies that interfering with the interactions between the nanomaterials and their ambient proteins by coatings would reduce their toxicity.

Low-energy Ion-surface Interactions at Semiconductor and High-TC Superconductor Surfaces
Low-energy ion scattering is a powerful surface analysis technique for interrogating the structural and chemical makeup of a surface, as well as the electronic structure. We have used this technique to probe the local electrostatic potential of Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and corroborated the findings of density functional theory. Sputtering was conducted on this same material, revealing the formation of a Bi capping layer that prevents further damage, due to the low surface energy of unsputtered Bi. Finally, scattering was used to investigate charge exchange of the Si(111) surface as a function of doping, a fundamental study that revealed the bulk band gap has a strong effect on neutralization of scattered ions, despite the work function being unchanged with added dopants.

Investigation of the Role of Trap States in Solar Cell Reliability using Photothermal Deflection Spectroscopy
Stability and reliability of solar cells are crucial for utilizing them for solar energy technology. In this dissertation work photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) technique was used to detect small absorption changes and to investigate trap density changes in three different types of solar cells in the process of light, air, and temperature induced degradation. The light-induced metastable changes in the properties of amorphous silicon and crystallinity effect in microcrystalline silicon were quantified by PDS. The effect of ligands and nanoparticle (NP) size on mid-gap trap states in NP thin films (CdTe and PbS) as it impacts on the performance during degradation were examined. Finally, several most common polymers (P3HT, MEH-PPV, and Polyfluorene Red) films absorption were compared and effect of photo-degradation and photo-oxidation on their trap states were analyzed. The PDS measurement technique is independent of scattering and permits the full band gap of the solar cells to be measured as well as the Urbach energy and the density of mid-gap trap states through analysis of the band gap and the band tail absorption. This work demonstrated that the higher amount of trap states in the material do not necessary limit the efficiency of a solar cell, since material structure, crystallinity, a particle deformation, and a polymer's decomposition may have much higher effect on the solar cells' stability and performance.

Convective heating analysis of an IFE target in a high temperature, low Reynolds number xenon environment
Target survival in the hostile chamber environment of the proposed Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) power plant is critical. The main focus of this work is to investigate the flow properties and convective heat load imposed upon the target traveling through the high-temperature xenon environment. This rarefied flow is characterized within the continuum regime, but is approaching transition where traditional CFD codes reach the bounds of operation. Thus ANSYS, specifically the Navier-Stokes module CFX, will be used in parallel with direct simulation Monte Carlo code DS2V and empirically and analytically derived expressions of heat transfer to the target for validation. Comparison of the DS2V and ANSYS viscous and thermal boundary layers were shown to match almost identically, while the simulated heat fluxes vary less than 8% on average over the hohlraum's surface. Since melting of the laser entrance hole window or fuel capsule constitutes failure of the target, a first-order approximation of the transient thermo-mechanical behavior of the target was conducted using the multi-physics code, COMSOL. Helium internal to the target has been shown to act as tremendous heat sink for cooling the laser entrance hole windows; however, spinning the target at 15,000 RPM induced buoyancy driven swirling effects that heated the sensitive fuel capsule. From the results herein, external baffles and radiative shields that completely partition the internal helium of the hohlraum have been shown to reduce this heating and optimize target survival in conjunction with other key reactor parameters

Increased activation and cytokine secretion in B cells stimulated with leptin in aged humans
Abstract
				Aging is associated chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, and increased levels of leptin. Increased levels of leptin are associated with inflammation and autoimmunity. We have recently reported that leptin activates B cells to induce secretion of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Role of B cells and leptin in inflammation associated with aging has not been explored. In this study we demonstrate that leptin activates and induces significantly greater amount of IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and IL-10 by B cells from aged humans as compared to young controls. This is associated with increased leptin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) in B cells from aged humans as compared to young subjects. These data suggest that leptin-induced B cell-derived proinflammatory cytokines may play a role in chronic inflammation associated with human aging.

THE EFFECTS OF A FRESHWATER GRADIENT ON ZOOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION AND COPEPOD RESPONSE TO SALINITY SHOCKS
Abstract.Estuaries are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world; though human development and global warming are threatening them. Zooplankton communities can serve as biological indicators of stresses due to their short lifecycles and sensitivity to environmental shocks, such as salinity changes. Studies have looked at the effects of freshwater shocks in the lab outnumber those that surveyed natural zooplankton distributions change along the freshwater gradient created by outflow from rivers. This study surveys the distribution of various taxa and examines the relationship this has with salinity by sampling zooplankton in Pao Pao River and Opunohu River on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. In addition, this study tests the ability of copepods native to brackish water in Pao Pao to survive various shocks of increasing or decreasing salinity over time, as well as their response to bright light. Significant differences were found in overall community composition between bays and along the freshwater gradient. Most taxa exhibited strong correlations to salinity levels; some positive, some negative and some parabolic. Sharp rises in salinity appear not to affect copepod survival rates significantly, but abrupt drops do have significant effects. Light seems to repel copepods significantly as well.

Synthesis of Graphene Layers from Metal-Carbon Melts: Nucleation and Growth Kinetics
A new method for growth of large-area graphene, which can lead to a scalable low-cost high-throughput production technology, was demonstrated. The method is based on growing of graphene films on the surface of metal-carbon melts and involves dissolving carbon in a molten metal at a specified temperature and then allowing the dissolved carbon to nucleate and grow on top of the melt at a lower temperature. The synthesized graphene layers were subjected to detailed microscopic and Raman spectroscopic characterizations. The deconvolution of the Raman 2D band was used to accurately determine the number of atomic planes in the resulting graphene layers and access their quality. The results indicated that the technology can provide bulk graphite films, few-layer graphene as well as high-quality single layer graphene on metals. It was also shown that upon cooling of supersaturated metal-carbon melts; graphite would also grow inside the melt either with flake or sphere morphology, depending on the solidification rate and degree of supersaturation. At small solidification rates, graphite crystals are normally bounded by faceted low index basal and prismatic planes which grow by lateral movement of ledges produced by 2D-nucleation or dislocations. At higher growth rates, however, both interfaces become kinetically rough, and growth becomes limited by diffusion of carbon to the growing interface. The roughening transition from faceted to non-faceted was found to depend on the driving force and nature of growing plane. Due to high number of C-C dangling bonds in prismatic face, its roughening transition occurs at smaller driving forces. At intermediate rates, the prismatic interfaces become rough and grow faster while the basal plane is still faceted, leading to formation of flake graphite. At higher growth rates, both interfaces grow with a relatively similar rate leading to initiation of graphite sphere formation, which later grows by a multi-stage growth mechanism. An analytical model was developed to describe the size and morphology of graphite as a function of solidification parameters.

Linking mechanistic and behavioral responses to sublethal esfenvalerate exposure in the endangered delta smelt; Hypomesus transpacificus (Fam. Osmeridae)
Abstract
            
            
               
                  Background
               
               The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is a pelagic fish species listed as endangered under both the USA Federal and Californian State Endangered Species Acts and considered an indicator of ecosystem health in its habitat range, which is limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary in California, USA. Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide esfenvalerate on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses.
            
            
               
                  Results
               
               Exposure to esfenvalerate affected swimming behavior of larval delta smelt at concentrations as low as 0.0625 &#956;g.L-1, and significant differences in expression were measured in genes involved in neuromuscular activity. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by esfenvalerate exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations.
            
            
               
                  Conclusions
               
               The results of this study show that microarray technology is a useful approach in screening for, and generation of molecular biomarkers in endangered, non-model organisms, identifying specific genes that can be directly linked with sublethal toxicological endpoints; such as changes in expression levels of neuromuscular genes resulting in measurable swimming impairments. The developed microarrays were successfully applied on larval fish exposed to esfenvalerate, a known contaminant of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary, and has permitted the identification of specific biomarkers which could provide insight into the factors contributing to delta smelt population decline.

Studies of transport and thermalization of excitons and the development of techniques for in-situ manipulation of excitons in coupled quantum wells
The study of excitons in semiconductors is a rich field that has seen numerous beautiful developments during the seven decades since they were proposed by Frenkel 1931. The exciton states in dielectric materials and molecular complexes are fundamental to understanding the full electronic structure of materials and the complex interactions between light and matter. Of particular interest is the fact that excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, form composite bosons with very low effective masses. This opens up an incredibly rich opportunity to study the phase space of quantum degenerate Bose gases at relatively high temperatures. An overview of many of the rich features that have been observed in exciton gases is presented. The system of indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells (CQWs) provides for drastically increased and tunable exciton lifetimes, leading to improved thermalization. The present experimental study presents a full steady state and dynamic model for the transport, generation, recombination, and thermalization of indirect excitons in CQWs, as well as methods for in-situ manipulation of indirect excitons by both optical and electrical methods. Both the optical and electrical methods for exciton control provide for dynamic manipulation of excitons on timescales significantly shorter than the lifetimes of indirect excitons

The embryonic mir-35 microRNA cluster regulates development and RNAi efficiency in C. elegans
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotide small RNAs that regulate gene expression by pairing with partial complementarity to target mRNAs. While loss of specific miRNAs can result in distinct phenotypic abnormalities, very few miRNA genes have been shown to be essential for viability. In this dissertation, I demonstrate that the mir-35 gene in Caenorabditis elegans has a vital role in embryogenesis. This gene encodes a cluster of 7 paralogous miRNAs, mir-35-41, that are highly expressed in C. elegans embryos. I show that loss of the mir-35-41 cluster in the genetic mutant mir-35(gk262), results in embryonic lethality, with defects in cytokinesis during the first embryonic cellular divisions and delays in cell cycle progression during subsequent embryonic cell divisions. Consistent with a role for mir-35 miRNAs in early embryogenesis, the inviability of mir-35(gk262) worms was rescued maternally, suggesting that deposition of the miRNA gene products is sufficient for embryogenesis. Supporting this idea, the precursor and mature forms of mir-35 are detectable in female worms that produce only oocytes. Additionally, accumulation of mature mir-35 miRNA correlated with the production of embryos. Taken together, my results suggest that RNA products expressed by the mir- 35 gene are deposited in oocytes; following fertilization, increased maturation and synthesis of mir-35-41 miRNAs are then available to control early embryonic events, including cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. In the second part of my dissertation, I investigated a surprising link between the mir-35 gene and the RNAi pathway. While performing RNA interference (RNAi) experiments in mir-35(gk262) worms, I observed strong RNAi hypersensitivity of the strain. The hypersensitivity is dependent on the canonical RNAi pathway and is similar in levels to the described lin-35 mutant. Additionally, microarrays indicated overlap in gene regulatory pathways for mir-35 and lin-35. I found that LIN-35 protein levels are significantly reduced in mir-35(gk262) embryos, indicating that the mir-35-41 miRNAs positively regulate accumulation of LIN-35 protein. Although the regulation is probably indirect, the decreased level of LIN-35 likely explains the RNAi hypersensitive phenotype of mir-35 mutant worms. Importantly, lin-35 encodes the worm homolog of the human Rb retinoblastoma gene. Another connection between the mir-35 gene and the RNAi pathway is the unexpected finding that nonspecific dsRNA affects the viability of mir-35(gk262) mutants. In contrast to almost complete lethality observed in the absence of mir-35-41 miRNAs at the restrictive temperature, I found that the introduction of non-specific dsRNA could partially rescue this lethality. Since the rescue is dependent on RNAi pathway genes, my results indicate that mir-35-41 is required for embryonic viability in a pathway that can be compensated by the initiation of RNAi. In conclusion, my research demonstrates that the mir-35-41 miRNAs are important for embryonic viability and regulate the efficiency of RNAi in C. elegans. Although the RNAi hypersensitivity of mir-35 mutants may be largely through down-regulation of LIN-35 in these mutants, the mir-35-41 miRNAs regulate lin-35 and other genes in parallel pathways important for embryogenesis. In support of this model, embryos with loss of lin-35 alone are viable, with loss of mir-35 alone have reduced viability and with loss of both genes are inviable. My work establishes a new regulator of lin-35 and demonstrates novel connections between RNAi pathway genes and embryonic viability

Studies Towards the Synthesis of  Optically Active Bicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-dienes
Optically active 2,5-disubstituted bicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-dienes (bod) have found use within synthetic organic chemistry as chiral ligands for rhodium asymmetric catalysis reactions. These chiral ligands often provide greater enantioselectivity than their phosphorus-based chiral ligand cousins when employed in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds under rhodium catalysis. The drawback to using these types of 2,5-disubstituted bicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-diene ligands is that they are very expensive to buy if they are commercially available or they must be synthesized if they are not commercially available. Present literature syntheses of these bod ligands rely on the physical separation of diastereomeric derivatives via recrystallization with low recovery or the separation of enantiomers via chiral HPLC, in which only small amounts of material may be separated. 	We have devised a synthesis of phenyl, benzyl, and methyl substituted bod ligands based on a bridged Robinson annulation reaction of 1,5-diketones and 1,5-ketoaldehydes, which gives the bicyclic core necessary for the bod ligand. Furthermore, our synthesis is designed to create optically active 1,5-diketones and 1,5-ketoaldehydes which transfer their chirality to the bicyclic core of the molecule. Our synthesis does not rely upon separation of racemic material at any step; instead we provide a method to synthesize any optically active bod ligand that is desired.	We successfully synthesized the chiral 3-allylcyclohexanone (>95% ee), a key intermediate in our synthesis, using a chiral conjugate allylation of &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated &beta;-ketoesters using Cu(OTf)<sub>2</sub> and the chiral <italic>t</italic>Bu-box ligand. We then successfully completed the racemic synthesis of 2,5-diphenylbicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-diene (Ph-bod) over 11 steps in 4.4% yield. The chiral Ph-bod ligand is projected to take 14 steps and proceed in a 1.1% overall yield. We also synthesized the racemic 2,5-bis(phenylmethyl)bicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-diene (Bn-bod) over 7 steps in 1.4% overall yield. The synthesis of 2,5-dimethylbicyclo2.2.2ocat-2,5-diene (Me-bod) was attempted but was unsuccessful at this time. Ultimately we proved the utility of the bridged Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of various bicyclo2.2.2octa-2,5-dienes.

Understanding Substrate Features Influenced by Pretreatments that Limit Biomass Deconstruction by Enzymes
Conflict between dwindling reserves of fossil energy and growing consumption presents significant challenges to our society.  To shift society's dependence away from petroleum to renewable energy, biorefineries are needed that employ advances in genetics, biotechnology, process chemistry, and engineering to convert biomass to valuable fuels and other products.  Lignocellulosic biomass is the only sufficiently abundant source of renewable carbon that can support large-scale sustainable and economic production of transportation fuels and industrial chemicals.  However, lignocellulosic biomass is naturally resistant to microbial or enzymatic deconstruction, a characteristic collectively termed "biomass recalcitrance," and overcoming this resistance is the main hurdle to realizing low costs.  A better understanding of relationships among biomass recalcitrance, pretreatment, and enzymatic hydrolysis can accelerate this quest. Against this background, this thesis seeks to understand the influence of pretreatment on substrate features and how such features affect subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis.  First, application of a high throughput pretreatment and co-hydrolysis system (HTPH) was extended to dilute acid pretreatment to facilitate development of a novel two-stage pretreatment strategy that sought to achieve high cellulose digestibility and total sugar yields while keeping hemicellulose degradation low.  Along with this, the feasibility of recycling liquid for low temperature pretreatment was demonstrated.  Inspired by the HTPH screening results, a new method was developed for simple and rapid quantification of the hemicellulose sugar content in biomass.  Finally, compositional and structural features of solids produced by application of two-stage pretreatment to switchgrass and three leading pretreatment technologies to corn stover were compared to provide new insights into control of biomass recalcitrance, as well as how pretreatments with much different deconstruction patterns impact enzymatic hydrolysis.

Analysis of pluripotent mouse stem cell proteomes : insights into post- transcriptional regulation of pluripotency and differentiation
Placental mammals begin life as free-living embryos that implant into the uterus. Before implantation, the embryo differentiates into two lineages, the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass (ICM). The ICM contains undifferentiated cells that give rise the adult animal. This ability to produce all the cells of the adult animal is called pluripotency. This dissertation consists of work to understand the molecular makeup of pluripotent cells. Previous work on mRNA content of pluripotent cells lead to important discoveries of factors necessary and sufficient for pluripotency. I reasoned that a quantitative analysis of the proteome of pluripotent cells would be useful in confirming mRNA observations, identifying protein markers of the pluripotent and differentiated state and identifying post-transcriptional regulation. This thesis describes my work toward that goal. I describe the quantitative proteomes of two systems also used for transcriptome studies of pluriopotent cells: mouse ES cells and mouse EC cells. I compared of the two protein datasets to each other to identify conserved proteins associated with pluripotency and to mRNA datasets to identify putative cases of post-transcriptional regulation. I confirmed putative cases of post- transcriptional regulation by western blot and RT-PCR, and confirmed the role of one of these proteins in ES cell colony formation by knockdown. I describe my semi- quantitative analyses of the phosphoproteomes of the same cell types, allowing me to identify phoshoproteins associated with the undifferentiated and differentiated states. I tested the phosphorylation of the transcription factor UTF1 for changes in the protein's function, and found no difference between wild-type and phosphomutant proteins. Finally, I describe my work to combine the two datasets in order to identify changes in phosphorylation that are independent of changes in underlying protein levels. I identified factors associated with alternative splicing that become phosphorylated after differentiation. I inhibited a candidate kinase, Clk1, that phosphorylates splicing factors and performed a phosphoproteome on the inhibited cells. These studies represent a deep, quantitative representation of the protein makeup of pluripotent cells and result in new markers of pluripotency and differentiation as well as new phosphorylation events on factors known to be necessary and sufficient for pluripotency

A search for excited electrons using the CMS detector at the LHC with 36 pb⁻¹ of proton-proton collision data recorded at square roots = 7 TeV is presented. The search is performed for associated production of an electron and an excited electron followed by the decay of the excited electron to an electron and a photon for a final state of eegamma. No excess of events above the standard model expectation is observed. Interpreting the results in the context of production via novel four- fermion contact interactions and the subsequent decay via electroweak processes, upper limits on the production cross section are set. The exclusion region in the compositeness scale, Lambda, and excited electron mass, Me*, parameter space is extended beyond previously established limits. For Lambda = 2 TeV, excited electron masses are excluded below 760 GeV/c² are excluded at the 95% confidence level. The cross sections for masses between 200 and 1500 GeV/c² are limited to be less than 0.21 - 0.16 pb⁻¹

We find that the final morphology and arrangement of the nanomaterials may be controlled through the concentration of the dissolved precursors and choice of solvent. One-dimensional (1-D) morphologies may also be grown onto substrates with the addition of a metal catalyst layer through solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth. These synthetic techniques may be expanded to other metal sulfide materials.

Reliable GPS Integer Ambiguity Resolution
To operate, guide and control vehicles in low visibility conditions, it is critical that the states of the vehicle are accurately estimated, which includes the three dimensional position, velocity, and attitude. This can be accomplished by GPS (Global Positioning System) aided encoder or GPS aided inertial approaches. The overall positioning accuracy of either approach will be determined by the GPS performance. Real-time centimeter accuracy GPS positioning can be achieved using carrier phase measurements. This requiresfast and reliable on-the-fly integer ambiguity resolution.In this dissertation, we focus on resolving GPS ambiguity problem, including both integer ambiguity estimation and integer ambiguity validation. For integer ambiguity estimation, a brief overview of pervious work on integer ambiguity resolution is first presented.Then, an improved integer ambiguity resolution method is proposed. Subsequently, simulations and real-world data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We also present integer ambiguity algorithms with auxiliary measurements and algorithms with multiple epoch measurements, both of which are useful in GPS challenging areas. For integer ambiguity validation, a brief overview is first presented, and then analytic discussion and test results on several popular validations methods are studied. Finally we discuss GPS modernization and its effect on integer  validation.

Regulation of gene expression programs by serum response factor and megakaryoblastic leukemia 1/2 in macrophages
Macrophages are key players in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, tissue homeostasis and wound healing. In response to inflammation or injury, macrophages are actively recruited to affected sites where they perform specialized functions, such as phagocytosis of invading pathogens or dead cells, which are key for host recovery and survival. Many studies have shown that members of the Rho family of GTPases are important mediators of macrophage recruitment and function. These proteins activate the signaling cascades that are necessary to control the dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton that are required for directed movement and protrusion of the extracellular membrane. In several non- macrophage cell types, it has also been described that Rho GTPases can stimulate the expression of differentiation and cytoskeletal genes. This gene regulation was shown to be mediated by the DNA-binding transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivators megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL) 1 and 2. Based on this data, the goal of this study was to elucidate the gene programs that are regulated by SRF and MKL1/2 in macrophages. Using mRNA expression profiling of primary macrophages, we discovered that both MKL1/2 and SRF regulate both general and hematopoietic-specific genes. In order to determine which of these genes are direct targets of the SRF pathway, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. Our results showed that, in general, SRF binding is not restricted to the proximal promoter, but occurs primarily at distal sites (further than +/- 500bp relative to the TSS) in close association with the macrophage and B-cell specific factor, PU.1. In particular, SRF and PU.1 were found to be localized to distal sites of several hematopoietic-specific target genes. Subsequent siRNA knockdown experiments showed that both SRF and PU.1 are required for full expression of these genes, providing insights into how cell-specific programs of SRF-dependent gene expression are achieved

Jumping Spiders Alternative Turns in the Abscence of Visual Cues
Theabilities of four species of diurnal jumping spiders (Helpis minitabunda,Portia fimbriata, Trite auricoma, and Trite planiceps) and one species of nocturnal clubionid spider (Clubiona cambridgei) to maintain approximately straight paths by alternating turns in the absence of visual cues was investigated. Under infra-red light (observed using infra-red video), individual spiders were run rough a maze comprising a single forced turn and then a choice of turning in the same or opposite direction to the forced turn. At the second (free) turn, each species turned in the direction opposite to the forced turn (i.e., alternated turns) more frequently than it turned in the same direction. There was no evidence that species differed in tendency to alternate turns. In nature, jumping spiders may use this ability to navigate in the absence of visual cues when foraging or escaping predators in darkness. It is suggested that alternation of turns by jumping spiders depends on proprioceptive information gathered during previous turns.

The use of mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolic output of bacterial pathogens
The overall theme of this thesis is the use of mass spectrometry to answer questions of biological relevance. The thesis begins by informing the reader on the basics of mass spectrometry and associated tools with an introductory chapter. Chapter 2 describes collaborative work performed between three labs at UCSD, the Jack E. Dixon, Victor Nizet and Pieter C. Dorrestein labs. The project was initiated by the use of comparative genomics to discover a widely distribution toxin biosynthetic gene cluster. Molecular and biochemical analysis of a two members of the conserved family, namely Group A Streptococcus and Clostridium Botulinum, demonstrated the organisms indeed contained similar cellular machinery for the biosynthesis of ribosomally encoded peptides putatively containing thiazole and (methyl)-oxazole moieties. Chapter 3 continues characterizing the widely distributed family of toxins specifically characterizing the gene cluster within the bacterium C. Botulinum. The work describes the use of mass spectrometry to obtain structural evidence, verifying the biosynthetic gene cluster indeed produces heterocycles as hypothesized by the genomic studies. Additionally, the work uses biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize a novel Beta-hemolytic, cytolytic toxin in two Clostridia species. Chapter 4 introduces the method of imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of microbial colonies. Although IMS is not a novel technique, very few reports had used the technology to investigate the microbial kingdom. The work within chapter 4 describes an IMS survey performed on a vast number of differential microbes to visualize their associated metabolic output. The goal was to show that IMS is an amenable technique that can be applied to a diverse number of microbes. Chapter 5 goes beyond the proposal set forth in chapter 4, as IMS was used to visualize the interaction between two well characterized model bacterial systems, the probiotic bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the bona fide human pathogen methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Imaging mass spectrometry showed directional release of compounds by the probiotic organism B. subtilis that have antibiotic effects against MRSA giving insight into the potential mode of action for probiotic organisms

Development of a luciferase-based reporter of transcriptional gene silencing that enables bidirectional mutant screening in Arabidopsis thaliana
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Cytosine methylation is an important chromatin modification that maintains genome integrity and regulates gene expression through transcriptional gene silencing. Major players in de novo methylation guided by siRNAs (known as RNA-directed DNA methylation, or RdDM), maintenance methylation, and active demethylation have been identified in Arabidopsis. However, active demethylation only occurs at a subset of RdDM loci, raising the question of how the homeostasis of DNA methylation is achieved at most RdDM loci. To identify factors that regulate the levels of cytosine methylation, we aimed to establish a transgenic reporter system that allows for forward genetic screens in Arabidopsis.
				
				
					
						Results
					We introduced a dual 35 S promoter (d35S) driven luciferase reporter, LUCH, into Arabidopsis and isolated a line with a moderate level of luciferase activity. LUCH produced transgene-specific 24 nucleotide siRNAs and its d35S contained methylated cytosine in CG, CHG and CHH contexts. Treatment of the transgenic line with an inhibitor of cytosine methylation de-repressed luciferase activity. Mutations in several components of the RdDM pathway but not the maintenance methylation genes resulted in reduced d35S methylation, especially CHH methylation, and de-repression of luciferase activity. A mutation in MOM1, which is known to cooperate with RdDM to silence transposons, reduced d35S DNA methylation and de-repressed LUCH expression. A mutation in ROS1, a cytosine demethylation enzyme, increased d35S methylation and reduced LUCH expression.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					We developed a luciferase-based reporter, LUCH, which reports both DNA methylation directed by small RNAs and active demethylation by ROS1 in Arabidopsis. The moderate basal level of LUCH expression allows for bi-directional genetic screens that dissect the mechanisms of DNA methylation as well as demethylation.

Antitumor effects of the investigational selective MEK inhibitor TAK733 against cutaneous and uveal melanoma cell lines
AbstractBackgroundTAK733 is a novel allosteric, non-ATP-binding, inhibitor of the BRAF substrates MEK-1/2.MethodsThe growth inhibitory effects of TAK733 were assessed in a panel of 27 cutaneous and five uveal melanoma cell lines genotyped for driver oncogenic mutations. Flow cytometry, Western blots and metabolic tracer uptake assays were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to TAK733.ResultsFourteen cutaneous melanoma cell lines with different driver mutations were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of TAK733, with a higher proportion of BRAFV600E mutant cell lines being highly sensitive with IC50s below 1 nM. The five uveal melanoma cell lines had GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and were either moderately or highly sensitive to TAK733. The tested cell lines wild type for NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ and GNA11 driver mutations were moderately to highly resistant to TAK733. TAK733 led to a decrease in pERK and G1 arrest in most of these melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin, driver oncogenic mutations and in vitro sensitivity to TAK733. MEK inhibition resulted in increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and GNAQ mutant cell lines than in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. Uptake of the metabolic tracers FDG and FLT was inhibited by TAK733 in a manner that closely paralleled the in vitro sensitivity assays.ConclusionsThe MEK inhibitor TAK733 has antitumor properties in melanoma cell lines with different oncogenic mutations and these effects could be detectable by differential metabolic tracer uptake.

Characterization of the archaebacterial ortholog of the processing body subunit Winnebago/Growl
Because the transcriptional machinery is inactive throughout late stages of oogenesis and early stages of embryogenesis, the initial development of the embryo is driven by post-transcriptional regulation of maternally deposited mRNA. In Drosophila, this post-transcriptional regulation occurs at specialized sites called P- bodies. While P bodies contain proteins required for mRNA degradation, translational control, and microRNA processing, the complete composition of the P body is unknown. Recent work on the biochemistry of the P body has identified a novel protein of unknown function called Winnebago. Winnebago contains an atypical conserved ATPase motif homologous with the cyclo-ligase human methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS) and a conserved RNA recognition motif suggesting that Winnebago may be a novel RNA modifying enzyme. Consistent with this, the substrate binding site of the Winnebago and its archaebacterial homologs are not conserved with the human MTHFS, indicating that Winnebago has a unique class of substrate. In this study, Swinn, the Winnebago homolog from Sulfolobus, was purified and it was demonstrated that it is an ATPase. We also found that Swinn does not use the normal substrates of MTHFS, arguing that it acts on a novel class of cyclo-ligase substrates. This work lays the groundwork for future studies to identify the substrate of the Winnebago family of ATPases and their role in RNA regulation

Pattern Recognition Invariance in Pigeons (Columbia Livia): Outline, Color and Contrast
Pigeons that had extensive training with an oddity-frona-sample discrimination procedure using visual patterns, and that could transfer their performance to novel patterns, were tested for three kinds of pattern recognition invariance. In one invariance experiment the sample stimuli were silhouette shapes and the comparison stimuli were outline figures. In another experiment the samples were white shapes on a dark background whereas the comparisons were black shapes on a bright background. In a third experiment the sample and comparison shapes were of different color. All the shapes used for invariance testing were novel to the pigeons. Performance during the tests was above 90% correct except in the case of the reversed contrast experiment, where it reached only 77/6; dazzling and/or attention problems may have been a disturbing factor. Even in this condition, however, significant transfer was obtained. Generally the pigeons showed that they are capable of invariant shape recognition under all three conditions. Since all critical tests involved shapes that were novel to the subjects the results also confirmed that pigeons can conceptualize a relational oddity/ identity rule.

The influence of small stresses on the dynamics of glaciers and subduction zones
The fast flow of glaciers and rupture of earthquakes on subduction zones both occur at interfaces notoriously difficult to observe.  When slip events occur on such interfaces, elastic energy is radiated in the form of seismic waves.  Here, we analyze these and other signals, such as continuous GPS, for two glacier systems and a subduction zone.  We find that the slip events at an Antarctic ice stream, a Greenland outlet glacier, and a subduction zone in Costa Rica are all modulated by the ocean tide, however, the manifestations of the modulations vary considerably.In Antarctica, we directly measure the bidaily rupture process of the Whillans Ice Plain using broadband seismometers.  The average rupture speed of these events varies by a factor of 2, which is dependent upon the recurrence interval.  Based on variations of rupture near the source region, we observe that rupture speed depends on loading conditions.In Greenland, the breakup of the sea ice and iceberg mixture that forms during the winter causes changes in the flow velocity of Store Glacier, West Greenland.  We measure velocity using continuous GPS 16 km away from the terminus and time-lapse photography near the terminus.  We observe a step-change in velocity near the terminus in response to the ice melange breakup, corresponding to a 30-60 kPa loss of buttressing stress.  Further, we observe semi-diurnal periodicity in GPS speed perturbations 16 km from the terminus, likely due to ocean tides.At the subduction zone, we identify and locate tremor events, distinct from earthquakes in their low amplitude, which occur as shear failure on the plate interface. We locate the events on portions of the plate believed to be undergoing stable sliding, adjacent to locked portions of the plate.  Furthermore, we provide multiple forms of geodetic and pressure evidence of an offshore event that occurred in 2008.Observations of various behaviors that include relatively small stresses may provide insight into the unique dynamics of glaciers and subduction zones.  Small stresses that drive failure suggests either a weak basal interface or a system near its critical stress state.

Bayesian Methods in the Quantitative Risk Assessment and Toxicity Profiling of Engineered Nanomaterials
Until recently, very little research has been conducted to assess the potential human health hazards associated with engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). <italic>In-vitro</italic> high-throughput screening (HTS) assays for the assessment of engineered nanomaterials provide new opportunities to learn how these particles interact at the cellular level, and may aid in reducing the demand for <italic>in-vivo</italic> testing. The large number of potential factors that could link nanomaterials to adverse human health impacts, create an imperative need to develop a stronger foundation for quantitative risk assessment in nanotoxicology. In this dissertation we propose a probability model for the analysis of high-throughput cellular assays. In particular, we develop a method that builds a balance between model complexity and interpretability as a tool to be used by subject-matter specialists for assessing cytotoxicity. The resulting multivariate surface-response model allows for joint inference on dose and time kinetics, and associated classical risk assessment parameters of interest. We illustrate the proposed methodology by profiling a multivariate screening study of eight metal-oxide nanomaterials. Next, we present loss-function-based methods for the hazard ranking of engineered nanomaterials. Specifically, we provide a decision-making tool for prioritizing extensive <italic>in-vivo</italic> testing of emerging nanomaterials. The proposed framework allows for the aggregation of ranks across different sources of evidence while allowing for differential weighting of this evidence based on its reliability and importance in risk ranking. We illustrate the methodology by ranking particles from a multivariate cytotoxicity screening study of eight metal oxides, conducted in two human cell-lines. Finally, we propose methodology for modeling the relationship between physicochemical properties of ENMs and their observed cytotoxicity, as an initial step in the development of a framework for predictive nanotoxicology. In particular, the proposed approach introduces a new measure of toxicity that is seamlessly integrated into a multi-dimensional model that accounts for dose and duration kinetics jointly using a flexible smooth surface fit. Moreover, the designed approach is appropriate for small sample size, and includes data integration and a framework for advanced dimension reduction through variable selection. The proposed method was applied to a library of 24 engineered nanomaterials.

Ostracodes and Gastropods of the Waucobi Lake Beds: Significance for Pliocene Environmental and Climate Conditions in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California
The fossil record of lake strata typically provide a high resolution record of past ecosystems and environmental conditions. The faunal records of the Pliocene Waucobi Lake beds provide such an opportunity to interpret environmental and climate conditions for the eastern Sierra Nevada. These lacustrine sediments cropping out in Soldier Canyon, Owens Valley, Inyo County, CA are composed primarily of clay beds with several freshwater species of ostracodes and gastropods. These presence and absence of key taxa and the relative abundance of various gastropod and ostracode taxa for the Sierra Nevada during the late Pliocene demonstrate that there were changes in salinity in the Waucobi Lake associated with an open- and closed-basin lake system, driven by the Sierra Nevada rainshadow climate control. Lake beds containing gastropods were interpreted as freshwater events. In this study two sections were stratigraphically analyzed for fossil ostracode and gastropod variability. The high resolution sampling revealed the presence of ostracode assemblages suggests interruptions of saline conditions occurred more frequently than previous reported.

Molecular diversity and adaptations of microorganisms from the deep ocean
The indigenous microbial members of deep oceanic environments mediate carbon fluxes in this realm and contribute to major biogeochemical cycles globally, yet their distribution, phylogenetic composition, and functional attributes are not yet well understood. Emerging concepts suggest the prevailing ecological processes and evolutionary constraints acting on these assemblages are more dynamic and heterogeneous than previously thought. In this context, the research presented herein examines the composition and genomic repertoires of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya from an extreme deep ocean environment, 6,000 m depth within the Puerto Rico Trench. The results identify depth-specific taxonomic and functional trends, as well as expanded gene inventories indicative of unique lifestyle strategies divergent from their photic-zone counterparts. The findings indicate significantly different bacterial communities in particle-associated and free-living fractions at depth, which has implication for future sampling practices and diversity estimates from deep ocean habitats. The disparity between the number of cultivated piezophilic ('high-pressure adapted') isolates and the expansive diversity identified using molecular techniques has limited further exploration of the physiological and biochemical properties of diverse piezophiles. This issue has been addressed through the application of dilution to extinction cultivation techniques at high-hydrostatic pressure and low temperature using a natural seawater medium. This work has led to the isolation and subsequent characterization of a unique piezophilic member of the Roseobacter lineage within the Alphaproteobacteria. The results provide further evidence for the temperature- pressure dependence of the growth rate for deep-ocean bacteria and substantiate hypotheses regarding piezophilic traits under nutritionally limiting conditions. This research concludes with the detailed genetic characterization of the unique flagellar motility system of the model piezophilic bacterium Photobacterium profundum SS9. It is the first investigation of motility as a function of high hydrostatic pressure in a deep-sea microbial species and highlights the profound value of genetically tractable systems to test hypotheses regarding high-pressure adaptation

Michael Nauenberg, Professor of Physics: Recollections of UCSC, 1966-1996, is the edited transcript of a single interview conducted by Randall Jarrell on July 12, 1994. Nauenberg received his B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955 and his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1960. Prior to his appointment as a professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz in 1966, he was an assistant professor at Columbia University and a visiting associate professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Stanford University.
      At UCSC, Nauenberg served as department chairman of physics from 1970 to 1972, and again from 1983 to 1985. He was instrumental in developing both Stevenson and Crown Colleges, but in 1973 shifted his focus to building a graduate program in physics. He also founded and served as the director of the Institute of Nonlinear Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.
      Nauenberg's primary research interests are in particle physics, condensed matter physics, and nonlinear dynamics, and he is the author of numerous publications in these areas. His most recent work is on a new quantum mechanical treatment of neutrino and neutral meson oscillations and on the dynamics of wave packets in weak external fields. He has had a long standing interest in the history of physics and mathematics, particularly during the seventeenth century, and published about a dozen articles on the works of Hooke, Newton and Huygens, and several reviews of recent books on Newton's Principia. He has a particular interest in the history of physics and has helped to bring historians of science and physicists together.
      In this oral history narration, Nauenberg shares his impressions and critical evaluation of UCSC as an experiment in public higher education, particularly the tensions between the college-based model and the pressures of the faculty tenure system within the large research University of California system. He points out that the founders of UCSC appear to have overlooked or underestimated the demands building graduate programs would make on faculty members' time. He discusses faculty appointments in the physics department, as well as other key faculty members on campus. He provides a sweeping and cogent assessment of the strengths and achievements of the physics department, and describes the struggle to establish the very successful Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, as well as his frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful political battle to attract the Institute for Theoretical Physics to UC Santa Cruz. This oral history is an invaluable and insightful historical contribution by a senior faculty member with an extensive and distinguished history on the Santa Cruz campus.

Origins and implications of human xeno-autoantibodies against a non-human sialic acid
All human adults have circulating antibodies against N- glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a sialic acid absent in humans. Neu5Gc from foods of mammalian origin can be metabolically incorporated into human tissues, especially vascular endothelia and carcinomas. Thus, the potential exists for circulating anti-Neu5Gc "xeno-autoantibodies" to react against this exogenously incorporated "self" Neu5Gc. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that anti -Neu5Gc antibodies can contribute to tumor progression and vascular inflammation. This dissertation focuses on investigating the origins and other implications of these anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Chapter 2 of this dissertation describes a novel model in which resident bacteria cooperate with dietary Neu5Gc to generate anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in humans. We show that anti-Neu5Gc antibodies appear during infancy and correlate with the introduction of Neu5Gc in the diet. However, dietary Neu5Gc alone is insufficient to elicit anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in human- like Neu5Gc deficient (Cmah-null) mice. While other postnatally-appearing anti-carbohydrate antibodies are likely induced by colonizing bacteria, no microbe is known to synthesize Neu5Gc. Here we show that anti-Neu5Gc antibodies appear coincident with antibodies against non- typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), an obligate human commensal and pathogen. We show that trace exogenous Neu5Gc can be incorporated into cell surface LOS molecules, which induce anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in Cmah-null mice. Furthermore, purified human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies specifically recognize Neu5Gc-expressing NTHi. Finally, Neu5Gc from infant foods is taken up and expressed by NTHi. We propose that incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc by NTHi residing in the nasopharynx can induce the production of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in humans. Cmah-null mice immunized with Neu5Gc-expressing NTHi generate anti-Neu5Gc antibodies with similar titer and specificity to humans. Chapters 3 and 4 describe two projects that use these mice to study the significance of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. These two projects demonstrate that anti-Neu5Gc antibodies can contribute to enhanced clearance of Neu5Gc-containing biotherapeutics and reproductive incompatibility, respectively. Chapter 5 details preliminary studies investigating the differential utilization of human and non-human sialic acids by NTHi. Here we investigate sialic acid expression preferences of NTHi and analyze sialic acid catabolism preferences of the NanA lyase. Finally, we present evidence that Neu5Gc utilization by NTHi has intriguing consequences for growth and survival in human serum

Carbon sp2-on-sp3 Technology: Graphene-on-Diamond  Devices and Interconnects
Graphene demonstrates potential in practical applications due to its excellent electronic and thermal properties.  Typical graphene field-effect transistors and interconnects built on conventional SiO2/Si substrates reveal a breakdown current density on the order of 1 uA/nm2 (i.e. 10^8 A/cm2) which is approximately 100 times larger than the fundamental limit for metals, but still smaller than the maximum achieved in carbon nanotubes.  In this dissertation research I investigated different methods of fabricating graphene devices and interconnects on synthetic diamond and tested their current-voltage and thermal characteristics.  Several types of these graphene-on-diamond devices have been compared to graphene-on-SiO2/Si devices as a baseline reference.  It was established that by replacing SiO2 with synthetic diamond one can substantially increase the current carrying capacity of graphene to a level as high as ~18 uA/nm2 in ambient conditions.  The obtained results indicate that graphene's current-induced breakdown is thermally activated.  It was also found that the current carrying capacity of graphene can be improved not only on single-crystal diamond substrates, but also on inexpensive ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD).  Additionally, UNCD can be produced in low-temperature processes compatible with conventional Si technology which is attributed to the decreased thermal resistance of ultrananocrystalline diamond layers at elevated temperatures.  The obtained results are important for graphene's applications in interconnects and transistors and can lead to the new planar sp2-on-sp3 carbon-on-carbon technology.

Kinetics of Pyrrhotite Oxidation in Seawater: Implications for Mining Seafloor Hotsprings
Laboratory experiments have been performed to evaluate the effects of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and mineral surface area on the rate of oxidation of pyrrhotite in seawater. Experiments employed to determine these effects utilized temperature-controlled circulation baths, Teflon reaction vessels, synthetic seawater, and pure, hand-sorted natural pyrrhotite crystals. Both batch and flow-through reactor methods were used and reaction products were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The rate law takes the following form:Rsp (Fe(1-x)S) = k (MH+)a(MO2(aq))bwhere R is the specific oxidation rate of pyrrhotite (moles/L sec), k is the rate constant (a function of temperature and surface area), and a and b are reaction orders for reactant concentrations (M), determined experimentally. The isolation method was used to obtain the reaction order of each reactant on the basis of initial rates. The rate law for the oxidation of pyrrhotite in seawater derived in this study is:Rsp(Fe(1-x)S) = -5.38 x 10-8 (MH+)0.08±0.03 (MO2(aq))0.30±0.07The value for k is averaged from runs at 22.0oC, which was used at the primary run temperature for convenience. Values for k from all runs are in Appendix A. Data from batch reactor experiments indicated positive influences of oxidant concentration, surface area, temperature, and H+ on the initial rate. Pyrrhotite oxidizes significantly faster than chalcopyrite, providing an upper limit to the anthropogenic and natural inorganic weathering rates of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits. Inorganic rates are most relevant to rapid seafloor mining timespans (minutes to days), within which significant bacterial colonization of freshly ground sulfide mineral surfaces is not likely to occur (e.g., McBeth et al., 2011). In the future, microbial studies will be needed in order to quantify the catalyzing or inhibitory effects of bacteria on natural, in situ seafloor pyrrhotite oxidation using this study as a baseline.

Rigidity properties of CR embeddings into hyperquadrics
We study the rigidity of holomorphic mappings from a neighborhood of a Levi-nondegenerate CR hypersurface M with signature l into a hyperquadric Q_̂{l'}{N} in CP̂{N+1} of larger dimension and signature. Recent work of Baouendi, Ebenfelt, and Huang shows that if the difference in signature between a source manifold with positive CR complexity and target quadric is zero then a super- rigidity phenomenon holds. Another recent paper by the same authors shows that if the CR complexity is zero (and the difference in signature is nonnegative) then a partial rigidity phenomenon occurs. Our work considers both positive CR complexity and positive signature difference simultaneously, and we prove a partial rigidity result. Our main result is that if the CR complexity of M is not too large then the image of M under any such mapping is contained in a complex plane with a dimension depending only on the CR complexity and the signature difference, but not on N, the CR dimension of the target quadric. This result follows from two theorems, the first demonstrating that for sufficiently degenerate mappings, the image of M is contained in a plane, and the second relating the degeneracy of mappings into different quadrics

Theoretical modeling of signal processing systems in biology
The survival of biological organisms relies on their capacity to sense and respond to various environmental signals. Such capacity is limited by stochasticity of both intracellular and extracellular signaling events and by potential cross-talk of signaling pathways. Understanding the performance of biological signaling networks is essential for a comprehensive explanation of biological mechanisms and functions. This dissertation presents theoretical models, primarily developed by the dissertation author, for various biological signal processing systems, including eukaryotic gradient sensing, chemotactic response, enzymatic switch system under noisy input, and specificity of yeast signaling networks. In those studies, we have employed a wide range of concepts and techniques in statistical mechanics, estimation theory, stochastic process, stochastic differential equation, numerical optimization, and Monte-Carlo simulations. In the analysis of gradient sensing limits (Chapter 2), we found that the accuracy of spatial gradient sensing is highly sensitive to the cell size and that the spatial sensing strategy may also be applicable to some small bacteria with the aid of receptor cooperativity. In the study of chemotactic response (Chapter 3), we developed an exactly solvable model which incorporate different sources of noise and can well explain the experimentally observed heavy-tails in the directional distribution of chemotactic cells. Chapter 4 devotes to the study of a simple biological switching system (e.g., gene promoter and bacterial motor) governed by fluctuating input signals. Our analytical results question the common belief that input noise will always contributes additively to the output variation. Finally, in the context of signaling specificity, we discovered and proposed a general design principle, namely the asymmetric hierarchical inhibition mechanism, for signaling pathways to avoid cross-talk and achieve specificity

Cyclic threshold strains in clays versus sands and the change of secant shear modulus and pore water pressure at small cyclic strains
When fully saturated soils are subjected to cyclic loading in undrained conditions involving moderate and large cyclic shear strain amplitudes, &#61543;c , their stiffness and strength decrease and the pore water pressure changes permanently with the number of cycles, N. Such cyclic degradation of stiffness and pore water pressure change are among the most fundamental and important phenomena in soil dynamics. Fully saturated sands are most susceptible to cyclic degradation and significant pore pressure buildup. During cyclic loading, they can completely lose their stiffness and strength while large excess pore pressure develops and they can eventually liquefy. On the other end of the spectrum are fully saturated clays of high plasticity that under significant cyclic loading can lose only a fraction of their original stiffness and strength while the pore water pressure change is relatively small. Moreover, in overconsolidated clays of high plasticity pore pressure can decrease instead of increase with N while cyclic degradation is even smaller. As opposed to that, when fully saturated soils are subjected to very small cyclic shear strains, &#61543;c, soil`s structure practically does not change and, consequently, neither cyclic degradation nor permanent cyclic pore pressure change occur. The amplitude &#61543;c below which there is no cyclic degradation and above which the degradation occurs is known as the threshold shear strain for cyclic degradation , &#61543;td. The amplitude &#61543;c below which there is no permanent pore water pressure change with N and above which the permanent pore pressure is recorded after every cycle is known as the threshold shear strain for cyclic pore water pressure change, &#61543;tp. For sands, &#61543;tp has been extensively investigated but &#61543;td has been hardly investigated at all. For clays, both &#61543;tp and &#61543;td were investigated to quite a limited extent. For example, &#61543;tp in overconsolidated clays has practically not been investigated. The thesis describes laboratory investigation focused on &#61543;td in a clean sand and &#61543;tp in two laboratory-made normally consolidated (NC) and overconsolidated (OC) clays, kaolinite clay having PI=28 and kaolinite-betonite clay having PI=55, and on the comparison and connection between different thresholds. The Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) type of direct simple shear device (DSS) was employed for the constant-volume equivalent-undrained cyclic testing. Two types of tests were conducted, single-stage cyclic strain-controlled test with constant &#61543;c throughout the test, and the multi-stage cyclic strain-controlled test in which &#61543;c was constant in each stage but larger in every subsequent stage. The magnitude of &#61543;c covered the range from 0.003% to 2%.   In the context of investigating  &#61543;td  in sand and &#61543;tp in clays, the following tasks were also performed: (1) the NGI-DSS device was adapted for small-strain cyclic testing and a procedure for eliminating false loads and deformations from test records was developed, (2) the effect of the vertical consolidation stress, &#61555;vc', and frequency of cyclic straining, f, on cyclic degradation and pore water pressure change in clays was tested, and (3) cyclic stress-strain behavior and the change in secant shear modulus, GSN, with N in sands at very small cyclic strains was investigated.    The following conclusions are derived and results obtained: (1) small-strain cyclic testing at &#61543;c as small as 0.003% can be conducted in the standard NGI-DSS device and the results can be used in soil dynamics analyses if the device is properly modified and the false loads are eliminated from the test records, (2) cyclic degradation in clays is affected moderately to significantly by &#61555;vc' and frequency, f , (3) in sands modulus GSN increases with N at very small &#61543;c below &#61543;tp  (sand is stiffening) while the cyclic pore water pressure does not develop; (4) in sands at small to moderate &#61543;c above &#61543;tp  modulus GSN first increases and then decreases with N while the cyclic pore water pressure continuously increases, (5) because of such behavior in which soil stiffness starts degrading after certain number of cycles, &#61543;td  in sand cannot be defined like &#61543;td  in clays, (6) in both clays tested &#61543;td is not visibly affected by overconsolidation ratio, OCR, (7) in kaolinite clay &#61543;tp  is not affected by OCR, (8) in kaolinite-bentonite clay with PI=55 and overconsolidated to OCR=4 and 7.8 the pore water pressures between &#61543;c=0.003% and 0.3% did not change in a consistent manner and &#61543;tp   could not be evaluated, (9) the thresholds &#61543;tp  tested show increase with PI just like in the previous studies, but their values are at or below the lower bound of published  &#61543;tp-PI trends, and (10) the tested &#61543;td  thresholds in clays do not follow the trend of increase with PI like in the previous studies and they are smaller than those published earlier for similar soils.

A histone arginine methylation localizes to nucleosomes in satellite II and III DNA sequences in the human genome
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Applying supervised learning/classification techniques to epigenomic data may reveal properties that differentiate histone modifications. Previous analyses sought to classify nucleosomes containing histone H2A/H4 arginine 3 symmetric dimethylation (H2A/H4R3me2s) or H2A.Z using human CD4+ T-cell chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data. However, these efforts only achieved modest accuracy with limited biological interpretation. Here, we investigate the impact of using appropriate data pre-processing &#8212;deduplication, normalization, and position- (peak-) finding to identify stable nucleosome positions &#8212; in conjunction with advanced classification algorithms, notably discriminatory motif feature selection and random forests. Performance assessments are based on accuracy and interpretative yield.
				
				
					
						Results
					We achieved dramatically improved accuracy using histone modification features (99.0%; previous attempts, 68.3%) and DNA sequence features (94.1%; previous attempts, &lt;60%). Furthermore, the algorithms elicited interpretable features that withstand permutation testing, including: the histone modifications H4K20me3 and H3K9me3, which are components of heterochromatin; and the motif TCCATT, which is part of the consensus sequence of satellite II and III DNA. Downstream analysis demonstrates that satellite II and III DNA in the human genome is occupied by stable nucleosomes containing H2A/H4R3me2s, H4K20me3, and/or H3K9me3, but not 18 other histone methylations. These results are consistent with the recent biochemical finding that H4R3me2s provides a binding site for the DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt3a) that methylates satellite II and III DNA.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Classification algorithms applied to appropriately pre-processed ChIP-Seq data can accurately discriminate between histone modifications. Algorithms that facilitate interpretation, such as discriminatory motif feature selection, have the added potential to impart information about underlying biological mechanism.

Experimental Characterization of Quantum Dynamics Through Many-Body Interactions
We report on the implementation of a quantum process tomography technique known as direct characterization of quantum dynamics applied on coherent and incoherent single-qubit processes in a system of trapped superscript 40Casuperscript + ions. Using quantum correlations with an ancilla qubit, direct characterization of quantum dynamics reduces substantially the number of experimental configurations required for a full quantum process tomography and all diagonal elements of the process matrix can be estimated with a single setting. With this technique, the system’s relaxation times Tsubscript 1 and Tsubscript 2 were measured with a single experimental configuration. We further show the first, complete characterization of single-qubit processes using a single generalized measurement realized through multibody correlations with three ancilla qubits.

Who was eating fish at kish? : a theoretical framework for using stable isotope analysis to explore processes of political economy in early dynastic Mesopotamia
Archaeology in Mesopotamia has a long history, with over a century of fieldwork having been undertaken to better understand this important region. The present work discusses the opening of a new chapter in Mesopotamian archaeology : the introduction of paleodiet reconstruction through the analysis of stable isotopes in human skeletal materials. To date, little, if any published research has ever been done that utilizes this method in the study of Mesopotamia, which is particularly unfortunate in light of the fact that stable isotope analysis has been an important and successful means of acquiring valuable information about other ancient societies. In this paper, I will briefly sketch several areas of study in the archaeology of Mesopotamia during the Third Millennium BCE, wherein the application of paleodiet reconstruction might be particularly illuminating, and could effectively supplement existing archaeological and linguistic data to further our understanding of a number of social, economic, and political processes that took place during that period. I will address the prospects for stable isotope analysis in relation to long-distance exchange of perishable commodities and elite self-aggrandizement through feasting. I will show in this assessment that, while there are very real political and practical hindrances that must be surmounted to achieve successful results with this technique, there is every reason to believe that these obstacles can be navigated successfully, and that the inclusion of stable isotope analysis in Mesopotamian archaeological study can only be of great benefit of the archaeological community as a whole

Delta Subsidence Reversal, Levee Failure, and Aquatic Habitat—A Cautionary Tale
Various schemes are often suggested to reverse the subsidence of lands below sea level in California’s Sacramento—San Joaquin Delta, an area protected by levees (dikes) that have significant probabilities of failure. Elementary modeling is used to estimate the probability distribution of land elevations at time of failure for 36 of these subsided islands, assuming a reasonable potential subsidence reversal rate. Given estimated annual probabilities of levee failure, elevation gains at this rate are not expected to exceed 1 to 2 m before flooding, which would be insufficient to restore most subsided islands to mean sea level (msl). However, under some circumstances 1- to 2-m gains are significant. A framework is introduced for evaluating islands as promising candidates for subsidence reversal based on elevation goals other than msl, as demonstrated though a hypothetical aquatic habitatexample. Here, we recommend relevant subsidence reversal strategies by comparing an elevation goal with each island’s anticipated flooded depth, and we prioritize islands for investment based on trade-offs between anticipated outcome and lost agricultural revenues. This approach might help integrate subsidence reversal activities into long-term Delta planning under a range of flooding, land use, and habitat management scenarios.

Evolutionary Psychology, Adaptation, and the Evoltion of Lanaguage:  Is there a Need for Comparsion?
A general assumption held by evolutionary psychologists is that a reference point for examining the origins and evolution of human psychological adaptations exists within a time range beginning roughly two million years ago. Scenarios for explaining the evolution of human psychological processes often allude to possible election pressures encountered by hominids during this time. unfortunately, comparative psychology and ethology are relatively absent from much current evolutionary psychological thought. Selective pressures that existed during the putative environment of evolutionary adaptedness may have predated the origin of hominids. Based on examples of the evolution of communication, this paper offers another approach to discovering the origins and evolution of psychological traits, with the aim of modifying a potentially misleading assumption of evolutionary psychology.

Essays in Time-Inconsistent and Endogenous Discounting
Empirical evidence shows that the exponential discount function employed in standard macroeconomic models falls short on two counts: it implies time-consistent preferences and assumes that the discount factor is a constant, exogenous parameter. As discounting behavior is crucial in the determination of individual intertemporal choice, it seems reasonable to expect that deviating from the standard exponential discounting behavior would significantly affect aggregate outcomes. Thus so, the main question of this dissertation is, "What are the macroeconomic and welfare consequences of time-inconsistent and endogenous discounting?" In this endeavor, this research focuses on three important applications: 1) on resource allocation and welfare in a social planner's economy; 2) on raising the retirement age in an economy where time-consistent and time-inconsistent discounters co-exist; and 3) on monetary policy effectiveness in a standard  neoclassical growth model. Indeed, the results show that moving beyond exponential discounting affects both macroeconomic and welfare outcomes to the extent that policy recommendations based on exponential discounting must at the very least be taken with a grain of salt.

[transport, protein, motor, vesicle, subunit, axonal]

Coordination of axonal transport revealed by particle tracking and quantitative immunofluorescence
Movement is intrinsic to life. Most forms of directed nanoscopic, microscopic and ultimately, macroscopic movement in cells is powered by tiny protein machines known as molecular motors. Microtubule-based motor proteins from the kinesin and dynein superfamilies are essential for many of these transport processes and coordinate to distribute various cellular cargos, including vesicles, organelles, protein complexes, and mRNAs to appropriate destinations within the cell. Due to the extreme compartmentalization of neurons, long range transport is particularly critical and recent advances suggests that these transport systems may fail early in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Although substantial progress has been made to understand the underlying fundamentals, how these two opposite polarity motor protein families cooperate to generate coordinated bidirectional movement is poorly understood. This work reveals a number of novel features of coordinated axonal transport through robust particle tracking and quantitative immunofluorescence for two medically relevant classes of cargos; amyloid precursor protein (APP) and cellular prion protein (PrPC) vesicles. We developed a quantitative approach to analyze the axonal transport of YFP-tagged APP vesicles in Drosophila segmental nerves using heterozygous animals. This allowed us to assess the contribution of individual motor subunits and accessory proteins to coordinated axonal transport. Our approach yielded a novel model for how motor proteins work together to achieve bi-directional transport. We subsequently propose a robust image analysis method to assess relative motor subunit composition of individual endogenous APP vesicles in mouse hippocampal culture. Our data provides new insight on how select motor subunit and cargo attachment protein levels contribute to the overall architecture of these vesicles. Finally, we characterize the intracellular transport and steady-state motor subunit composition of mammalian PrPC vesicles. We suggest a coordination model wherein PrPC vesicles maintain a stable population of associated motors whose activity is modulated by regulatory factors instead of by structural changes to motor-cargo associations. Since disruption of this transport machinery has been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS, elucidating the underlying fundamentals of this highly coordinated system is an essential part of understanding what happens during the progression of these devastating illnesses

Synthesis of Cationic Extended Frameworks for Anion-Based Applications
Many of the metal pollutants listed as priorities by the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) occur in water as their oxo-hydroxo anionic forms (e.g. perchlorate, chromate, selenite, etc.). Radioactive technetium (Tc-99) in the form of soluble pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) is highly problematic in low-activity waste (LAW) to separate the nuclear waste into primary solids.  Its easy leakage from glass after vitrification does not meet long-term storage performance assessment requirements. LAW also contains other non-radioactive inorganic and organic species e.g. carbonate (CO32&#8722;), nitrate (NO3&#8722;), etc. that may interfere with immobilizing radioactive species in solid-state ion-exchange materials.  Chromate is another problematic anion for vitrification because it weakens the integrity of the waste glass by forming spinels; such particles can also obstruct the glass flow within the melter during vitrification. 	There is an extensive class of purely inorganic extended materials and hybrid inorganic-organic extended frameworks. However, the majority of this group of materials occurs to bear a neutral or negative charge on their extended framework (e.g. zeolites). Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of well-studied isostructural cationic materials, and have been extensively studied in anion exchange. This group of materials, however, has limited capacity as evidenced by adsorption titration and isotherms.  They also display low selectivity towards anion pollutants, especially in the presence of carbonate. Exploration of transition metals and lower p block metals lead to synthesis of cationic inorganic materials and cationic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Ag(I) based cationic extended frameworks with &#945;,&#969;-alkanedisulfonate as anionic SDAs has successfully been synthesized with the formula as following, Ag2(4,4' bipy)2 (O3SCH2CH2SO3)*4H2O (SLUG-21). The unbound ethanedisulfonate anions display effective anion pollutant trapping on permanganate (MnO4&#8722;) and perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;) with high adsorption capacity and selectivity.   These two anions are chosen for anion exchange study owing to the same group as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;).  SLUG-21 displayed its adsorption capacity in record levels over all previous materials with 292 mg/g and 602 mg/g, respectively, for permanganate and perrhenate.  These values are over five times compared to the conventional layered double hydroxides (LDHs) under the same condition.  We further investigated the mechanism of these exceptional high adsorption capacities in view of crystallography.  In addition to exceptional high adsorption capacity, SLUG-21 displayed excellent selectivity towards anionic pollutants over non-toxic anions. One hundred fold excess of nitrate or carbonate do not interfere with SLUG-21 trapping permanganate and perrhenate.  The favorable trend of anions to be intercalated in SLUG-21 is as following: MnO4&#8722;> ReO4&#8722;> ClO4&#8722;> CrO42&#8722;> NO3&#8722;> CO32&#8722;, with the toxic pollutants topping the list.We are also successful in the synthesis of cationic inorganic layered materials, which displayed higher thermal and chemical stability than cationic MOFs.  Our approach focuses on the use of anionic SDAs and excluding any potential cationic SDAs. The first copper-based cationic layered extended framework Cu4(OH)6(O3SCH2CH2SO3)* 2H2O (SLUG-26) was hydrothermally synthesized. Inorganic connectivity (Cu-O-Cu) construct a cationic 2-D extended layer Cu4(OH)62+ with ethanedisulfonate weakly bounding between adjacent layers.  This material display rich intercalation chemistry with different &#945;,&#969;-alkanedicarboxylate anions.  The d-spacing between cationic cuprate layer can be tuned from 7.6 Å with intercalating malonate (&#8722;O2CCH2CO2&#8722;) to 11.1 Å with glutarate (&#8722;O2C(CH2)3CO2&#8722;) separating layers.  Besides organic anions, SLUG-26 also showed exchange capabilities upon inorganic anion pollutants, exhibiting five times higher adsorption capacity for permanganate than LDHs.  The complete exchange of the interlamellar anions of a 2-D cationic inorganic material was demonstrated.  The &#945;,&#969;-alkanedisulfonates were exchanged for &#945;,&#969;-alkanedicarboxylates, leading to two new cationic materials with the same Pb2F22+ layered architecture.  Both were solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction and the transformation also followed by in-situ optical microscopy and ex-situ powder X ray diffraction.  This report represents a rare example of metal-organic framework displaying highly efficient and complete replacement of its anionic organic linker while retaining the original extended inorganic layer.  It also opens up further possibilities for introducing other anions or abatement of problematic anions such as pharmaceuticals and their metabolites.A rare example of an extended nickel oxide open framework with succinate capping the channels was synthesized.  A honeycomb-like layer of 14-membered rings centered in the (-111) plane are connected by vertex-sharing NiO6 octahedra and water resides in the channels.  The structure is the second example of an extended hybrid containing 3-D Ni-O-Ni connectivity and was structurally characterized by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction.  The material displays excellent chemical stability in aqueous solution from pH ~ 1 to 13 and thermal stability to ~ 375 °C as evidenced by thermogravimetic analysis coupled mass spectroscopy.  The Ni2+ ions order ferromagnetically order below Tc = 5.1 K, and anisotropic exchange interactions lead to a field-induced metamagnetic transition and spin-glass-like dependence on cooling conditions in magnetic field.  Sb6O7(SO4)2 (SLUG-34) consists of a very unusual 1-D antimony oxide chain four Sb atoms wide, with unprotonated sulfate between the chains.  The material can be synthesized in high yield and pure phase and was characterized by both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.  The entirely inorganic nature of SLUG-34 along with infinite 1-D Sb-O-Sb connectivity results in high thermal stability and chemical resistance.  SLUG-34 is thermally stable to ca. 500 °C as evidenced by in-situ variable temperature thermodiffraction as well as thermogravimetric analysis.  Unlike the basic nature of layered double hydroxides (which are the only well-studied class of cationic inorganic materials), SLUG-34 is chemically stable in aqueous acidic conditions.  This opens up the possibility for synthesis of other non-LDH type cationic inorganic materials with potential host-guest applications based on their extraframework anions.A facile and inexpensive approach to fabricate "nanospider" TiO2 thin films was demonstrated with not only an amazing morphology but highly efficient water splitting to produce hydrogen.  Our method employs benzene-swollen poly(ethylene glycol) as a sacrificial organic polymer to template the semiconductor thin film.  The synthesized TiO2 thin films are highly crystalline with optimized particle and channel size to enhance the liquid-semiconductor junction interaction.  This enhanced contact area leads to more than twice the water splitting performance than conventional P25 thin films.  In addition, the nanospider thin films also outperform P25 films in the photodegradation of toxic organics.An inexpensive method using solvent-swollen poly(methyl methacrylate) as a sacrificial template for mesoporous titanium oxide thin films was investigated with tunable meso/nano morphology.  The conversion efficiency reaches 4.2 % despite using a solid state electrolyte, which circumvents the longevity issues of liquid electrolytes.  The cells show a large short-circuit photocurrent density of 7.98 mA, open-circuit voltage of 0.78 V and maximum conversion efficiency of 4.2 % under air-mass 1.5 global illumination.  At higher titania precursor ratios, nanodisk particles are formed, increasing light scattering and doubling the efficiency over our previous reports.  The tunability of the semiconductor morphology and all solid-state nature of the cells makes the method a viable alternative to existing solar cell technology.

Inter- and intracellular dynamics of DNA methylation
CpG methylation in the human genome plays an important role in the transcriptional regulatory network. I have explored the biology of this epigenetic mark and I have developed tools that aid in methylation-related analyses. Although most of the human genome is methylated, regions involved in regulatory activity tend to be unmethylated. The methylation states of CpGs influence DNA-protein interactions. Since DNA methylation influences transcriptional regulation, DNA methylation signatures discriminate among phenotypes, such as cancerous cells versus healthy cells or differentiated cells versus pluripotent cells. To better study DNA methylation, I produced a new probe set, Cpg220k, used in targeted bisulfite sequencing by Kun Zhang's lab. This involved surveying the literature for experiments that found regions of variable DNA methylation and using other experimental data, such as DNaseI hypersensitivity data, that found candidates for likely differential methylation. I produced padlock probes based on maximizing the bp coverage of these regions while minimizing the cost of the experiment. Using targeted bisulfite sequencing, I developed analytical tools that allowed for inter- and intracellular analysis of CpG methylation data. I found that methylation signatures accurately classify ES, fibroblast, and iPS cell lines. Gene expression and methylation are negatively correlated at the TSS but they are weakly correlated further down- and upstream from the TSS. Further exploring fuzzily methylated CpGs (methylation frequencies between .25 and .75), I found regions that exhibited allele-specific methylation. Many of the ASM regions involved a SNP overlapping with a CpG site, thereby creating sequence dependent ASM. Other ASM regions were likely products of biological regulatory mechanisms. I then created a pipeline that utilized the tools I developed for my methylation analyses. I integrated the pipeline into a website (http:// wanglab.ucsd.edu/star/) so that other scientists can conveniently run these analyses on their methylation data. Due to the increasing scale of methylation experiments, I created the pipeline with the capability of handling massive data sets that can exceed several billion reads. I made the tools that were critical to my research publicly available in hopes to furthering the scientific community's understanding of DNA methylation

Using a model filamentous fungus to unravel mechanisms of lignocellulose deconstruction
Abstract
				Filamentous fungi are the main source of enzymes used to degrade lignocellulose to fermentable sugars for the production of biofuels. While the most commonly used organism for the production of cellulases in an industrial setting is Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina), recent work in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has shown that the variety of molecular, genetic and biochemical techniques developed for this organism can expedite analyses of the complexities involved in the utilization of lignocellulose as a source of carbon. These include elucidating regulatory networks associated with plant cell wall deconstruction, the identification of signaling molecules necessary for induction of the expression of genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes and the characterization of new cellulolytic enzymatic activities. In particular, the availability of a full genome deletion strain set for N. crassa has expedited high throughput screening for mutants that display a cellulolytic phenotype. This review summarizes the key findings of several recent studies using N. crassa to further understanding the mechanisms of plant cell wall deconstruction by filamentous fungi.

Role of the RNA-Binding Protein UBP1C in Translational Repression  During Hypoxia in Arabidopsis thaliana
Oxygen deficient plants suffer an energy limitation that can suppress growth and development and lead to premature cell death. Underlying adaptation, plants have evolved integrated genetic and cellular programs to respond to low oxygen stress (hypoxia/anoxia). Mechanisms of diverse adaptation share common themes, such as enhanced oxygen-independent energy supply, regulated growth and energy consumption, and prioritization of energy use. Tailored protein synthesis conserves energy by reduction in synthesis of non-stress-relevant proteins (90% of cellular mRNA) involved in normal growth and development, and funnels resources to translation of hypoxia-induced mRNAs encoding proteins that drive carbohydrate mobility and substrate-level phosphorylation. It was hypothesized that the mRNAs that are translationally repressed during hypoxia associate with RNA binding proteins, which protect them or allow their degradation, and facilitate their rapid return of the sequestered mRNAs to translational complexes within minutes of reoxygenation. Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are two structures of up to 4 µM in diameter, characterized in non-plant eukaryotic cells as sites of mRNA sequestration and degradation during stress. Conservation of genes encoding orthologs of these proteins in plants suggests a corresponding system for management of cytosolic non-translated mRNA . We initiated a survey study of predicted RNA binding proteins that are orthologous to non-plant SG and PB proteins encoded by Arabidopsis thaliana. To determine their roles in normal development, T-DNA insertion mutant alleles were identified and surveyed for abnormal growth and development. In addition, several were fused to fluorescent proteins to determine their subcellular localization and make observations of the effect of overexpression on normal growth. From this survey, plant OLIGOURIDYLATE BINDING PROTEIN (UBP)1C was further characterized for its role during hypoxia stress. UBP1A and UBP1C-GPF fusion proteins relocalized from diffuse to granular cytoplasmic localization upon hypoxia treatment, which was rapidly reversed by reoxygenation, concomitant with restoration of protein synthesis. These granules required completion of translation for their assembly. Mutation of these genes led to altered survival of oxygen deprivation. Global quantitative profiling of the mRNAs associated with UBP1C revealed that transcripts with U-rich 3'-untranslated regions are highly UBP1C-associated during non-stress conditions. Upon treatment with hypoxia most cellular mRNAs increased association with UBP1C with the exception of the mRNAs that were highly induced by hypoxia and associated with polyribosomes under stress and those already highly associated. Upon reoxygenation this association was rapidly reversed. In conclusion, UBP1C association with mRNA during hypoxia is linked to the dynamic sequestration and turnover of transcripts observed during hypoxia in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

VaseyThe California coast is renowned for its exceptional diversity of local endemic species, particularly in evergreen, sclerophyllous shrubland known as maritime chaparral.    This species rich, fire-adapted shrubland is typical of other regions in the world with Mediterranean-type climates characterized by cool, wet winters and long, dry summers.   The dry season in California, however, is moderated by a persistent layer of fog and low cloud cover that hugs the coast during much of the summer (summer marine layer).  I investigated the potential influence of the summer marine layer on shrub water relations along a coast-to-interior climate gradient in the central California region.  I also tested the possible impact the summer marine layer might have on chaparral species diversity patterns in this region.  Finally, since maritime chaparral is a legally protected natural community under Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA) policy, I investigated the origin and implementation of ESHA policy to determine if natural science insights might help to inform the conservation of this globally rare vegetation.     Using water potentials, stable carbon isotope ratios, and xylem vulnerability analysis of Arctostaphylos shrubs, we found evidence that plant water relations in coastal chaparral are more favorable than in interior chaparral.  Dry season climate variables associated with evaporative demand were found to dominate the environmental variance of the 87 plots investigated; however, for upland coastal (transition) plots, there was significantly more winter rain than coastal lowlands or interior uplands.  I found high levels of beta diversity in both coastal uplands and coastal lowlands compared to low beta diversity in interior chaparral.  Since "maritime chaparral" has legal status under ESHA policy, I propose that the designation of maritime chaparral in most cases should include both coastal lowland and coastal upland chaparral.  I found that the mandatory language of ESHA policy, its focus on habitat rather than species, and its grounding in local land use planning is a powerful combination for biodiversity conservation that provides an interesting model for landscape scale conservation strategies.

Protease activity in mesenteric lymph following splanchnic arterial occlusion
The lymphatics play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure following circulatory shock. Understanding the cause of this organ dysfunction is a fundamentally unsolved problem in medicine. Current results show that biologically active molecules produced in the gut enter the circulation via the mesenteric lymph duct, and induce neutrophil activation, increased vascular permeability, and acute lung injury. Despite several attempts to determine the protein composition of mesenteric lymph, the factors responsible for this biological activity and specifically the organ damage are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the level and activity of pancreatic digestive proteases in post-shock lymph, which could be derived from the intestine and which are a potentially damaging mediator. Male Wistar rats were subjected to laparotomy, followed by mesenteric lymph duct cannulation and one hour of lymph fluid collection before shock. Five animals then underwent one hour of splanchnic arterial occlusion followed by reperfusion, while sham shock animals remained perfused. Post-shock lymph was collected for three hours, with the samples aliquoted every hour. Protease activity in the lymph was analyzed using a fluorescently quenched casein substrate as an indicator for general protease activity and separately charge-changing fluorescently quenched peptide substrates specific to pancreatic digestive proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin). These measurements showed trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in the lymph, and the presence of trypsin was confirmed using Western analysis. Over the time course we see a base level of protease activity in the mesenteric lymph that increases following gut ischemia and reperfusion. These results indicate that during shock digestive protease escape from the splanchnic bed, raising the possibility that they are involved in the systemic injury following shock.

Targeting the brain : identifying and inhibiting harmful protein-amyloid interactions in Alzheimer's disease
Although the pathological aggregation and deposition of Abeta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain has long been implicated as the key event leading to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is still no disease- modifying therapeutic or definitive diagnostic method to diagnose, monitor, or treat AD. Compelling evidence has shown a strong correlation between accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta peptides and oxidative damage in the brains of AD sufferers. One hypothesis for this correlation involves the direct and harmful interaction of aggregated Abeta peptides with enzymes responsible for maintaining normal levels of reactive oxygen species. Identification of specific, destructive interactions of Abeta peptides with cellular anti-oxidant enzymes would represent an important step towards understanding the pathogenicity of Abeta peptides in AD and designing an effective strategy to manage this disease. Therefore, the focus of this dissertation is to : 1) identify direct and harmful binding interactions between aggregated Abeta peptides and anti-oxidant enzymes that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, 2) inhibit these destructive interactions using Abeta-binding small molecules capable of generating protein-resistive surface coatings on aggregated Abeta peptides, and 3) develop a general strategy to deliver diagnostic and therapeutic agents across the restrictive blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this dissertation, small molecules capable of generating protein-resistive surface coatings on aggregated Abeta peptides were used to probe the interaction of A&beta; with cellular anti-oxidant enzymes. This dissertation supports the important role of intracellular catalase- amyloid interactions in Abeta-induced oxidative stress and proposes a novel molecular strategy of generating protein-resistive surface coatings on aggregated Abeta peptides to inhibit such harmful interactions in AD. The development of high payload brain-targeting magnetic nanoparticles that have the ability to act as a diagnostic imaging agent while simultaneously providing a multivalent scaffold for conjugation of drugs and brain-targeting vectors was also explored. This dissertation provides evidence that magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to transferrin enhances the transport of nanoparticles across the BBB by receptor-mediated transcytosis. Collectively, these findings provide new information on the interaction of aggregated Abeta peptides with cellular components that contribute to AD, propose a strategy to inhibit these interactions, and suggest that receptor-mediated transcytosis may be a promising route for the delivery of molecules across the BBB

Dynamics of digging in wet soil
Numerous animals live in, and locomote through, subsea soils. To move in a medium dominated by frictional interactions, many of these animals have adopted unique burrowing strategies. This paper presents a burrowing model inspired by the Atlantic razor clam (Ensis directus), which uses deformations of its body to cyclically loosen and re-pack the surrounding soil in order to locally manipulate burrowing drag. The model reveals how an anisotropic body – composed of a cylinder and sphere varying sinusoidally in size and relative displacement – achieves unidirectional motion through a medium with variable frictional properties. This net displacement is attained even though the body kinematics are reciprocal and inertia of both the model organism and the surrounding medium are negligible. Our results indicate that body aspect ratio has a strong effect on burrowing velocity and efficiency, with a well-defined maximum for given kinematics and soil material properties.

Experimental and Numerical Investigations of Novel Architectures Applied to Compressive Imaging Systems
A recent breakthrough in information theory known as compressive sensing is one component of an ongoing revolution in data acquisition and processing that guides one to acquire less data yet still recover the same amount of information as traditional techniques, meaning less resources such as time, detector cost, or power are required.  Starting from these basic principles, this thesis explores the application of these techniques to imaging.  The first laboratory example we introduce is a simple infrared camera.  Then we discuss the application of compressive sensing techniques to hyperspectral microscopy, specifically Raman microscopy, which should prove to be a powerful technique to bring the acquisition time for such microscopies down from hours to minutes.  Next we explore a novel sensing architecture that uses partial circulant matrices as sensing matrices, which results in a simplified, more robust imaging system.  The results of these imaging experiments lead to questions about the performance and fundamental nature of sparse signal recovery with partial circulant compressive sensing matrices.  Thus, we present the results of a suite of numerical experiments that show some surprising and suggestive results that could stimulate further theoretical and applied research of partial circulant compressive sensing matrices.  We conclude with a look ahead to adaptive sensing procedures that allow real-time, interactive optical signal processing to further reduce the resource demands of an imaging system.

Continuous surface ocean measurements of dissolved oxygen isotopes
Continuous measurements of dissolved oxygen isotopes can provide insight into how oceanic primary production varies over time and space. For example, ¹⁷Delta, the deviation from the expected mass-dependent isotopic fractionation, is a tracer of gross primary production. This thesis focuses on techniques for continuously measuring dissolved oxygen isotopes, and showcases measurements from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier. We developed a counterflow-type equilibrator with a time constant of 7-8 minutes for oxygen. When interfaced to a mass spectrometer, this equilibrator allows for a sampling flow rate of 3 mL min⁻¹. Using a model of O₂, N₂, and Ar, the behavior of major gases in an equilibrator is explored, and the corrections needed to account for incomplete equilibration are determined. We also quantify possible sources of interference to the measurement of oxygen isotopes, and find that O₂ and N₂ contribute to the interference, while the interferences from water vapor and DMS are negligible. In addition, we describe a technique for keeping the O₂/N₂ ratio constant, to reduce the interference from N₂. Dissolved oxygen isotopes were measured near the surface ocean at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier for five weeks. The data show diurnal cycles in O₂ and delta¹⁸O, with amplitudes of 19 mmol m⁻³ and 1.1 per mil , respectively. The diurnal cycles are well described by a box model that includes photosynthesis, respiration, air- sea gas exchange, and mixing. The timing of the cycle can be explained using a photosynthesis rate proportional to photosynthetically active radiation. The maximum daily photosynthesis rate is 4.7 mmol O₂ m⁻³ hr⁻¹ (40.3 mgC m⁻³ hr⁻¹ using a photosynthetic quotient of 1.4). This is in agreement with the production estimated from the chlorophyll concentration. Although the ¹⁷Delta data did not have a resolvable diurnal cycle, modeled ¹⁷Delta shows a diurnal cycle with an amplitude of 11 per meg. The oxygen isotope data also show variability over longer timescales, suggesting a change in the production rate over time. In the future, these techniques could be used around the world to improve our understanding of variability in oceanic primary production

[superhydrophobic, surface, glass, application, chapter]

Nano-structured self-cleaning superhydrophobic glass
Superhydrophobic surfaces have received increasing attention because of their potential applications in cleantech applications such as maintaining highrise building window glasses and automobile glasses clean, consumer applications such as water-proof textiles, protective coating for telecommunication antennas, and other devices. Superhydrophobic surfaces have the self- cleaning effect, reducing the usage of energy and water required for cleaning, and minimizing pollution and waste caused by cleaning chemicals. This thesis investigates the preparation and properties of superhydrophobic glass surfaces and provides new means for fabricating these self -cleaning surfaces. In chapter 1, the basic properties related to superhydrophobic surfaces are reviewed. In chapter 2, the fabrication of Al₂O₃ nanowires having superhydrophobic characteristics is discussed. The nanowire topography in a vertically aligned configuration was constructed by altering the geometry of as fabricated anodized aluminum oxide pore structure through pore- widening. In chapter 3, superhydrophobic surfaces made from dry and wet etching processes were investigated. Glass nanopillar configurations with an extremely high contact angle ( ̃172o) were made by straightforward and economical process techniques. Optically transparent or translucent glass can be selectively made by adjusting the etching methods. In chapter 4, the morphology of diblock copolymer, polystyrene-block-poly (4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b- P4VP), is described. It is shown that gold nanoparticles embedded into a diblock copolymer selectively onto only P4VP blocks can be used as etching mask island arrays to fabricate Teflon nanopillar arrays having superhydrophobic characteristics. New techniques for creating superhydrophobic surfaces in this work could serve as useful guidance for self-cleaning surfaces, especially window or automobile glass applications

Analysis of C. elegans NR2E nuclear receptors
defines three conserved clades and ligand-independent
functions
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The nuclear receptors (NRs) are an important class of transcription factors that are conserved across animal phyla. Canonical NRs consist of a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD). While most animals have 20&#8211;40 NRs, nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis have experienced a spectacular proliferation and divergence of NR genes. The LBDs of evolutionarily-conserved Caenorhabditis NRs have diverged sharply from their Drosophila and vertebrate orthologs, while the DBDs have been strongly conserved. The NR2E family of NRs play critical roles in development, especially in the nervous system. In this study, we explore the phylogenetics and function of the NR2E family of Caenorhabditis elegans, using an in vivo assay to test LBD function.
				
				
					
						Results
					Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the NR2E family of NRs consists of three broadly-conserved clades of orthologous NRs. In C. elegans, these clades are defined by nhr-67, fax-1 and nhr-239. The vertebrate orthologs of nhr-67 and fax-1 are Tlx and PNR, respectively. While the nhr-239 clade includes orthologs in insects (Hr83), an echinoderm, and a hemichordate, the gene appears to have been lost from vertebrate lineages. The C. elegans and C. briggsae nhr-239 genes have an apparently-truncated and highly-diverged LBD region. An additional C. elegans NR2E gene, nhr-111, appears to be a recently-evolved paralog of fax-1; it is present in C. elegans, but not C. briggsae or other animals with completely-sequenced genomes. Analysis of the relatively unstudied nhr-111 and nhr-239 genes demonstrates that they are both expressed&#8212;nhr-111 very broadly and nhr-239 in a small subset of neurons. Analysis of the FAX-1 LBD in an in vivo assay revealed that it is not required for at least some developmental functions.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our analysis supports three conserved clades of NR2E receptors, only two of which are represented in vertebrates, indicating three ancestral NR2E genes in the urbilateria. The lack of a requirement for a FAX-1 LBD suggests that the relatively high level of sequence divergence for Caenorhabditis LBDs reflects relaxed selection on the primary sequence as opposed to divergent positive selection. This observation is consistent with a model in which divergence of some Caenorhabditis LBDs is allowed, at least in part, by the absence of a ligand requirement.

Defining the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in EGF receptor trafficking and signaling
RGS-PX1 functions as a GAP that inactivates Galphas and regulates EGFR trafficking and signaling, while GIV binds Galphai to form a molecular switch that and activates Galphai and promotes efficient receptor signaling. Yet the mechanisms by which Galphas/RGS-PX1 and Galphai/ GIV affect EGFR signaling remained unclear. I set out to further define the roles of Galphas/RGS-PX1 and Galphai/GIV in EGFR trafficking and signaling. We found that Galphas regulates EGFR degradation. Specifically, Galphas depletion by RNAi delayed and Galphas overexpression promoted EGF-induced degradation of EGFR, a key step in the downregulation of receptor signaling. In addition, Galphas and RGS-PX1 form a complex with Hrs, a component necessary for receptor sorting for degradation. Thus, Galphas promotes EGFR degradation and forms a complex with RGS-PX1 and Hrs that might be required for efficient receptor sorting. Galphas depletion also enhanced ligand-induced EGFR autophosphorylation and ERK 1 /2 signaling, and a siRNA-resistant, inactive Galphas- G226A mutant but not an active Galphas-Q227L mutant reversed these effects. Together, these data indicate that activation of Galphas delays and inactivation of Galphas by RGS-PX1 promotes downregulation of EGFR signaling. We also found that the Galphai-GIV switch reprograms EGFR signaling to influence whether cells migrate or proliferate. Specifically, GIV interacts with EGFR, and GIV's GEF motif promotes several events including formation of a ligand-induced complex between EGFR, Galphai, and actin which promotes receptor signaling within the plasma membrane (PM)-actin bed, receptor autophosphorylation, PM-based signaling to Akt and PLCgamma, and cell migration. Disabling GIV's GEF motif by mutation (GIV-F1685A) disrupts this complex which promotes receptor signaling trafficking from endosomes, inhibits receptor autophosphorylation, and enhances endosome-based signaling to ERK 1/2 MAPK and c-Src/STAT5b and cell proliferation. Furthermore, early during progression of colorectal carcinomas, before metastatic invasion the Galphai-GIV switch is disabled due to the loss of GIV's carboxy-terminus and critical GEF motif by alternative splicing. Later during metastatic invasion the switch is assembled by upregulation of GIV. Therefore, the switch is selectively assembled or not at different stages of oncogenesis leading to pro-migration or proliferative cellular profiles, respectively. These traits might cumulatively influence growth and invasiveness of tumors during oncogenic progression

Contrasting Effects of Vasculogenic Induction Upon Biaxial Bioreactor Stimulation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Endothelial Progenitor Cells Cocultures in Three-Dimensional Scaffolds Under In Vitro and In Vivo Paradigms for Vascularized Bone Tissue Engineering
Clinical translation of bone tissue engineering approaches for fracture repair has been hampered by inadequate vascularization required for maintaining cell survival, skeletal regeneration, and remodeling. The potential of vasculature formation within tissue-engineered grafts depends on various factors, including an appropriate choice of scaffold and its microarchitectural design for the support of tissue ingrowth and vessel infiltration, vasculogenic potential of cell types and mechanostimulation on cells to enhance cytokine expression. Here, we demonstrated the effect of biomechanical stimulation on vasculogenic and bone-forming capacity of umbilical-cord-blood endothelial progenitor cells (UCB-EPC) and human fetal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hfMSC) seeded within macroporous scaffolds and cocultured dynamically in a biaxial bioreactor. Dynamically cultured EPC/hfMSC constructs generated greater mineralization and calcium deposition consistently over 14 days of culture (1.7-fold on day 14; p<0.05). However, in vitro vessel formation was not observed as compared to an extensive EPC-vessel network formed under static culture on day 7. Subsequent subcutaneous implantations in NOD/SCID mice showed 1.4-fold higher human:mouse cell chimerism (p<0.001), with a more even cellular distribution throughout the dynamically cultured scaffolds. In addition, there was earlier evidence of vessel infiltration into the scaffold and a trend toward increased ectopic bone formation, suggesting improved efficacy and cellular survival through early vascularization upon biomechanical stimulation. The integrative use of bioreactor culture systems with macroporous scaffolds and cocultured osteogenic and vasculogenic cells promotes maturation of EPC/hfMSC-scaffold grafts necessary for vascularized bone tissue engineering applications.

Manipulating posttranslational modification in natural product biosynthesis
Fatty acids, polyketides and nonribosomal peptides are three classes of natural products that play critical roles in human health, disease and therapy. Investigations that lead to a broader understanding of their biosynthesis may one day allow scientists to engineer the biomanufacture of novel compounds with tailored chemistries and biological activities. A unifying characteristic between these classes of compounds is the posttranslational modification of their synthase enzymes with a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl (4'-PP) arm from a coenzyme A (CoA) donor, installed by phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). We have previously described a method to chemoenzymatically install modified 4'-PP arms to heterologously expressed synthase enzymes through the use of CoA analogues that have been alkylated at the thiol terminus with fluorescent and affinity probes. We have since sought to extend this technique to the isolation of synthases from producer organisms, but this application was complicated by the efficiency of endogenous modification. This dissertation focuses on evaluating the use of PPTase inhibitors to enable the extension of our technique to these organisms.We have previously described a method to chemoenzymatically install modified 4'-PP arms to heterologously expressed synthase enzymes through the use of CoA analogues that have been alkylated at the thiol terminus with fluorescent and affinity probes.

 The sculpting of ultracold neutral plasmas represents a frontier in the experimental study of collective modes in strongly coupled plasmas. By extending the range of accessible length scales to less than tens of microns we gain access to a regime where strong coupling's effects are predicted yet largely untested. To this effort, high resolution optical systems were designed, bench tested and implemented for sculpting and imaging ultracold neutral plasmas. Many complications and unexpected effects were documented to assist future experimental design considerations, including, those due to saturation and optical thickness, both of which limit the utility of 461 nm push beam modulations. It was concluded that sculpting should be performed on the 412 nm ionizing beam and real-time density space analysis is reliable for spatial frequencies up to 5 cyc/mm by using 4X magnified imaging. Higher spatial frequencies benefit from velocity space analysis due to extremely fast dynamics and low intensity levels.

Purification and Processing of Graphitic Carbons
Carbon materials exist in several forms and have a wide range of applications that are commonly encountered in everyday life.  The more familiar applications range from car tires to cosmetics.  The breadth of applications is solely due to the various graphitic and amorphous structures of carbon, which gives rise to a wide range of properties that can be engineered to obtain the desired feature or function.  Allotropes of carbon include diamond, fullerenes, graphite (graphene) and carbon nanotubes.  The latter two are the focus of this dissertation and their characterization, purification, and functionalization will be described in detail.      High solubility of purified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene is desired for their utilization in various applications.  In the case of SWNTs, concentrated nitric acid treatment is the most common form of purification currently used.  It is highly effective in the removal of residual metal catalysts, but generates unwanted carbonaceous byproducts known as carboxylated carbons (CCs).  Little is known about the nature of these species (CCs), and it is has been suggested that because of their high carboxylic acid functionality and their adhesion to the SWNT side wall, that upon functionalization of an oxidized nanotube sample, the majority of the functionalization is occurring on the CCs and not the SWNTs, and that upon their removal, the SWNTs are rendered insoluble.  Similar to SWNTs, soluble graphene is desirable to achieve facile manipulation of the material for device applications although the exfoliation of graphite to form a single layer has proven to be challenging. In this dissertation, the characterization of the CCs will be discussed and upon their removal, it is demonstrated that solubility of the purified SWNTs is retained upon covalent functionalization with octadecylamine (ODA).  Soluble graphene layers were formed by reacting graphite fluoride with alkyl lithium reagents.  Functionalized graphene can be readily prepared by this technique and dispersed in organic solvent and upon annealing, the intrinsic properties can be partially restored.  This dissertation serves to extend the achievements previously developed by the Haddon research group and adds to the continued progress in the advancement of carbon materials chemistry.

Community-dependent Positive Interactions in  Southern California Coastal Ecosystems
Ecological interactions are context dependent.  The net effect of species interactions includes the multifaceted impacts of community composition and abiotic influences of the environment.  I examined how both biotic and abiotic stressors, in the form of herbivore composition and salinity stress, respectively, elicited positive interactions between species.  In a kelp forest I examined how the relationship between kelp and an encrusting bryozoan, <italic>Membranipora membranacea </italic>, shifted to an associational defense depending on herbivore guild composition.  Using a combination of choice experiments and surveys of grazing damage, I demonstrated that the mesograzers <italic>Lacuna unifasciata</italic>, <italic>Perampithoe humeralis</italic>, and <italic>Idotea resecata</italic> almost entirely avoided (<1% of total diet) encrusted kelp.  The large snail <italic>Norrisia norrisi</italic> also preferred clean kelp, but kelp crabs, <italic>Pugettia producta</italic>, targeted encrusted kelp.  Field surveys in a mesograzer dominated canopy found 2.5 times more grazing damage on sparsely encrusted kelp than on heavily encrusted kelp and far more grazing in the upper canopy than on the blades from the vertical stipes below the canopy.  These results indicate that, when mesograzers are dominant, <italic>Membranipora</italic> provides kelp associational resistance to grazing.  Such protection may be more prominent in the upper canopy.  Additionally, I examined the role of abiotic stress on positive interactions in a hypersaline salt marsh.  Following disturbance that removes established vegetation, salt-tolerant species can ameliorate harsh soil salinities for less tolerant species and therefore promote secondary succession.  However, when abiotic stress is extremely high amelioration may be inadequate to improve growth of associated neighbors.  Using clipping manipulations of <italic>Batis maritima</italic>, an early successional halophyte, I tested whether <italic>B. maritima</italic> facilitates secondary succession in an excessively hypersaline salt marsh in southern California.  Experimental plots with <italic>B. maritima</italic> present recovered faster (27% compared to 14% revegetation by matrix species) and had lower increases in soil salinity.  <italic>Salicornia pacifica</italic> and <italic>Arthrocnemum subterminale</italic> were the dominant recovery species in both treatments and no differences were found in species richness, diversity, or evenness of recovery species between treatments.  Overall, my research indicates positive interactions play a prominent role in these coastal ecosystems though that role will depend on the specific nature of the community.

The Kolmogorov-Obukhov Statistical Theory of Turbulence
In 1941 Kolmogorov and Obukhov proposed that there exists a statistical theory of turbulence that should allow the computation of all the statistical quantities that can be computed and measured in turbulent systems. These are quantities such as the moments, the structure functions and the probability density functions (PDFs) of the turbulent velocity field.  In this paper we will outline how to construct this statistical theory from the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. The additive noise in the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation is generic noise given by the central limit theorem and the large deviation principle. The multiplicative noise consists of jumps multiplying the velocity, modeling jumps in the velocity gradient.We first estimate the structure functions of turbulence and establish the Kolmogorov-Obukhov {'}62 scaling hypothesis with the She-Leveque intermittency corrections. Then we compute the invariant measure of turbulence writing the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation as an infinite-dimensional Ito process and solving the linear Kolmogorov-Hopf functional differential equation for the invariant measure. Finally we project the invariant measure onto the PDF. The PDFs turn out to be the normalized inverse Gaussian (NIG) distributions of Barndorff-Nilsen, and compare well with PDFs from simulations and experiments.

In my thesis work, I participated in forward genetic screens to identify genes involved in two biological processes in plants, stem cell maintenance in the floral meristem and small RNA biogenesis/function. First, I characterized a Polycomb (PcG) gene, CURLY LEAF (CLF) as a factor required for floral meristem termination. A mutation in CLF enhances the floral determinacy defects of ag-10, a weak allele in AGAMOUS (AG), a gene essential for floral stem cell termination. CLF acts in the AG pathway to repress the stem cell identity gene, WUSCHEL (WUS) to result in floral stem cell termination. In addition, I show that this role of CLF reflects the role of the PcG complex in the control of floral meristem determinacy. Taken together, I provide a link between epigenetic regulation and stem cell maintenance in the floral meristem. Second, I identified two genes, MED20a and STERILE APETALA (SAP) that promote small RNA biogenesis and modulate small RNA activities, respectively. MED20a is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which is thought to bridge transcription factors and the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional machinery. In med20a and mutants in two other Mediator subunits, med17 and med18, miRNA accumulation is generally reduced. In the med20a mutant, the levels of pri-miRNA are also lower and the promoter activity of MIR167a is reduced, suggesting that the Mediator promotes MIR gene expression at the transcriptional level. I show that SAP is a negative regulator of the activities of a subset of miRNAs. In sap mutants, the mRNA and protein levels of several miRNA target genes are reduced despite no changes in miRNA accumulation. In addition, some miRNAs are more active in sap mutants, resulting in more 3' cleavage products from target mRNAs. This indicates that SAP negatively regulates the activities of a subset of miRNAs at the posttranscriptional level. These studies extend our understanding of the dynamic control of small RNA biogenesis and function.

DNA variation in the phenotypically-diverse brown alga Saccharina japonica
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						Saccharina japonica (Areschoug) Lane, Mayes, Druehl et Saunders is an economically important and highly morphologically variable brown alga inhabiting the northwest Pacific marine waters. On the basis of nuclear (ITS), plastid (rbcLS) and mitochondrial (COI) DNA sequence data, we have analyzed the genetic composition of typical Saccharina japonica (TYP) and its two common morphological varieties, known as the &#8220;longipes&#8221; (LON) and &#8220;shallow-water&#8221; (SHA) forms seeking to clarify their taxonomical status and to evaluate the possibility of cryptic species within S. japonica.
				
				
					
						Results
					The data show that the TYP and LON forms are very similar genetically in spite of drastic differences in morphology, life history traits, and ecological preferences. Both, however, are genetically quite different from the SHA form. The two Saccharina lineages are distinguished by 109 fixed single nucleotide differences as well as by seven fixed length polymorphisms (based on a 4,286&#8201;bp concatenated dataset that includes three gene regions). The GenBank database reveals a close affinity of the TYP and LON forms to S. japonica and the SHA form to S. cichorioides. The three gene markers used in the present work have different sensitivity for the algal species identification. COI gene was the most discriminant gene marker. However, we have detected instances of interspecific COI recombination reflecting putative historical hybridization events between distantly related algal lineages. The recombinant sequences show highly contrasted level of divergence in the 5&#8217;- and 3&#8217;- regions of the gene, leading to significantly different tree topologies depending on the gene segment (5&#8217;- or 3&#8217;-) used for tree reconstruction. Consequently, the 5&#8217;-COI &#8220;barcoding&#8221; region (~ 650&#8201;bp) can be misleading for identification purposes, at least in the case of algal species that might have experienced historical hybridization events.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Taking into account the potential roles of phenotypic plasticity in evolution, we conclude that the TYP and LON forms represent examples of algae phenotypic diversification that enables successful adaptation to contrasting shallow- and deep-water marine environments, while the SHA form is very similar to S. cichorioides and should be considered a different species. Practical applications for algal management and conservation are briefly considered.

A novel IgE antibody targeting the prostate-specific antigen as a potential prostate cancer therapy
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA), often found at high levels in the serum of PCa patients, has been used as a marker for PCa detection and as a target of immunotherapy. The murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody AR47.47, specific for human PSA, has been shown to enhance antigen presentation by human dendritic cells and induce both CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation when complexed with PSA. In this study, we explored the properties of a novel mouse/human chimeric anti-PSA IgE containing the variable regions of AR47.47 as a potential therapy for PCa. Our goal was to take advantage of the unique properties of IgE in order to trigger immune activation against PCa.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Binding characteristics of the antibody were determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. In vitro degranulation was determined by the release of &#946;-hexosaminidase from effector cells. In vivo degranulation was monitored in human Fc&#949;RI&#945; transgenic mice using the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay. These mice were also used for a vaccination study to determine the in vivo anti-cancer effects of this antibody. Significant differences in survival were determined using the Log Rank test. In vitro T-cell activation was studied using human dendritic cells and autologous T cells.
				
				
					
						Results
					The anti-PSA IgE, expressed in murine myeloma cells, is properly assembled and secreted, and binds the antigen and Fc&#949;RI. In addition, this antibody is capable of triggering effector cell degranulation in vitro and in vivo when artificially cross-linked, but not in the presence of the natural soluble antigen, suggesting that such an interaction will not trigger systemic anaphylaxis. Importantly, the anti-PSA IgE combined with PSA also triggers immune activation in vitro and in vivo and significantly prolongs the survival of human Fc&#949;RI&#945; transgenic mice challenged with PSA-expressing tumors in a prophylactic vaccination setting.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The anti-PSA IgE exhibits the expected biological properties and is capable of triggering immune activation and anti-tumor protection. Further studies on this antibody as a potential PCa therapy are warranted.

Food for stars: the role of hydrogen in the formation and evolution of galaxies
The current cosmological model, the Lambda CDM theory, describes with remarkable precision the assembly and growth of the large scale structures and of the dark matter halos in our Universe. A comprehensive theory for the baryon processes that take place within dark matter halos is, instead, still the subject of active research. The three major ingredients of this theory are known: accretion of hydrogen from the intergalactic medium, star formation, and feedback mechanisms in the form of galactic winds. However, the recipe to blend them together has not yet been found. This thesis focuses on the role that two of these ingredients have in the assembly and evolution of galaxies. The underlying questions that this work aims to address are how the accretion of hydrogen onto galaxies occurs and what the conditions needed to convert this raw fuel into stars are. The instruments used for this investigation are diverse, because of the multiplicity of physical processes, spatial scales, and cosmic epochs involved in the problem. Theory, or more specifically the analysis of hydrodynamic simulations to unveil gas accretion onto high-redshift galaxies, is the starting point for this work. In the second part, spectroscopy of bright quasars is used to probe the physical properties of gas and metals around and within distant galaxies. These observations are systematically compared to model predictions. Deep optical imaging is also used to connect the star formation rates of these galaxies to the gas properties that are measured in absorption. Finally, in the third part, the relationship between hydrogen and star formation on smaller scales is investigated by means of multiwavelength observations of local galaxies. This thesis contributes to the aforementioned open questions in four ways. First, itis shown that the accretion of gas onto galaxies as predicted by current simulations imprints characteristic signatures on the distribution of hydrogen and metals of a particular family of absorption line systems, the Lyman limit systems. Second, new spectroscopic observations that led to the discovery of gas clouds with physical properties that match predictions from simulations are presented, paving the way for establishing empirically how galaxies acquire their gas. Third, through a comparison of the hydrogen content and the star formation rates of distant galaxies, this thesis confirms how the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen is not a sufficient condition for the onset of star formation. Finally, after assessing the validity of star formation models in environments that are common to high redshift galaxies, these findings have been interpreted as inefficient star formation in regions with low gas column density and low metallicity.

Optimized polar-azimuthal orientations for polarized light illumination of different superconducting nanowire single-photon detector designs
The optimum orientations were determined for polarized light illumination of three superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) designs consisting of niobium-nitride (NbN) stripes with dimensions according to conventional devices in 200 nm periodic pattern: (1) standing in air (bare-SNSPD), (2) below ∼quarter-wavelength hydrogen-silsesquioxane (HSQ) filled nano-cavity (DC-SNSPD), and (3) below HSQ-filled nano-cavity closed by a thin gold reflector (OC-SNSPD). Computations showed that the optical response and near-field distribution vary significantly with polar angle φ, and these variations are analogous across all azimuthal angles γ, but are fundamentally different in different device designs. Larger absorptance is attainable due to p-polarized illumination of NbN patterns in P-orientation, while s-polarized illumination results in higher absorptance in S-orientation. As a result of p-polarized illumination, a global NbN absorptance maximum appears in bare-SNSPD at polar angle corresponding to attenuated total internal reflection (ATIR); in DC-SNSPD exactly at total internal reflection (TIR); and at perpendicular incidence in OC-SNSPD. S-polarized illumination results in a global NbN absorptance maximum in bare-SNSPD at TIR; in DC-SNSPD at polar angle corresponding to ATIR phenomenon; while large and almost polar angle independent absorptance is attainable in OC-SNSPD at small tilting.

Coevolution of Supermassive Black Holes and Their Host Galaxies
The role of black holes in galaxy evolution has come under intense scrutiny since it was discovered that every galaxy in the local universe contains a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its nucleus. The existence of scaling relations between the SMBH and its host galaxy show that their presence is not coincidental, but rather that SMBHs and their hosts have a shared evolution. The nature of this coevolution is still debated with some proposing it to be a natural result of hierarchical merging models, while others invoke SMBH feedback mechanisms that couple BH growth with that of the host galaxy. In this dissertation, I examine different regimes of SMBH activity and host galaxy properties. I investigate a sample of post-starburst galaxies to gain insight into the morphological and spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies through galaxy interactions and mergers. I plot detailed comparisons of the galaxy kinematics as measured from different stellar populations. I also investigate post-starburst galaxies that simultaneously host an AGN. I develop a technique to study the properties of both the host galaxy and the SMBH in these objects, directly investigating the scaling relation between the two. I describe analysis performed on red quasars in another study that directly probes the scaling relations in the non-local universe. Lastly, I conduct SED fitting of quasars to illuminate the differences between two major spectral types, and investigate host galaxy properties including star formation. All of these projects focus on the relationship between the SMBH and host galaxy. I show that a range of galaxy interactions can lead to black hole growth and are part of galaxy evolution over cosmic time.

Longitudinally Coherent Single-Spike Radiation from a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission Free-Electron Laser
This work studies the production and measurement of longitudinally coherent, ultrashort pulses of light from a self-amplified spontaneous emission free-electron laser (SASE FEL) by using an energy-chirped electron beam in conjunction with a tapered undulator. This scheme effectively preserves the FEL gain only where an appropriate undulator taper compensates for the detuning experienced by an amplifying radiation spike as it slips forward in the electron beam rest frame. The simultaneous time and frequency-domain measurement of ultrashort pulses of light generated in this manner were made with an advanced transient-grating frequency-resolved optical gating (TG FROG) diagnostic, which has the potential to push ultrashort light pulse measurement at FEL facilities to shorter wavelength regimes.The theoretical framework presented in this dissertation has two components. The FEL theory presented here includes an analysis of the coupled wave and Vlasov equations, which are linearized in the one-dimensional case, and are solved in the frequency domain by the Laplace transform technique. The exponential gain regime for SASE FEL light is explored in detail to clearly identify concepts that are relevant to the energy-chirp and undulator tapering experiment. Some of these concepts are illustrated with fully three-dimensional, time-dependent numerical particle simulations using the FEL code GENESIS for the supportive case of ultrashort, low-charge electron beams. In addition, nonlinear optics, the foundation upon which all FROG diagnostics are built, is briefly explored using two complementary perspectives as they apply to the TG FROG geometry.The experimental section describes in detail the first direct time-domain measurements of a single coherent radiation spike from a SASE FEL amplifier employing the energy-chirped electron beam and tapered undulator technique at the SPARC FEL test facility in Frascati, Italy. Electron beams were accelerated and compressed using the velocity bunching technique, which leaves a residualenergy-chirp in the longitudinal phase space. The energy-chirp was compensated by appropriately tapering individual undulator sections. This process was optimized at a resonant wavelength of &lambda; = 530 nm. The ultrashort light pulses that were generated had a temporal full-width at half-maximum of 98 fs and a time-bandwidth product of TBP &sim; 1.2, indicating that the Fourier limit was nearly achieved. This experiment provides further insight into methods that can be used to shape the SASE FEL longitudinal profile and enhance coherence properties. In addition, the measurements were taken with an advanced, and relatively simple, TG FROG diagnostic that can potentially be used to measure ultrashort UV pulses at FEL facilities.

Image-Based Screening in Vibrio Cholerae: Platform Development, Image Analysis, and Small Molecule Biofilm Modulators
This dissertation describes the development and application of a high-throughput, image-based screening platform for the discovery of small molecules with activity against <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. Like many bacterial species, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is capable of forming three-dimensional biofilms. Biofilm-mediated infections are prevalent in the clinic, and bacteria in the biofilm state are 10-10,000 fold less susceptible to antibiotic treatment than bacteria in the planktonic state. Despite the pervasiveness of these diseases there are no existing therapeutics for combatting these infections, nor is there a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control biofilm formation. In order to address this problem, a wide range of techniques were utilized including high-throughput screening (UCSC Chemical Screening Center), image analysis tools, and structure elucidation methods.	Chapter 1 provides a history of bacterial biofilms, the role of biofilms in human disease, and the existing small molecules with reported biofilm inhibitory activity. The second chapter describes the development of an image-based, 384-well format platform for investigating the effects of small molecules upon a biofilm forming strain of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. The chapter closes with the validation of this assay through the screening of a 5,080 member commercial library. Chapter 3 reports the results from a large scale screening campaign investigating both commercial and marine natural product (NP) libraries. The final half of the chapter details the development of two secondary screening platforms designed for the evaluation of small scale quantities of compound, allowing for characterization of pure natural products produced in low titer beyond the primary screening stage. Chapter 4 describes the discovery, isolation, structure elucidation, and biological characterization of a novel biofilm inhibitor. This compound, previously reported as the chromophore of auromomycin, displays a unique biofilm inhibitory phenotype indicating that the mechanism through which this molecule disrupts biofilm formation is unique compared to the previous compounds discovered using this screening platform.	The final chapter departs from the subject of biofilm inhibition, and concentrates on the effects of a known antibacterial training set and our natural product extract libraries on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> morphology. The development of a novel image analysis platform allowed for the quantification of cellular morphologies caused by compound treatment. The results from screening a dilution series of a set of known antibiotics indicated that the compounds can be binned based on their broad modes of action. This is the first example of a high-content bacterial screen, and has allowed for the mechanism-based profiling of NP extracts with unknown chemical constitution.

The effects of pre-formed plasma on the generation and transport of fast electrons in relativistic laser-solid interactions
In this thesis we present the dynamics of relativistic fast electrons produced in the laser-solid interactions at the intensities greater than 10¹⁸ W/cm². In particular, the effects of pre-formed plasma in front of a solid target on the generation and transport of these fast electrons is studied. The presence of such a pre-formed plasma is ubiquitous in almost all the present short pulse high intensity laser-solid interaction experiments. First, the generation of fast electrons in the presence of pre- formed plasma of varying density scale-lengths is studied with the help of Particle In Cell (PIC) simulations. It is shown that the fast electrons energy increases with the increasing pre-formed plasma, consistent with the experimental observations. The possible mechanism of generation of such energetic electrons is studied. It is proposed that the interaction of plasma electrons with the laser in the presence of ambipolar electric field, generated due to the laser heating, can result in the electron acceleration beyond laser ponderomotive energy. The analytical and numerical studies of this heating mechanism are presented. In the second part of thesis, the influence of pre-formed plasma on the fast electrons transport is studied. Especially the physics of refluxing of these fast electrons due to the excitation of electrostatic sheath fields inside the pre-formed plasma is investigated. It is shown that this refluxing is responsible for the ànnular ring shaped' copper Kalpha x -ray emission observed in the recent high intensity laser- solid experiments

Lightweight Impact-Resistant Composite Materials:  Lessons from Mantis Shrimp
Nature has evolved efficient strategies to synthesize complex mineralized structures that exhibit exceptional damage tolerance. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized hammer-like dactyl clubs of the stomatopods, a group of highly aggressive marine crustaceans. The dactyl clubs from one such species, Odontodactylus Scyllarus, exhibit an impressive set of characteristics adapted for surviving high velocity impacts with the heavily mineralized prey species on which they feed. Consisting of a multi-phase composite of oriented crystalline hydroxyapatite and amorphous calcium phosphate and carbonate, in conjunction with a highly expanded helicoidal organization of the fibrillar chitinous organic matrix, these structures display several effective lines of defense against catastrophic failure during repetitive high energy loading events. The study of this organism and its relatives has lead to design cues, which were incorporated into prototype composite materials designed for applications in aviation, body armor, and entertainment.

The new prophet : Harold C. Urey, scientist, atheist, and defender of religion
During the 1950s, American chemist and Nobel laureate Harold C. Urey began advocating the necessity of a new "prophet" to bring together the inspiring scientific view of the universe with the moral teachings of the traditional western religions. This was necessary, he claimed, because neither science nor society could survive without these moral teachings. Likewise, Urey believed that these religions could not survive if they were not brought up-to-date with scientific progress. This dissertation is a social and cultural biography that examines this turn to religion in light of Urey's religious upbringing in the Church of the Brethren at the turn of the century, his scientific training and rise to fame during the 1910s and 20s, his turn to earth and planetary science after World War II, his attempts at political activism during the Cold War, and his participation in NASA's lunar exploration program during the 1950s and 60s. Urey's turn to religion was not based on a faith in god. He was a self-avowed atheist. This turn was instead a product of two Cold War crises - the postwar trauma of the Manhattan Project and the Cold War trauma of McCarthyism and the loyalty-security system. The first of these crises pushed Urey's postwar research program away from the isotope separation work that had made him famous and into the earth and planetary sciences. The second crisis pushed Urey's public rhetoric away from an optimistic scientific utopianism and hope of a world united under one government. He instead turned toward advocating a new, meaningful engagement between science and spirit. This engagement was difficult to foster, even with the largest and potentially most inspiring scientific projects, as Urey discovered in his work with NASA. Urey's intervention in the "Big Science" of NASA was no more successful than his intervention in Cold War politics. The bureaucratization of science during the Cold War made it difficult for Urey to champion his view of the moon as a cosmogonic Rosetta Stone. Although scientists found themselves better funded than before WWII, their own agency within the new bureaucratic structure of science was limited

Elucidating the Roles of PEX19 and Prenylation in Arabidopsis Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes are organelles originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. Peroxisome biogenesis requires multiple peroxins, including PEX19, a prenylated protein that helps deliver peroxisomal membrane proteins in yeast and mammals. Arabidopsis thaliana PEX19 is encoded by two isogenes, PEX19A and PEX19B. 

I demonstrate that pex19A and pex19B insertional mutants lack obvious abberant physiological phenotypes. I provide evidence that pex19A pex19B double mutants are inviable, that PEX19B is more abundant than PEX19A in young seedlings, that Arabidopsis PEX19 is farnesylated in vivo, and that YFP-PEX19 predominantly associates with what appears to be a subcellular membrane regardless of its prenylation state. I show that farnesyltransferase mutants apparently contain only non-prenylated PEX19 and lack phenotypes that would indicate inefficient peroxisome activity. 

My analysis of PEX19 suggests that PEX19 prenylation is dispensable for peroxisome biogenesis, and has generated tools for future studies of the earliest steps in peroxisome biogenesis in plants.

Central and South Pacific plate tectonic reconstructions
Several aspects of the plate tectonic evolution of the ridge systems and structural development of oceanic crust in the Central and South Pacific basins are investigated. In the South Pacific surveys of magnetic anomaly data and multibeam bathymetry of the Menard and Pitman Fracture Zones, 3̃500 km apart, allowed for significant refinement of the Pacific-Antarctic plate motion history over the last 44 million years. We tested the predictive quality of the high-resolution plate motion model at the southwestern end of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Macquarie Triple Junction and showed that reconstructions predict phases of transform fault motion and extension to great detail. In particular, the most recent period of extension since 10 million years ago occurred when a 1̃200 km long transform fault was replaced an array of 15 transform faults and short spreading centers. The detailed plate motion model for the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge was used to test whether abyssal hill tip curvatures correlate to changes in plate motion direction, which lead to periods of transtension and transpression. The tip of the ridge axis can deflect up to 60° into the transform fault in response to changes in the stress field at ridge-transform -intersections. This is observed to have occurred in particular during periods of significant transtension. In addition, abyssal hill curvatures in the opposite sense are observed to have developed during periods of transpression when increased coupling across an oceanic transform fault is partially accommodated by distributed strike-slip deformation rather than solely by discontinuous displacement at the transform fault. In the equatorial Pacific region, where the total field magnetic anomalies are very small for oceanic crust formed at the North-South striking East Pacific Rise, towed and aeromagnetic vector magnetometer data allowed for better constraints of the relative motions of the Pacific-Cocos Ridge near the Galapagos Triple Junction. These data in combination with available magnetic anomaly profiles for most of the East Pacific ridge were used to improve plate reconstructions for the Pacific-Cocos, Pacific-Nazca, Cocos-Nazca, Pacific-Antarctic, Chile Ridge and Mathematician Paleo-Ridge since 9 Ma

Causation in biology : a biomolecular systems view
Fundamental physical phenomena are studied with a "cause and effect" approach. This enables understanding and prediction by employing mathematically formulated physical laws. Such approaches are less successful in biological systems, since they are subject to dual causation. That is, both physicochemical laws and evolving genetic constraints govern organisms. Biological systems respond immediately to stimuli (proximal causation) against a constant genetic background; however, these responses depend upon evolving genetic programs. Alterations in genetic programs are manifestations of distal causation, representing changes induced by genetic drift and natural selection. Constraint -based reconstruction and analysis is an emerging modeling approach that can account for both physicochemical constraints in biological systems and some evolutionary selective pressures. Here, constraint-based modeling is deployed to integrate disparate data types with genome- scale metabolic models to gain insight into mechanisms in proximal and distal causation, and conceptual advances are presented with respect to how these data are interpreted using constraint-based models. Specifically, these advances are used to suggest mechanisms determining proximal responses with respect to disease progression in human brain metabolism and the regulation of prokaryotic metabolism in dynamic environments. In addition, methods are presented that use genome-scale models of metabolism to analyze various data types to identify determinants of distal causation. Specifically, these methods are deployed to show that the evolution of enzyme specificity is guided by network context and the need to produce biomass. Moreover, these pressures further tune expression levels of metabolic pathways in laboratory evolved bacteria. Thus, through network reconstruction and data integration, vast amounts of data can be queried and provide detailed insight into proximal and distal causation in complex biological networks

Proteolytic receptor cleavage and attenuated endothelial cell response to fluid shear stress in a model for autodigestion in shock
In physiological shock, a leading cause of death, cell and tissue function are compromised. Once proteases enter into the circulation during shock, there may be proteolytic damage to the extracellular components of cells including cleavage of surface receptors and the glycocalyx of the endothelial cells (ECs). The endothelial cell is sensitive to physiological shear stress (typically 10-15 dyn/cm²) and aligns in the direction of the fluid flow. Sheared endothelial cells exhibited a higher tolerance to protease exposure than static cells. Extracellular damage to the endothelial cell by active proteases causes the ECs to not align in the direction of the fluid shear stress; however when the proteases were inhibited, ECs exposed to shear stress could realign with the direction of the flow. Receptor intensity of the mechanosensors VEGFR-2 and junctional PECAM-1 was reduced on both sheared and unsheared ECs. The insulin receptor surface density was also reduced for cells exposed to proteases. In conclusion, proteases present in the circulation during shock may damage extracellular molecular membrane components on the cell and interfere with one of the most basic mechanotransduction mechanisms in endothelial cells, i.e. aligning in the presence of physiological shear stress

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has recently produced binding data for more than 100 transcription factors from about 500 ChIP-seq experiments in multiple cell types. While this large amount of data creates a valuable resource, it is nonetheless overwhelmingly complex and simultaneously incomplete since it covers only a small fraction of all human transcription factors.

Results
As part of the consortium effort in providing a concise abstraction of the data for facilitating various types of downstream analyses, we constructed statistical models that capture the genomic features of three paired types of regions by machine-learning methods: firstly, regions with active or inactive binding; secondly, those with extremely high or low degrees of co-binding, termed HOT and LOT regions; and finally, regulatory modules proximal or distal to genes. From the distal regulatory modules, we developed computational pipelines to identify potential enhancers, many of which were validated experimentally. We further associated the predicted enhancers with potential target transcripts and the transcription factors involved. For HOT regions, we found a significant fraction of transcription factor binding without clear sequence motifs and showed that this observation could be related to strong DNA accessibility of these regions.

Conclusions
Overall, the three pairs of regions exhibit intricate differences in chromosomal locations, chromatin features, factors that bind them, and cell-type specificity. Our machine learning approach enables us to identify features potentially general to all transcription factors, including those not included in the data.

Dual role of autophagy in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis
Abstract
					
				
				Autophagy, the major mechanism for degrading long-lived intracellular proteins and organelles, is essential for eukaryotic cell homeostasis. Autophagy also defends the cell against invasion by microorganisms and has important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Increasingly evident is that HIV-1 replication is dependent on select components of autophagy. Fittingly, HIV-1 proteins are able to modulate autophagy to maximize virus production. At the same time, HIV-1 proteins appear to disrupt autophagy in uninfected cells, thereby contributing to CD4+ cell death and HIV-1 pathogenesis. These observations allow for new approaches for the treatment and possibly the prevention of HIV-1 infection. This review focuses on the relationship between autophagy and HIV-1 infection. Discussed is how autophagy plays dual roles in HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 disease progression.

Quantum oscillations from a two-dimensional electron gas at a Mott/band insulator interface
We report on the magnetotransport properties of a prototype Mott insulator/band insulator perovskite heterojunction in magnetic fields up to 31 T and at temperatures between 360 mK and 10 K. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the magnetoresistance are observed. The oscillations are two-dimensional in nature and are interpreted as arising from either a single, spin-split subband or two subbands. In either case, the electron system that gives rise to the oscillations represents only a fraction of the electrons in the space charge layer at the interface. The temperature dependence of the oscillations is used to extract an effective mass of ∼1 m
      e for the subband(s). The results are discussed in the context of the t2

Phenotypic plasticity in opsin expression in a butterfly compound eye complements sex role reversal
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Animals often display phenotypic plasticity in morphologies and behaviors that result in distinct adaptations to fluctuating seasonal environments. The butterfly Bicyclus anynana has two seasonal forms, wet and dry, that vary in wing ornament brightness and in the identity of the sex that performs the most courting and choosing. Rearing temperature is the cue for producing these alternative seasonal forms. We hypothesized that, barring any developmental constraints, vision should be enhanced in the choosy individuals but diminished in the non-choosy individuals due to physiological costs. As a proxy of visual performance we measured eye size, facet lens size, and sensitivity to light, e.g., the expression levels of all opsins, in males and females of both seasonal forms.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We found that B. anynana eyes displayed significant sexual dimorphism and phenotypic plasticity for both morphology and opsin expression levels, but not all results conformed to our prediction. Males had larger eyes than females across rearing temperatures, and increases in temperature produced larger eyes in both sexes, mostly via increases in facet number. Ommatidia were larger in the choosy dry season (DS) males and transcript levels for all three opsins were significantly lower in the less choosy DS females.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Opsin level plasticity in females, and ommatidia size plasticity in males supported our visual plasticity hypothesis but males appear to maintain high visual function across both seasons. We discuss our results in the context of distinct sexual and natural selection pressures that may be facing each sex in the wild in each season.

Linking Advanced Visualization and MATLAB for the Analysis of 3D Gene Expression Data
Three-dimensional gene expression PointCloud data generated by the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project (BDTNP) provides quantitative information about the spatial and temporal expression of genes in early Drosophila embryos at cellular resolution. The BDTNP team visualizes and analyzes Point-Cloud data using the software application PointCloudXplore (PCX). To maximize the impact of novel, complex data sets, such as PointClouds, the data needs to be accessible to biologists and comprehensible to developers of analysis functions. We address this challenge by linking PCX and Matlab via a dedicated interface, thereby providing biologists seamless access to advanced data analysis functions and giving bioinformatics researchers the opportunity to integrate their analysis directly into the visualization application. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we computationally model parts of the expression pattern of the gene even skipped using a genetic algorithm implemented in Matlab and integrated into PCX via our Matlab interface.

Altering physiological networks using drugs: steps towards personalized physiology
Abstract



Background

The rise of personalized medicine has reminded us that each patient must be treated as an individual. One factor in making treatment decisions is the physiological state of each patient, but definitions of relevant states and methods to visualize state-related physiologic changes are scarce. We constructed correlation networks from physiologic data to demonstrate changes associated with pressor use in the intensive care unit.



Methods

We collected 29 physiological variables at one-minute intervals from nineteen trauma patients in the intensive care unit of an academic hospital and grouped each minute of data as receiving or not receiving pressors. For each group we constructed Spearman correlation networks of pairs of physiologic variables. To visualize drug-associated changes we split the networks into three components: an unchanging network, a network of connections with changing correlation sign, and a network of connections only present in one group.



Results

Out of a possible 406 connections between the 29 physiological measures, 64, 39, and 48 were present in each of the three component networks. The static network confirms expected physiological relationships while the network of associations with changed correlation sign suggests putative changes due to the drugs. The network of associations present only with pressors suggests new relationships that could be worthy of study.



Conclusions

We demonstrated that visualizing physiological relationships using correlation networks provides insight into underlying physiologic states while also showing that many of these relationships change when the state is defined by the presence of drugs. This method applied to targeted experiments could change the way critical care patients are monitored and treated.

Identification and Characterization of the Endosomal Recycling Inhibitor Endosidin2
Protein trafficking through the endomembrane system of plants is a highly dynamic and transient process. Protein trafficking plays a role in several signal transduction and developmental pathways such as gravitropic response, plant pathogen resistance, cell pattern formation and autophagy. One of the most dynamic compartments of the endomembrane system is the endosome. The endosome is comprised on proteins that transit to and from the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi network, and the prevacuolar compartment. Given the highly dynamic nature of this compartment, chemical genomics is a useful approach to slow down trafficking of proteins or inhibit trafficking through specific compartments. Since high-throughput cellular phenotyping is not available in Arabidopsis thaliana, tobacco pollen was used as a model system for membrane cycling to identify putative trafficking inhibitors for Arabidopsis. Tobacco pollen displays polarized growth that is dependent on the delivery and recycling of protein to the apical tip, and tobacco pollen is highly amenable to high-throughput screening. Utilizing tobacco pollen, over 46,000 natural and synthetic compounds were assayed and 378 were found to inhibit pollen germination and/or morphology. Of these 378, 365 were novel compounds. These 378 were then screened on three highly characterized Arabidopsis plasma membrane protein known to cycle through endosomal compartments, the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1:BRI1:GFP, and two PINFORMED auxin efflux proteins PIN2:PIN2:GFP and PIN2:PIN1:GFP. With just these three markers, 129 compounds from the pollen screen disrupted the normal localization patterns of at least one of these proteins. To examine a specific physiological response, these 129 were screened for effects on root gravitropic response. Sixteen compounds were identified as strongly disrupting gravity response. From these, the compound Endosidin2 (ES2) was characterized. ES2 disrupted several specific plasma membrane markers without affecting any internal protein markers, with the exception of the auxin homeostasis protein PINFORMED5, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. ES2 specifically inhibits endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane without affecting endocytosis. ES2 allows for specific interrogation into the effects of endosomal recycling without affecting any other internal compartments as Brefeldin A does, the only other compound known to inhibit endosomal recycling.

The Interconversion of UDP-Arabinopyranose and UDP-Arabinofuranose Is Indispensable for Plant Development in Arabidopsis
l-Ara, an important constituent of plant cell walls, is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. Nucleotide sugar mutases have been demonstrated to interconvert UDP-l-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and UDP-l-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) in rice (Oryza sativa). These enzymes belong to a small gene family encoding the previously named Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). RGPs are plant-specific cytosolic proteins that tend to associate with the endomembrane system. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the RGP protein family consists of five closely related members. We characterized all five RGPs regarding their expression pattern and subcellular localizations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Enzymatic activity assays of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli identified three of the Arabidopsis RGP protein family members as UDP-l-Ara mutases that catalyze the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-Arap. Coimmunoprecipitation and subsequent liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed a distinct interaction network between RGPs in different Arabidopsis organs. Examination of cell wall polysaccharide preparations from RGP1 and RGP2 knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in total l-Ara content (12-31percent) compared with wild-type plants. Concomitant downregulation of RGP1 and RGP2 expression results in plants almost completely deficient in cell wall-derived l-Ara and exhibiting severe developmental defects.

Provenance and Detrital-Zircon Studies of the Mint Canyon  Formation and its Correlation to the Caliente Formation, Southern California
The Middle Miocene Mint Canyon and Caliente formations represent sedimentation after triple-junction extension in southern California. Sandstone and conglomerate petrology, combined with detrital-zircon analysis, determines provenance of the Mint Canyon and Caliente formations. These data indicate that most detritus is locally derived, rather than being derived from the Chocolate Mountains across the San Andreas fault. The Mint Canyon and Caliente formations received Proterozoic anorthosite-syenite-gabbro and Triassic Lowe plutonic detritus from the San Gabriel Mountains throughout their depositional history, but show variations geographically from more locally derived sources, including Pelona Schist from Sierra Pelona.Discriminant analysis of sandstone and conglomerate indicates strong correlation between the Mint Canyon and Caliente formations. Each group for the Mint Canyon Formation (schist (S), volcanic (V) and plutonic (P)) shows a distinct age peak (based on detrital zircons) from a nearby source rock.  The plutonic group has a strong Lowe Pluton signal (220 Ma), the volcanic group has a strong Vasquez and related volcanics signal (25 Ma) and the schist group has a strong Lowe Pluton and Pelona Schist signal (220 Ma and 75 Ma). The Caliente Formation is less distinctive, but shows the same Lowe Pluton (220 Ma), unknown local plutons (150 Ma), volcanic (25 Ma) and schist (75 Ma) signals. All samples show Proterozoic anorthosite-syenite-gabbro and gneiss signals (1200 Ma and 1700 Ma) that are weaker to the west.This study supports the importance of integrated multi-method analyses. Conglomerate petrology, sandstone petrology and detrital-zircon analysis constrain drainage styles of Mint Canyon and Caliente provenance. Independently, each method provides limited provenance information about rock type or age, but together, they demonstrate correlation between the Mint Canyon and Caliente formations, and refine our understanding of source rocks and paleogeography.

Some aspects of the structure and magnetization of the oceanic crust
The structure and magnetization of the oceanic crust reflect its tectonic and magmatic evolution since its initial formation. The magnetization of the crust also provides a record of the polarity reversals and strength of the Earth's geomagnetic field. In this dissertation I first describe absolute paleointensity measurements made on gabbroic rocks collected from the lower oceanic crust of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus. The resultant data-set provides a view into the geomagnetic field during the end of the Cretaceous normal polarity superchron (CNS, 120.6 to 83 million years ago). This data-set is then compared to the locally and globally existing data and predictions made by geodynamo numerical simulations. The results hint that the geomagnetic field had similar properties during times of frequent reversals and times of stable polarity. The second chapter of this dissertation is focused on the marine magnetic anomalies observed across the North Pacific fracture zones. Here I analyze archival and newly collected magnetic anomaly and bathymetric profiles measured across three fracture zones in the Cretaceous Quiet Zone (CNS in age). Forward and inverse modeling indicate that these anomalies arise from remanent magnetization, with enhanced remanence located on one side of each fracture zone. These long-duration enhanced zones require some long-lived asymmetry in crustal construction processes near ridge-transform intersections. The calculated magnetization contrasts provide long-term constraints on the properties of the geomagnetic field during the Cretaceous superchron. Finally, using seismic reflection and magnetic anomaly grids collected in the Adare Basin, Antarctica, I explore the kinematic evolution of the West Antarctic rift system during the Neogene. Correlation of the Adare seismic sequence to the closest drillholes and the Ross Sea seismic stratigraphy establishes the temporal framework of three regional tectonic events. Overall, minimal but significant extensional activity took place in the Adare Basin after seafloor spreading stopped. Comparison of the results with observations from the central and southern parts of the rift system suggests that a major change in plate motion took place in the middle miocene

Kinetics of the Dissolution of Scheelite in Groundwater:  Implications for Environmental and Economic Geology
Tungsten, an emerging contaminant, has no EPA standard for its permissible levels in drinking water.  At sites in California, Nevada, and Arizona there may be a correlation between elevated levels of tungsten in drinking water and clusters of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).  Developing a better understanding of how tungsten is released from rocks into surface and groundwater is therefore of growing environmental interest.  Knowledge of tungstate ore mineral weathering processes, particularly the rates of dissolution of scheelite (CaWO<super>4</super>) in groundwater, could improve models of how tungsten is released and transported in natural waters.Our research focused on the experimental determination of the rates and products of scheelite dissolution in 0.01 M NaCl (a proxy for groundwater), as a function of temperature, pH, and mineral surface area.  Batch reactor experiments were conducted within constant temperature circulation baths over a pH range of 3-10.5.  Cleaned scheelite powder with grain diameters of 106-150µm were brought in contact with 0.01 M, NaCl in a Teflon vessel.  Aliquots of solution were taken periodically for product analysis by ICP-OES.  Changes in mineral surface characteristics were monitored using SEM and EDS methods.The integral method was used to interpret data from experiments and to develop a rate law.  The specific rate for the dissolution of scheelite in groundwater is expressed as:    (dM)/<sub>(sch overall)</sub>/dt =  k<sub>r</sub>(K<sub>sp</sub> - IAP)where k<sub>r</sub> is the reverse rate constant in units of mol/L-sec, K<sub>sp</sub> is the solubility product in mol/L , and IAP is the ion activity product for scheelite in mol/L.  At pH 6.2 and 20<super>o</super>C, the specific rate law for the dissolution of scheelite in a 0.01M NaCl groundwater proxy is:(dM)/(sch overall)/dt = (9.09x10<super>-8</super>)  (2.63x10<super>-10</super>-IAP)The dissolution of scheelite shows variable behavior depending on the pH and temperature.  At low pH, the release of Ca and W is disrupted by the formation and adsorption of tungstic acid onto grain surfaces.  In groundwater with progressively higher alkalinity, W releases at a higher rate.  The reaction also follows typical Arrhenius behavior.  These results suggest that the warmer and more basic the groundwater that scheelite is in contact with, the greater the propensity for an elevated level of tungsten within it.

[rb, phosphorylation]

Structural Studies of Retinoblastoma Protein Phosphorylation
The Retinoblastoma Protein (Rb) is a sentinel of the cell division process.  When phosphorylated, Rb is inactivated and physically releases its protein-binding partner, E2F; a potent transcription factor that up-regulates many of the genes required for DNA synthesis and cell division.  Aberrant deregulation of Rb, either through the loss of functional Rb or the persistence of hyper-phosphorylated Rb, is a common event in the development and progression of cancer.  This study uses protein X-ray crystallography, NMR, ITC and SAXS to characterize three distinct structural changes to Rb that are caused by certain phosphorylation events.  Specifically, we find phosphorylation of S608 induces the formation of a helix within the pocket linker region of Rb, which competitively inhibits E2F-binding.  T373 phosphorylation promotes a docking interaction between Rb's two structured domains; this causes an allosteric change to a critical E2F-binding surface of Rb and dramatically weakens the Rb-E2F interaction.  Lastly, phosphorylation of Rb's C-terminus at S788 and S795 also promotes an intramolecular interaction that destabilizes the Rb-E2F complex.  These three distinct phosphorylation-induced mechanisms provide supporting evidence for structure-based theories of how Rb phosphorylation promotes the release and activation of E2Fs.  A knowledge of these mechanisms is the first step in understanding how Rb may be therapeutically targeted to regain its function in cancer cells.

Molecular diagnosis of putative stargardt disease
probands by exome sequencing
AbstractBackgroundThe commonest genetic form of juvenile or early adult onset macular degeneration is Stargardt Disease (STGD) caused by recessive mutations in the gene ABCA4. However, high phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity and a small but non-trivial amount of locus heterogeneity currently impede conclusive molecular diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases.MethodsWe performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of nine putative Stargardt Disease probands and searched for potentially disease-causing genetic variants in previously identified retinal or macular dystrophy genes. Follow-up dideoxy sequencing was performed for confirmation and to screen for mutations in an additional set of affected individuals lacking a definitive molecular diagnosis.ResultsWhole exome sequencing revealed seven likely disease-causing variants across four genes, providing a confident genetic diagnosis in six previously uncharacterized participants. We identified four previously missed mutations in ABCA4 across three individuals. Likely disease-causing mutations in RDS/PRPH2, ELOVL, and CRB1 were also identified.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the enormous potential of whole exome sequencing in Stargardt Disease molecular diagnosis and research. WES adequately assayed all coding sequences and canonical splice sites of ABCA4 in this study. Additionally, WES enables the identification of disease-related alleles in other genes. This work highlights the importance of collecting parental genetic material for WES testing as the current knowledge of human genome variation limits the determination of causality between identified variants and disease. While larger sample sizes are required to establish the precision and accuracy of this type of testing, this study supports WES for inherited early onset macular degeneration disorders as an alternative to standard mutation screening techniques.

Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Emim+Tf2N?), and a reactive hypergolic ionic liquid, 1- Butyl-3-Methyl-Imidazolium Dicyanamide (Bmim+Dca?), are generated by vaporizing ionic liquid submicron aerosol particles for the first time; the vaporized species are investigated by dissociative ionization with tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light, exhibiting clear intact cations, Emim+ and Bmim+, presumably originating from intact ion pairs. Mass spectra of ion pair vapor from an effusive source of the hypergolic ionic liquid show substantial reactive decomposition due to the internal energy of the molecules emanating from the source. Photoionization efficiency curves in the near threshold ionization region of isolated ion pairs of Emim+Tf2N? ionic liquid vapor are compared for an aerosol source and an effusive source, revealing changes in the appearance energy due to the amount of internal energy in the ion pairs. The aerosol source has a shift to higher threshold energy (~;;0.3 eV), attributed to reduced internal energy of the isolated ion pairs. The method of ionic liquid submicron aerosol particle vaporization, for reactive ionic liquids such as hypergolic species, is a convenient, thermally ?cooler? source of isolated intact ion pairs in the gas phase compared to effusive sources.

Selenium Partitioning and Food-Chain Transfer at the Salton Sea
With the habitat at the Salton Sea, California, expected to decline to conditions unsuitable for wildlife as the Sea shrinks in coming years, efforts are being made to restore this valuable wildlife area.  Current plans involve construction of a series of Species Conservation Habitat (SCH) ponds at the south end of the Sea to replace some of the habitat lost and evaluate options for further restoration.  There is concern for the accumulation of selenium (Se) in the SCH ponds to levels potentially toxic to the birds they are meant to protect.In order to evaluate potential Se risk in the SCH ponds, this study employed a novel selenium modeling approach in which Se concentrations in food web organisms were linked to stable isotope data.  Two freshwater lakes in Imperial County, CA, Finney Lake and Ramer Lake, were chosen as surrogates for the proposed SCH ponds.  Organisms from the aquatic food webs of the two lakes were collected and analyzed for both Se concentration and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition.  Se concentration was plotted against delta 15N for each lake to develop an empirical relationship between position in the food web and Se concentration that was then used to predict Se concentrations in piscivore and invertivore birds.Results provide direct evidence for the bioaccumulation of Se in freshwater habitats at the Salton Sea, but indicate that birds should be at little or no risk from Se toxicity in freshwater systems such as those at Finney and Ramer Lakes.  Even though multiple food web components had Se concentrations above established toxicity thresholds, predicted bird concentrations were either below or only slightly above a widely used threshold for reduced hatchability.

[pseudopod, extension, membrane, fertilization, protein, physiological]

A Physiological Approach to the Study of Pseudopod Extension in the Amoeboid Sperm of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
Fertilization is the process in which both the spermatozoon and the oocyte must undergo a myriad of physiological changes resulting in successful fusion to produce progeny. Spermatozoa are highly motile cells that must reach the oocyte in the environment where fertilization takes place and in this regard the study of acquisition of motility in sperm cells is important to understand sperm-egg interactions. In the case of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fertilization takes place in the hermaphrodite reproductive tract where sessile spermatids must extend a pseudopod to become motile. The process of pseudopod extension initiates with rearrangement of the plasma membrane and culminates with the extension of a pseudopod by an MSP-based cytoskeleton. Thus, successful fertilization depends on the initiation of a signaling pathway that acts on proteins present on the plasma membrane and has as an ultimate target the MSP filament. A genetic model of pseudopod extension suggests the interaction of proteins from the SPE group in a multicomponent complex that regulates the timing for pseudopod extension. This complex of proteins resembles membrane microdomains, regions of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, where membrane and cytosolic proteins from a common signaling pathway interact. In the present work, the presence and involvement of membrane microdomains in C. elegans spermatids is tested. This hypothesis is approached by the use of biochemical assays and microscopy techniques that give useful information on the physiological process of motility acquisition. The results suggest that male-derived spermatids are subject to physiological changes that prevent pseudopod extension prior to ejaculation and that membrane microdomains are present in these cells and involved in successful fertilization of the oocyte through the extension of a pseudopod. Using an integrative approach, these results revealed that membrane dynamics are responsible for the signaling cascade that triggers acquisition of motility, complementing the genetic model of pseudopod extension.

Feather lead concentrations and (207)Pb/(206)Pb ratios reveal lead exposure history of California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus).
Lead poisoning is a primary factor impeding the survival and recovery of the critically endangered California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). However, the frequency and magnitude of lead exposure in condors is not well-known in part because most blood lead monitoring occurs biannually, and biannual blood samples capture only approximately 10% of a bird's annual exposure history. We investigated the use of growing feathers from free-flying condors in California to establish a bird's lead exposure history. We show that lead concentration and stable lead isotopic composition analyses of sequential feather sections and concurrently collected blood samples provided a comprehensive history of lead exposure over the 2-4 month period of feather growth. Feather analyses identified exposure events not evident from blood monitoring efforts, and by fitting an empirically derived timeline to actively growing feathers, we were able to estimate the time frame for specific lead exposure events. Our results demonstrate the utility of using sequentially sampled feathers to reconstruct lead exposure history. Since exposure risk in individuals is one determinant of population health, our findings should increase the understanding of population-level effects from lead poisoning in condors; this information may also be helpful for other avian species potentially impacted by lead poisoning.

[iron, hepcidin]

Disorders of iron regulation and their treatment
In vertebrates, hepcidin is the peptide hormone that homeostatically regulates the body's supply of elemental iron, an indispensible reactant in many biological processes. Worldwide over a billion people are affected by diseases associated with iron imbalance. These conditions can be categorized as disorders in which hepcidin responds physiologically and disorders in which hepcidin is dysregulated. In the former, lack of dietary iron appropriately suppresses hepcidin to maximize dietary iron absorption capacity. Iron-restricted anemia can develop, nevertheless, if the iron content of food is not sufficient. In the latter, inappropriate hepcidin stimulation by cytokines, during chronic inflammation for example, reduces plasma iron and anemia results despite adequate levels of dietary and body iron.Iron absorption depends on the interaction between hepcidin and its receptor, the iron exporting channel, ferroportin. When hepcidin activity is insufficient, iron pathways saturate and excess iron intoxicates the organs in which it accumulates. When plasma iron levels need to be reduced, hepcidin is secreted by the liver into circulation where it finds ferroportin and initiates its internalization and degradation. Plasma iron flow is thus blocked from the principle ferroportin-expressing cell types including, but not limited to, enterocytes, macrophages of the spleen and liver and hepatocytes until an unknown signaling mechanism suppresses hepcidin production to allow iron to flow to sites of need.How the liver moderates hepcidin production in response to increased body iron is still not completely understood, but Chapter 1 of this dissertation, describes the use of mouse models of hepcidin deficiency to define two signals that independently regulate hepcidin production. Chapter 2 builds on a collaboration described in Chapter 3, and details the optimization and use of hepcidin mimetics to treat iron overload caused by hepcidin deficiency. Chapter 4 is another collaboration that elucidates novel signaling pathways that suppress hepcidin and their connection to iron overload in conditions that damage cells of the liver.

How Many Dimensions are Needed to Describe Temperament in Animals:  A Factor Reanalysis of Two Data Sets
Factor analysis has commonly been used to infer the dimensions of animal temperament. However, the results were often complicated by large number of broad and situation-specific factors caused by low psychometric adequacy of the correlation matrices,undermining the assumptions of factor analysis. In this study I reanalyzed the datasets obtained by Royce, Foley & Yeudall (1973) and Gervai & Csanyi (1985) including,however, only the variables with high correlations (multiple R^ > 0.3) and psychometric adequacies (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkinmeasure > 0.5). This yielded more stable andsimpler factor solutions than in the original studies. Specifically, even though the present reanalysiscannot rule out the existence of other temperament factors, it indicates thattwo general dimensions, Activity-Exploration and Fear-Avoidance, are present in suchdiverse species as mice and the paradise fish.

Intracellular and extracellular interactions of the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP-1)
The LDLR family of receptors mediates the uptake of lipoprotein particles, and is essential for cholesterol homeostasis. The LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) mediates internalization of a large number of diverse ligands and is widely implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Clusters of complement-type ligand binding repeats (CRs) in the LDL receptor family are thought to mediate the interactions between these receptors and their various ligands. Apolipoprotein E, a key ligand for cholesterol homeostasis, has been shown to interact with LDLR, LRP and VLDLR, through these clusters. LDLR and VLDLR each contain a single ligand-binding repeat cluster, whereas LRP contains three large clusters of ligand binding repeats, each with ligand binding functions. In order to study smaller units of these ligand binding clusters we have engineered a new approach to express and refold complement repeat (CR) domains in E. coli. This successfully produced high yields of refolded protein with the benefit of inexpensive isotope labeling for NMR studies. We have expressed a subdomain of sLRP3 (CR16-18) that has previously been shown to recapitulate ligand binding to the isolated receptor binding portion of ApoE (residues 130-149). Binding experiments with the ApoE recognition region of LDLR (LA3-5) and CR16-18 showed that each CR could interact with ApoE(130-149) and that a conserved W25 /D30 pair within each repeat appears critical for high affinity. The triple repeat LA3-5 showed the expected interaction with the lipid complexed ApoE(1-191)*DMPC, but surprisingly CR16-18 did not interact with this form of ApoE. To understand these differences in ApoE binding affinity, we introduced mutations of conserved residues from LA5 into CR18, and produced a CR16-18 variant capable of binding ApoE(1-191)*DMPC. This change cannot fully be accounted for by the interaction with ApoE's proposed receptor binding region, therefore we speculate that LA5 is recognizing a distinct epitope on ApoE that may only exist in the lipid bound form. The combination of avidity effects with this distinct recognition process likely governs the ApoE-LDL receptor interaction. Since even the strongest interaction between ApoE(130-149) and a single repeat (CR17) was relatively weak, we constructed a CR17- ApoE(130-149) fusion protein to stabilize the interface for structural studies. The structure revealed a motif seen previously in all ligand CR interactions, in which lysine residues of the ligand interact with the calcium binding site of the CR. Like many ligands of CRs ApoE(130- 149) binds as a helix, but with an unexpected turn at H140. These studies also revealed that little structural rearrangement occurs within CR17 upon binding. In addition, dynamics measurements of the free and bound CR17 reveal that certain regions become more ordered, while others become less ordered upon binding. The cytoplasmic tail of LRP, containing two NPXY motifs, has been implicated in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. To examine the intracellular interactions of LRP, as well as to separate which proteins bind to each NPXY motif and their phosphorylation dependence, each NPXY motif microdomain was prepared in both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms and used to probe rodent brain extracts for binding proteins. Proteins that bound specifically to the microdomains were identified by LC-MS/MS, and confirmed by western blot. Recombinant proteins were then tested for binding to each NPXY motif. The NPXY₄₅₀₇ (membrane distal) was found to interact with a large number of proteins, many of which only bound the tyrosine-phosphorylated form. This microdomain also bound a significant number of other proteins in the unphosphorylated state. Many of the interactions were later confirmed to be direct with recombinant proteins. The NPXY₄₄₇₃ (membrane proximal) bound many fewer proteins and only to the phosphorylated form

A Randomized Trial of Raltegravir Replacement for Protease Inhibitor or Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Women with Lipohypertrophy
Raltegravir (RAL) is not known to induce adipose tissue (AT) changes or severe metabolic perturbations in HIV-infected patients.  HIV-infected women with central adiposity and HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL on ART continued their NRTIs and were randomized to switch NNRTI or PI to open label RAL immediately or after 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was 24-week between-group change in CT-quantified visceral AT volume. Metabolic parameters, anthropometrics, and patient-reported quality of life assessments were also measured. Thirty-six subjects provided 80% power to detect a 10%, 24-week, between-group difference in visceral AT. Thirty-seven of 39 enrolled subjects completed Week 24. No statistically significant changes in visceral or subcutaneous AT, anthropometrics, glucose, or CRP were observed. Significant improvements in total and LDL cholesterol (p=0.04), self-reported belly size  (p=0.02), and composite body size (p = 0.02) were observed in RAL-treated subjects. Body size changes correlated with percent visceral AT change. No RAL-related adverse events occurred.

Occupying the Noosystem: The Evolution of Media Platforms and Webs of Community Protest
This article suggests the emergence of a new dominant ecological system in civil discourse and protest: the noosystem. The idea of a vibrant noosystem is taken from the concept of the noosphere which was introduced near the beginning of the 20th century. The noosphere is a complex, uniquely human system of activity where individual minds use meditational tools to engage in the transfer of information and problem solving activities. The Internet has given the idea of a noosphere new vibrancy, creating a platform where that is capable of augmenting and extending humans minds so that they are capable of engaging in joint activity in ways that transcend traditional boundaries of time and space. The noosystem is offered as a subcategory of the noosphere, an ecological system that not only allows human intellect to guide our perceptions of more concrete settings, but to actually participate in defining and redefining these activity settings. Nowhere has the noosystem had more impact than in the current Occupy movement (exemplified by Occupy Wall Street). This article argues that our burgeoning noosystem is redefining both protest and social change. This idea is illustrated through an analysis of Occupy Youngstown, and Occupy Wall Street affiliated group.

Rheology of silicon carbide/vinyl ester nanocomposites
Silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles with no surface treatment raise the viscosity of a vinyl ester resin much more intensely than micrometer-size SiC particles. An effective dispersant generally causes a reduction in the resin viscosity attributed to its surface-active properties and thereby increases the maximum fraction of particles that can be introduced. This article assesses the rheological behavior of SiC-nanoparticle-filled vinyl ester resin systems with the Bingham, power-law, Herschel–Bulkley, and Casson models. The maximum particle loading corresponding to infinite viscosity has been determined to be a 0.1 volume fraction with the (1 − η
         r
      
      −1/2)–ϕ dependence (where η
         r
       is the relative viscosity and ϕ is the particle volume fraction). The optimum fractional weight percentage of the dispersants (wt % dispersant/wt % SiC) is around 40% for 30-nm SiC nanoparticles, which is much higher than 1–3% for micrometer-size particles. SiC nanoparticles at a concentration of 9.2 wt % (0.03 volume fraction) cause a fourfold increase in the resin viscosity. The addition of a dispersant at the optimum dosage lowers the viscosity of SiC/vinyl ester suspensions by 50%. The reduction in the viscosity is substantial to improve the processability of SiC/vinyl ester nanocomposites.

An expanded model of HIV cell entry phenotype based on multi-parameter single-cell data
AbstractBackgroundEntry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into the host cell involves interactions between the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and the cellular receptor CD4 as well as a coreceptor molecule (most importantly CCR5 or CXCR4). Viral preference for a specific coreceptor (tropism) is in particular determined by the third variable loop (V3) of the Env glycoprotein gp120. The approval and use of a coreceptor antagonist for antiretroviral therapy make detailed understanding of tropism and its accurate prediction from patient derived virus isolates essential. The aim of the present study is the development of an extended description of the HIV entry phenotype reflecting its co-dependence on several key determinants as the basis for a more accurate prediction of HIV-1 entry phenotype from genotypic data.ResultsHere, we established a new protocol of quantitation and computational analysis of the dependence of HIV entry efficiency on receptor and coreceptor cell surface levels as well as viral V3 loop sequence and the presence of two prototypic coreceptor antagonists in varying concentrations. Based on data collected at the single-cell level, we constructed regression models of the HIV-1 entry phenotype integrating the measured determinants. We developed a multivariate phenotype descriptor, termed phenotype vector, which facilitates a more detailed characterization of HIV entry phenotypes than currently used binary tropism classifications. For some of the tested virus variants, the multivariant phenotype vector revealed substantial divergences from existing tropism predictions. We also developed methods for computational prediction of the entry phenotypes based on the V3 sequence and performed an extrapolating calculation of the effectiveness of this computational procedure.ConclusionsOur study of the HIV cell entry phenotype and the novel multivariate representation developed here contributes to a more detailed understanding of this phenotype and offers potential for future application in the effective administration of entry inhibitors in antiretroviral therapies.

Development of Analytical Methods for Trace Impurity Analysis and Structure Determination of Heparin/Heparan Sulfate-Derived Oligosaccharides
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONDevelopment of Analytical Methods for Trace Impurity Analysis and Structure Determination of Heparin/Heparan Sulfate-Derived OligosaccharidesbyStacie Liane EldridgeDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in ChemistryUniversity of California, Riverside, August 2009Dr. Cynthia K. Larive, ChairpersonThe goal of this dissertation is to develop improved analytical methods and approaches that address the difficulties in separating and detecting pharmaceutical impurities and heparin oligosaccharides. The specific methods used were capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet detection (CE-UV), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), with special emphasis given to capillary isotachophoresis-nuclear magnetic resonance (cITP-NMR). The FDA requires structural identification of all pharmaceutical impurities and degradants present at levels &#8805; 0.1% of the parent compound. This poses a significant analytical challenge since these impurities are typically present in trace amounts along with high levels of the parent drug and matrix components. Greater complications arise in the analysis of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). These highly sulfated linear polysaccharides display a wide range of biological activities through interaction with proteins. The enzymatic modifications that occur during biosynthesis for the purposes of cell adaptation and regulation, contribute to the heterogeneity of heparin and HS, making them a challenge to characterize. Progress in the areas of impurity and heparin/HS substructure analysis requires the use of NMR for molecular characterization. NMR is a powerful analytical tool despite its intrinsically poor sensitivity when compared to other analytical methods. This limitation becomes magnified when the structure elucidation of concentration or mass-limited compounds is required. This problem is addressed in this work by coupling microcoil NMR to the pre-concentration method cITP. Microcoil NMR is an inexpensive way to increase the intrinsic sensitivity of NMR, and cITP can concentrate analytes up to 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. This makes cITP-NMR ideal for studying analytes that are mass- or volume-limited. Results are presented illustrating the ability of cITP-NMR to separate and detect charged impurities in the presence of 1000-fold excess of the parent compound. Also, cITP-NMR was used to develop a disaccharide chemical shift database and probe intracapillary pD, providing insight into processes that drive cITP separations. NMR, together with CE-UV and LC-MS, facilitated the characterization of several physico-chemical properties of heparin di- and tetrasaccharides, including functional group pKa values, with the goal of advancing the methods for the separation and structural characterization of heparin and HS oligosaccharides.

Soft X-ray Spectroscopy Study of the Electronic Structure of Oxidized and Partially Oxidized Magnetite Nanoparticles
The crystal structure of magnetite nanoparticles may be transformed to maghemite by complete oxidation, but under many relevant conditions the oxidation is partial, creating a mixed-valence
material with structural and electronic properties that are poorly characterized. We used X-ray diffraction, Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and soft X-ray
absorption and emission spectroscopy to characterize the products of oxidizing uncoated and oleic acid-coated magnetite nanoparticles in air. The oxidization of uncoated magnetite nanoparticles
creates a material that is structurally and electronically indistinguishable from maghemite. By contrast, while oxidized oleic acid-coated nanoparticles are also structurally indistinguishable from
maghemite, Fe L-edge spectroscopy revealed the presence of interior reduced iron sites even after a 2-year period. We used X-ray emission spectroscopy at the O K-edge to study the valence bands (VB)
of the iron oxide nanoparticles, using resonant excitation to remove the contributions from oxygen atoms in the ligands and from low-energy excitations that obscured the VB edge. The bonding in all
nanoparticles was typical of maghemite, with no detectable VB states introduced by the long-lived, reduced-iron sites in the oleic acid-coated sample. However, O K-edge absorption spectroscopy
observed a 0.2 eV shift in the position of the lowest unoccupied states in the coated sample, indicating an increase in the semiconductor band gap relative to bulk stoichiometric maghemite that was
also observed by optical absorption spectroscopy. The results show that the ferrous iron sites within ferric iron oxide nanoparticles coated by an organic ligand can persist under ambient conditions
with no evidence of a distinct interior phase and can exert an effect on the global electronic and optical properties of the material. This phenomenon resembles the band gap enlargement caused by
electron accumulation in the conduction band of TiO2.

Prospective assessment of the gastroesophageal microbiome in VLBW neonates
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The distal GI microbiota of hospitalized preterm neonates has been established to be unique from that of healthy full-term infants; the proximal GI, more specifically gastroesophageal colonization has not been systematically addressed. We prospectively evaluated early colonization of gastroesophageal portion of the GI tract of VLBW infants.
				
				
					
						Methods
					This study involved 12 infants admitted to a level III NICU with gestational age (GA) 27 +/&#8722; 0.5 weeks and birth weight 1105 +/&#8722; 77 grams. The gastroesophageal microbial flora was evaluated using 16S rDNA analysis of aspirates collected in a sterile manner during the first 28 days of life.
				
				
					
						Results
					Bacteria were detected in 9 of the 12 neonates. Ureaplasma was the dominant species in the first week of life, however, staphylococci were the predominant bacteria overall. By the fourth week, Gram (&#8722;) bacteria increased in abundance to account for 50% of the total organisms. Firmicutes were present in the majority of the neonates and persisted throughout the 4 weeks comprising nearly half of the sequenced clones. Noticeably, only two distinct species of Staphylococcus epidermidis were found, suggesting acquisition from the environment.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					In our neonates, the esophagus and stomach environment changed from being relatively sterile at birth to becoming colonized by a phylogenetically diverse microbiota of low individual complexity. By the fourth week, we found predominance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Bacteria from both phyla (CONS and Gram (&#8722;) organisms) are strongly implicated as causes of hospital-acquired infections (HAI). Evaluation of the measures preventing colonization with potentially pathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms from the hospital environment may be warranted and may suggest novel approaches to improving quality in neonatal care.

A yeast phenomic model for the gene interaction network modulating F508del-CFTR protein biogenesis
Abstract
Background
The overall influence of gene interaction in human disease is unknown. In cystic fibrosis (CF) a single allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR-&#916;F508) accounts for most of the disease. In cell models, CFTR-&#916;F508 exhibits defective protein biogenesis and degradation rather than proper trafficking to the plasma membrane where CFTR normally functions. Numerous genes function in the biogenesis of CFTR and influence the fate of CFTR-&#916;F508. However it is not known whether genetic variation in such genes contributes to disease severity in patients. Nor is there an easy way to study how numerous gene interactions involving CFTR-&#916;F would manifest phenotypically.

Methods
To gain insight into the function and evolutionary conservation of a gene interaction network that regulates biogenesis of a misfolded ABC transporter, we employed yeast genetics to develop a 'phenomic' model, in which the CFTR-&#916;F508-equivalent residue of a yeast homolog is mutated (Yor1-&#916;F670), and where the genome is scanned quantitatively for interaction. We first confirmed that Yor1-&#916;F undergoes protein misfolding and has reduced half-life, analogous to CFTR-&#916;F. Gene interaction was then assessed quantitatively by growth curves for approximately 5,000 double mutants, based on alteration in the dose response to growth inhibition by oligomycin, a toxin extruded from the cell at the plasma membrane by Yor1.

Results
From a comparative genomic perspective, yeast gene interactions influencing Yor1-&#916;F biogenesis were representative of human homologs previously found to modulate processing of CFTR-&#916;F in mammalian cells. Additional evolutionarily conserved pathways were implicated by the study, and a &#916;F-specific pro-biogenesis function of the recently discovered ER membrane complex (EMC) was evident from the yeast screen. This novel function was validated biochemically by siRNA of an EMC ortholog in a human cell line expressing CFTR-&#916;F508. The precision and accuracy of quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP), which captures tens of thousands of growth curves simultaneously, provided powerful resolution to measure gene interaction on a phenomic scale, based on discrete cell proliferation parameters.

Conclusion
We propose phenomic analysis of Yor1-&#916;F as a model for investigating gene interaction networks that can modulate cystic fibrosis disease severity. Although the clinical relevance of the Yor1-&#916;F gene interaction network for cystic fibrosis remains to be defined, the model appears to be informative with respect to human cell models of CFTR-&#916;F. Moreover, the general strategy of yeast phenomics can be employed in a systematic manner to model gene interaction for other diseases relating to pathologies that result from protein misfolding or potentially any disease involving evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways.

Improved resolution of hydrocarbon structures and constitutional isomers in complex mixtures
using Gas Chromatography-Vacuum Ultraviolet-Mass Spectrometry (GC-VUV-MS) (Supplementary Info)
Understanding the composition of complex hydrocarbon mixtures is important for environmental studies in a variety of fields, but many prevalent compounds cannot be confidently identified using traditional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. This work uses vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ionization to elucidate the structures of a traditionally "unresolved complex mixture" by separating components by GC retention time, tR, and mass-to-charge ratio, m/Q, which are used to determine carbon number, NC, and the number of rings and double bonds, NDBE. Constitutional isomers are resolved based on tR, enabling the most complete quantitative analysis to date of structural isomers in an environmentally-relevant hydrocarbon mixture. Unknown compounds are classified in this work by carbon number, degree of saturation, presence of rings, and degree of branching, providing structural constraints. The capabilities of this analysis are explored using diesel fuel, in which constitutional isomer distribution patterns are shown to be reproducible between carbon numbers and follow predictable rules. Nearly half of the aliphatic hydrocarbon mass is shown to be branched, suggesting branching is more important in diesel fuel than previously shown. The classification of unknown hydrocarbons and the resolution of constitutional isomers significantly improves resolution capabilities for any complex hydrocarbon mixture.

Copper Transporter 2 (CTR2) as a regulator of cisplatin accumulation and sensitivity
Platinum(Pt)-containing cancer drugs are highly polar molecules that do not diffuse across lipid membranes; thus, their uptake into tumor cells must involve a transport process. Cells selected for resistance to these drugs uniformly exhibit impaired drug accumulation. The copper (Cu) transport pathway has been demonstrated to be responsible for the majority of Pt-drug accumulation and cellular trafficking. The overall goal of this dissertation was to determine whether Cu transporter 2 (CTR2) plays a role in the cellular accumulation of cisplatin (DDP), and if so, whether it influences the sensitivity of cells to DDP. This was accomplished through the study of a CTR2 knockdown model system. It was discovered that the loss of CTR2 protein expression leads to increased DDP accumulation and sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, it was determined that CTR2 is required for optimal tumor growth, as CTR2kd tumors demonstrated increased the frequency of apoptotic cells and reduced vascular density. Once CTR2 was established as a regulator of DDP accumulation and sensitivity, the investigations went on to focus on how CTR2 expression and degradation is controlled by DDP, and Cu. Cu and DDP exposure were shown to increase CTR2 levels. This increase was associated with an increase in CTR2 mRNA and prolongation of CTR2 half-life. Cu starvation triggered rapid degradation of CTR2, which was dependent on proteosomal activity and the status of the copper chaperone Atox1. Consistent with the observations previously made, reduction of CTR2 by Cu starvation also enhanced DDP uptake and cytotoxicity. During the course of these studies, the unique observation was made that CTR2 is partially localized in the nucleus of cells. Finally, the mechanism by which decreased CTR2 levels lead to increased accumulation of DDP was explored. CTR2 knockdown did not change the rate of efflux of or the amount of vesicular DDP. Decreased CTR2 levels, due to knockdown or degradation, triggered the up-regulation of cellular macropinocytosis and activation of the GTPases necessary for endocytosis. Inhibition of endocytosis blocked the increased accumulation of DDP in CTR2kd cells, suggesting that CTR2 limits Pt-drug accumulation through the regulation of endocytosis

Proposal of a critical test of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier paradigm for compressible fluid continua
A critical, albeit simple experimental and/or molecular-dynamic (MD) simulation test is proposed whose outcome would, in principle, establish the viability of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations for compressible fluid continua. The latter equation set, despite its longevity as constituting the fundamental paradigm of continuum fluid mechanics, has recently been criticized on the basis of its failure to properly incorporate volume transport phenomena—as embodied in the proposed bivelocity paradigm  H. Brenner Int. J. Eng. Sci. 54 67 (2012)—into its formulation. Were the experimental or simulation results found to accord, even only qualitatively, with bivelocity predictions, the temperature distribution in a gas-filled, thermodynamically and mechanically isolated circular cylinder undergoing steady rigid-body rotation in an inertial reference frame would not be uniform; rather, the temperature would be higher at the cylinder wall than along the axis of rotation. This radial temperature nonuniformity contrasts with the uniformity of the temperature predicted by the NSF paradigm for these same circumstances. Easily attainable rates of rotation in centrifuges and readily available tools for measuring the expected temperature differences render experimental execution of the proposed scheme straightforward in principle. As such, measurement—via experiment or MD simulation—of, say, the temperature difference ΔT between the gas at the wall and along the axis of rotation would provide quantitative tests of both the NSF and bivelocity hydrodynamic models, whose respective solutions for the stated set of circumstances are derived in this paper. Independently of the correctness of the bivelocity model, any temperature difference observed during the proposed experiment or simulation, irrespective of magnitude, would preclude the possibility of the NSF paradigm being correct for fluid continua, except for incompressible flows.

The Relationship Between Implicit and Explicit Memory in Negative and Positive Priming
Two classes of theories of priming are ones that posit that negative priming follows from Logan's (1988) instance theory of automaticity, and ones that posit ideas of inhibition (Houghton & Tipper, 1994; Neill, 1977; Tipper & Cranston, 1985). One prediction of Logan's theory is that negative priming should be positively related to recognition. The present experiments aimed to investigate the relationship between implicit and explicit memory in negative and positive priming using a hybrid methodology following from work done by Turk-Browne, Yi, and Chun (2006) and Grison, Tipper, and Hewitt (2005). Turk-Browne et al. examined positive priming and BOLD responses to images as a function of later recognition and found greater positive priming for items later classified as old than for ones classified as new. Grison et al. examined priming using a task requiring participants to classify the gender of faces and animacy of objects. Negative priming was not consistently elicited in Ignore-Attend sequences of the current studies, and as such no conclusions can be drawn regarding the explanations of negative priming.

The Science and Technology of Automatable Droplet Lipid Bilayer Platforms
Droplet lipid bilayers have been shown to be robust platforms for studying membrane proteins in a highly controlled environment. They are stable and can be formed using automated fluid handling techniques. Measuring membrane protein activity and compound transport through droplet lipid bilayers, however, is labor intensive, and most often requires technicians to manually insert electrodes into small volume droplets. This problem prevents droplet lipid bilayers from being employed in high-throughput measurement platforms. Solutions employing the integration of droplet lipid bilayer formation and measurement are developed in this work. Refinements allowing for simplified control over the size of droplet lipid bilayers for consistent measurements across arrays of bilayers formed in parallel are discussed. The development of a measurement chamber that allows for continuous solution perfusion of intact droplet lipid bilayers is also discussed. These new techniques for forming and measuring droplet lipid bilayers are tested by measuring the drug dose-dependence of activity from ensembles of human ether-a-go-go related gene encoded ion channel (hERG) reconstituted into droplet lipid bilayers. Finally, an automated microfluidic platform allowing for the optical measurement of passive drug permeation through droplet lipid bilayers is developed and discussed. The methods produced in this work indicate that automated formation and measurement of droplet lipid bilayers is feasible. In doing so, they provide the potential to greatly expand the applications of artificial lipid bilayer research.

Massively parallel DNA sequencing: the new frontier in biogeography
The advent of Sanger sequencing represented a scientific break-through that greatly advanced biogeographic studies. However, this technology has several limitations that have hampered more advanced studies in the field. The development of novel techniques which more fully exploit the potential of Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) to deliver sequence data at a fraction of the cost of Sanger sequencing promises to revolutionize biogeographic studies. Approaches like Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and UltraConserved Element (UCE) sequencing enable the collection of unprecedented amounts of data for multi-locus studies of population genetics and phylogenetics respectively, which in turn can be used for biogeographic analysis. Here we review those and other methods related to MPS, and provide examples of how they can be used in tropical Atlantic biogeography.

This dissertation combines these two techniques by adding the use of wireless communications technology to integrate streaming, real-time GPS data with a dynamically generated, web-based activity survey. In addition, three separate analysis techniques are examined using the results of an informal pilot test. The purpose of these analysis techniques is to weave together the large set of GPS data that can be collected with the much smaller set of activity responses that can be expected. The net result represents both an advance in data collection techniques, as well as a new, peer-to-peer approach to gathering and sharing experiential transportation information, an approach that should be incorporated into future Intelligent Transportation Systems designs.

Guided wave monitoring of prestressing tendons
Monitoring load levels in multi-wire steel strands is crucial to ensuring the proper structural performance of post-tensioned concrete structures, suspension and cable- stayed bridges. The post-tensioned box-girder structural scheme is widely used in several bridges, including 90% of the California inventory. Prestressing tendons are the main load-carrying components. Therefore loss of prestress as well as the presence of structural defects (e.g. corrosion and broken wires) affecting these elements are critical for the performance of the entire structure and may conduct to catastrophic failures. Unfortunately, at present there is no well-established methodology for the monitoring of prestressing (PS) tendons able to provide simultaneous and continuous information about the presence of defects as well as prestress levels. In this thesis a methodology to assess the level of load applied to the strands is developed through the use of ultrasonic nonlinearity. Since an axial load on a multi-wire strand generates proportional contact stresses between adjacent wires, ultrasonic nonlinearity from the inter-wire contact must be related to the level of axial load. The work presented shows that the higher-harmonic generation of ultrasonic guided waves propagating in individual wires of the strand varies monotonically with the applied load, with smaller higher-harmonic amplitudes with increasing load levels. This trend is consistent with previous studies on higher-harmonic generation from ultrasonic plane waves incident on a contact interface under a changing contact pressure. The thesis presents the results of experimental researches on free strands and embedded strands. Finally numerical studies (nonlinear Finite Element Analysis) on free strands are presented

Statistical Performance Characterization and Analysis of Nano-Scale VLSI Circuits
The performance of integrated circuits (IC) is becoming less predictable as technology scales to the sub-90-num regime. Disparate sources of variations stem from the manufacturing process and ultimately translate to a parametric yield loss. To improve parametric yield, efficient algorithms are required to accurately predict the performance of a circuit at the design stage. However, given the high complexity of design and the presence of a large number of correlated parameters that exhibit significant variations, traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method becomes inefficient as a large number of sampling points are required for an accurate statistical description of the circuit response. To mitigate this problem, a novel methodology for statistical performance analysis is proposed by representing statistical processes in a deterministic way to determine the key characteristics of statistical distributions. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to statistical full-chip leakage analysis and capacitance extraction. For statistical full-chip leakage analysis, a general framework has been provided to derive the full-chip leakage currents or powers as closed form functions of process variation parameters. To the best knowledge of the author, this is the first full-chip statistical leakage analysis algorithm considering all types of spatial correlations with only linear time complexity O(N). Furthermore, it is extendable to incremental analysis for even more promising computing speed for larger problem sizes. For statistical capacitance extraction, a 3D statistical capacitance extraction method called StatCap is proposed, in which orthogonal polynomials are used to represent the statistical processes and the analytic second-order orthogonal polynomials are derived from the capacitance integrated equations to give more accurate results without loss of efficiency compared to the linear models. Experimental results show that StatCap is two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed statistical approach and many orders of magnitude faster than the MC. To improve parametric yield, not only efficient algorithms are required to accurately predict the performance of a circuit, but also efficient techniques are highly desirable for chip design. Toward this direction, a novel voltage binning technique is proposed in the last part of the dissertation.  The proposed method makes it possible to predict maximum bin numbers required under the uniform binning scheme, and model the optimal binning scheme as a set-cover problem. To achieve the same yield as the uniform approach, the proposed method can significantly save the number of bins and only takes very small CPU time cost.

Use of Visual and Tactual Cues in Learning of Simultaneous Shape Discriminations by Albino and Pigmented Rats (Rattus Norvegicus)
Albino Wistar, pigmented DA and crossbred (F1) rats were compared in learning of 4 versions of a simultaneous circle-triangle discrimination. On tasks with 3 dimensional shapes, either with both visual and tactual cues available, or without the tactual cues, albino rats performed as well as the pigmented rats. On tasks with reduction of visual cues, (one task with 2 dimensional cues, the other with tactual cues, and reduced 3 dimensional visual cues), the albino group's performance was significantly inferior to that of the pigmented rats. The two types of pigmented rats did not differ in learning on any task.

Sarcospan: a small protein with large potential for Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Abstract
				Purification of the proteins associated with dystrophin, the gene product responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, led to the discovery of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Sarcospan, a 25-kDa transmembrane protein, was the last component to be identified and its function in skeletal muscle has been elusive. This review will focus on progress over the last decade revealing that sarcospan is an important regulator of muscle cell adhesion, strength, and regeneration. Investigations using several transgenic mouse models demonstrate that overexpression of sarcospan in the mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy ameliorates pathology and restores muscle cell binding to laminin. Sarcospan improves cell surface expression of the dystrophin- and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes as well as &#945;7&#946;1 integrin, which are the three major laminin-binding complexes in muscle. Utrophin and &#945;7&#946;1 integrin compensate for the loss of dystrophin and the finding that sarcospan increases their abundance at the extra-synaptic sarcolemma supports the use of sarcospan as a therapeutic target. Newly discovered phenotypes in sarcospan-deficient mice, including a reduction in specific force output and increased drop in force in the diaphragm muscle, result from decreased utrophin and dystrophin expression and further reveal sarcospan&#8217;s role in determining abundance of these complexes. Dystrophin protein levels and the specific force output of the diaphragm muscle are further reduced upon genetic removal of &#945;7 integrin (Itga7) in SSPN-deficient mice, demonstrating that interactions between integrin and sarcospan are critical for maintenance of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and force production of the diaphragm muscle. Sarcospan is a major regulator of Akt signaling pathways and sarcospan-deficiency significantly impairs muscle regeneration, a process that is dependent on Akt activation. Intriguingly, sarcospan regulates glycosylation of a specific subpopulation of &#945;-dystroglycan, the laminin-binding receptor associated with dystrophin and utrophin, localized to the neuromuscular junction. Understanding the basic mechanisms responsible for assembly and trafficking of the dystrophin- and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes to the cell surface is lacking and recent studies suggest that sarcospan plays a role in these essential processes.

Characterizing complex phenotypes in metabolism : an "omics"-driven systems approach
The advent of high-throughput technologies has resulted in an explosion of molecular data. A major challenge is found in interpreting and understanding these different types of data sets at a phenotypic level. Systems biology has capitalized on these technologies by consolidating various types of biological information into structured networks for their analysis and computation. The bottom-up systems biology approach, in particular, has been crucial in providing mechanistic foundations for systems-level modeling in microorganisms, and its extension to eukaryotic metabolism has made it possible to elucidate complex phenotypes in a systematic manner. The work presented in this dissertation describes the integrative use of high-throughput data and genome-scale network reconstructions to characterize complex phenotypes of eukaryotic metabolism. First, the genome-scale reconstructions of yeast and human metabolism are discussed, which provide the contextual basis in which "omics" data is analyzed. Previously developed constraint- based modeling approaches were refined to analyze "omics" data sets, in particular for transcriptomic and metabolomic data. Finally, example applications are presented in the evaluation of physiological and perturbed metabolic states of yeast and human cellular systems. The studies discussed herein are: (1) analyzing drug response phenotypes of human metabolism; (2) evaluating genetic and environmentally perturbed processes in yeast ammonium assimilation; and (3) characterizing the pluripotent phenotype of embryonic stem cell metabolism. The work described in these studies represents advancement towards integrating bottom-up and data-driven approaches to understanding broader "omics"-to-phenotype relationships

Quantitative Brain Electrical Activity in the Initial Screening of Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries
Introduction: The incidence of emergency department (ED) visits for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in the United States exceeds 1,000,000 cases/year with the vast majority classified as mild (mTBI). Using existing computed tomography (CT) decision rules for selecting patients to be referred for CT, such as the New Orleans Criteria (NOC), approximately 70% of those scanned are found to have a negative CT. This study investigates the use of quantified brain electrical activity to assess its possible role in the initial screening of ED mTBI patients as compared to NOC.
      Methods: We studied 119 patients who reported to the ED with mTBI and received a CT. Using a hand-held electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition device, we collected data from frontal leads to determine the likelihood of a positive CT. The brain electrical activity was processed off-line to generate an index (TBI-Index, biomarker). This index was previously derived using an independent population, and the value found to be sensitive for significant brain dysfunction in TBI patients. We compared this performance of the TBI-Index to the NOC for accuracy in prediction of positive CT findings.
      Results: Both the brain electrical activity TBI-Index and the NOC had sensitivities, at 94.7% and 92.1% respectively. The specificity of the TBI-Index was more than twice that of NOC, 49.4% and 23.5% respectively. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the positive likelihood ratio were better with the TBI-Index. When either the TBI-Index or the NOC are positive (combining both indices) the sensitivity to detect a positive CT increases to 97%.
      Conclusion: The hand-held EEG device with a limited frontal montage is applicable to the ED environment and its performance was superior to that obtained using the New Orleans criteria. This study suggests a possible role for an index of brain function based on EEG to aid in the acute assessment of mTBI patients. West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(5):394-400.

Physical controls on episodic nearshore phytoplankton blooms in Southern California
The nearshore and surfzone in Southern California are highly dynamic regions (< 20 m depth), and governed by different processes than water further offshore. As such, these are also unique environments for phytoplankton; affecting the spatial and temporal distributions of chlorophyll a (Chl a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) and nutrient delivery. This dissertation explores the challenges of making Chl a measurements in the turbid surfzone, and presents data from a novel sampling platform designed for nearshore and surfzone measurements. The underlying mechanisms driving Chl a variability over hourly, weekly and monthly scales are investigated. The data presented here was collected during a 4-month field experiment at Huntington Beach, CA during Summer and Fall 2006. Chapter one demonstrates the data errors induced by in situ optical fluorometers within the bubbly and sandy surfzone. A method for data correction is developed, and applied to surfzone field observations. Chapter two describes the sudden appearance at the surface of an alongshore-parallel band of a redtide dominated by the regionally common dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum (F. Stein). The red tide band was mapped in high spatial and temporal resolution using novel instrumentation including a global positioning system (GPS) -tracked jetski. Data from a series of moorings and CTD profiles provide insight into the sequence of events that culminated in the surface red tide appearance. And finally, Chapter three explores the drivers of episodic phytoplankton blooms over the entire four month record. Three pulses of estimated advective and turbulent vertical (NO₃) flux, are found to precede three phytoplankton blooms by approximately 8 days. Chl a predicted from a very simple NP model driven only by the estimated NO₃ fluxes captured the timing, width and approximate magnitude of each of the blooms (r² = 0.49), verifying that the vertical NO₃ flux was a important control on the bloom events

The response of fatty acids and pigments to variations in temperature and irradiance in the Marine Diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana :
In this study, we set out to understand environmental effects on basic cell physiology as well as on the relationship between fatty acid and pigment constituents. Closed culturing environments were applied to grow Thalassiosira pseudonana under a temperature and irradiance matrix. It was demonstrated that the experimental parameters had a profound effect on cell physiology as well as cell biochemistry. We detected an inverse relationship between the expression of fatty acids and pigments from exponential to stationary phase growth; pigments were expressed at the highest concentrations during exponential growth and with the onset of stationary phase growth, there was a significant decrease in pigment concentrations that were mainly attributed to a sharp decline in chlorophyll-a. During stationary phase, changes in irradiance had the most dramatic effect at 18.0°C with 55% increase in lipid concentration from low to high irradiance. This increase in lipids was also reflected in a 20% increase in the average cell sizes from 4.8mum to 5.4mum and a 50% decrease in chlorophyll-a concentrations. Temperature and irradiance also had a significant effect on both fatty acid and pigment moieties. During stationary phase, the ratio of palmitic and palmitoleic acid (C16/C16:1) was closely regulated by both temperature and irradiance. A synergistic relationship was observed for temperature and saturated fatty acids and the inverse was detected for polyunsaturated fats. The ratio of photoprotective pigments to photosynthetic pigments (PP/PS) increased as a function of both temperature and irradiance during stationary phase, increasing most dramatically at higher temperatures and irradiances. These findings were able to give some insight in cellular lipid biochemistry in response to fluctuations in temperature and irradiance

Arabidopsis nonhost resistance gene PSS1 confers immunity against an oomycete and a fungal pathogen but not a bacterial pathogen that cause diseases in soybean
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Nonhost resistance (NHR) provides immunity to all members of a plant species against all isolates of a microorganism that is pathogenic to other plant species. Three Arabidopsis thaliana PEN (penetration deficient) genes, PEN1, 2 and 3 have been shown to provide NHR against the barley pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei at the prehaustorial level. Arabidopsis pen1-1 mutant lacking the PEN1 gene is penetrated by the hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, the causal organism of the root and stem rot disease in soybean. We investigated if there is any novel nonhost resistance mechanism in Arabidopsis against the soybean pathogen, P. sojae.
					
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The 
							P.
						
						
							s
						
						ojae
						susceptible (pss) 1 mutant was identified by screening a mutant population created in the Arabidopsis pen1-1 mutant that lacks penetration resistance against the non adapted barley biotrophic fungal pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. Segregation data suggested that PEN1 is not epistatic to PSS1. Responses of pss1 and pen1-1 to P. sojae invasion were distinct and suggest that PSS1 may act at both pre- and post-haustorial levels, while PEN1 acts at the pre-haustorial level against this soybean pathogen. Therefore, PSS1 encodes a new form of nonhost resistance. The pss1 mutant is also infected by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme, which causes sudden death syndrome in soybean. Thus, a common NHR mechanism is operative in Arabidopsis against both hemibiotrophic oomycetes and necrotrophic fungal pathogens that are pathogenic to soybean. However, PSS1 does not play any role in immunity against the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, that causes bacterial blight in soybean. We mapped PSS1 to a region very close to the southern telomere of chromosome 3 that carries no known disease resistance genes.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The study revealed that Arabidopsis PSS1 is a novel nonhost resistance gene that confers a new form of nonhost resistance against both a hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen, P. sojae and a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, F. virguliforme that cause diseases in soybean. However, this gene does not play any role in the immunity of Arabidopsis to the bacterial pathogen, P. syringae pv. glycinea, which causes bacterial blight in soybean. Identification and further characterization of the PSS1 gene would provide further insights into a new form of nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis, which could be utilized in improving resistance of soybean to two serious pathogens.

Analysis of inflammation-related nigral degeneration and locomotor function in

Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Complex interactions involving genetic susceptibility and environmental
						factors are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of Parkinson&#8217;s
						disease (PD). Although the role of inflammatory processes in modulating risk
						for development of PD has yet to be fully understood, prospective studies
						suggest that chronic use of NSAIDs reduce the incidence of PD.
						Loss-of-function mutations in the DJ-1 gene cause a rare form of
						familial PD with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance; however,
							DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice do not display nigrostriatal pathway
						degeneration, suggesting that additional factors such as inflammation may be
						needed to induce neurodegeneration on the background of DJ-1 gene
						mutations. Neuroinflammation causes oxidative stress and, based on evidence
						that DJ-1 plays a protective role against oxidative stress, we investigated
						whether DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice display increased vulnerability to
						inflammation-induced nigral degeneration.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					We exposed adult wild-type and DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice to repeated
						intranasal administration of soluble TNF (inTNF) or repeated intraperitoneal
						injections of low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline vehicle. We
						measured locomotor performance using a variety of behavior tasks, striatal
						dopamine (DA) content by HPLC, DA neuron (TH+ cells) and total neuron (NeuN+
						cells) number in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental
						area by unbiased stereology, number of Iba1-positive microglia, and mRNA
						levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress genes by quantitative PCR in the
						midbrain, cortex and isolated peritoneal macrophages of
							DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; and wild-type mice.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We found that chronic LPS injections induced similar neuroinflammatory
						responses in the midbrains of DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice and
						wild-type mice and neither group developed locomotor deficits or nigral
						degeneration. inTNF administration did not appear to induce
						neuroinflammatory responses in LPS-treated wild-type or
							DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice. The lack of vulnerability to
						inflammation-induced nigral degeneration was not due to enhanced
						anti-oxidant gene responses in the midbrains of DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722;
						mice which, in fact, displayed a blunted response relative to that of
						wild-type mice. Peripheral macrophages from wild-type and
							DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice displayed similar basal and
						LPS-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in vitro.
					
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our studies indicate that DJ-1&#8722;/&#8722; mice do not display
						increased vulnerability to inflammation-related nigral degeneration in
						contrast to what has been reported for
						1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrindine. We conclude that either DJ-1
						does not have a critical role in protecting DA neurons against
						inflammation-induced oxidative stress and/or there is compensatory gene

The effects of embarrassment on cognition and behavior
Several studies have found that specific emotions can have distinct effects on decision making, however, very few include embarrassment. A few theoretical frameworks have been put forth to understand the effects of emotions on decisions. These frameworks are typically based off of research that investigates emotions that are unrelated to subsequent judgments or choices. This dissertation presents findings that examine the effects of embarrassment on decision making. The results offer an alternative framework, emotion regulation, for understanding the effects of embarrassment on a variety of judgments and choices that are both related (integral) and unrelated (incidental) to the embarrassing situation. Chapter 2 presents data suggesting that incidental embarrassment has distinct effects on risk perception and risk taking compared to anger, fear, and neutral mood states, and that these effects may be driven by attempts to alleviate negative affect. Findings from Chapter 3 suggest that medical embarrassment causes increased perceptions of cervical exam embarrassment and decreased screening intentions without influencing cancer risk perceptions. Data provide additional support for an emotion regulation framework. People tend to choose the route most likely to alleviate negative affect, particularly if it fulfills the motivation of the emotion. Chapter 4 examines the effects of power as a moderator of subjective experiences of embarrassment and disgust. Rather than high power providing a buffer against negative affect, the evidence indicates that power increases negative emotion. Chapter 5 argues that embarrassment has distinct effects on decision making and presents a framework for understanding such effects

Behavioral plasticity in the Zebrafish C-start (escape) response
Vertebrate models of learning and memory are hampered by massively complex neural circuits. Further, the engrams of memory in many vertebrate systems are highly distributed, increasing the difficulty of their identification. Invertebrate models, which possess much simpler nervous systems, have been used to relate neuronal changes to behavior changes. However, these invertebrate models are phylogenetically distant, and are physiologically and functionally different from mammalian systems.  An ideal model to investigate plasticity or memory in vertebrates would entail a simple neural circuit. One such model, the zebrafish, or danio rerio, offers a variety of advantages in this regard. In addition to its rapid development, high fecundity, and ease of genetic manipulation, it is transparent at the larval stage, making future experimentation in calcium imaging readily available. Additionally, the zebrafish contains a simple neural circuit that mediates a simple behavior. This behavior is the c-start escape response (figure 1), which is dependent on large, bilaterally paired Mauthner cells in a well-understood neural circuit. Because of this, the zebrafish model presents an ideal model in the elusive understanding of the cellular mechanism of learning and memory.The purpose of my thesis is to develop the zebrafish c-startle escape response as a new model of learning and memory to facilitate assignment of neural function and structure to behavioral memory. To achieve this goal, I have pursued numerous avenues, the first being to define many of the basic response properties that influence the escape response, in order to enable efficient and rational design of learning assays. Through experimentation, I've determined some of the factors that influence the escape response, such as volume of water, the zebrafish circadian rhythm, and even certain acoustic properties of the stimulus itself (pulse length, frequency, decibel).  Other experiments to discover and describe other factors that may affect the escape response, such as boldness, will also be discussed.A secondary goal of my thesis is to discover and reveal new types of memories in the escape response of the zebrafish, such as sensitization and classical conditioning. Using an alarm pheromone, H3NO, we've managed to sensitize the c-start response, and have also elucidated the phototaxic preferences of the zebrafish. These results will certainly lead into studies on classical conditioning of the escape response, such as association of a neutral stimulus (amino acid water) with the alarm pheromone. Ultimately, these projects should elucidate neural function and plasticity at the M-cell synapse and set the stage for more in depth neurophysiological investigation.

Analysis of the processing body subunits Winnebago and Trailer Hitch in Drosophila melanogaster
To discover new ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components, Trailer Hitch (Tral), a RNP factor involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit site function, was immunoprecipiated and Winnebago (Winn) was identified as a novel Tral- associated protein. Analysis of the Winn sequence revealed a RNA binding motif and conservation with the human cyclo- ligase, methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS). These observations led us to propose that Winn utilizes ATP to catalyze ring closure on RNA 5' caps in a manner similar to that of MTHFS. Experiments included recombinant expression of Bovine Winn protein, purification, and assay for ATPase activity. Despite a multistep protein purification strategy, our preparations were contaminated with low levels of ATPase that interfered with the assays. In parallel with identifying Winn, we sought to identify mRNA targets of Tral. From microarray analysis of mRNAs that co-immunoprecipitated with Tral, orc5 mRNA was identified. Orc5 protein is a component of the Origin Recognition Complex involved in DNA replication and membrane trafficking. Orc5 function in membrane trafficking suggested that it might be a functionally relevant target for the ER defects observed in tral mutants. We examined orc5 mutants for the ability to genetically interact with tral but these experiments did not reveal an interaction; therefore, orc5 mRNA is not a target of the Tral complex. We expanded our genetic screen using the Drosophila deletion collection to identify regions on Chromosome 3 that could dominantly enhance eggshell defects seen in tral mutants. Sixty genomic regions were tested for genetic interaction with tral; however, none of the regions tested interacted

hIws1 structural elucidation and protein interactions
There are a number of nuclear factors that play an integral role in transcriptional elongation. Once such factor is hIws1, a nuclear protein first characterized to bind the histone H3 chaperone, Spt6. Our lab previously showed that Spt6 binds directly to the phosphorylated C- terminal tail of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and recruits Iws1 to control specific events that occur during elongation, including mRNA processing, mRNA export, and histone H3K36 methylation. hIws1 interacts directly with the histone H3K36 methyltransferase, Hypb/Set2, as well as the mRNA export adaptor protein, REF1/Aly. Iws1 is reportedly an essential mammalian protein, but little is know about its structure or functional domains. In the present study, I constructed GST tagged hIws1 protein constructs that were subsequently used in pulldown assays to evaluate its nuclear binding partner proteins. Pulldown assays were performed with either HeLa whole cell extract or HeLa nuclear extract. The Nterminal region of Iws1 (residues 1 through 495) was found to associate with the LEDGF/p75, a protein that has been previously identified to take part in lentiviral genome integration. In addition, I found that the C-terminal region of Iws (residues 522 through 819) binds to the E74-like factor 1 (Elf1). Interestingly, the hIws1 C-terminus contains a novel domain called the LW motif, which is highly conserved in Iws1 proteins from other species, and is also present in two transcription factors, Med26 and TFIIS. To test the role of the LW domain, I created three GST-Iws1 point mutant proteins, which were purified and used in GSTpulldown assays. Two residues (tyrosine-665 and tryptophan-685) contained within the LW motif were found to be crucial for the hIws1- Spt6 interaction. By contrast, Med26 was found to also associate with ix Iws1, but this interaction was not mediated by the LW motif, and Iws1 also binds to the LEDGF factor through a region outside of the LW sequence. Thus these findings identify a new domain that is likely to be critical for binding of Iws1 to Spt6 and assembly of the RNAPII elongation complex

Man-made hydraulic fracturing has been most commonly used for stimulation of oil and gas reservoirs to increase hydrocarbon production, stimulation of geothermal reservoirs, remediation of soil and groundwater aquifers, injection of wastes, goafing and fault reactivation in mining, and measurement of underground in situ stresses.Computational modeling and simulation of fluid driven fracture propagation in realistic geological formation has been a challenging problem because of various complexities including formation heterogeneities and the use of highly nonlinear engineered fluids. At present, one of the main obstacles for the robust industrial application of the simulating technology is the computational efficiency and stability. The objective of this study is to investigate the numerical efficiency and stability of various algorithms that can be potentially used in modeling of fluid driven fracture propagation. For simplicity, we have focused on fracture propagation in the plane strain condition. The fracture is assumed to in homogeneous linearelastic medium and modeled using displacement discontinuity boundary element method (DDBEM). The nonlinear power-law fluid flow is modeled using conventional lubrication theory. The coupled equations are then discretized using zero order elements for its efficiency. The coupled equations become increasingly stiff and difficulty to solve when the power law indices become smaller. Various numerical algorithms such as Newton iterationwith line search, trust-region and quasi-Newton method are investigated and compared. We have also extended the model to the fluid driven non-planar fracture propagation. A numerical crack propagation criterion based on the minimum local shear stress under mixed loading condition is proposed and compared with conventional theoretical and numerical criteria. The new crack propagation criterion provides more accurate and smooth crack initiation paths. Finally we have studied the geomechanics interaction between two simultaneous fluid driven fractures. The results provided some useful inputs for optimal design of multiple stage and multiple fracturing treatments along horizontal wells currently adoptedby the oil and gas industry for the economical recovery of unconventional resources such as shale gas and oil.

Resampling inhomogeneous marked point processes
We investigate methods for resampling inhomogeneous marked point processes, focusing on Poisson point processes. In Chapter 1 we introduce the problem and provide some background information. In Chapter 2 we adapt existing methods for resampling homogeneous marked point processes to the case of one-dimensional inhomogeneous marked point processes data. In Chapter 3 we extend theoretical results such as asymptotic normality from the homogeneous to the inhomogeneous setting. In Chapter 4 we establish the validity of our local block bootstrap procedure for one- dimensional inhomogeneous marked point processes data while in Chapter 5 we compare the performance of the one- dimensional methods. In Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, we extend the theory and validity of our local block bootstrap procedure to higher dimensions. We carry out simulations to test the performance of our methods under varying distributions of points as well as varying dependencies on the associated marks

Reference in action : links between pointing and language
When referring to things in the world, speakers produce utterances that are composites of speech and action. Pointing gestures are a pervasive part of such composite utterances, but many questions remain about exactly how pointing is integrated with speech. In this dissertation I present three strands of research that investigate relations of different kinds between pointing and language. A first strand investigates the relationship between pointing gestures and spoken demonstratives, such as this and that in English. Linguists, philosophers, and psychologists have long noted the pointing-demonstrative relationship but have not yet characterized it with any precision. At the same time, cross-disciplinary controversy about the meaning of demonstratives has intensified. I present findings from two studies using a referential communication task, which suggest that demonstrative use may hinge on pointing in previously unappreciated ways. A second strand of research presents an exploratory investigation of a commonplace but ignored class of pointing: gestures that speakers direct toward their own bodies. An analysis was carried out of body- directed gestures in a corpus of one-on-one interviews, resulting in a typology of three types of body-directed gestures-- self-points, body-points, and body-anchors. Each type is considered in turn, with a focus on basic questions about how, when, and why such gestures are produced. The third strand considers cross-cultural differences in pointing and the question of what motivates these differences. A case study is presented of a previously undocumented facial pointing gesture-- nose- pointing-- used by the Yupno, an indigenous group of Papua New Guinea. Based on examples of pointing and non-pointing uses of the form, we propose that facial gesture is linked to a particular semantic theme, and discuss how this link is both iconically motivated and shaped by features of Yupno language and communicative practice. Together these different strands of research contribute to our understanding of pointing as both a window into processes of conceptualization and a cornerstone of human social interaction. The findings presented offer new insights into the disparate forces-- biomechanics, grammar, conceptual structure, and cultural practices-- that give this cornerstone shape

Strongly correlated electron behavior : superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid behavior in Ce₁-xRxColn₅
CeCoIn₅ has received a great deal of attention in recent years due to its exotic normal state behavior and possibly magnetically mediated superconductivity. In this work, we performed a two-part doping study of CeCoIn₅. First we investigated single crystals with dilute concentrations of several rare earths in the lanthanide series for Ce₀.₉₅R₀.₀₅CoIn₅. Second, in a more extensive substitution study, ytterbium was doped into the cerium sites for a full range of concentrations. For both cases, the synthesized compounds exhibited normal state NFL behavior, Kondo coherence, and magnetic anisotropy. In the rare earth study we found that the suppression of the superconducting transition Tc does not follow the conventional rate of suppression when a paramagnetic impurity is introduced into the system. In the ytterbium study a possible valence transition occurs for the Yb ion with increasing concentrations into the Ce sites. Single crystals of Ce₀.₉₅R₀.₀₅CoIn₅ and Ce₁-xRxCoIn₅ are investigated by means of x-ray powder diffraction, resistivity as function of temperature, and magnetic susceptibility

Spectroscopy and dynamics of amino acid radical intermediates in electron transfer processes
Electron transfer is one of the most fundamental reactions observed in nature. Long-range electron transfer (ET) processes in biological systems often utilize aromatic amino acids as redox-active intermediates. Both tryptophan and tyrosine have been recognized as playing critical roles in mediating ET reactions that are essential to life, including photosynthesis and respiration. In contrast to the tyrosine radical, only a few studies have focused on the elusive tryptophan radical, which can exist in two distinct protonation states. One primary aim of this dissertation is the characterization of neutral tryptophan radicals within a protein scaffold to identify spectral markers of structure and local environment. Emphasis was placed on the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy, which has the capability to provide molecular-level detail but has been undervalued in this field. Azurin, a blue copper protein, is used as a model protein for the study of redox -active amino acids. Two neutral tryptophan radicals in different protein environments (ReAz108W* and Az48W*) were generated and characterized in detail via multiple spectroscopic techniques. The effects of hydrogen-bonding, environmental polarity, and geometry on absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman spectra of the radical were identified. Through this research, a spectroscopic library was established that correlates radical spectral parameters to local environment and structure. Rapid-flow mixing to generate the tryptophan cation radical enabled resonance Raman characterization of that species for the first time. Furthermore, a quantitative model for the photophysics of tryptophan radicals was developed. Study of the Az48W* radical revealed the ability of tryptophan to act as an excited-state reducing agent. Electron and proton transfer pathways within the protein were proposed and have begun to be probed using multiple techniques. Additionally, a related azurin variant was shown to demonstrate multistep ET between tryptophan, tyrosine, and the copper center on the sub-microsecond timescale. This system was investigated spectroscopically and biochemically to identify specific interactions that mediate these ET processes. It was found that the rapid proton-coupled electron transfer from tyrosine relies on intramolecular proton transfer to a nearby glutamate residue. These results have implications for understanding native systems and engineering multistep ET pathways within other proteins

[formality, theory, gtof, general, formal]

A general theory of formality
"Form" is one of the first concerns of philosophy, though its centrality to philosophy has somewhat faded. However, in the last few decades it has reemerged as a central idea in a particular area of philosophy -- the demarcation of "logicality." I show that it should be of concern more broadly. As invariance, the underlying principle used to characterize logical formality, is not itself essentially logical, important questions arise. Can invariance be used to characterize other formal theories? Can it furthermore form the basis of a contemporary, general theory of formality? I develop and advocate for just such a general theory of formality (GTOF). This GTOF is based on a notion of invariance which is completely generalized -- it consists simply of the stability of features under functional mappings in a given domain. Different domains and functional mappings give rise, then, to different types of formality. In advocating the view, I show that the GTOF has promise for an acceptable combination of adequacy -- it does minimal damage to intuitions about formality -- and usefulness. I first show that the GTOF rules geometrical theories to be formal. This is followed by an examination of standard first order logic, which illuminates the possibility that a close correlation between syntactic and semantic formalities may be distinctive of formal languages. This is bolstered by an examination of a number of programming languages and methods. Finally, some deeper consequences of the GTOF are examined and its association to other philosophical theories is explored. The general theory of formality I develop is a promising candidate to fill a gap in existing theory. Not only does it do justice to some of our deepest intuitions about formality, but it sheds light on important relationships between formal systems that have not been previously recognized

Warming Intravenous Fluids for Improved Patient Comfort in the Emergency Department: A Pilot Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to test if intravenous (IV) fluids warmed to body temperature are associated with greater patient comfort than room temperature IV fluids in adult emergency department (ED) patients.
      
         Methods: This was a pilot double-blind, crossover, randomized controlled trial. Enrolled subjects sequentially received boluses of body temperature (36ºC) and room temperature (22 ºC) IV fluid, with the order of boluses randomized. Each subject’s level of discomfort was assessed prior to and after each bolus, using a 10 cm visual analog scale (Discomfort VAS), with higher scores indicating greater discomfort. We calculated the change in Discomfort VAS score associated with body temperature IV fluid (ΔVASbody) and room temperature IV fluid (ΔVASroom) by subtracting the score reported before the bolus from the score reported after that bolus. We compared changes in Discomfort VAS score with body temperature and room temperature IV fluid using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test.
      
         Results: Twenty-seven subjects were included. Treatment with body temperature IV fluid was associated with a significant decrease in discomfort (median ΔVASbody: -0.7 cm; interquartile range (IQR): -4.5 cm to +0.4 cm) compared to room temperature IV fluid (median ΔVASroom: +1.2 cm; interquartile range: -0.1 cm to + 3.6 cm) (P = 0.001).
      
         Conclusion: In this small trial of adult ED patients, infusing IV fluids warmed to body temperature was associated with improved comfort compared to standard, room temperature IV fluids. West J Emerg Med. 2013;14(5):542–546.

Diamidodipyrrins as BODIPY dyes and chelator fragment libraries to identify new scaffolds for metalloprotein inhibitors
The thesis presented here is split between two distinct projects. The first project explores the synthesis and photophysical evaluation of a new class of BODIPY dyes with handles for functionalization. These dyes may be easily modified for use in biological systems. The BODIPY dyes were synthesized by simple modifications of reported procedures and were evaluated using luminescence and UV- visible spectroscopy. An X-ray diffraction crystal structure and ¹⁹F NMR data indicate that these dyes are rigidified by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The second project is directed towards studying the utility of a chelator fragment library in indentifying new metal- binding groups for metalloprotein inhibitors. The chelator fragment library was screened at high concentration in cell-free bioassays against several types of metalloenzymes to yield several new metal-binding scaffolds that result in significant enzyme inhibition. One of these scaffolds was synthetically elaborated at multiple positions to demonstrate the effect of the chelator in a fragment growth strategy

Exploring the Texture of Ocean-Atmosphere Redox Evolution on the Early Earth
The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis has dramatically reshaped the chemistry of the surface Earth, and the presence of significant quantities of O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and ocean now drives the fundamental dynamics of nearly all quantitatively significant biogeochemocal cycles (C, S, P, N, Fe). Whether by direct consumption through the metabolic demands of large, complex organisms, or through the recycling of essential substrates within microbial ecosystems, biologically produced O<sub>2</sub> provides nearly all of the compounds used in metabolic electron transfer on a global scale. Although it is widely accepted that the partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere has increased through time (with attendant, although somewhat complex, changes in ocean ventilation), there is still much debate surrounding the timing of the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and little is known about the detailed tempo and mode with which this metabolic innovation came to shape early Earth surface chemistry.	This dissertation explores the early oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere and the relationship between atmospheric oxygen levels and ocean ventilation from a variety of perspectives. First, empirical data based on an integrated suite of paleoredox proxies is used to suggest that biological oxygen production emerged and began exerting significant effects on Earth surface chemistry at least 100 million years prior to the initial accumulation of large quantities of O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere (often referred to as the "Great Oxidation Event", approximately 2.4 billion years ago). The implications of this time lag between metabolic innovation and large-scale biogeochemical reorganization are explored through a series of quantitative models, focusing on the thermodynamics and kinetics of mineral reactions under various Earth surface conditions, regional oceanographic modeling of surface ocean O<sub>2</sub>  cycling, and a global sulfur isotope mass balance model that explicitly incorporates rare sulfur isotope systematics (<super>33</super>S, (<super>36</super>S) and the dynamics of sedimentary recycling on long timescales. Finally, the dynamics of ocean ventilation following the initial accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere are explored by combining a large trace metal database with a spatially explicit mass balance model that exploits the differing redox behavior and surface cycling of molybdenum (Mo) and chromium (Cr).

Ylides: Stabilization of Novel, Low Valent Carbon-Based Ligands with Applications in Catalysis
The ylide has found practical applications in synthesis for many years, especially in the creation of carbon-carbon double bonds by way of the Wittig reaction. However, this work is concerned with new applications of ylides, especially the unique stabilization powers of phosphorus and nitrogen ylides. While the species reported in this dissertation are fundamentally interesting they are also directed toward synthetically useful applications. The first such species reported herein is the first phosphorus-sulfur bis-ylide, an analog of the well know carbodiposphorane, and has coordination behavior that is similar. This type of species could be a valuable reagent to do tandem olefination and epoxidation reactions on aldehydes or ketones.A major part of this work is directed at using ylides to create stable carbon based ligands for homogeneous catalysis. A stable cyclic(amino)(bis)ylide carbene is the first example. The carbenic carbon itself is part of a formal nitrogen ylide, which is further stabilized by one anionic carbon of a phosphorus bis-ylide. The other anionic carbon remains free to coordinate transition metals creating very stable bidentate complexes.The largest portion of this dissertation is focused on the synthesis and ligand behavior of the first stable, fully characterized cyclic vinylidenephosphorane. Once again the special properties of ylides, specifically phosphorus ylides are on display as only one phosphorus stabilizes the low valent carbon center. This new species is a very strong donor for late transition metals, stronger than phosphines and carbenes. As such it is an ideal ligand for numerous catalytic reactions. Two new catalysts using this ligand are made and successfully used in olefin metathesis and hydroamination reactions, respectively.The final portion focuses on the use of N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs) to stabilize a propadienylidene, a valence isomer of cyclopropenylidene. While the free species alluded synthesis several adducts are stable including a silver complex that can be used in transmetallation reaction.

Regulation of apical-basal patterning during Arabidopsis thaliana embryo development
The formation of the apical-basal axis during Arabidopsis thaliana embryogenesis is a crucial step that directs the overall body plan of the seedling and directs the establishment of stem cell populations at either end of the embryo that give rise to all of the adult structures. The establishment of the apical-basal axis occurs with the first division of the zygote and remains plastic until the transition stage, where apical-basal polarity becomes fixed. The molecular mechanisms and genes responsible for the formation and fixation of the apical-basal axis remain largely unknown. This dissertation describes the advances made toward the elucidation of two major pathways that contribute to the formation and fixation of the apical- basal axis. Transcriptional repression plays a major role in developmental processes in general and this dissertation describes the role of the TOPLESS (TPL) gene in repression of the basal embryonic gene program in the developing apical domain of the embryo. We provide a framework for the function of TPL in transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. Furthermore, we show that the PLETHORA (PLT) family of transcription factors are direct targets for TPL mediated repression and necessary for the shoot to root transformation seen in the tpl-1 mutant. Secondly, using the tpl-1 mutant as a tool for forward genetics, the HD-ZIP Class III transcription factor family members are identified as determinants of apical fate in the globular stage embryo. Additionally, the HD-ZIP III genes are shown to have a mutually antagonistic relationship with the PLT gene family. Lastly, we show that the HD-ZIP III genes are true apical determinants and able to cause a homeotic conversion of the basal pole to a second apical pole

Optical studies on cell division (Mitosis)
Mitosis is the process by which cells, after having duplicated their DNA content, segregate chromosomes equally into two identical daughter cells. Mitosis is a very short part of a normal cell cycle (usually 24+hours) and ranges from 30 minutes to an hour depending on cell type and environmental conditions. During this incredibly short amount of time, the cell undergoes several complex re-arrangements, biomechanically and biochemically. Microtubules, 20 nm width dimer polymers, play an essential role as the building blocks that provides the cytoskeleton and mitotic spindle for the cell, provide the force that segregates chromosomes (anaphase), to satisfaction of tension and attachment based checkpoints (metaphase-anaphase transition). To elucidate the key role microtubules have in mitosis, drugs such as taxol and nocodazole have been used to impart catastrophic global damage to the mitotic spindle and study the effects on cellular division. However, catastrophic global damage can not answer specific questions regarding highly spatially localized damage and temporally transient damage. In elucidating the role of microtubules, chromosomes and other key biological structures, there is the need for a transient perturbation on the mitotic process. To study the effects of transient perturbation on mitosis, a Laser microscope system (Robolase) was developed to deliver spatially localized (0̃.4 um) and temporally-specific disruption inside living cells (nanosurgery). Specifically, the affect of ablating chromosome tips, mitotic spindles, and chromatid are examined, and the relationship between damaged sites and pathways controlling the progression of the cell cycle and DNA damage pathways are examined. In conclusion, an optically based method for studying mitosis with transient perturbation has been developed and used to determine that chromosome tip disruption affects cytokinetic progression, prolonged disruption of mitotic spindle reveals force sensing in the metaphase spindle, and double-strand breaks of DNA recruit CENP-A in addition to known DNA damage proteins

None of the Aebuster1 mutants were found to have increased transposition activity however several mutants had altered target site specificity. One <italics>piggyBac<italics> mutant <italics>hyPBase<italics>, which has been shown to have increased activity in HeLA cells, mouse somatic cells and yeast, was studied in-depth. My study determined that hyPBase does not maintain its increased activity in Dipteran systems and significantly increases sterility rates when compared to wild type <italics>piggyBac<italics>. The second half of the thesis focuses on investigating the piRNA system in the important disease vector <italics>Ae. aegypti<italics>. The piRNA pathway is a Dicer independent small RNA pathway believed to be responsible for transposon control.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide shapes photic communication across the circadian visual system
Circadian rhythms affect human health and well-being by temporally organizing biological processes and fitting them to a 24 hour period. In mammals, circadian rhythm generation and organization are regulated by oscillatory networks in the heterogeneous suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Acute light resets the phase of these networks at night by an incompletely understood mechanism that involves changes in the transcriptional status of the immediate early gene c-fos and the clock gene Per1 in individual SCN cells. Neuropeptides, which anatomically define the SCN's functionally distinct core and shell subregions, have also emerged as important players in this light response pathway. The following set of studies examines how one such neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), contributes to the gene expression changes across the SCN network during a successful phase shift. Experiments show that in response to a phase shifting light pulse, mice genetically deficient in VIP: 1) have acute, blunted molecular responses of c-FOS and Per1 in the SCN, 2) do not sustain gene expression changes in c-FOS and Per1 across SCN cells over time, and 3) lack gene expression changes of c-FOS and Per1 specifically in the SCN shell. Because these effects of VIP may be either acute or chronic due to an organizational or developmental role for VIP, experiments were also carried out to identify anatomical changes in the SCN of mice genetically deficient in VIP.  Results suggest that specific changes to the light-input side of the circuit are altered when VIP is absent, indicating an organizational role for this neuropeptide. These changes include increased retinal afferent terminal branching and decreased androgen receptor expression in the retino-recipient region of the SCN. Interestingly, there did not appear to be changes in intra-SCN connectivity in mice lacking VIP, as determined by analysis of Golgi impregnated neurons. These data together suggest that VIP acts not only acutely to affect photic signaling,  but it also plays a role in the structuring of the SCN to allow for the efficient flow of photic phase resetting information from retinal inputs across the circadian system.

Here we report the bipolar doping of GaN1-xAsx with high As content to conductivities above 4 S/cm at room temperature using Mg or Te. The carrier type was confirmed by thermopower measurements.

Atomic scale studies of interface formation between oxides and III-V semiconductor surfaces
The surface reconstructions of InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) were investigated at 300 K and 80 K. At 300 K, the surfaces reconstruct to form the group III rich beta3'(4 x 2) reconstructions and at 80 K, the surfaces reconstruct to form the beta3'(4 x 4) reconstruction. A novel hybridization scheme is required for these reconstructions. Oxidation of the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface by O₂ was studied and it was determined that this occurs via an autocatalytic process, displacing surface As. Oxidation is initiated on the group III rows of the surface, but the autocatalysis is in competition with a thermodynamic stability that limits the size of oxidation sites in the low coverage regime. Two methods for the formation of an interface between the high-&kappa; dielectric, HfO₂ on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) were examined: reactive oxidation of Hf metal by O₂ and electron beam deposition of HfO₂. Reactive oxidation of Hf metal is problematic, but e⁻ beam deposition of HfO₂ showed that the p-type pinning behavior of In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) can be at least partially removed. Several oxygen atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursors were studied for the reaction (ALD initiation step) of high-kappa oxide growth on the InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface : water, hydrogen peroxide, and isopropyl alcohol. All of these O precursors showed displacement reactions occurring on the III-V surfaces, but proceeded to varying degrees and by different pathways. Water displaces As, but does not fully oxidize it, HOOH etches the semiconductor surface at all temperatures, and isopropyl alcohol shows chemisorption site selectivity at 100 ⁰C. The reaction of the ALD precursor, trimethyl aluminum (TMA) on InAs(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) was studied. An ordered, self-terminating single monolayer reaction occurs in the high coverage regime on both semiconductor surfaces. The p -type pinning behavior observed on the clean In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(0 0 1)-(4 x 2) surface is removed upon formation of the TMA-induced reaction; the surface was passivated for Al₂O₃ growth via metal-first ALD initiation. The major surface analytical techniques used were scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

Thermodynamic Signatures of Half-Quantum Vortices in p+ip Josephson Junction Arrays
A very interesting type of excitation in a chiral p-wave superconductor is a half-quantum vortex. As the name suggests, a half-quantum vortex carries half of a superconducting flux quantum, and are only possible in superconductors with spin-triplet pairing. An astonishing feature of these excitations is the presence of topologically protected Majorana zero modes. Single half-quantum vortices were recently discovered (J. Jang et al, Science <bold>331</bold>(6014): 186-188) in superconducting mesoscopic rings made of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>, yet to this date they have not been observed in macroscopic samples. We propose a method for detecting half-quantum vortices in Josephson junction arrays, which could host a large number of these vortices. Contrary to a 3D setting, we argue that half-quantum vortices can be energetically preferable in quasi-2D chiral spin-triplet superconductors. As a result, half-quantum vortices rather than full vortices could drive a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition (which manifests itself as a resistive transition). We propose to look for their signatures by comparing transition temperatures in <italic>p+ip</italic> Josephson junction arrays in a transverse magnetic field in both unfrustrated and frustrated cases.

Control of structure and reactivity by ligand design : applications to small molecule activation by low-valent uranium complexes
The ability of uranium to support multiple oxidation states, achieve various coordination numbers combined with the highly reducing nature of the U(III) ion makes this metal a great candidate for small molecule activation. The challenge lies in designing the appropriate ligand that can stabilize a highly reactive uranium center while simultaneously promoting activation and functionalization of small molecules in a controlled manner. Presented herein are the syntheses of two new ligand systems for uranium coordination chemistry. The effects of different ligand environments on the reactivity of trivalent uranium complexes toward small molecules are investigated. The U(III) complexes containing triazacylononane tris- aryloxide ligands ((R/ArO)₃/tacn)U (R = t-Bu, Ad) were found to stabilize charge-separated species with radical anionic ligands. Isolation of uranium ketyl radical complex, ((t-Bu/ArO₃/tacn)UIV(OC*t-Bu/Ph₂), was achieved through a one-electron reduction of di-tert-butyl benzophenone with ((t-Bu/ArO₃/tacn)U. One-electron reduction of diphenyldiazomethane by ((Ad/ArO)₃/tacn)U generated a highly reactive charge-separated intermediate species ((((Ad/ArO)₃/tacn)U(Eta²-NNCPh₂)⁺+С that underwent C--H activation, N-insertion, and H₂ elimination to yield the uranium indazole complex ((Ad/ArO)₃/ tacn)U(Eta²-3-phen(Ind)). A comparatively bulkier diamantyl functionalized ligand system was developed and the reactivity of the corresponding U(III) precursor complex was investigated. The molecular structures obtained for ((Dia/ArO₃/tacn)U(Cl) and ((Dia/ArO₃/ tacn)U(NTMS) revealed a much deeper coordination cavity than in those of corresponding uranium complexes supported by the tert-butyl and adamantyl ligand systems. The deeper hydrophobic pocket is potentially advantageous for activation and functionalization of alkanes. A highly reactive trivalent uranium complex was also prepared supported by a more flexible single N-anchored ligand, ((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U. This U(III) complex is reactive towards a wide range of substrates. For instance, reductive cleavage of CO₂ was observed to form bridging carbonate complex {((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U}₂/Mu-Eta¹:Kappa²/-CO₃). A rare transformation involving reductive coupling of CS₂ was achieved generating uranium thiooxalate complex {((Ad /ArO)₃/N)U}₂/Mu-Kappa²:Kappa²-C₂S₄). Activation of organic azides such as azidotrimethylsilane yielded ((Ad/ ArO)₃/N)U(N₃) and ((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U(NTMS). Uranium mesitylimide complex ((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U(NMes) can also be synthesized from activation of mesityl azide. The trivalent uranium complex ((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U can also activate chalcogenides such as elemental sulfur and selenium to form bridging chalcogenide complexes of the type {((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U}₂/Mu-E), E = S, Se. In the presence of Na/Hg, Na₂{((Ad/ArO)₃/N)U}₂/Mu-E)₂-type complexes, E = S, Se, Te were also obtained

Investigations into the Role of TAF1-mediated Phosphorylation in Gene Regulation
In response to cellular stresses, the transcription factor p53, a tumor suppressor, controls cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or senescence by modulating the expression of target genes. Phosphorylation of p53 at threonine-residue 55 (p53-Thr55) by the TBP-associated factor 1 (TAF1), a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID, suppresses the interaction of p53 with target genes and promotes nuclear export of p53, resulting in degradation of p53 and G1 cell cycle progression.  TAF1-mediated p53-Thr55 phosphorylation in response to UV damage or high glucose (HG) treatment terminates the transcription of p21, an important regulator of G1 progression.   In Chapter 2, as a first step to identify additional p53 target genes regulated by TAF1-mediated p53-Thr55 phosphorylation through genome-wide transcription and protein-DNA interaction assays, I recapitulated the HG-induced, TAF1-, and p53-dependent repression of p21 and confirmed the conditions under which maximal repression of p21 can be observed.  Furthermore, my preliminary results suggest that HG can alter p53 protein levels in response to UV damage and provide a model for how HG increases the cancer risk of diabetics.In Chapter 3, I collected lists of p53- and TAF1- target genes, and HG-regulated genes via bioinformatics. I identified a set of genes commonly activated in response to different stress conditions: 12 p53-activated and 11 p53-repressed TAF1 target genes differentially expressed by HG, suggesting that these genes are regulated via TAF1-mediated p53-Thr55 phosphorylation.  Furthermore, I describe a number of transcription factors representing putative targets for regulation via TAF-mediated phosphorylation.In Chapter 4, I describe tools to further investigate the relationship between TAF1 and p53. A 2x3'BS p21-LUC construct shall allow discernment of the role of different p53 DNA binding sites in the differential recruitment of TAF1 by DNA bound p53.  Two TAF1 kinase mutant expression constructs shall facilitate the future elucidation of the TAF1 kinase domain responsible for p53-Thr55 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic>.  Finally, my preliminary results suggest that the p53 target gene <italic>NOXA</italic> is regulated via TAF1-mediated p53-Thr55 phosphorylation in response to UV, indicating that TAF1-mediated phosphorylation of p53-Thr55 may be involved in regulating the expression of a subset of p53 target genes.

Synthesis and Characterization of Metal-Oxide Composite  Materials for Permanent Magnetic Applications
State of the art magnets depend heavily on the use of rare-earth materials and cost 10 to 20 times more than other magnets such as ferrite magnets, per weight. In addition, the global supply of crucial rare-earth elements is uncertain, causing a real threat to the magnetic industry. Effective use of exchange coupling between hard and soft magnetic materials could decrease reliance on rare-earth based magnetic materials and lower the cost of high performance permanent magnets. Despite the promise, engineering a composite permanent magnetic material with enhanced magnetic properties as a result of exchange coupling has been an elusive goal. Research described in this thesis centers on the synthesis and characterization of metal-oxide 3D bulk composite materials for permanent magnetic applications. Samples were densified from powders using the Current Activated Pressure Assisted Densification (CAPAD) apparatus. A range of samples with densities as high as 97% relative density have been synthesized in relatively short times (~10 minutes). Samples have been shown through X-ray diffraction (XRD) to contain desired composition, and are indeed hard and soft magnetic composites. The applied pressure has been shown to play a significant role in increasing density and in turn improving the magnetic properties. Enhanced magnetic saturation of the composite material, as compared to the mass dominant hard phase has been observed.

Induction of IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES) in human respiratory epithelial (A549) cells by clinical isolates of respiratory syncytial virus is strain specific
AbstractBackgroundRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major respiratory pathogen of infants and young children. During each seasonal epidemic, multiple strains of both subgroup A and B viruses circulate in the community. Like other RNA viruses, RSV genome replication is prone to errors that results in a heterogeneous population of viral strains some of which may possess differences in virulence. We sought to determine whether clinical isolates of RSV differ in their capacity to induce inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CCL5 (previously known as RANTES regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted protein), which are known to be induced in vitro and in vivo in response to RSV, during infection of A549 cells.ResultsScreening of subgroup A and B isolates revealed heterogeneity among strains to induce IL-6 and CCL5. We chose two subgroup B strains, New Haven (NH)1067 and NH1125, for further analysis because of their marked differences in cytokine inducing properties and because subgroup B strains, in general, are less genetically heterogeneous as compared to subgroup A strains. At 12 and 24&#8201;hours post infection RSV strains, NH1067 and NH1125 differed in their capacity to induce IL-6 by an order of magnitude or more. The concentrations of IL-6 and CCL5 were dependent on the dose of infectious virus and the concentration of these cytokines induced by NH1125 was greater than that of those induced by NH1067 when the multiplicity of infection of NH1067 used was as much as 10-fold higher than that of NH1125. The induction of IL-6 was dependent on viable virus as infection with UV-inactivated virus did not induce IL-6. The difference in IL-6 induction most likely could not be explained by differences in viral replication kinetics. The intracellular level of RSV RNA, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, was indistinguishable between the 2 strains though the titer of progeny virus produced by NH1125 was greater than that produced by NH1067 at 16, 24 and 36&#8201;hours but essentially equal at 48 and 72&#8201;hours. Full genome sequencing of the 2 strains revealed 193 polymorphisms and 4 insertions in NH1067when compared to NH1125 (2 single base insertions in non-coding regions and 2 duplications of 3 and 60 bases in the RSV G gene). Of the polymorphisms, 147 occurred in coding regions and only 30 resulted in amino acid changes in 7 of the RSV genes.ConclusionsThese data suggest that RSV strains may not be homogeneous with regard to pathogenesis or virulence. Identification of the genetic polymorphisms associated with variations in cytokine induction may lead to insights into RSV disease and to the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines.

The curse of dimension in nonparametric regression
We consider the problem of nonparametric regression, consisting of learning an arbitrary mapping f : X arrow left Y from a data set of (X,Y) pairs in which the Y values are corrupted by noise of mean zero. This statistical task is known to be subject to a so-called "curse of dimension'' : if X is a subset of RD̂, and if the only smoothness assumption on f() is that it satisfies a Lipschitz condition, it is known that any estimator based on n data points will have an error rate (risk) of Omega(n⁻²/(2+D)). In other words a data size exponential in D is required to approximate f(), which is unfeasible even for relatively small D. Fortunately, high-dimensional data often has low-intrinsic complexity (e.g. manifold data, sparse data) and some nonparametric regressors perform better in such situations. This dissertation presents and analyzes various fast regressors that escape the curse of dimension in situations where data has low- intrinsic complexity. These nonparametric regressors, namely tree and tree-kernel-hybrid regressors, have strong theoretical guarantees which are verifiable on a wide range of real-world data

Defining the relationship between kinetochore structure and spindle checkpoint signaling
In this dissertation, I use the early embryo of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to probe the relationships between kinetochore formation and spindle checkpoint signaling. The spindle checkpoint is a conserved signaling pathway that delays cell cycle progression in mitosis until all chromosomes have properly attached to microtubules emanating from opposing spindle poles. To trigger checkpoint activation, I undertook a strategy of inhibiting centriole duplication, using RNAi specific for components of the centriole duplication machinery. Such depletions result in bipolar spindles in the first mitotic division (serving as useful internal controls), while leading to monopolar spindle formation in the second and third divisions. Monopolar spindles are known to trigger checkpoint activation, as kinetochores lack both full attachment and tension. By performing live imaging video microscopy on these embryos, I was able to quantitatively assess checkpoint status by timing cell cycle progression. I found that cells with monopolar spindles exhibited cell cycle delays that were dependent on each of the conserved checkpoint proteins in C. elegans. Kinetochores are proteinaceus organelles that connect DNA to microtubules, and are essential for chromosome segregation in mitosis. Using the timing assay described above, I set out to comprehensively determine the contribution of kinetochore proteins for checkpoint signaling, and found that these proteins could be placed into one of three categories based on their phenotypes in the timing assay; required for checkpoint signaling, not required, or those that trigger checkpoint activation when depleted. Checkpoint activation is correlated with enrichment of specific components of the pathway on unattached kinetochores. To correlate checkpoint protein recruitment with the functional analysis of checkpoint signaling, I generated worm strains stably expressing fluorescently tagged checkpoint proteins Mad2<super>MDF⁻², Mad3<super>SAN⁻¹, and BUB-3, and systematically determined the requirements for their localization and enrichment at kinetochores. I also used these assays to characterize the roles of the recently discovered kinetochore protein SPDL-1 in checkpoint activation and signaling. Taken together, my results indicate that checkpoint activation is coordinately directed by three key kinetochore components - the NDC-80 complex, the Rod/Zwilch/Zw10 complex, and BUB -1 - that are targeted independently of one another by the outer kinetochore scaffold protein KNL-1. Surprisingly, I found that Mad3<super>SAN⁻¹, unlike other checkpoint proteins, does not enrich at unattached kinetochores, and that subtly elevating Mad2<super>MDF⁻², levels bypasses the requirement for BUB-3 and Mad3<super>SAN⁻¹ in kinetochore-dependent checkpoint activation. I propose that a core kinetochore-generated Mad1<super>MDF⁻¹/super>/ Mad2<super>MDF⁻² signal is integrated with a largely independent cytoplasmic Mad3<super>SAN⁻¹/BUB-3-based signal to coordinately regulate checkpoint activation, possibly in response to different checkpoint-activating states. I discuss the rationale for the partitioning of the checkpoint signaling pathway into two branches, and the newly elucidated relationships between kinetochore assembly and checkpoint signaling

STAT3 in intestinal epithelial cells regulates barrier function and anti-bacterial response
Inflammatory Bower Disease (IBD) is composed of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this pathogenesis, which has a common feature of compromised intestinal epithelial barrier in the small and large intestines. We investigated the role of STAT3 in intestinal epithelial cells (STAT3IEC) and identified a novel function of STAT3 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. STAT3IEC deletion in mice resulted in compromised barrier function and the loss of IEC polarity due to low tight junction protein levels (i.e. claudin-1, -3, and -5) in vitro and in vivo. We further identified that STAT3 maintains tight junction protein level in vitro and in vivo by inducing ubiquitin- mediated degradation of SNAI, a transcriptional suppressor of claudins. STAT3 binds with GSK3b, which phosphorylates SNAI for ubiquination and results in degradation. Moreover, STAT3 is essential for host defense against enteropathogenic bacteria (i.e. Citrobacter rodentium and E.coli). STAT3IEC knock out mice are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection due to impaired IEC barrier and antimicrobial peptide (i.e. regIIIg) induction, which is necessary for bacterial clearance. Collectively, STAT3 along with GSK3b forms a SNAI destruction complex in IECs to maintain claudin levels and thus results in proper barrier function and antibacterial defense

Fingerprinting Inhomogeneities in Recording Media Using the First-Order Reversal Curve Method
Understanding how interactions within magnetic systems affect the reversal process is critical to the development of magneticrecording media. Using the first-order reversal curve (FORC) method we demonstrate an ability to map out and uniquely identifymagnetic recording media. We evaluate the interactions and intrinsic switching field distribution (SFD) in single layer and exchangecoupled composite granular recording media. Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert-based simulations are used to probe the roles lateral andvertical exchange interactions have on the distribution of reversal events. We find that there is an optimal value for these terms whichmaximizes homogeneity of the reversal behavior.

A Field-Calibrated Model of Pioneer Riparian Tree Recruitment for the San Joaquin Basin, CA
In the Central Valley of California, Populus fremontii ssp. fremontii, Salix
          gooddingii, and Salix exigua dominate the near-river forests. Historically, seedling recruitment for these disturbance-adapted species coincided with spring floods. Changes in flow timing and magnitude due to river regulation have decreased the success of seedling cohorts and contribute to the decline of pioneer riparian tree populations.
      In order to address gaps in our understanding of these species and their potential restoration strategies, I rigorously quantified and field-calibrated a conceptual model of seedling recruitment using field and laboratory studies. Results indicate that these species do not maintain a seed bank and that vegetation competition does not limit seedling recruitment in the first year. Abundance was correlated with soil moisture and with low bank elevation. However, overwinter mortality was nearly complete.
      Results of my 3-year study of seed dispersal timing found that P. fremontii releases seeds earlier than the two willow species; a degree-day model robustly predicts interannual differences in timing; and early-season temperature likely drives andcoordinates both annual seed release and the spring snowmelt runoff pulse.Experimentally-imposed water table decline had strong effects on riparian seedling survival and growth. High stage decline rates ( ≥6 cm d-1) induced full mortalityfor all species. S. gooddingii seedlings survived better and grew faster than Populusseedlings at more moderate rates (0-3 cm d-1); this increased performance was correlated with higher seasonal water use efficiency as determined by carbon isotope ratios.I integrated these results into a process-based recruitment model that generates point estimates of seedling density and elevation based on inputs of site hydrology, seed dispersal timing, and seedling desiccation thresholds. I compared these predictions against independent field data for the same time period. Model predictions captured basic patterns of interannual and species-level differences in recruitment. Both predicted and observed seedling densities were highest in 2004 and lowest in 2003. The model correctly predicted that Salix exigua recruitment would be less extensive than for the twotree species. The successful pattern replication conducted in this work is a first step toward developing analytical tools to implement numerous riparian restorationapproaches, including flow releases and floodplain rehabilitation.

The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is essential for angiogenesis and cartilage matrix secretion during development
Members of the C(Cyr61) C(CTGF) N(Nov) family of matricellular proteins are involved in multiple aspects of embryonic and postnatal development and disease pathologies. CCN2, or connective tissue growth factor, is the second member of the family and has gained importance due to its prominent role in fibrotic disease. CCN2 has been extensively studied both in vitro and in vivo, but its specific roles remain unclear due to discrepancies in cell specific signaling mechanisms and experimental design. The current use of CCN2 blocking antibodies in clinical trials to treat symptoms associated with fibrosis and kidney function during diabetes warrants a clearer understanding of the function of CCN2 during normal physiology in order anticipate side effects. In order to investigate the functions of CCN2 during development, we have further analyzed the Ccn2 global knockout mouse and found that CCN2 plays essential roles in angiogenesis during vascular remodeling and cellular stress during endochondral ossification. CCN2 plays a dual role in vascular remodeling, first through mediating platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling between endothelial cells and pericytes, and second through inducing the secretion of provisional and permanent vascular basement membrane components. Further analysis of the ECM defect observed in the growth plates of Ccn2 mutant mice revealed that the loss of CCN2 results in increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Ccn2 mutants also exhibited decreased Nuclear Factor &#954;B (NF&#954;B) and autophagy-mediated cellular survival. Conversely, the overexpression of CCN2 results in attenuated ER stress and increased cellular survival during chemically induced ER stress. These results highlight a novel protective role for CCN2 during chondrocyte differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CCN2 plays important physiological roles in vivo and these roles should be considered during therapeutic interventions.

Rapid Determination of Near-Fault Earthquake Deformation Using Differential LiDAR
Improved near‐field measurements of earthquake slip and deformation patterns have the potential for expanding our understanding of fault behavior and the relationship of active faulting to topography. Current techniques for obtaining these measurements—including field observation, Global Navigation Satellite Systems displacement estimation, and optical or radar remote sensing—have limitations that can be mitigated by the inclusion of results from differential airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) analysis of the rupture zone. The 2005 airborne LiDAR survey of the southern San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Banning faults (the B4 survey) mapped 1100 km of the most seismically active fault systems in southern California for the purpose of providing a baseline for determining slip from a future earthquake. We used the B4 survey to develop a processing algorithm that yields rapid estimates of near‐fault ground deformation using simultaneous cross correlation of both topography and backscatter intensity from pre‐earthquake and simulated postearthquake LiDAR datasets. We show robust recovery of the direction and magnitude of an applied synthetic slip of 5 m in the horizontal and 0.5 m in the vertical within our area of study, with clear discrimination between areas with and without applied slip. We also successfully recovered more complex deformation from a modeled fault stepover in the same study area. Our results indicate that we should be able to recover slip to accuracies of better than 20 cm in the horizontal and 1 cm in the vertical, at a spatial resolution of ≤15  m for LiDAR datasets with sample densities as low as 0.5  points/m2.

Accelerating conformational sampling in free energy calculations
Molecular dynamics are increasingly used to construct conformational ensembles of biochemical systems. The accuracy of these ensembles is determined by the accuracy of the underlying model and the extent of conformational sampling during the simulation. Biochemical systems can have motion on time scales that vary by several orders of magnitude, and these must all be described before a specific model can be validated. For this reason research into enhanced sampling methods that accelerate conformational sampling are vital to the progress of molecular dynamics. This dissertation describes the validation and application of the replica exchange accelerated molecular dynamics (REXAMD) method in the context of free energy calculations. In chapters 2 and 3 the REXAMD method is validated using simple model systems. The convergence of REXAMD is shown to be an improvement over classical molecular dynamics. Additionally, various methods to improve the statistical behavior of REXAMD are investigated. In chapter 4 gradient-augmented Harmonic Fourier Beads, a minimum free energy pathway method, is used to study the conformational change of the ion selectivity peptide from the KcsA potassium channel. The robustness of various models, ranging from classical to quantum mechanical, is investigated and the importance of conformational sampling is observed. Finally in chapter 5, I propose a modification to the AMBER molecular dynamics package which allows the calculation of absolute binding free energies to be computed

Effects of Systemic Inflammation on Synaptogenesis in Developing Mouse Hippocampus
Synapses are specialized points of contact between neurons allowing for rapid transfer of signals in electrical or chemical form. Synaptic transmission and plasticity are integral to information processing and memory functions in any nervous system, regardless of its level of complexity. Chemical synapses can be broadly classified as excitatory or inhibitory, depending on how their activity affects the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. The majority of excitatory synapses are made onto small protrusions in dendrite membrane termed dendritic spines, while inhibitory synaptic terminals contact smooth membrane of dendritic shafts and cell bodies. The initial process of synapse formation, or synaptogenesis, occurs early in animal development and in humans as well as in mice it takes place postnatally over an extended period of time. Many neurodevelopmental as well as neurodegenerative disorders involve synapse and spine abnormalities, suggesting that undisturbed synaptogenesis is important to development of a healthy brain. Astrocytes and microglia are non-neuronal cells which play supportive and protective roles and thus shape the environment within the nervous system. Although their function is critical to proper neuronal operation, under pathological conditions their activities can have deleterious effects on neurons and their synapses. The purpose of the presented research was to elucidate the potentially detrimental influence of glial activation on developing synapses. Using the lipopolysaccharide model of systemic inflammation we induced glial inflammatory response in mice at several points of postnatal development. Hippocampus, one of the best described brain structures was used as the region of interest. We observed varying levels of microglial activation depending on the age of the animal and similar levels of astrocyte reactivity at all ages. Morphometric analysis of dendritic spines identified a period of vulnerability, manifested as a decrease in spine density in response to inflammation. The density of presynaptic excitatory terminals was similarly affected. When the systemic inflammation was extended from 24h to 8 days, the negative effects on the excitatory terminals were more pronounced and suggested a reduced excitatory drive. The improvement of seizure outcomes confirmed this hypothesis. We also investigated synaptic development in the mouse model of Nasu-Hakola disease, a genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dementia and microglial activation. We found that the mice failed to develop normal levels of excitatory presynaptic terminals, while exhibiting reduced susceptibility to seizures. Furthermore, inducing a systemic inflammation in these mice resulted in a decrease in inhibitory terminal density and higher seizure susceptibility. The results of this study demonstrate a period in postnatal development with elevated sensitivity to immune inflammatory responses. Using a mouse disease model we confirmed the impact of inflammation on synaptic development.

Spatial and temporal modulation of internal waves and thermohaline structure
Repeated horizontal sections at tidal and seasonal timescales are analyzed and show the two-dimensional (x-z) spatial patterns of internal waves and thermohaline structure. These spatial patterns give information about internal wave properties on tidal timescales, and the history of stirring and mixing on seasonal timescales. The across-ridge structure of tidal internal waves at Kauai Channel, Hawaii was observed using 300 km SeaSoar and Doppler sonar sections perpendicular to the Hawaiian ridge. M₂ tidal beams and their reflection off of the surface were observed in velocity and displacement variance and several covariances. Covariances were consistent with internal wave generation at the ridge flanks and corresponded to internal wave propagation away from the ridge. Energy flux was found to exceed dissipation almost everywhere across the ridge. Interactions between upward and downward tidal beams are shown to cause momentum flux divergences and mean flows. The seasonal evolution of upper ocean thermohaline structure was studied using observations of a North Pacific section taken in winter, spring, and summer with 3 -14 km horizontal resolution. In the mixed layer, seasonal modulations in the size of horizontal temperature and salinity differences as well as their tendency to compensate in density were observed. Water left behind after the mixed layer restratified inherited its thermohaline structure from the winter mixed layer, was most similar to the mixed layer in spring, and to the region just below in summer. Spectra of isopycnal depth and temperature showed seasonal variations at 30-370 km wavelengths. Effective isopycnal diffusivity was estimated by treating salinity anomalies as a tracer. Thermohaline structure at 5-1300 km scales in the upper 1000 m was analyzed along a section north of Hawaii observed 16 times with autonomous gliders over 2.5 years. A spatial modulation of thermohaline fluctuations along isopycnals was observed that persisted over the observation period and reflects the history of horizontal stirring and mixing. Temporal modulations in thermohaline structure were observed in the mixed layer, including the subtropical frontal regions, and the water left behind after restratificaiton, where perturbation magnitude decayed with time once isolated from the mixed layer

Ecohydrological Analysis of the Transport of Nitrate and Ammonium in Sandy Desert Soils in Southern California
Disruptions of the hydrological and nitrogen cycles in arid regions can seriously impact desert ecosystems by altering the fire cycle and exacerbating shifts in vegetation.  With the potential for nitrogen deposition, spread of invasive species, and climate change to alter the hydrological and nitrogen cycles, understanding these cycles is necessary for assessing the threats to desert ecosystems.  This dissertation explores the connections between the hydrological and nitrogen cycles in sandy soils in arid ecosystems.  An analysis of the hydrological cycle suggested that the water flux at highly negative potentials during the dry summers contributes significantly to the total annual water flux at two study sites in the Sonoran desert.  Because commonly-used soil hydraulic models do not accurately approximate the retention curve at highly negative potentials, predictions of liquid water flow at moderate potentials during the growing season were inaccurate due to very dry initial conditions.  An examination of how monthly nitrate measurements throughout the top 100cm of soil varied with precipitation at the same study sites showed how strongly the hydrological cycle affects the nitrogen cycle in the desert.  After rapid nitrate creation followed the first rains of the growing season, the leaching of nitrate with subsequent rainfalls was likely a major factor causing nitrogen limitation in annual plants.  Significantly greater nitrate in the soil in plots fertilized with ammonium nitrate relative to unfertilized plots throughout the dry summer suggested that a considerable amount of nitrate in the soil was not taken up by plants.  Variations in ammonium measurements with precipitation in the soil at the sites were similarly analyzed.  Results suggest that the adsorption of ammonium is likely an important factor in increasing nitrogen availability to short-rooted plants through inhibiting leaching.  Identifying how the hydrological cycle influences the nitrogen cycle in arid ecosystems is critical for predicting how deserts will change in the future.

Exploration of N-terminal methionine excision via comparative proteogenomics
This thesis will explore N-terminal methionine excision (NME), a co-translational process that occurs on virtually all proteins in all organimsms from bacteria to eukaryotes. NME is an essential process for the funtioning of proteins, with the enzymes responsible for carrying out NME belonging to the minimal bacterial cell (HPG⁺99). This excision is almost exclusively determined by the second amino acid of the nascient protein. The set of seven amino acids that prompt cleavage also correspond to the seven stabilizing amino acids that Arfin and Bradshaw AB88 connected to protein degradation. Comparative proteogenomics approaches are employed to perform an analysis of NME based on sequence as well as other available data. The ties of NME to protein degradation are questioned, with the results of experiments suggesting that only two of the seven amino acids that prompt cleavage are important and required for post-translational modifications, specifically N-acetylation

However, existing labeling methods are time consuming and costly and therefore often limit the scale of microarray experiments and sample throughput. Here we introduce a new, fast, inexpensive method for direct random-primed fluorescent labeling of eukaryotic cDNA for gene expression analysis and compare the results obtained on the NimbleGen microarray platform with two other widely-used labeling methods, namely the NimbleGen-recommended double-stranded cDNA protocol and the indirect (aminoallyl) method. RESULTS: Two total RNA samples were labeled with each method and hybridized to NimbleGen expression arrays. Although all methods tested here provided similar global results and biological conclusions, the new direct random-primed cDNA labeling method provided slightly better correlation between replicates compared to the other methods and thus increased ability to find statistically significant differentially expressed genes. CONCLUSION: The new direct random-primed cDNA labeling method introduced here is suitable for gene expression microarrays and provides a rapid, inexpensive alternative to existing methods. Using NimbleGen microarrays, the method produced excellent results comparable to those obtained with other methods. However, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the new method allows for increased sample throughput in microarray experiments and makes the process amenable to automation with a relatively simple liquid handling system.

Improved resolution of hydrocarbon structures and constitutional isomers in complex mixtures using Gas Chromatography-Vacuum Ultraviolet-Mass Spectrometry (GC-VUV-MS)
Understanding the composition of complex hydrocarbon mixtures is important for environmental studies in a variety of fields, but many prevalent compounds cannot be confidently identified using traditional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. This work uses vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ionization to elucidate the structures of a traditionally "unresolved complex mixture" by separating components by GC retention time, tR, and mass-to-charge ratio, m/Q, which are used to determine carbon number, NC, and the number of rings and double bonds, NDBE. Constitutional isomers are resolved based on tR, enabling the most complete quantitative analysis to date of structural isomers in an environmentally-relevant hydrocarbon mixture. Unknown compounds are classified in this work by carbon number, degree of saturation, presence of rings, and degree of branching, providing structural constraints. The capabilities of this analysis are explored using diesel fuel, in which constitutional isomer distribution patterns are shown to be reproducible between carbon numbers and follow predictable rules. Nearly half of the aliphatic hydrocarbon mass is shown to be branched, suggesting branching is more important in diesel fuel than previously shown. The classification of unknown hydrocarbons and the resolution of constitutional isomers significantly improves resolution capabilities for any complex hydrocarbon mixture.

A Nanocrystal Sensor for Luminescence Detection of Cellular Forces
Quantum dots have been used as bright fluorescent tags with high photostability to probe numerous biological systems. In this work we present the tetrapod quantum dot as a dynamic, next-generation nanocrystal probe that fluorescently reports cellular forces with spatial and temporal resolution. Its small size and colloidal state suggest that the tetrapod may be further developed as a tool to measure cellular forces in vivo and with macromolecular spatial resolution.

Challenges in network-based classification of gene expression profiles
Classification of gene expression profiles to distinguish one disease state from another is essential for the realization of personalized medicine. Recent approaches towards this problem use prior knowledge about interaction among bio-molecules to improve classification accuracy and the biological relevance of the predictive features. However, many such network-based methods do not significantly outperform their unconstrained counterparts in terms of sensitivity and specificity due to unexplained reasons. This behavior, observed across diverse datasets and methods, is a cause of concern as it implies that something is wrong with the data, the algorithms or both. This work focuses on understanding the reasons behind this problem through extensive simulation of gene expression profile to help the development of better classifiers in the future. We infer that when using networks whose interactions do not agree well with the patterns of gene expression, improvement in classification performance will not be significant. Because this improvement is dependent on the classifier also, future network-based methods need to understand their properties with respect to network noise and know the quality of actual network mapping to make meaningful inferences from the performance results

Anatomy and physiology of neurons supporting the cerebellar circuit
The cerebellum is essential for performing accurate, smooth and coordinated movements in an ever-changing environment. While the cerebellum has been studied for well over one hundred years, many questions remain regarding how the underlying circuitry supports overall cerebellar function. To address questions related to anatomy and intrinsic excitability, a combination of neuronal tracing techniques and intrinsic electrophysiological recordings are used to study cerebellar circuit neurons. Experiments reveal that despite conveying different sensory, motor and cortical signals, precerebellar neurons in diverse precerebellar nuclei share most intrinsic excitability characteristics. In addition, neurons in the vestibular complex, a region well-connected with the cerebellum, have specializations in the conversion of current into firing rate related to their neurotransmitter content and specific anatomical projections. Finally, experiments reveal specific neurons participating in a cerebellar feedback loop connecting the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi to the inferior olive

Graphene growth with giant domains using chemical vapor deposition
We report the first demonstration of the growth of giant graphene domains on platinum (Pt), which results in a uniform bilayer graphene film with domain sizes of millimetre scale. These giant graphene domains are attributed to the giant Pt grains attained in post-deposition annealed Pt thin films that exhibit a strong dependency on the Pt film thickness. Giant grains have been claimed to occur in other metallic materials under appropriate film thicknesses and processing conditions. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational large-scale uniform graphene synthesis for applications in nanoelectronics and sensing.

Analysis of the Multidimensional Effects in Biofilms
A general multidimensional, multispecies, heterogenous biofilm model is developed using the balance equations.  Multidimensional effects are studied by taking limiting scenarios towards lower dimensional analogues, as well as studying the effects of changing biofilm surface geometries.  Error-maps are developed suggesting when single-dimensional models give an accurate representation of biofilm growth, and when multidimensional effects are substantial.  A porous media model is studied, where the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is modeled to grow in a packed porous bed of spheres.  It is found that under most circumstances, single-dimensional models predict very similar growth rates as compared to their multidimensional analogues.  However, under some conditions the multidimensionality can have a significant effect in the model's predictions.  To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first work which develops error maps detailing multidimensional effects of biofilm growth.

Abundance, Species Richness, and Reproductive Success of Tidal Marsh Birds at China Camp State Park, Marin County, California
Extensive habitat loss and degradation have resulted in decreases in populations of tidal marsh breeding birds in the San Francisco Estuary in the past 150 years. We conducted point count surveys and nest monitoring in tidal marsh habitat at China Camp State Park from 1996 through 2007 to assess bird abundance, species richness and reproductive success over time. We found overall species richness at China Camp to be significantly lower than that of other San Pablo Bay tidal marshes, but also to be increasing during the study period. We present relative density indices and confirm breeding for three focal species that are of conservation concern: San Pablo song sparrow (Melospiza melodia samuelis), California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), and California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Song sparrows were observed at higher densities at China Camp than at other San Pablo Bay sites. There was no apparent trend in song sparrow density during the study period at China Camp, in contrast with the rest of San Pablo Bay, which displayed a significant decline. We determined song sparrow nest survival probability using the method described by Mayfield (1975) and found that nest survival at China Camp varied markedly among years, from >30% in 1996 to 6% in 2006, with no discernible trend. The main causes of nest failure were predation and tidal flooding. Song sparrow nests were found predominantly in gumplant (Grindelia stricta) and pickleweed (Sarcocornia pacifica) and less commonly in saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). Clapper rails nested exclusively in pickleweed and black rail nests were found mainly in gumplant and less commonly in saltgrass. China Camp’s expansive ancient marsh supports endemic and bird species of conservation concern, while serving as a reference site for tidal marsh studies in San Francisco Bay. The long-term monitoring of tidal marsh bird breeding parameters at China Camp has the potential to provide early detection of declining population trends before local populations become imperiled.

Methods for hydrographic data collection and use applied to infer biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean
Data-based estimates of marine biogeochemical cycling are essential for making accurate forecasts of changes to our planet's climate and ecosystems resulting from mankind's perturbations to the chemistry of the ocean and the atmosphere. In this thesis I present and apply novel methods for hydrographic data collection and analysis. The quality and coverage of hydrographic measurements must be balanced against the practical costs of the analyses. A system for efficient, semi-autonomous, and precise colorimetric seawater pH analyses is presented and assessed with the aim of decreasing the investment required for this measurement. An inverse model constructed to estimate rates of organic matter degradation, rates of calcium carbonate dissolution, measurement covariance resulting from organic matter degradation, and the length of time that a measured water parcel has been out of contact with the atmosphere is presented and applied in the Southern Ocean. Model estimates are compared to estimates obtained from similar inverse methods that neglect either diapycnal mixing or mixing altogether, and significant differences are found. This supports the findings of several recent research efforts urging caution when interpreting inverse methods that neglect mixing. Climate models and ocean and atmospheric monitoring suggest that the Southern Ocean is undergoing long-term changes in its freshwater budget, heat budget, gas exchange processes, and circulation patterns. I examine and inverse model the effects of changes in biogeochemical processes on hydrographic properties using differences between datasets collected more than a decade apart in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Results indicate a continuation of previously observed warming and freshening trends in intermediate and mode waters and evidence for an increase in the Ekman divergence driven upwelling in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current

Investigating the Role for Dysbindin in Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory: Glutamatergic Mechanisms
ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONInvestigating the Role for Dysbindin in Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory: Glutamatergic MechanismsByBryant Lance HorowitzDoctor of Philosophy in PsychologyUniversity of California, Los Angeles, 2012Professor J. David Jentsch, ChairSchizophrenia is a complexly defined disorder with many genes contributing to the high heritability, but the degree to which these genes contribute to the pathophysiology is unclear. DTNBP1, which codes for the dysbindin protein, has been identified as one of the candidate risk genes in schizophrenia. Dysbindin is one of eight proteins that make up the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1(BLOC-1), which includes pallidin, muted, snapin, cappuccino, and BLOC-1 subunits 1, 2, and 3.The BLOC-1 complex is involved in trafficking of vesicles. Variation in DTNBP1 has been associated with increased risk of schizophrenia in behavioral genetic studies of humans, as well as deficits in cognition and memory phenotypes. Studies on the physiology of the dysbindin protein reveal reduction in expression within forebrain glutamatergic neurons, playing a role in trafficking of vesicles in the BLOC-1 complex. The sandy mouse, which carries a mutation of the DTNBP1 gene and does not code for the dysbindin protein, has been used to study behavioral, cellular and physiological processes; revealing compromised glutamatergic neurotransmission and deficits in working memory and cognitive function similar to patients with schizophrenia. Sandy mice were used to examine hippocampal-dependent tasks of memory. Homozygous sandy mice showed normal locomotor movement and some learning in a Morris water maze task compared to heterozygous and wild type controls, but were impaired in spatial memory. Sandy mice also showed deficits in recognition memory and contextual memory compared to heterozygous and wild type controls. To investigate the role of dysbindin as BLOC-1 dependent the pallid mouse, which has a null mutation in the Pldn gene which produces no pallidin protein, was examined in context and recognition memory tasks and showed deficits in fear generalization and recognition memory; but not identical to deficits shown in sandy mice. Taken together, this data indicates that dysbindin may be acting independently of BLOC-1.

Investigations of marine cyanobacterial secondary metabolites : isolation, structure elucidation, and synthesis
Marine cyanobacteria, especially of the genus Lyngbya, have been a prolific source of bioactive natural products over the past forty years. While the most prevalent biological activity reported for marine cyanobacterial secondary metabolites is anticancer activity, the propensity of marine cyanobacteria to produce neuromodulatory active secondary metabolites has been realized in recent years. Neuromodulatory activity may have therapeutic relevance in the treatment of spinal cord injury, chronic pain, CNS disorders including stroke and epilepsy, and treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. While a number of compounds exhibiting neuromodulatory activities have been isolated from Lyngbya sp., relatively few have been reported from other species belonging to the Oscillatoriaceae. The primary focus of the research herein was to evaluate the natural products richness of marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genera Schizothrix and Symploca spp. with particular emphasis on isolating compounds from extracts and fractions exhibiting neuromodulatory activity. In total, seven novel compounds from marine cyanobacteria were isolated and characterized, including four lipopeptides, janthielamide A and kimbeamides A-C, a polyketide-extended pyranone, kimbelactone A, a new iodinated and brominated diterpene, tasihalide C, and a novel lipophilic carboxylic acid, palmyric acid. Janthielamide A displayed sodium channel blocking activity in murine Neuro-2a cells with an IC₅₀ of 11.5 muM and antagonized veratridine-induced sodium influx in murine cerebrocortical neurons with an IC₅₀ of 5.2 muM. Kimbeamide A also exhibited modest sodium channel blocking activity with an IC₅₀ of 60 muM in murine Neuro-2a cells. Meanwhile, tasihalide C was found to possess potent anti-inflammatory activity with an IC₅₀ of 1.3 muM in a mouse macrophage cell line. In addition to studies regarding isolation and characterization of novel marine cyanobacterial natural products, investigations utilizing synthetic methodology to address questions regarding absolute stereochemistry of some of these compounds, as well as several depsipeptides containing an alpha,alpha-dimethyl-beta-hydroxy octynoic acid residue, were undertaken. An improved synthetic route for the generation of alpha,alpha- dimethyl-beta-hydroxy octynoic acid and related residues was achieved and standards generated by this methodology have been utilized to determine the absolute configuration of the beta-hydroxy stereocenter of this fragment in ten depsipeptides of marine cyanobacterial origins thus far

Forward chemical genetic screens in Arabidopsis identify genes that influence sensitivity to the phytotoxic compound sulfamethoxazole
Background
				
				The sulfanilamide family comprises a clinically important group of antimicrobial compounds which also display bioactivity in plants. While there is evidence that sulfanilamides inhibit folate biosynthesis in both bacteria and plants, the complete network of plant responses to these compounds remains to be characterized. As such, we initiated two forward genetic screens in Arabidopsis in order to identify mutants that exhibit altered sensitivity to sulfanilamide compounds. These screens were based on the growth phenotype of seedlings germinated in the presence of the compound sulfamethoxazole (Smex).
			
			
				
					Results
				
				We identified a mutant with reduced sensitivity to Smex, and subsequent mapping indicated that a gene encoding 5-oxoprolinase was responsible for this phenotype. A mutation causing enhanced sensitivity to Smex was mapped to a gene lacking any functional annotation.
			
			
				
					Conclusions
				
				The genes identified through our forward genetic screens represent novel mediators of Arabidopsis responses to sulfanilamides and suggest that these responses extend beyond the perturbation of folate biosynthesis.

Safety evaluation of a recombinant plasmin
derivative lacking kringles 2-5 and rt-PA in a rat
model of transient ischemic stroke
AbstractBackgroundTissue type plasminogen activator is the only approved thrombolytic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, it carries the disadvantage of a 10-fold increase in symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. A safer thrombolytic agent may improve patient prognosis and increase patient participation in thrombolytic treatment. A novel direct-acting thrombolytic agent, &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin, promising an improved safety profile was examined for safety in the snare ligature model of stroke in the rat.MethodsMale spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to 6 hours middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 18 hours reflow. Beginning 1 minute before reflow, they were dosed with saline, vehicle, &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin (0.15, 0.5, 1.5, and 5&#8201;mg/kg) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (10 and 30&#8201;mg/kg) by local intra-arterial infusion lasting 10 to 60 minutes. The rats were assessed for bleeding score, infarct volume, modified Bederson score and general behavioral score. In a parallel study, temporal progression of infarct volume was determined. In an in vitro study, whole blood clots from humans, canines and rats were exposed to &#916;(K2-K5). Clot lysis was monitored by absorbance at 280&#8201;nm.ResultsThe main focus of this study was intracranial hemorrhage safety. &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin treatment at the highest dose caused no more intracranial hemorrhage than the lowest dose of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator, but showed at least a 5-fold superior safety margin. Secondary results include: temporal infarct volume progression shows that the greatest expansion of infarct volume occurs within 2&#8211;3 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. A spike in infarct volume was observed at 6 hours ischemia with reflow. &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin tended to reduce infarct volume and improve behavior compared to controls. In vitro data suggests that &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin is equally effective at lysing clots from humans, canines and rats.ConclusionsThe superior intracranial hemorrhage safety profile of the direct-acting thrombolytic &#916;(K2-K5) plasmin compared with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator makes this agent a good candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Physical mapping resources for large plant genomes: radiation hybrids for wheat D-genome progenitor Aegilops tauschii
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Development of a high quality reference sequence is a daunting task in crops like wheat with large (~17Gb), highly repetitive (&gt;80%) and polyploid genome. To achieve complete sequence assembly of such genomes, development of a high quality physical map is a necessary first step. However, due to the lack of recombination in certain regions of the chromosomes, genetic mapping, which uses recombination frequency to map marker loci, alone is not sufficient to develop high quality marker scaffolds for a sequence ready physical map. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping, which uses radiation induced chromosomal breaks, has proven to be a successful approach for developing marker scaffolds for sequence assembly in animal systems. Here, the development and characterization of a RH panel for the mapping of D-genome of wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii is reported.
					
				
				
					
						Results
					Radiation dosages of 350 and 450 Gy were optimized for seed irradiation of a synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD) wheat with the D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78. The surviving plants after irradiation were crossed to durum wheat (AABB), to produce pentaploid RH1s (AABBD), which allows the simultaneous mapping of the whole D-genome. A panel of 1,510 RH1 plants was obtained, of which 592 plants were generated from the mature RH1 seeds, and 918 plants were rescued through embryo culture due to poor germination (&lt;3%) of mature RH1 seeds. This panel showed a homogenous marker loss (2.1%) after screening with SSR markers uniformly covering all the D-genome chromosomes. Different marker systems mostly detected different lines with deletions. Using markers covering known distances, the mapping resolution of this RH panel was estimated to be &lt;140kb. Analysis of only 16 RH lines carrying deletions on chromosome 2D resulted in a physical map with cM/cR ratio of 1:5.2 and 15 distinct bins. Additionally, with this small set of lines, almost all the tested ESTs could be mapped. A set of 399 most informative RH lines with an average deletion frequency of ~10% were identified for developing high density marker scaffolds of the D-genome.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The RH panel reported here is the first developed for any wild ancestor of a major cultivated plant species. The results provided insight into various aspects of RH mapping in plants, including the genetically effective cell number for wheat (for the first time) and the potential implementation of this technique in other plant species. This RH panel will be an invaluable resource for mapping gene based markers, developing a complete marker scaffold for the whole genome sequence assembly, fine mapping of markers and functional characterization of genes and gene networks present on the D-genome.

Human mammary cancer progression model recapitulates methylation events associated with breast premalignancy
Abstract



Introduction

We have previously identified a rare subpopulation of variant human mammary epithelial cells (vHMEC) with repressed p16INK4A that exist in disease-free women yet display premalignant properties, suggesting that they have engaged the process of malignant transformation. In order to gain insight into the molecular alterations required for vHMEC to progress to malignancy, and to characterize the epigenetic events associated with early progression, we examined the effect of oncogenic stress on the behavior of these cells.



Methods

HMEC that express p16INK4A and vHMEC that do not, were transduced with constitutively active Ha-rasV12 and subsequently exposed to serum to determine whether signals from the cellular microenvironment could cooperate with ras to promote the malignant transformation of vHMEC. Epigenetic alterations were assessed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR).



Results

vHMEC expressing Ha-rasV12 (vHMEC-ras) bypassed the classic proliferative arrest that has been previously documented in normal fibroblasts following oncogenic stress, and that we also observe here in normal HMEC. Moreover, vHMEC-ras cells exhibited many additional alterations that are observed during progression to malignancy such as the generation of chromosomal abnormalities, upregulation of telomerase activity, immortalization following exposure to serum, and anchorage-independent growth, but they did not form tumors following orthotopic injection in vivo. Associated with their early progression to malignancy was an increase in the number of genes methylated, two of which (RASSF1A and SFRP1) were also methylated in other immortalized mammary cell lines as well as in breast cancer cells and tissues.



Conclusions

We have characterized a mammary progression model that recapitulates molecular and methylation alterations observed in many breast cancers. Our data suggest that concomitant methylation of RASSF1A and SFRP1 marks an early event in mammary transformation and may thus have prognostic potential.

Functionalization of nanocarriers for efficient combination drug delivery
Therapeutic Nanoparticles have shown significant impact in the field of medicine, particularly in anticancer drug delivery. Prolonged circulation time, functionalization with tumor-targeting ligands, and encapsulation of multiple drug types are among the key features of nanoparticles that make them desirable anticancer drug carriers. This dissertation will focus on these three major features of therapeutic nanoparticles and provide novel improvements in these areas. The first area of research is multi-drug coencapsulation, where precise control over drug-to-drug ratio has a major impact on the particles' therapeutic efficacy. A drug-polymer conjugate system is used to overcome the intrinsic differences in the physicochemical properties of different drug molecules. By adapting metal alkoxide chemistry, we synthesize highly hydrophobic drug-poly-l-lactide (drug- PLA) conjugates, of which the polymer has the same chain length while the drug may differ. These drug-polymer conjugates are then encapsulated into lipid-coated polymeric nanoparticles through a single-step nanoprecipitation method. Using doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT) as two model chemotherapy drugs, various ratios of DOX-PLA and CPT-PLA conjugates are loaded into the nanoparticles with over 90% loading efficiency. The resulting nanoparticles are uniform in size, size distribution and surface charge. The loading yield of DOX and CPT in the particles can be precisely controlled by simply adjusting the DOX-PLA:CPT-PLA molar ratio. Cellular cytotoxicity results show that the dual- drug loaded nanoparticles are superior to the corresponding cocktail mixtures of single-drug loaded nanoparticles. This dual-drug delivery approach offers a solution to the long-standing challenge in ratiometric control over the loading of different types of drugs onto the same drug delivery vehicle. The second area is nanoparticle functionalization for tumor-targeted delivery. we synthesize anti-CEA half-antibody conjugated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and characterize their ligand conjugation yields, physicochemical properties, and targeting ability against pancreatic cancer cells. Under the same drug loading, the half-antibody targeted nanoparticles show enhanced cancer killing effect compared to the corresponding non-targeted nanoparticles. The half- antibody approach offers the advantage of reduced ligand size, site-specific conjugation, and easy accessibility over existing functionalization approaches. The third area of research presented herein is a novel nature-inspired approach to camouflage nanoparticles for long systemic circulation. A top-down approach in coating biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles with natural erythrocyte membranes is reported. The structure, size and surface zeta potential, and protein contents of the erythrocyte membrane-coated nanoparticles were verified using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and gel electrophoresis respectively. Mice injections with fluorophore-loaded nanoparticles revealed superior circulation half-life by the erythrocyte-mimicking nanoparticles as compared to control particles coated with the state-of-the-art synthetic stealth materials. Biodistribution study revealed significant particle retention in the blood 72 hours following the particle injection. The translocation of natural cellular membranes, their associated proteins and the corresponding functionalities to the surface of synthetic particles represents a novel approach in nanoparticle functionalization. The developments on these three areas are compatible with one another and could be integrated as one multifunctional nanoparticle platform. Each of these features aims to target a distinctive barrier in cancer drug delivery

The dynamic interplay between adhesion signaling and the ERK MAP kinase pathway
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and integrins are involved in a variety of processes including but not limited to, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and cell migration. Thus it is not surprising that aberrant signaling by either of these elements has developmental and pathological consequences. Whereas, MAP kinases and integrins coordinate these important cellular processes there is a lack of insight into how these two signaling components intersect. In this dissertation I employ a variety of biochemical, molecular biology, and cell biological techniques to decipher three distinct interfaces between integrins and MAP kinases. First, I will demonstrate how PEA-15 potentiates MAP kinase signaling by limiting ERK1/2 association with the plasma membrane. Next I will detail how tyrosine phosphorylation of beta integrin cytoplasmic tails regulates the binding of intracellular binding proteins. Lastly, I will explain how ERK1/2 suppresses integrin activation through the adaptor protein FRS2. In addition, I will provide a biological context for the experimental results discussed in this dissertation

Spatial EEG Patterns, Non-linear Dynamics and Perception: the Neo-Sherringtonian View
 Spatial analysis with preamplifier arrays and computers offers fresh perspectives on brain function. Realization of its potential depends on development of appropriate procedures for data processing and display, experimental paradigms to serve as benchmarks, and theories of brain function to predict what to look for and how to distinguish valid results from artifacts. Measurement of EEGs from arrays of 64 electrodes chronically implanted on the olfactory bulbs of rabbits that are trained to discriminate odorant conditioned stimuli show that the odorants induce spatially distinctive amplitude patterns of neural activity. The odor-specific information density is inferred to be uniform over the whole main bulb. The neural dynamics that produce these activity patterns emerge from the synaptically interactive sheet of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells with distributed input and output tracts and with static non-linearities deriving from the nerve impulse mechanism. Excitatory synapses between mitral cells are subject to modification when odorants are paired with unconditioned stimuli, thus forming nerve cell assemblies. Odorant-specific information established by a stimulus locally in the bulbar unit activity is integrated with past experience by an assembly, disseminated over the entire bulb on the order of 100 mm2 in area in a time period of 2.5 ms, and sustained for a time period on the order of 0.1 s. An arbitrary spatial sample on the order of 20% of bulbar EEG activity captures the entire integrated information albeit at lesser resolution than the whole. This synaptic mechanism of local input and global output may be common to all of the cerebral cortex. The implications are discussed for neocortical sensory systems, motor pattern generators, and goal-directed behavior in the context of self-organizing non-linear dynamic systems.

Histone acetylation dynamics play a critical role in co- transcriptional spliceosome assembly and spliceosomal rearrangements
In the last several years, a number of studies have shown that spliceosome assembly and splicing catalysis can occur co-transcriptionally. However, it has been unclear which specific transcription factors play key roles in coupling splicing to transcription and the mechanisms through which they act. Here we report the discovery that Gcn5, which encodes the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of the SAGA complex, has HAT-dependent genetic interactions with the genes encoding the heterodimeric U2 snRNP proteins Msl1 and Lea1, suggesting a functional relationship between Gcn5 HAT activity and Msl1/Lea1 function. To understand this relationship, we carried out an analysis of Gcn5's role in co-transcriptional recruitment of Msl1 and Lea1 to pre-mRNA and find that Gcn5 HAT activity is required for co-transcriptional recruitment of the U2 snRNP (and subsequent snRNP) components to the branchpoint. Although previous studies suggested that transcription elongation can alter co- transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing, we do not observe evidence of defective transcription elongation for these genes in the absence of Gcn5, while Gcn5-dependent histone acetylation is enriched in the promoter regions. While all these data suggest a role for histone acetylation in co- transcriptional spliceosome assembly. A closer examination of the functional interactions between histone mutants and the U2 snRNP and the effects of histone mutants and histone deacetylation on spliceosome assembly provide convincing evidence of the functional coordination of histone deaceylation and splicing. Mutations in histone residues targeted by Gcn5 show genetic interactions with the U2 snRNP and splicing defects that mirror GCN5 deletion. Furthermore, not only is Gcn5 associated throughout intron-containing genes, but deletion of multiple HDACs reveals peaks in acetylation in these regions, and this results in defects in spliceosome assembly. Finally, we present data that support a model whereby the Gcn5-dependent U2 snRNP recruitment facilitates HDAC recruitment, suggesting that splicing factors can, in fact, affect histone acetylation. These studies show that co-transcriptional spliceosome rearrangements are driven by dynamic changes in the acetylation state of histones and provide a model whereby spliceosome assembly is tightly coupled to histone modification

Assessment of phytoplankton community dynamics using bead array technology
Molecular methods are becoming increasingly popular in the field of microbial ecology for the characterization of phytoplankton communities at the taxonomic level. However, many techniques lack the potential for large scale spatiotemporal studies due to limitations in their methodology. In this study, a high-throughput, rapid and cost effective hybridization-based bead assay was applied to two sets of samples : (1) a yearlong time series (March 2009-2010) of surface seawater samples taken off the Scripps Pier, and (2) a three month long series of samples taken during a Lingulodinium polyhedrum bloom in June 2010. The presence and abundance of seven phytoplankton taxa known to occur in the La Jolla, CA coastal water community were measured using taxon-specific probes, and results showed significant temporal variability throughout the sampling period. The diatoms Chaetoceros and Cylindrotheca and the dinoflagellate taxa Prorocentrum and Scrippsiella exhibited similar temporal abundances, suggesting that commonalities in traits allow for the coexistence of these phylogenetically divergent taxa. The dinoflagellates Akashiwo and Lingulodinium also shared similar peak distributions during the bloom following peak abundances of diatoms in early spring, indicating biological succession of these taxa. Our study demonstrated the potential application of the Luminex bead array assay as a valuable tool to assess phytoplankton community dynamics. Further analyses of the ecological strategies of the seven taxa are necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation of the biotic and abiotic factors structuring phytoplankton communities

Adipose Co-expression networks across Finns and Mexicans identify novel triglyceride-associated genes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					High serum triglyceride (TG) levels is an established risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Fat is stored in the form of TGs in human adipose tissue. We hypothesized that gene co-expression networks in human adipose tissue may be correlated with serum TG levels and help reveal novel genes involved in TG regulation.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Gene co-expression networks were constructed from two Finnish and one Mexican study sample using the blockwiseModules R function in Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Overlap between TG-associated networks from each of the three study samples were calculated using a Fisher&#8217;s Exact test. Gene ontology was used to determine known pathways enriched in each TG-associated network.
				
				
					
						Results
					We measured gene expression in adipose samples from two Finnish and one Mexican study sample. In each study sample, we observed a gene co-expression network that was significantly associated with serum TG levels. The TG modules observed in Finns and Mexicans significantly overlapped and shared 34 genes. Seven of the 34 genes (ARHGAP30, CCR1, CXCL16, FERMT3, HCST, RNASET2, SELPG) were identified as the key hub genes of all three TG modules. Furthermore, two of the 34 genes (ARHGAP9, LST1) reside in previous TG GWAS regions, suggesting them as the regional candidates underlying the GWAS signals.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This study presents a novel adipose gene co-expression network with 34 genes significantly correlated with serum TG across populations.

Near Field Modeling of the Effects of Sound Barriers on Flow and Dispersion
Previous research of air quality in the vicinity of roadways has used either field measurements, where results are site specific, or modeling, which can be computationally expensive or too simplified and misleading. The presented research consists of a systematical laboratory and numerical investigation of the influence of different sound barrier (SB) configurations on the dispersion from roadways. Sound Barriers can be seen along the sides of freeways, especially in Southern California. The primary purpose of SBs is to dampen roadway noise; however this research focuses on their influence on the dispersion of pollutants from roadways. Vehicular emissions have been shown to be a major source of pollution in urban areas and that long term exposure can lead to adverse health effects. There is a need for reliable models to predict the effectiveness of SBs. These models need to be validated and the best way to accomplish that is through laboratory experiments. The laboratory experiments are being conducted at the Laboratory for Environmental Flow Modeling (LEFM) at the University of California, Riverside, which has a custom made water channel with the capability of performing Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Fiber Optic Assisted Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements.  This water channel is commonly used to investigate the flow and dispersion within complex urban geometries. The water channel is also being used for qualitative flow visualizations by releasing fluorescence tracer dye. The presented measurements have been made with a neutrally buoyant dye (mixture of dye with water). The laboratory experiments are accompanied with numerical modeling using Quick Urban and Industrial Complex (QUIC) model, which consists of a wind and a dispersion module. The wind module has two options: 1) parametric flow description (QUIC-URB) or 2) flow results from Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (QUIC-CFD). The dispersion module deploys Lagrangian particle tracking method. It was found that in both the water channel and QUIC simulations, the presence of SBs increases the vertical spread of the plume relative to that of no SBs. The presence of SBs has been shown to decrease the downwind concentrations due to the enhanced vertical mixing, however in certain situations, such as during conditions of low wind speeds, the SBs tend to trap the pollutants on the roadway.

[copepod, gut, hypothesis, layer, sortie]

The foraging sorties hypothesis : evaluating the effect of gut dynamics on copepod foraging behavior
While the diel vertical migration of copepods has been known for over a century, the details of this migration remain elusive. Field studies in Dabob Bay, a fjord in Puget Sound, Washington State (U. S. A.) show that copepods found in food- poor layers had gut contents similar to copepods found in food-rich layers. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations; the in situ feeding hypothesis and the foraging sorties hypothesis. The in-situ feeding hypothesis states that copepods with food in their guts were feeding in the layers where they were captured. The foraging sorties hypothesis predicts that copepods migrate into food-rich layers, where they feed to saturation, in brief bouts that lasts several tens of minutes. They then sink out as they digest. Once their gut is cleared the return to the shallow layer and repeat the cycle. In both cases feedback from the gut during feeding is critical. The present work has two components. The first consists of a series of laboratory experiments where I use a planar laser imaging fluorometer to quantify the dynamics of food movement through the guts to determine the time scales that are likely to dictate feeding behavior of individual copepods and their resulting vertical distribution. The second component of this work consists in deploying a profiling multi-spectral imaging system. This system is used to record individual copepod location in the water column and to quantify their corresponding gut content. Used in conjunction with an IBM, partially based on the laboratory work, I show that both in situ feeding and foraging sorties hypotheses are feasible strategies. Furthermore I show that dominance of one strategy over the other will depend greatly on the interaction between the copepods' physiology and the environment they experience. Thus, prediction of the general foraging pattern may be possible from knowledge of the hydrographic structure

Role of nuclear dynamics in the Asymmetric molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions for C 1s photoejection from CO2
We report the results of semiclassical calculations of the asymmetric molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions for C 1s ionization of CO2 measured with respect to the CO+ and O+ ions produced by subsequent Auger decay, and show how the decay event can be used to probe ultrafast molecular dynamics of the transient cation. The fixed-nuclei photoionization amplitudes were constructed using variationally obtained electron-molecular ion scattering wave functions. The amplitudes are then used in a semiclassical manner to investigate their dependence on the nuclear dynamics of the cation. The method introduced here can be used to study other core-level ionization events.

[activity, pattern, time, individual]

A Model of Household Interactions In Activity Patterns
Time is an important aspect of the activity patterns of individuals. An activity pattern can be described by means of a time-space diagram (Hagerstrand, 1970), that describes, for each moment within a given time interval, the location and type of activity of an individual. These time-space patterns are the result of various decisions and events experienced by that individual. In this paper, we will focus on the time dimensions of the space-time activity patterns of individuals. More specifically, we will focus attention on the allocation of time to a number of out-of-home activities. Other aspects, such as the timing and scheduling of activities are outside the scope of this paper.

Chemistry of atmospheric aerosol particles and their resulting warm cloud-nucleation properties
Atmospheric aerosol particles are a major component of the troposphere and affect regional and global atmospheric chemistry and climate. The size and chemistry of these particles influences the warm and cold cloud nucleation ability and optical properties of the aerosol particles. This dissertation investigates the atmospheric chemistry of aerosol particles and their role in warm cloud nucleation through a combination of laboratory experiments and field measurements. The effect of organics on the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of sea spray aerosols is described in Chapter 2. Sea spray aerosol produced by bubbling solutions composed of simplistic mixtures of NaCl and oleic acid or SDS had a significant effect on CCN activity, even in very small amounts; while artificial seawater solutions containing microorganisms, the common cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) and DMS-producing green algae (Ostreococcus), produced particles containing ̃34 times more carbon than the particles produced from pure ASW, with no significant change observed in the overall CCN activity. During the fall of 2007 and 2008, over 300, 000 acres burned in San Diego County wildfires. The resulting particle chemistry and estimated hygroscopicity during these wildfire events are explored in Chapter 3. The contribution of wildfire emissions were much larger and played a more significant role in affecting cloud condensation nuclei and total particle concentrations in 2007 than in 2008. The overall particle hygroscopicity during the biomass burning dominated periods was very similar; however in 2008, the particle hygroscopicity was dominated by local sources rather than biomass burning, due to the much smaller particle size mode. Owens Lake is one of the largest sources of PM₂.₅ in the Western Hemisphere, producing highly soluble dust plumes, and therefore there is great potential for those particles to impact cloud formation and possibly precipitation in the region. Chapter 4 explores particle chemistry and estimated hygroscopicity at Owens Lake. No significant change in particle hygroscopicity or CCN activity occurred concurrently with the change in mixing of particle classes during two different dust events at Owens Lake; indicating that the large dust particles were most likely completely CCN active and the smaller particles are likely dictating the hygroscopicity, as most of the dust particles are large enough and would activate to become CCN regardless of their hygroscopicity. The Cloud Indirect Forcing Experiment (CIFEX) took place to study the influence of aerosols on cloud properties at Trinidad Head, a coastal site in northern California representing clean marine air with periodic long-range transport. Chapters 5 & 6 explore particle chemistry, mixing state, optical properties and estimated hygroscopicity during CIFEX. Our measurements demonstrate how changes in hygroscopicity and optical properties evolve over time in the atmosphere as a function of particle chemistry and the mixing state of the aerosol. Two distinct oxalate events with enrichment of oxalate on different particle types and sizes suggest two separate sources of oxalate

NMR studies of the transcriptional inhibitor I kappa B alpha and its interaction with the transcription factor NF kappa B
One of the reasons why functional proteins might be unfolded or partly folded in vivo is the relative ease and rapidity by which they can be degraded when not in complex with their biological target. Previous data has indicated that the ankyrin repeat domain of IkappaBalpha, the primary inhibitor of NF-kappaB, may be incompletely folded in the absence of NF-kappaB. Based on this premise, the initial goal of this work was to investigate the solution structure and dynamics of the ankyrin repeat domain of IkappaBalpha in its free state by NMR. In the Chapters 2 and 3, solution NMR experiments on free IkappaBalpha(67-206) protein, that allowed us to characterize the structure and dynamics of this "folded" part of the IkappaBalpha ankyrin repeat domain will be presented. A battery of NMR experiments, including chemical shifts, NOEs, amide proton exchange, backbone relaxation and residual IkappaBalpha and a peptide representing the nuclear localization sequence of NF- kappaB is characterized by NMR. Again, a battery of NMR and binding experiments are presented that show that the NLS polypeptide (residues 293-321 of NF-kappaB(p65) folds upon binding to IkappaBalpha providing a mechanistic explanation of how it is sequestered by inhibitor binding. In the final chapter, the full-length ankyrin repeat domain of IkappaBalpha ; is characterized. The fifth and sixth ankyrin repeats show very few cross peaks in the NMR indicating that they are weakly folded and in conformational exchange. By taking advantage of NMR data obtained on the bound protein as well as on a stabilized mutant, a good number of resonance assignments could be made. These assignments facilitated the interpretation of backbone dynamics experiments that allowed us to characterize the dynamics of the weakly- folded fifth and sixth repeats of the I&kappa;B&alpha; ankyrin repeat domain. Since the function of IkappaBalpha is so intimately related to its folded state, the experiments described herein should provide not only a detailed characterization of the free form of IkappaBalpha, but also important insights into its function in vivo through characterization of its complex with NF-kappaB

Understanding Star Formation and AGN Activity at z~2-3
There is compelling evidence that the growth of supermassive black holes and the stellar populations of their host galaxies are intricately linked. At the same time, the exact relationship between the buildup of stellar mass and the growth of supermassive black holes is still not well understood. At z ~ 2, both star-formation and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity in the universe were at peak levels, and this epoch is ideal for exploring the coevolution of stars and supermassive black holes. This dissertation examines high-redshift galaxies, looking at the particular properties of star-forming galaxies, the stellar populations of AGNs and the relationship between black hole and star-formation activity at z ~ 2 - 3. I have used the magnification afforded by gravitational lensing of z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies to measure important physical properties of the stars and gas in these galaxies. Using near-IR spectroscopy, I have calculated the metallicities, ionization parameters, star-formation rates, and dynamical masses for two galaxies which help to explain the differences between local- and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The third and fourth chapters of this work cover the analysis of a sample of z ~ 2 - 3 AGNs drawn from the UV-selected Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) survey. I present a rest-frame UV composite spectrum for this sample of AGNs. This spectrum shows many emission and absorption features, such as HI Lyman-alpha, NV1240, NIV1483,1486, CIV1548,1550, HeII1640, and CIII1907,1909. Redshifted SiIV1394 absorption provides evidence for outflowing high-ionization gas in these objects at speeds of 10^3 km/s. Finally, by using optical, near-IR, and mid-IR photometry, which covers the rest-frame UV to near-IR portions of the galaxies spectral energy distributions, I have modeled the SEDs of the AGNs that comprise this sample. I have developed a unique dual-component modeling approach that allows me to correct for the presence of an AGN. Based on these results, I have explored the relationship in the host galaxy between AGN activity, maturity of the stellar population, and regulation of star formation.

What to Expect When it's Unexpected: A Multi-Theoretical Approach to Exposure Therapy
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is the most widespread and effective intervention used for anxiety disorders.  Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is somewhat limited by divergent theories, as the most widespread theory, Emotional Processing Theory (Foa & Kozak, 1986), has not been empirically supported, and in fact, has been regularly refuted when tested.  An alternative can be drawn from associative learning theory by employing the Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) to model change during exposure therapy.  This model postulates that after a strong dose of exposure therapy to a target stimulus, the use of secondary exciter in conjunction with a target stimulus would allow additional learning to accrue to the target stimulus.   Study 1 applied this model by treating specific phobia of spiders with a 40-minute prolonged exposure to two spiders on day one, then providing an additional day of exposure where the control group again received exposure to the two spiders, and the experimental group received exposure to one spider and worms concurrently.  Results indicated that the intended manipulation was not effective at increasing expectancy due to the inclusion of worms; however, process analyses revealed a relationship of between session activation leading to better treatment outcomes.  Study 2 again applied this model by inflating the outcome expectancy belief on a second day of exposure, by providing the experimental group with information about the spiders being more aggressive than usual.  In a pilot sample the results were mixed as to whether the intervention was effective at increasing expectancy of an adverse event occurring, though it did provide important information about the feasibility of utilizing scripts to inflate outcome expectancy without risking inflated drop-out.  While limited support was found for the model in these two studies, the large number of limitations warranted future work to be done with more acutely anxious samples.  Further, future studies should look to employ more powerful forms of secondary exciters to reveal effects above and beyond the already powerful intervention.

The antifungal activity of mutafurans A-G is reportedChapter 3 describes the identification of the feeding deterrent chemotype in the marine sponge Phorbas amaranthus against the common bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. Two types of sulfated sterols were isolated from the highly deterrent polar extracts: amaranzoles A-F and amaroxocanes A and B. The structure determination of amaranzoles A and B was assisted by synthesis of optically active hydroxy- phenyl imidazole model compounds for comparison of NMR and CD to the natural products. Amaraoxocane B showed feeding deterrent activity against Thalassoma bifasciatum at higher than natural concentrations. Chapter 4 describes the identification of bis-piperidine alkaloids, xestoproxamines A-C from the marine sponge Neopetrosia proxima. The stereochemistry of the C23 methyl group in xestoproxamine C was elucidated by a Hoffman degradation/ cross metathesis protocol and comparison to an optically active model. A method was established to assign the absolute configuration of the bis-piperidine core in xestoproxamines A-C by chemical conversion to bis-p- bromophenacyl quaternary ammonium salts, and interpretation of the resulting ECCD spectra. The cytotoxic activity for xestoproxamines A-C is reported. Chapter 5 describes the isolation and structure determination of mollenyne A from Spirastrella mollis.

Antimutagenic specificities of two plant glycosylases, oxoguanine glycosylase and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase, assayed in vivo
The base-excision repair process protects genomes by removing and replacing altered bases in DNA. Two analogous glycosylases, oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG), can start the process by removing oxidized guanine, the most common modification that leads to misreading of DNA. Plants possess genes for both types of glycosylases. We have tested the hypothesis that the two enzymes in plants have diverged in their specificities by inserting the genes for each enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana L. into Escherichia coli strains designed to indicate the frequencies of the six possible single-base changes. Both enzymes retain the ability to reduce the rate of GC --> TA transversion mutations. Both enzymes also reduce the frequency of two other base-change mutations, GC --> AT and AT --> TA. We do not find a divergence in the repair capabilities of the two enzymes, as measured in E. coli, although surprisingly FPG appears to increase the rate of mutations in one particular strain.

On the theory and application of pattern maximum likelihood
Pattern Maximum Likelihood (PML) is a method of probability estimation that works well for large alphabets. It does not assume that all elements from the unknown alphabet have been observed. PML outperforms the traditional Maximum Likelihood for sequences, and it is particularly useful when the sample size is small. In this dissertation we study both the theory and application of PML. For the theory part, we extend the previous results on the properties of PML, and also show how to find the PML distributions analytically for patterns of simple forms. For general patterns, PML probabilities can be approximated using a previously developed EM algorithm, which we will prove to be equivalent to a generalized Gradient Ascend Method. We also use the algorithm to conduct experiments on different distributions and evaluate the performance of PML. In addition, we investigate the calculation of pattern probability. We show that the pattern probability is closely related to symmetric polynomials, and it can be written as a summation over graphs using power sums. Along the way we reveal a relation between pattern probability and the enumeration of certain connected graphs as well as inversion-free trees. For applications, we show how PML can be used to predict the number of new symbols that would appear in a future sample. We conduct experiments on various distributions and compare PML to the method of Good & Toulmin and the method of Efron & Thisted. We demonstrate that PML outperforms the other methods even if the future sample size is large. Finally we apply PML to authenticating the authorship of the Taylor poem, attributed to Shakespeare, and conclude that it is consistent with Efron and Thisted's models. PML deals with samples from a single distribution. In the last part of this dissertation we extend PML to set-patterns where multiple samples are observed from concurrent Bernoulli processes. Analogous to the single-process patterns, we show that for certain forms of set-patterns we can find the exact Set-pattern Maximum Likelihood (SPML) probabilities analytically. Furthermore, for general set- patterns we extend the previous EM algorithm to approximate the SPML probabilities. We also show that for samples taken from Poisson distributions the set-pattern is reduced to the single-process pattern problem

Development and plasticity of dorsal and ventral visual functions : insights from behavioral and FMRI investigations of bilateral spastic cerebral palsy
Bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (BSCP) is the most common form of cerebral palsy, and has risen in prevalence in recent years as advances in neonatal care improve survival rates for at-risk infants. In addition to the motor disability that defines the disorder, affected individuals often demonstrate pervasive visual cognitive deficits. Although the typical pattern of brain injury predicts greater compromise of dorsal than ventral stream visual functions, behavioral evidence is currently limited and no studies have evaluated this prediction using functional neuroimaging methods. To further characterize the nature and severity of visual cognitive deficits in BSCP, we probed dorsal and ventral stream functioning in typically developing 8-10 year-old children (n=15), adults (n=15), and children and adolescents with BSCP (n=6), using working memory tasks for locations and faces. In Study 1, behavioral and FMRI data were compared across child and adult control groups to chart the normal course of developmental change in dorsal and ventral stream functioning. Study 2 explored the relative compromise of dorsal and ventral stream functions in BSCP participants via a series of individual case studies. Results of Study 1 revealed continued refinement of dorsal and ventral stream functioning from mid-childhood through adulthood. Across both tasks, ongoing development was apparent at the behavioral level through improvements in speed and accuracy of performance, and at the neural level through increasing reliance on higher-order prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Overall, the data from Study 2 underscored a striking degree of resilience in the face of early brain injury. BSCP participants as a whole performed within normal limits on both tasks and demonstrated only slight departures from expected profiles of regional brain activation. Specifically, across individual cases, findings converged to suggest subtle inefficiencies with face processing and modest reduction in BOLD response in dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Results will be discussed with reference to theories of visual cognitive and prefrontal dysfunction in BSCP, the likely inadequacy of predictions based on adult structure-function correspondences in the study of early brain injury, protective socioeconomic factors potentially relevant to our sample, and implications for neuroplasticity

Rescue of nonsense mutations by amlexanox in human cells
Abstract


Background
Nonsense mutations are at the origin of many cancers and inherited genetic diseases. The consequence of nonsense mutations is often the absence of mutant gene expression due to the activation of an mRNA surveillance mechanism called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Strategies to rescue the expression of nonsense-containing mRNAs have been developed such as NMD inhibition or nonsense mutation readthrough.


Methods
Using a dedicated screening system, we sought molecules capable to block NMD. Additionally, 3 cell lines derived from patient cells and harboring a nonsense mutation were used to study the effect of the selected molecule on the level of nonsense-containing mRNAs and the synthesis of proteins from these mutant mRNAs.


Results
We demonstrate here that amlexanox, a drug used for decades, not only induces an increase in nonsense-containing mRNAs amount in treated cells, but also leads to the synthesis of the full-length protein in an efficient manner. We also demonstrated that these full length proteins are functional.


Conclusions
As a result of this dual activity, amlexanox may be useful as a therapeutic approach for diseases caused by nonsense mutations.

Determination of Cellular Pathways that Lead to Spontaneous and Induced Mutagenesis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>
While much work has been done to elucidate the mechanisms through which mutations occur and the corresponding DNA repair, there is still much to be discovered in global pathways not directly related to the site of mutation, and how these pathways affect ensuing mutagenesis. In this dissertation, I will elucidate global pathways involved and how they influence both spontaneous and induced mutagenesis. We conducted a screen of six genotoxic agents against a single gene knockout library of Escherichia coli, and discovered a set of mutants that are involved in the cytotoxicity of these agents. In particular, folate biosynthetic pathways were found to be involved in the cell's resistance to a cytidine base analog. Next, using a papillation assay, we discovered four mutants involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway that show decreased levels of 5-azacytidine-induced mutagenesis, implicating RNA turnover and competing nucleotide pools in exacerbating this mutagenesis. We also show that the rNDP pool generated by the degradation of RNA is responsible for spontaneous mutations that result from replication errors, and these are normally repaired by the mismatch repair (MMR) system and prevented by 8-oxo-dGTP diphosphatase. Our results suggest that the rNDP pools derived from RNA degradation fuel replication to the point that replication errors escape the exonucleolytic editing function of DNA polymerase, but can be dealt with by the MMR system.  We propose that in the absence of the cell's primary exoribonuclease (polynucleotide phosphorylase), the reduced rNDP pools limit replication to the point where the editing function can correct replication errors, and the MMR system is not required. Additionally, we discovered that in the absence of this exoribonuclease, there is an increase in frameshift mutations in the mutational spectrum, possibly due to the minimization of normal replication errors and revealing secondary mutations.

Complement activation fragment C5a receptors, CD88 and C5L2, are associated with neurofibrillary pathology
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative dementia characterized by the decline of cognition and the presence of neuropathological changes including neuronal loss, neurofibrillary pathology and extracellular senile plaques. A neuroinflammatory process is also triggered and complement activation has been hypothesized to have a relevant role in this local inflammatory response. C5a, a proinflammatory anaphylatoxin generated after complement activation, exerts its chemotactic and inflammatory functions through the CD88 receptor while the more recently discovered C5L2 receptor has been postulated to have an anti-inflammatory role. Previously, we reported that a CD88 specific antagonist (PMX205) decreased the pathology and improved cognition in transgenic models of AD suggesting that C5a/C5aR interaction has an important role in the progression of the disease.
				
				
					
						Methods
					
					The present study characterizes the expression of the two receptors for C5a in human brain with confirmed post mortem diagnosis of vascular dementia (VD) or AD as well as age matched controls by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis using several antibodies against different epitopes of the human receptors.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The CD88 and C5L2 antibodies revealed increased expression of both receptors in AD samples as compared to age-matched controls or VD brain tissue by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, using multiple antibodies and distinct cohorts of brain tissue. Immunostaining showed that both the C5L2 and CD88 antibodies similarly labeled abundant neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites associated with plaques in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of AD cases. In contrast, little or no neuronal staining, tangles or dystrophic neurites associated with plaques were observed in control or VD brains. CD88 and C5L2 receptors are associated with both early (AT8) and mature (PHF1) neurofibrillary tangles and can be found either independently or colocalized with each other.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The observed association of CD88 and C5L2 with neurofibrillary pathology suggests a common altered pathway of degradation.

Structural and Therapeutic Investigations of Human Lipoxygenase
The research in this dissertation describes the investigations of potential therapeutics as well as structural and allosteric properties of human lipoxygenases. Lipoxygenases (LOX) are a ubiquitous enzyme found in plants and mammals, of which are responsible for regulation of inflammation in humans. Uncontrolled inflammation in humans may result in various types of cancers and inflammatory diseases, for which LOX is implicated. This has prompted the Holman lab to explore a diverse range on potential therapeutic targets in hopes of discovery of novel selective LOX inhibitors, while concurrently investigating the structural and kinetic properties of the enzyme.Through use of conventional kinetic and structural studies we investigated the role of the polycystin-1 lipoxygenase alpha-toxin (PLAT) domain's role in enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation. Previous studies had implicated the PLAT domain as being a critical aspect of the allosteric binding site. This theory was explored through extensive investigations into the resulting effects elicited by removal of the PLAT domain from human epithelial 15-lipoxygenase-2 (15-LOX-2). In chapter 2 we present our findings supporting our previous concept, that indeed the PLAT domain plays a key role in the allosteric properties of 15-LOX-2.Chapter 3 describes collaboration with the National Institutes Chemical Genomic Center, where we report the discovery of a novel dual inhibitor targeting fungal sterol 14á-demethylase (CYP51 or Erg11) and human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) with improved potency against 5-LOX due to its reduction of the iron center by its phenylenediamine core. The phenylenediamine core was then translated into the structure of ketoconazole, a highly effective anti-fungal medication for seborrheic dermatitis, to generate a novel compound, ketaminazole. Ketaminazole was found to be a potent dual selective inhibitor against human 5-LOX and CYP51 in vitro.Understanding the mode of action of lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors is critical to determining their efficacy in the cell. The pseudoperoxidase assay is an important tool for establishing if an inhibitor is reductive in nature. In chapter 4, we evaluate the effectiveness of two distinct pseudoperoxidase methods in characterizing known inhibitor's redox properties; the "234 nm" decomposition and xylenol orange assay. In addition, we identified rapid inactivation occurring with particular inhibitors in the pseudoperoxidase assay. To account for the resulting inaccuracy attributed to this inhibitor dependent inactivation, we modified the pre-existing "234 nm" assay allowing for observation of this inactivation.

Imaging cell wall architecture in single Zinnia elegans tracheary elements
The chemical and structural organization of the plant cell wall was examined in Zinnia elegans tracheary elements (TEs), which specialize by developing prominent secondary wall thickenings underlying the primary wall during xylogenesis in vitro. Three imaging platforms were used in conjunction with chemical extraction of wall components to investigate the composition and structure of single Zinnia TEs. Using fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-tagged Clostridium thermocellum family 3 carbohydrate-binding module specific for crystalline cellulose, we found that cellulose accessibility and binding in TEs increased significantly following an acidified chlorite treatment. Examination of chemical composition by synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared spectromicroscopy indicated a loss of lignin and a modest loss of other polysaccharides in treated TEs. Atomic force microscopy was used to extensively characterize the topography of cell wall surfaces in TEs, revealing an outer granular matrix covering the underlying meshwork of cellulose fibrils. The internal organization of TEs was determined using secondary wall fragments generated by sonication. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting rings, spirals, and reticulate structures were composed of fibrils arranged in parallel. Based on these combined results, we generated an architectural model of Zinnia TEs composed of three layers: an outermost granular layer, a middle primary wall composed of a meshwork of cellulose fibrils, and inner secondary wall thickenings containing parallel cellulose fibrils. In addition to insights in plant biology, studies using Zinnia TEs could prove especially productive in assessing cell wall responses to enzymatic and microbial degradation, thus aiding current efforts in lignocellulosic biofuel production.

[gene, animal, expression, homeodomain, important, factor, organism, transcription, protein]

Gene expression and evolution
The control of the spatial expression of gene products is one of the most important and complex processes contributing to the embryogenesis of metazoans. This control can be achieved through many levels of regulation. Transcription factors such as homeodomain proteins are important regulators of the phenotypic output of cells in which they are expressed. The Hox genes are a genomic cluster of homeodomain containing master control proteins, each of which is expressed in, and controls the morphology of a specific anteroposterior domain. While transcription factors have long been known to be an important type of regulatory molecule, recent discoveries have shown that there is always more out there for biology to teach us. The discovery of microRNAs has led to a whole new paradigm, in which the expression of many genes is controlled by the activity of tiny RNAs that were once invisible to researchers. The Hox complexes of bilaterian animals typically contain a few microRNAs, but nearly all of them have the mir-10 gene. This ancient regulatory molecule is conserved in its sequence, genomic position, and to some extent its spatial expression over evolutionary time scales. In Drosophila melanogaster, this gene produces two mature microRNA products, each of which has strong complementarity to conserved sequences in Hox genes. These microRNAs are also expressed in patterns that are complementary to these potential target genes. Despite these correlations, disruption of the normal expression of the mir-10 gene does not strongly effect the expression of these genes, but may instead function to canalize their expression. Appendages are structures common to a wide variety of animal body plans. When compared between distantly related animals there are no obvious structural characteristics which suggest they are homologous, yet they are patterned by similar transcription factors. Since these structures are not likely ancestral, their seemingly conserved patterning mechanism may have been acquired through independent co-option of a pre-existing network of genes for a similar purpose. The core genes responsible for patterning the proximodistal axis of appendages are also expressed in domains of the anterior neurectoderm that are conserved among distantly related animals and function to pattern the anteroposterior axis of the head. This ancient gene network was likely co-opted in order to pattern the axis of appendages during the early evolution of bilaterian animals. The advent of multicellularity has provided our planet with a rich variety of organisms. It is unknown what was necessary to allow single celled organisms to give rise eventually to the people that would research them, but there are many proteins that are assumed to be important for this process. Multicellular organisms are composed of many different types of cells, and homeodomain transcription factors are often involved in the specification of these cell types. The nearest relatives to animals are choanoflagellates, which are simple single celled organisms that sometimes exist in colonies. Although most animals have a specific set of homeodomain containing genes, most these are either evolutionary novelties specific to animals or have been secondarily lost in choanoflagellates. For this reason it is unknown what role homeodomain proteins played in the process of multicellularization that gave rise to animals, but further studies may provide exciting answers

To study this prediction, we have producedCo/Pd multilayers with depth-dependent Co layer thickness. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows that thethickness grading results in a corresponding magnetic anisotropy gradient. Magnetometry reveals that theanisotropy gradient promotes domain nucleation upon magnetization reversal - a clear experimental demonstrationof the effectiveness of graded anisotropy for reducing write field.

K3 surfaces. We show that there exist infinitely many isolated sections on certain K3
fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds and the subgroup of the N´eron-Severi group generated
by these sections is not finitely generated. This also gives examples of K3 surfaces
over the function field F of a complex curve with Zariski dense F-rational points,

Market Concepts, Competing Technologies and Cost Challenges for Automotive and Stationary Applications
The concept of the fuel cell traces its roots all the way back to William Grove’s famous experiments on water electrolysis in 1839, but the commercialization history of fuel cell technologies remains rather limited over 150 years later. Throughout the later part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries, attempts were made to develop fuel cells that could directly convert coal or some other carbon material into electricity, but these attempts were unsuccessful because scientific knowledge of material properties and electrochemistry was lacking. The first fuel cell capable of producing significant quantities of electricity was developed by Francis Bacon in 1932. This system used an alkaline electrolyte and nickel electrodes to produce electricity using hydrogen and oxygen. By 1952, Bacon had produced a 5kW system, and this provided much of the basis for further work on fuel cells in the 1950s and 1960s.
      Fuel cell development received a boost in the late 1950s, when the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) determined that fuel cell technology was the most promising option for producing electricity in space in a compact and safe fashion. Nuclear power was considered too dangerous, batteries were too heavy, and solar power was too cumbersome. NASA eventually funded over 200 research contracts for fuel cell technology, and used both alkaline and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in the Apollo, Gemini, and space shuttle programs. The Gemini program utilized 1 kW PEMFC units from 1965 to 1966, while 1.5 kW alkaline fuel cell (AFC) units were used in the Apollo program from 1968 to 1972. More recently, three 12kW AFC units have been used for at least 87 missions with 65 000 h flight time in the space shuttle Orbiter.1 Altogether more than 100 manned space flights have been made by the US, totaling over 90 000 h of operating time, and all of these have used fuel cell systems developed by the United Technologies Corporation (UTC) of Windsor, CT.
      The experience of UTC and its International Fuel Cells (IFC) unit with fuel cells for the space program led to the development of the first truly commercial fuel cell system, the PC25 phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) product. This stationary fuel cell generating system, now in its third generation design, produces electricity from natural gas that is reformed into a hydrogen-rich gas stream before being supplied to the fuel cell stack. PC25s were first manufactured by IFC’s ONSI division in 1991, and approximately 200 of these 200kW fuel cell systems have now been purchased and deployed throughout the US and in other countries. Many of these systems were either procured under a US Department of Defense (DOD) fuel cell purchase program, where about 30 units were purchased and operated at US DOD facilities, or through a $1000kW−1 fuel cell purchase subsidy program also administered through the US DOD.2
      For motor vehicle applications, General Motors has the longest history among major automakers, having experimented with fuel cell technology in the 1960s and having demonstrated the world’s first drivable fuel cell passenger vehicle in 1966. General Motors designed this vehicle, called the “Electrovan”, with liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel tanks, and it achieved a range of 150 miles and a top speed of 70 miles h−1. The Electrovan program demonstrated General Motors’ early interest in developing fuel cell vehicles for commercial use, but it also uncovered the several obstacles that then became the focus of research and development. These included the needs for improved electronics, breakthroughs in electrochemistry, and new fuel cell stack and system materials.3
      During the decade of the 1990s, fuel cells experienced an intense phase of research and development that led to the formation of many new companies and the establishment of new divisions within established companies, and a complex series of corporate mergers and re-organizations. Many different companies are now planning to commercialize several different fuel cell technologies for a wide range of markets. These fuel cell technologies include the PEMFC, AFC, and PAFC technologies mentioned above, but also higher temperature solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) types. A variation of the PEMFC can also use methanol directly, without first reforming it into hydrogen; it is known as a direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC). There also is an interesting class of metal/air fuel cells that could also be considered “mechanically recharged” batteries, and that may be attractive for certain niche applications.
      Fuel cells are currently being developed for the following applications:
      • power for portable electronic devices (5–50W)
      • power for remote telecommunications applications
      (100W–1 kW)
      • power for construction and outdoor recreational uses
      (1–3 kW)
      • auxiliary power units for cars and trucks, and motive
      power for scooters (3–5 kW)
      • stationary power generation (1 kW–50MW)
      • electric passenger car, utility vehicle, and bus power systems (20kW–250 kW).
      Some fuel cell companies are focusing on a single fuel cell type and application combination, while other companies are investigating more than one fuel cell technology and various potential applications. The following sections of this chapter briefly describe the current state of fuel cell industries for the stationary power and transportation markets, some of the commercialization plans for these two sectors, and additional thoughts about prospects for market commercialization of fuel cell technology. We do not discuss in detail the prospects for fuel cell for portable electronic devices, since this application is rather distinct and still at a relatively early stage of development.

Competing Models for the Timing of Cryogenian Glaciation: Evidence From the Kingston Peak Formation, Southeastern California
The Neoproterozoic (~750-635 Ma) Kingston Peak Formation, southeastern California, is a coarse-grained siliciclastic interval, with laterally extensive carbonate marker horizons, deposited in extensional basins between two regionally extensive carbonate intervals. Thirty sections measured and two geologic maps produced show a wedge-shaped geometry unique to extensional settings and clarify the conformable relationship between the coarse-grained deposits and the overlying Noonday Dolomite.  Carbonate intervals were sampled extensively to determine the value of chemostratigraphic correlation in this interval.  A newly mapped regional unconformity near the base of the formation serves to separate the overlying tectonic sequence of the Kingston Peak Formation from the underlying deposits related to the platformal Beck Spring Dolomite.  A glacigenic influence is inferred based on the presence of striated clasts in one of several basins, facilitating global correlation with similar coarse-grained deposits thought to record the Earth's most severe ice age.The Kingston Peak Formation provides a rare example of ancient glacial successions in which the relationship between the sedimentary packaging in vertical and lateral dimensions is apparent in outcrop.  This allows the influence on stratigraphic development by the series of tectonic and climate events to be reconstructed without relying on regional or global correlation.  These relations show the progressive development of extensional basins from northwest to southeast in the Death Valley region.  The exceptional exposure in this region reveals bounding synsedimentary faults allowing tectonic and climate influence on coarse-grained facies to be resolved as well as the lateral persistence and stacking of course grained units.  Through-going carbonate marker beds recording regional sea level rise provide timelines allowing the reconstruction and relative timing of climate and rifting events.  These relations identify that the Kingston Peak Formation records a complicated regional history in which the record of rifting and climate are intimately related through fault subsidence and the creation of accommodation space. The availability of accommodation space from tectonism biases the sedimentary record of climate change.  Glacial deposits are not necessarily uniquely timed with glacial conditions, but with preservational conditions.  This interplay between tectonism and related coarse-grained deposits obscures both the timing and extent of similar coarse-grained deposits related to glaciation.

Human platelet metabolic network reconstruction
In the past, metabolic network reconstruction has been used extensively for the analysis and discoveries in microorganisms such as E.Coli. furthermore, after the completion of human genome sequencing and building of the first human metabolic network reconstruction (Recon 1) in 2007, there has been a growing interest in reconstruction of tissue-specific metabolic networks based on the human metabolic network reconstruction. This work is an attempt to reconstruct human platelet's metabolic network based on the Recon 1. The advancements in proteomics techniques have provided us with a wealth of high throughput dataset on human platelets. These datasets were carefully reviewed and annotated in order to obtain a solid and comprehensive proteomic profile of human platelet. Then the metabolic functionality and capabilities of human platelet were identified in the literature. After applying some modifications and refinements to the Recon 1 to accommodate these metabolic capabilities, an algorithmic approach was used to tailor the platelet specific conditions to the Recon1. Once the in silico model of human platelet was created, its network properties and models functionalities were characterized using constraint based analysis such as flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis. The model's solution space was further investigated using a sampling method and coset analysis. Finally the effect of aspirin on platelet was simulated and analyzed using the tools mentioned

MEMS-based Massively-parallelized Mechanoporation Instrumentation for Ultrahigh Throughput Cellular Manipulation
Many applications in cell biology, genetic engineering, cell-based therapeutics, and drug discovery require precise and safe methods for introducing membrane-impermeable molecules into cells. This can be implemented satisfactorily by microinjection. However, disadvantages of traditional manual microinjection include high degree of operator skill, low throughput and labor-intensiveness. Many studies have focused on developing automated and high-throughput systems for microinjection to address these limitations. However, none have provided sufficient throughput for applications such as ex vivo cell therapy, where manipulation of many millions of cells is required. Herein, we propose an ultrahigh throughput (UHT) mechanoporation concept that seeks to address these limitations. The mechanoporation device is a massively-parallelized MEMS-based platform for passively delivering molecules into living cells via mechanical cell membrane penetration. Studies focusing on device design, fabrication and validation at the proof-of-concept level are presented in this dissertation. Detailed system concept and design is introduced, which integrates functions of cell transfer, capture, penetration and release into a single piece of instrumentation using a microfluidic approach. System operating parameters are analytically analyzed and numerically simulated. Results from these studies agree with previous studies by others in related applications, and suggest reasonable operation feasibility without detrimental effect on cells. Those estimated operation parameters also provide basis to develop test models in practical cell studies. The device fabrication utilized conventional silicon MEMS technologies, and we successfully produced millimeter-scale device chips containing an array of ten thousand hemispherical capture wells with monolithically integrated solid penetrators. A flow circuit system involving a syringe pump, pressure transducer, and fixture set supporting the device chip was developed, and preliminary functional testing was carried out. Device validation tests using K562 cells obtained about 15% average penetration efficiency of live cells after manipulation. Subsequent testing with fluorescent beads and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cells identified several key issues responsible for the lower-than-expected efficiency, thus suggesting that improved performance may be possible with further system and operation optimization. The UHT mechanoporation device developed in this effort shows promise for providing an efficient and safe method for introducing membrane impermeable molecules into cells with ultrahigh throughput. Moreover, these studies also represent key steps towards our long-term goal of developing instrumentation capable of UHT cellular manipulation via active microinjection. This new instrumentation will have broad potential for advancing understanding of fundamental cellular processes, as well as facilitating clinical translation of cell-based therapies.

Reactivity of Bis(amino)cyclopropenylidenes (BACs) and Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs):
Carbenes have played an important role as reactive intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry for many years. The isolation of stable versions of these important carbon species has resulted in an explosion of research and applications not only as ancillary ligands for transition metal (TM) based catalysts, but also as small molecule activators, and organocatalysts in their own right. One aspect of my work is exploration of the reactivity of bis(diisopropylamino) cyclopropenylidene (BAC) and cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs), first isolated by our group. Due to their unique steric and electronic properties, these species are perhaps the most distinct representatives of the carbene ligand set and as such allow the isolation of a variety of catalytically active TM complexes unobtainable by other routes and frequently different from their cyclic diamino carbene (NHCs) counterparts. Inspired by the novel reactivity of these new carbenes in TM chemistry, I have also explored the activation of heteroallenes using these species. Similarly to NHCs, CAACs and BACs react with carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide and to give the corresponding zwitterionic betaines. However, unlike NHCs, a second equivalent of CS2 reacts with the BAC-CS2 adduct leading to a bicyclic thieno2,3-diamino-1,3-dithiole-2-thione, which results from a novel ring expansion process. Surprisingly, and also in contrast to NHCs, CAAC does not react with carbodiimide, whereas BAC exclusively gives a ring expanded product, analogous to that obtained with CS2. The intermediate amidinate can be trapped, using a lithium tetrafluoroborate adduct of BAC as a carbene surrogate.In related work, I demonstrate that depending on their electronic and steric properties, stable singlet carbenes can react with white phosphorus at room temperature to yield P4, P3, P2, and even P1 fragments that are stabilized by the carbene moiety. Therefore, stable singlet carbenes can achieve the tasks that transition metals do with P4, namely activation, aggregation, and importantly, fragmentation. The next challenge is to use the resulting adducts, to prepare useful organophosphorus derivatives. This would avoid the use of Cl2 gas, which is important to meet the growing demand in phosphorus derivatives using environmentally friendly processes.

Accounting for Variation of Diminutive Formation in Porteño Spanish
Diminutive formation, although highly productive in Spanish, is not uniform across all dialects; and even within a specific dialect there is a certain degree of variation amongst speakers. The Maximum Entropy model (Hayes and Wilson) is a probabilistic theory that captures free variation by assigning weights to different phonotactical constraints that are applied in a formation process. The data used in this study, 650 diminutives collected from each one of six different Spanish native speakers of Porteño (Buenos Aires) Spanish, were processed using the Maximum Entropy model in order to specify the constraints that restricted their formation process. In addition, the interaction of this process with phonological processes was drawn for the particular case of words ending in /s/. The proposed constraints and interaction with phonology achieved a very significant account for the variation of diminutive formation in Porteño Spanish.

Ciliopathies : molecular and genetic basis for Ahi1 function in retinal degeneration
Ciliopathies comprise a highly heterogeneous group of genetic disorders attributed to dysfunction of the primary cilium. Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy that primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS), and is specifically characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, and neonatal apnea associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and malformation of the midbrain-hindbrain junction. Absence of AHI1, which encodes a cilium-localized protein, has been shown to cause a form of Joubert syndrome that is also highly penetrant for retinal degeneration¹'²but the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Joubert syndrome and related disorders are not well understood. To study the role of Ahi1 in a more tractable model, I have targeted the Ahi1 gene in the mouse to generate germline and conditional null alleles, and used tissue culture, mouse genetic analysis, histopathology and immunochemical techniques to study these mouse mutants. In contrast to human patients with the disease, brains from Ahi1-/- mice were nominally affected. Despite this, analysis of retina from Ahi1-/- mice revealed a phenotype consistent with the retinal involvement frequently observed in patients with deleterious AHI1 mutations. Specifically, Ahi1 knockout mice failed to form outer segments (OS), and showed abnormal distribution of opsin throughout photoreceptors. This was followed by rapid degeneration of the outer nuclear layer through apoptotic mechanisms attributed to the ectopic accumulation of opsin. Through analysis of double mutant mouse lines, I also found that the phenotype displayed dosage-sensitive genetic interactions with Nphp1, another ciliopathy gene. Although not a primary cause of retinal blindness in humans, I found that an allele of AHI1 modifies the relative risk of retinal degeneration greater than 7 fold within a cohort of nephronopthisis patients. These data support context-specific roles for AHI1 as a contributor to retinopathy and may explain a proportion of the variability of retinal phenotypes observed in nephronophthisis

Methods for determining and confirming age for Sebastes rufus from otoliths were examined. The periodicity of growth zone formation and of calcium deposition in otoliths was studied to verify ages estimated from counts of otolith growth zones;    results were inconclusive.
      Pb-210/Ra-226 activity ratios were measured in otoliths to confirm ages estimated from counts of otolith growth zones. Radiometric ages agreed well with growth zone counts, giving substantial validity to them and suggesting longevity of 50 years or more Sebastes rufus.
      Otolith length, width, area, perimeter and weight were evaluated as criteria for determining age. All parameters were highly correlated with growth zone counts, with otolith weight showing the most promise as an age predictor.

Effect of Structured Channels on Controlling Interparticle Spacing in Inertial Microfluidics
Single-cell microfluidic analysis platforms are powerful tools in the characterization of rare phenotypes that exist as subpopulations and may be hidden by bulk averages.  Operating at high throughputs and high concentrations is often necessary for processing large volumes required to isolate these rare populations and obtain statistical relevance.  The current challenge of working at high concentrations lies in the inability of systems to perform relevant analysis or separation with high accuracy or purity when the interparticle spacing is reduced beyond the system response time, resulting in coincident events.  This work proposes the use of structured channels to control interparticle spacing with an inertial microfluidics platform capable of operating at high throughputs (up to 10,000 particles/sec), high concentrations (1-3 million particles/mL), and with heterogeneous cell populations (16% cell size variation).  Local expansion-contraction structures and extended chambers are used in series to induce secondary flows that promote repulsion between neighboring particles reliably (>98%) beyond a 40-µm threshold.  This use of passive methods to control spacing presents a more robust alternative to active methods such as squeezing sheath fluid or electric and magnetic field manipulation.

Energy spread reduction of electron beams produced via laser wakefield acceleration
Laser wakefield acceleration of electrons holds great promise for producing ultra-compact stages of GeV scale, high quality electron beams for applications such as x-ray free electron lasers and high energy colliders. Ultra-high intensity laser pulses can be self-guided by relativistic plasma waves over tens of vacuum diffraction lengths, to give >1 GeV energy in cm-scale low density plasma using ionization-induced injection to inject charge into the wake at low densities. This thesis describes a series of experiments which investigates the physics of LWFA in the self-guided blowout regime. Beginning with high density gas jet experiments the scaling of the LWFA-produced electron beam energy with plasma electron density is found to be in excellent agreement with both phenomenological theory and with 3-D PIC simulations. It is also determined that self-trapping of background electrons into the wake exhibits a threshold as a function of the electron density, and at the densities required to produce electron beams with energies exceeding 1 GeV a different mechanism is required to trap charge into low density wakes. By introducing small concentrations of high-Z gas to the nominal He background the ionization-induced injection mechanism is enabled. Electron trapping is observed at densities as low as 1.3x10¹⁸ cm⁻³ in a gas cell target, and 1.45 GeV electrons are demonstrated for the first time from LWFA. This is currently the highest electron energy ever produced from LWFA. The ionization-induced trapping mechanism is also shown to generate quasi-continuous electron beam energies, which is undesirable for accelerator applications. By limiting the region over which ionization-induced trapping occurs, the energy spread of the electron beams can be controlled. The development of a novel two-stage gas cell target provides the capability to tailor the gas composition in the longitudinal direction, and confine the trapping process to occur only in a limited, defined region. Using this technique a 460 MeV electron beam was produced with an energy spread of 5%. This technique is directly scalable to multi-GeV electron beam generation with sub-percent energy spreads

Macrophages and angiogenesis: A role for Wnt signaling
Abstract
				Macrophages regulate many developmental and pathological processes in both embryonic and adult tissues, and recent studies have shown a significant role in angiogenesis. Similarly, Wnt signaling is fundamental to tissue morphogenesis and also has a role in vascular development. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the field of macrophage-regulated angiogenesis, with a focus on the role of macrophage-derived Wnt ligands. We review data that provide both direct and indirect evidence for macrophage-derived Wnt regulation of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis. Finally, we propose that Wnt signaling plays a central role in differentiation of tumor associated and wound infiltrating macrophages to a proangiogenic phenotype.

Low-Energy Charge and Spin Dynamics in Quantum Confined Systems
Condensed matter systems exhibit a variety of dynamical phenomena at low energy scales, from gigahertz (GHz) to terahertz (THz) frequencies in particular, arising from complex interplay between charge, spin, and lattice.  A large number of collective and elementary excitations in solids occur in this frequency range, which are further modified and enriched by scattering, interactions, and disorder.  Recent advancements in spectroscopic methods for probing low-energy dynamics allow us to investigate novel aspects of charge and spin dynamics in solids.  In this dissertation work, we used direct current (DC) conductivity, GHz, THz, and mid-infrared (MIR) techniques to provide significant new insights into interaction and disorder effects in low-dimensional systems.  Specifically, we have studied temperature-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) in single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), intra-exciton scattering in InGaAs quantum wells, and high-field MIR-induced band gaps in graphene.

Temperature-dependent resistance and MR were measured in an ensemble of SWCNTs from 0.3 to 350 K.  The resistance temperature behavior followed a 3D variable range hopping (VRH) behavior from 0.3 to ~100 K.  A positive MR was observed at temperatures above 25 K and could be fit with a spin-dependent VRH model; negative MR was seen at low temperatures. In the GHz regime, the ESR linewidth for SWCNTs was observed to narrow by as much as ~50% as the temperature was increased from 3 to 300 K, a phenomenon known as motional narrowing, suggesting that we are detecting the ESR of hopping spins.  From the linewidth change versus temperature, we find the hopping frequency to be 285 GHz.  For excitons in InGaAs quantum wells, we demonstrate the manipulation of intra-excitonic populations using intense, narrow-band THz pulses.  The THz radiation temporarily quenches the 1s emission, which is then followed by an enhancement and subsequent decay of 2s emission.  After the quenching, the 1s emission recovers and then eventually becomes enhanced, a demonstration of energy storage in intra-exciton states known as excitonic shelving.  We show that the diffusive Coulomb scattering between the 2p and 2s states produces a symmetry breaking, leading to a THz-field-induced 1s-to-2s exciton population transfer.

Role of cellular microenvironment in non-viral gene transfer
Gene delivery has widespread application in tissue regeneration and gene therapy. While non-viral gene delivery is less immunogenic as compared to viral gene delivery, it is hindered by its lack of efficiency. Studies aiming to improve the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery have mostly focused on improving the vector system. However, the cellular microenvironment where the cells reside is only beginning to be exploited as a means to enhance gene transfer. In this dissertation, the effect of different densities of extracellular matrix proteins namely collagen I (C I), vitronectin (Vt), laminin (Lm), collagen IV (C IV), fibronectin (Fn) and ECM gel (ECMg), and their combinations on gene transfer to mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) were studied. Protein coatings that resulted in well spread cells such as Fn, ECMg and C IV, resulted in 14.6-, 7- and 6.1- fold increase in transgene expression, respectively, when compared to uncoated surfaces. The transgene expression was up to 90% inhibited on C I coated surface, which led to less spread cells. Interestingly, the same trend was not observed for polyplex internalization, where protein coats that resulted in less spread cells, such as C I and Vt, resulted in higher polyplex internalization. Subsequently, decreased transgene expression corresponded with inhibited trafficking of the internalized complexes to the nucleus. The effect of combining multiple ECM proteins on non-viral gene transfer was also investigated. Surfaces coated with combination including C I resulted in inhibition of transgene expression.  In addition, surfaces coated with combination of Vt, C IV and Lm resulted in a statistically similar enhancement in transgene expression as compared to fibronectin. For all ECM combinations analyzed, the extent of cell spreading mediated by the ECM protein had a 70% correlation with the extent of overall gene transfer observed. The role of different endocytic pathways and cytoskeletal components on gene transfer was later analyzed on collagen I (C I) and fibronectin (Fn), which had opposite influence on gene transfer. The mechanism by which these ECM proteins affect non-viral gene transfer involved the endocytosis pathway used for polyplex uptake and intracellular tension. Fn was found to promote internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and this pathway brought about more efficient transfection than caveolae-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Likewise, the disruption of actin-myosin interactions resulted in an enhancement of gene transfer for cells plated on Fn coated surfaces, but not for cells plated on C I. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism by which these ECM molecules affect the process of gene transfer is not completely understood. The Rho subfamily of GTPases regulates a number of cellular processes including cell morphology, cytoskeletal dynamics and uptake pathways and they are activated to different extents by different ECM proteins. The involvement of RhoGTPases in the ECM protein-mediated enhancement of non-viral gene transfer was studied.  Fibronectin was used as the substrate for these studies. The interaction of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs) with fibronectin was found to activate  RhoGTPases (RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42). Inactivation of RhoGTPases using chemical inhibitor or expression of dominant negative genes resulted in significantly reduced transgene expression. However, the activation of RhoGTPases using chemical activators or expressing constitutively active genes did not further enhance transgene expression for cells plated on fibronectin. But, for cells plated on C I, which did not result in RhoGTPase activation, expression of constitutively active RhoA, Rac, Cdc42 genes resulted in enhanced non-viral gene transfer. Cells in the body exist in a 3-D microenvironment. Cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis as well as cellular morphology have been shown to be significantly different in 2-D versus 3-D. In part, these differences are due to differential signaling as a consequent of different cytoskeletal assembly and cell-matrix adhesions in 2-D and 3-D. To fully understand the mechanism of gene transfer in cells, L-polyethylenimine (LPEI) mediated non-viral gene transfer mechanism constituting pathways of endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics and RhoGTPases, was studied in 3-D using hyaluronic acid hydrogels, in comparison with 2-D using tissue culture plates.  Caveolae and clathrin mediated endocytosis were observed to regulate gene transfer in 2-D, while all three pathways of endocytosis namely clathrin and caveolae mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis regulated gene transfer in 3-D. Actin polymerization and RhoA mediated contractility highly contributed to efficient transgene expression in 3-D rather than 2-D. Furthermore, Rac and Cdc42 influenced internalization in 2-D but not in 3-D. In conclusion, endocytic pathways, cytoskeletal dynamics and RhoGTPase mediated signaling differentially modulated non-viral gene transfer in cells cultured in 2-D and 3-D. These results provide an understanding of the dimensionality of cell microenvironment to obtain efficient gene transfer for the purpose of tissue regeneration and gene therapy.We believe that the cellular microenvironment can be engineered to enhance the ability of cells to become transfected, and through understanding of the mechanisms by which the ECM affects non-viral gene transfer, better materials and transfection protocols can be achieved.

Functional genomics of a generalist parasitic plant: Laser microdissection of host-parasite interface reveals host-specific patterns of parasite gene expression
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Orobanchaceae is the only plant family with members representing the full range of parasitic lifestyles plus a free-living lineage sister to all parasitic lineages, Lindenbergia. A generalist member of this family, and an important parasitic plant model, Triphysaria versicolor regularly feeds upon a wide range of host plants. Here, we compare de novo assembled transcriptomes generated from laser micro-dissected tissues at the host-parasite interface to uncover details of the largely uncharacterized interaction between parasitic plants and their hosts.
				
				
					
						Results
					The interaction of Triphysaria with the distantly related hosts Zea mays and Medicago truncatula reveals dramatic host-specific gene expression patterns. Relative to above ground tissues, gene families are disproportionally represented at the interface including enrichment for transcription factors and genes of unknown function. Quantitative Real-Time PCR of a T. versicolor &#946;-expansin shows strong differential (120x) upregulation in response to the monocot host Z. mays; a result that is concordant with our read count estimates. Pathogenesis-related proteins, other cell wall modifying enzymes, and orthologs of genes with unknown function (annotated as such in sequenced plant genomes) are among the parasite genes highly expressed by T. versicolor at the parasite-host interface.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Laser capture microdissection makes it possible to sample the small region of cells at the epicenter of parasite host interactions. The results of our analysis suggest that T. versicolor&#8217;s generalist strategy involves a reliance on overlapping but distinct gene sets, depending upon the host plant it is parasitizing. The massive upregulation of a T. versicolor &#946;-expansin is suggestive of a mechanism for parasite success on grass hosts. In this preliminary study of the interface transcriptomes, we have shown that T. versicolor, and the Orobanchaceae in general, provide excellent opportunities for the characterization of plant genes with unknown functions.

Assessing the Impact of Differential Genotyping Errors on Rare Variant Tests of Association
Genotyping errors are well-known to impact the power and type I error rate in single marker tests of association. Genotyping errors that happen according to the same process in cases and controls are known as non-differential genotyping errors, whereas genotyping errors that occur with different processes in the cases and controls are known as differential genotype errors. For single marker tests, non-differential genotyping errors reduce power, while differential genotyping errors increase the type I error rate. However, little is known about the behavior of the new generation of rare variant tests of association in the presence of genotyping errors. In this manuscript we use a comprehensive simulation study to explore the effects of numerous factors on the type I error rate of rare variant tests of association in the presence of differential genotyping error. We find that increased sample size, decreased minor allele frequency, and an increased number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) included in the test all increase the type I error rate in the presence of differential genotyping errors. We also find that the greater the relative difference in case-control genotyping error rates the larger the type I error rate. Lastly, as is the case for single marker tests, genotyping errors classifying the common homozygote as the heterozygote inflate the type I error rate significantly more than errors classifying the heterozygote as the common homozygote. In general, our findings are in line with results from single marker tests. To ensure that type I error inflation does not occur when analyzing next-generation sequencing data careful consideration of study design (e.g. use of randomization), caution in meta-analysis and using publicly available controls, and the use of standard quality control metrics is critical.

A simple method for enzymatic synthesis of unlabeled and radiolabeled Hydroxycinnamate-CoA
Hydroxycinnamate coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters are substrates for biosynthesis of lignin and hydroxycinna- mate esters of polysaccharides and other polymers. Hence, a supply of these substrates is essential for investigation of cell wall biosynthesis. In this study, three recombinant enzymes, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, 4-coumarate- CoA ligase 1, and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 5, were cloned from wheat, tobacco, and Arabidopsis, respectively, and were used to synthesize 14C-feruloyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA, and sinapoyl-CoA. The corresponding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters were high-performance liquid chromatography purified, the only extraction/purification step necessary, with total yields between 88?95percent. Radiolabeled 14C-feruloyl-CoA was gener- ated from caffeic acid and S-adenosyl-14C-methionine under the combined action of caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 1. About 70percent of 14C-methyl groups from S-adenosyl methionine were incorporated into the final product. The methods presented are simple, fast, and efficient for the preparation of the hydroxycinnamate thioesters.

Measurement of the Azimuthal Anisotropy of Neutral Pions in Pb-Pb Collisions at √sNN=2.76  TeV
First measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of neutral pions produced in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √ over ssubscript NN=2.76  TeV are presented. The amplitudes of the second Fourier component (vsubscript 2) of the πsuperscript 0 azimuthal distributions are extracted using an event-plane technique. The values of vsubscript 2 are studied as a function of the neutral pion transverse momentum (psubscript T) for different classes of collision centrality in the kinematic range 1.6<psubscript T<8.0  GeV/c, within the pseudorapidity interval |η|<0.8. The CMS measurements of vsusbcript 2(psubscript T) are similar to previously reported πsuperscript 0 azimuthal anisotropy results from √ over ssubscript NN=200  GeV Au-Au collisions at RHIC, despite a factor of ∼14 increase in the center-of-mass energy. In the momentum range 2.5<psubscript T<5.0  GeV/c, the neutral pion anisotropies are found to be smaller than those observed by CMS for inclusive charged particles.

Air Quality Impact of Distributed Generation of Electricity
This dissertation summarizes the results of a five-year investigation of the impact of distributed generation (DG) of electricity on air quality in urban areas. I focused on the impact of power plants with capacities of less than 50 MW, which is typical of DG units in urban areas. These power plants are modeled as buoyant emissions from stacks less than 10 m situated in the midst of urban buildings. Because existing dispersion models are not designed for such sources, the first step of the study involved the evaluation of AERMOD, USEPA's state-of-the art dispersion model, with data collected in a tracer study conducted in the vicinity of a DG unit. The second step of the study consisted of using AERMOD to compare the impact of DG penetration in the South Coast Air Basin of Los Angeles with the impact of replacing DG generation with expansion of current central power plant capacity. The third topic of my investigation is the development and application of a model to examine the impact of non-power plant sources in a large urban area such as Los Angeles. This model can be used to estimate the air quality impact of DG relative to other sources in an urban area.   The first part of this dissertation describes a tracer study conducted in Palm Springs, CA.  Concentrations observed during the nighttime experiments are generally higher than those measured during the daytime experiments. They fall off less rapidly with distance than during the daytime. AERMOD provides an adequate description of concentrations associated with the buoyant releases from the DG during the daytime when turbulence is controlled by convection induced by solar heating. However, AERMOD underestimates concentrations during the night when turbulence is generated by wind shear. Also, AERMOD predicts a decrease in concentrations with distance that is much more rapid than the relatively flat observed decrease. I have suggested modifications to AERMOD to improve the agreement between model estimates and observations during the night.     The second part of this dissertation examines the air quality impact of using DG to satisfy future growth in power demand in the South Coast Air Basin of Los Angeles (SoCAB), relative to the impact when the demand is met by expanding current central generation (CG) capacity. The air quality impacts of these two alternate scenarios are quantified in terms of hourly maximum ground-level and annually-averaged primary NOx concentrations, which are estimated using AERMOD. The shift to DGs has the potential for decreasing maximum hourly impacts of power generation in the vicinity of the DGs. The maximum hourly concentration is reduced from 25 ppb to 6 ppb if DGs rather than CGs are used to generate power. However, the annually-averaged concentrations are likely to be higher than for the scenario in which existing CGs are used to satisfy power demand growth. Future DG penetration will add an annual average of 0.1 ppb to the current basin average, 20 ppb, while expanding existing CGs will add 0.05 ppb.The third part of my dissertation focused on formulating a model to estimate concentrations of NO2, NOx, and O3 averaged over a spatial scale of the order of a kilometer in a domain extending over tens of kilometers. The model can be used to estimate hourly concentrations of these species over time periods of years. It achieves the required computational efficiency by separating transport and chemistry using the concept of species age. Evaluation with data measured at 21 stations distributed over the Los Angeles air basin indicates that the model provides an adequate description of the spatial and temporal variation of the concentrations of NO2 and NOx. Estimates of maximum hourly O3 concentrations show little bias compared to observations, but the scatter is not small.

Characterization of small RNA genes in the marine organisms Ciona intestinalis and Thalassiosira pseudonana
This dissertation describes an integration of computational and biological techniques to characterize small RNA genes in two key marine organisms, a sea squirt and a diatom. Eukaryotic small RNA genes, which are typically 19-31 nucleotides in length, regulate gene expression within cells in a temporal and state-dependent manner, controlling essential processes such as embryological development, cell differentiation, responses to environmental stress, and cellular defense mechanisms. In the first chapter, computational methods were developed to predict evolutionarily conserved members of one class of small RNAs, known as microRNAs, in the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis. The sea squirt is an important model organism due to its phylogenetic placement at the emergence of vertebrates. The microRNA prediction algorithm was designed to quickly screen the genome for the presence of conserved microRNAs, producing the first validated collection of microRNAs in the sea squirt. Additionally, a target prediction algorithm was implemented which identified potential target genes. The second chapter built upon these techniques and expanded the search for other classes of endogenous small RNAs in the diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Diatoms are unicellular phytoplankton, chosen as the model organism because of their global importance in processes such as carbon fixation and nutrient cycling. A small RNA cDNA library was constructed for exponentially growing T. pseudonana, and then pyrosequenced. Computational analysis of approximately 300,000 sequences yielded strong evidence of small RNA genes in T. pseudonana, including microRNAs, repeat-associated short interfering RNAs, and endogenous short interfering RNAs. The third chapter focused on differential small RNA gene expression in Thalassiosira pseudonana, under various nutrient stress conditions. Small RNA cDNA libraries were constructed under conditions of exponential growth, silicon starvation, nitrogen starvation, and iron starvation. The libraries were then processed with high throughput SOLiD sequencing. A methodology was developed to computationally analyze the 150 million sequences, generating a profile of differential small RNA expression between the conditions, as well as a core subset of small RNAs expressed across all conditions. The novel computational techniques implemented in this dissertation can be applied to other organisms and aid in elucidating the roles of small RNAs in gene regulation

Designing Imprint Rolls for Fluid Pathway Fabrication
This paper discusses a novel method for designing imprint rolls for the fabrication of fluid pathways. Roller imprint processes have applications in diverse areas including fuel cell manufacturing and microfluidic device fabrication. Robust design methods are required for developing imprint rolls with optimal features. In the method discussed in this paper, the rolls are designed procedurally with the fluid pathway design given as input. The pathways are decomposed into repeating features (or tiles), and the rolls are designed by first modeling a small set of unique tiles and then combining them to model the entire roll. The tiling strategy decreases the complexity of the model, and reduces the time taken for designing the rolls. The modular nature of the tiles also improves the efficiency of post-processing operations like feature identification and optimization, and the generation of toolpaths for machining the roll.

The development of a chemical biology pipeline for the identification of small molecules that induce cardiopoiesis in murine embryonic stem cells
High-Content Screening (HCS) is a form of high throughput screening (HTS) that couples automated microscopy with high throughput image analysis to quantify biological effects. Thus, it can be thought of as applied biology bridging basic bench research to drug discovery and clinical medicine. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a HCS strategy to identify small molecules that stimulate the differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) toward the cardiac lineage. Screening campaigns are difficult and expensive, and success can be undermined by variation or errors in the underlying biology, robotics, instrumentation and data analysis. Some of these problems can result in systematic errors resistant to correction by established methods. Thus, the second aim of this proposal focuses on development and testing of a novel correction method for redressing systematic errors. The third aim is to implement the HCS campaign and analyze the most interesting hits through confirmatory and secondary screens, medicinal chemistry optimization, and then mechanism of action and target identification. Two libraries were screened : 1) ̃14,000 small synthetic compounds screened at 2 doses and added 1 molecule per sample well, and 2) a chemical mixture library where each sample well is tested against thousands of structurally similar molecules at equimolor concentration. Two molecules from the individual compound screen and one compound from the mixture library screen were selected for structure activity relationship (SAR) analyses. For each compound class, the data define an SAR for cardiomyogenesis from ESCs. Studies focused on the biological mechanism of action studies have revealed two molecules bias germ layer commitment toward early endoderm at the expense of mesoderm. Biotin-tethered probes used to affinity capture small molecule protein targets together with biological assays have suggested metabolic stress is a modulator of mESC specification of the 3 germ layers

A modular approach to the synthesis of small molecules targeting RNA
This study is focused on the synthesis of small RNA- binding molecules that are potential inhibitors of hepatitis C virus protein synthesis and of thymidylate synthase expression. The molecules synthesized are chosen for their "RNA friendly" properties, i.e. hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor properties, pi-stacking ability, rigid, non-planar structure and positively charged amino groups. The two sets of molecules synthesized have a "modular" structure, providing versatility, diversity and the ability to perform parallel synthesis. The first set is a novel class of molecules that contain a cis-3,5- diaminopiperidine (DAP) moiety as a structural mimetic of the 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) pharmacophore of the RNA- binding, natural aminoglycoside antibiotics. Parallel synthesis has been used to obtain focused libraries around scaffolds containing the DAP ring linked to amino acids. The amino acid building blocks allowed for further diversification with various carboxylic acids. Compounds from the libraries have been tested for binding and biological activity against hepatitis C virus RNA. We have also synthesized a library of hydrazone compounds obtained from the reaction of an aromatic hydrazide with an isatin or indole aldehyde. Compounds from the libraries have been tested for binding and biological activity against hepatitis C virus RNA and thymidylate synthase mRNA and structure activity relationship were explored

Improving pairwise sequence alignment accuracy using near-optimal protein sequence alignments
Abstract
Background
While the pairwise alignments produced by sequence similarity searches are a powerful tool for identifying homologous proteins - proteins that share a common ancestor and a similar structure; pairwise sequence alignments often fail to represent accurately the structural alignments inferred from three-dimensional coordinates. Since sequence alignment algorithms produce optimal alignments, the best structural alignments must reflect suboptimal sequence alignment scores. Thus, we have examined a range of suboptimal sequence alignments and a range of scoring parameters to understand better which sequence alignments are likely to be more structurally accurate.

Results
We compared near-optimal protein sequence alignments produced by the Zuker algorithm and a set of probabilistic alignments produced by the probA program with structural alignments produced by four different structure alignment algorithms. There is significant overlap between the solution spaces of structural alignments and both the near-optimal sequence alignments produced by commonly used scoring parameters for sequences that share significant sequence similarity (E-values &lt; 10-5) and the ensemble of probA alignments. We constructed a logistic regression model incorporating three input variables derived from sets of near-optimal alignments: robustness, edge frequency, and maximum bits-per-position. A ROC analysis shows that this model more accurately classifies amino acid pairs (edges in the alignment path graph) according to the likelihood of appearance in structural alignments than the robustness score alone. We investigated various trimming protocols for removing incorrect edges from the optimal sequence alignment; the most effective protocol is to remove matches from the semi-global optimal alignment that are outside the boundaries of the local alignment, although trimming according to the model-generated probabilities achieves a similar level of improvement. The model can also be used to generate novel alignments by using the probabilities in lieu of a scoring matrix. These alignments are typically better than the optimal sequence alignment, and include novel correct structural edges. We find that the probA alignments sample a larger variety of alignments than the Zuker set, which more frequently results in alignments that are closer to the structural alignments, but that using the probA alignments as input to the regression model does not increase performance.

Conclusions
The pool of suboptimal pairwise protein sequence alignments substantially overlaps structure-based alignments for pairs with statistically significant similarity, and a regression model based on information contained in this alignment pool improves the accuracy of pairwise alignments with respect to structure-based alignments.

Aspects of the physical control of phytoplankton dynamics over the Southern California Bight continental shelf
Evidence gathered three decades ago showed persistently elevated total and new primary production over the continental shelf of the Southern California Bight. This dissertation examines the mechanisms that drive the flux of nitrate necessary to support the phytoplankton productivity over the shelf. Using results gathered from an intensive field experiment, I show that strong, persistent cross-shelf gradients in phytoplankton standing stock, primary productivity and community composition result from nitrate flux due to internal waves of tidal and higher frequency. I report the first estimates of the horizontal flux of nitrate due to the internal tide, and demonstrate that it is quantitatively similar to the nitrate demand of the inner shelf phytoplankton population. The local winds, contrary to expectations based on previous research, support a biologically- relevant tilt of the nitracline. Variability in the magnitude of the cross-shore shoaling of the nitracline in turn impacts the magnitude of the internal tide mediated nitrate flux. Remotely-forced large scale variability in the offshore depth of the nitracline controls the continental shelf ǹitrate climate.' During episodes of anomalously warm ocean temperatures, a correspondingly deep nitracline can shut off nitrate supply to the continental shelf, resulting in low phytoplankton biomass. During more typical conditions, the phytoplankton community over the inner shelf is dominated by taxa capable of rapid nitrate assimilation, while offshore waters have a proportionally greater amount of oligotrophic species. The results of this dissertation indicate that relatively small changes in the offshore depth of the nitracline could account for the long-term increase primary productivity and phytoplankton biomass noted by recent studies, even in the absence of increased local wind-forced upwelling. Finally, I examine the baroclinic semidiurnal variability in currents and water column structure in the shallow water of the inner shelf. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the behavior of the semidiurnal variability is not consistent with a propagating or standing low mode internal wave. Analyses of linearized momentum balances suggest that the semidiurnal variability may result from the interaction of barotropic tidal flow, friction in the bottom boundary layer, and rotation

Separating metagenomic short reads into genomes
via clustering
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The metagenomics approach allows the simultaneous sequencing of all genomes in an environmental sample. This results in high complexity datasets, where in addition to repeats and sequencing errors, the number of genomes and their abundance ratios are unknown. Recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies significantly improve the sequencing efficiency and cost. On the other hand, they result in shorter reads, which makes the separation of reads from different species harder. Among the existing computational tools for metagenomic analysis, there are similarity-based methods that use reference databases to align reads and composition-based methods that use composition patterns (i.e., frequencies of short words or l-mers) to cluster reads. Similarity-based methods are unable to classify reads from unknown species without close references (which constitute the majority of reads). Since composition patterns are preserved only in significantly large fragments, composition-based tools cannot be used for very short reads, which becomes a significant limitation with the development of NGS. A recently proposed algorithm, AbundanceBin, introduced another method that bins reads based on predicted abundances of the genomes sequenced. However, it does not separate reads from genomes of similar abundance levels.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					In this work, we present a two-phase heuristic algorithm for separating short paired-end reads from different genomes in a metagenomic dataset. We use the observation that most of the l-mers belong to unique genomes when l is sufficiently large. The first phase of the algorithm results in clusters of l-mers each of which belongs to one genome. During the second phase, clusters are merged based on l-mer repeat information. These final clusters are used to assign reads. The algorithm could handle very short reads and sequencing errors. It is initially designed for genomes with similar abundance levels and then extended to handle arbitrary abundance ratios. The software can be download for free at 
						http://www.cs.ucr.edu/&#8764;tanaseio/toss.htm.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our tests on a large number of simulated metagenomic datasets concerning species at various phylogenetic distances demonstrate that genomes can be separated if the number of common repeats is smaller than the number of genome-specific repeats. For such genomes, our method can separate NGS reads with a high precision and sensitivity.

Community-dependent Positive Interactions in  Southern California Coastal Ecosystems
Ecological interactions are context dependent.  The net effect of species interactions includes the multifaceted impacts of community composition and abiotic influences of the environment.  I examined how both biotic and abiotic stressors, in the form of herbivore composition and salinity stress, respectively, elicited positive interactions between species.  In a kelp forest I examined how the relationship between kelp and an encrusting bryozoan, <italic>Membranipora membranacea </italic>, shifted to an associational defense depending on herbivore guild composition.  Using a combination of choice experiments and surveys of grazing damage, I demonstrated that the mesograzers <italic>Lacuna unifasciata</italic>, <italic>Perampithoe humeralis</italic>, and <italic>Idotea resecata</italic> almost entirely avoided (<1% of total diet) encrusted kelp.  The large snail <italic>Norrisia norrisi</italic> also preferred clean kelp, but kelp crabs, <italic>Pugettia producta</italic>, targeted encrusted kelp.  Field surveys in a mesograzer dominated canopy found 2.5 times more grazing damage on sparsely encrusted kelp than on heavily encrusted kelp and far more grazing in the upper canopy than on the blades from the vertical stipes below the canopy.  These results indicate that, when mesograzers are dominant, <italic>Membranipora</italic> provides kelp associational resistance to grazing.  Such protection may be more prominent in the upper canopy.  Additionally, I examined the role of abiotic stress on positive interactions in a hypersaline salt marsh.  Following disturbance that removes established vegetation, salt-tolerant species can ameliorate harsh soil salinities for less tolerant species and therefore promote secondary succession.  However, when abiotic stress is extremely high amelioration may be inadequate to improve growth of associated neighbors.  Using clipping manipulations of <italic>Batis maritima</italic>, an early successional halophyte, I tested whether <italic>B. maritima</italic> facilitates secondary succession in an excessively hypersaline salt marsh in southern California.  Experimental plots with <italic>B. maritima</italic> present recovered faster (27% compared to 14% revegetation by matrix species) and had lower increases in soil salinity.  <italic>Salicornia pacifica</italic> and <italic>Arthrocnemum subterminale</italic> were the dominant recovery species in both treatments and no differences were found in species richness, diversity, or evenness of recovery species between treatments.  Overall, my research indicates positive interactions play a prominent role in these coastal ecosystems though that role will depend on the specific nature of the community.

[cognitive, theory, principle, consistency, social]

A Revised Theory of Cognitive Consistency
Decades of social psychological research have rested upon a simple assumption: people prefer incoming information to be consistent with their existing understandings of the social world.  This simple premise, known as the cognitive consistency principle, is the foundation for many of the most prominent theories in sociological social psychology (e.g. affect control theory, justice theory, expectation states theory, identity theory, etc.).  However, increasing evidence has accrued that suggests that this principle may be incorrect, or at least incomplete.  This study reviews three well-established areas of research that challenge the cognitive consistency principle (over-reward/self-enhancement, amusement, varied experience theory), and reveals that all three areas point to an overarching truth: social actors often experience positive emotion or pleasure from small levels of cognitive inconsistency.  In light of this, a modified cognitive consistency principle is formulated, and hypotheses are offered and tested using paired internet surveys and panel-clustered random-effects maximum-likelihood regression.  Data supports a modified cognitive consistency principle which posits that actors can experience positive emotions and pleasure at low levels of cognitive inconsistency.

[neutrophil, fibrocyte, differentiation, cell, sap, ard, accumulation]

Regulation of Innate Immune Cells
Immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes enter tissues after tissue damage and clear cell debris to allow repair cells such as fibroblasts to close the wound.  Monocytes also differentiate into fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes to mediate wound healing, similar to fibroblasts. However, in abnormal wound healing such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fibrosing diseases, the accumulation of immune cells such as neutrophils or fibrocytes become detrimental to health.  In ARDS, neutrophils accumulate in the lungs and causes additional damage by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS).  In fibrosing diseases, increased fibrocyte differentiation is one of the causes that increase extracellular matrix deposition, which leads to severe scar tissue build up.  Since there are no effective treatments for ARDS or fibrosing diseases, understanding the regulation of neutrophil activation or fibrocyte differentiation could be helpful to develop new effective therapies.  

	The Gomer lab has found several factors that either promote or inhibit fibrocyte differentiation.  The pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 potentiate fibrocyte differentiation while the plasma protein serum amyloid P (SAP), crosslinked IgG, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-12 inhibit fibrocyte differentiation.  In this thesis, I have now shown that additional factors such as toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) inhibit fibrocyte differentiation, while high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMWHA) potentiate fibrocyte differentiation.

The accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs is one of the major factors that debilitate the health of a patient in ARDS.  Since neutrophils have Fc receptors, I examined the effect of SAP on neutrophil spreading, adherence, activation, and accumulation.  SAP inhibits neutrophil spreading induced by cell debris and TNF-α induced adhesion, but SAP is unable to have any effect on classic neutrophil adhesion molecules or the production of hydrogen peroxide.  SAP inhibits neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of bleomycin-injured mice.  There is an exciting possibility of using SAP as a therapeutic agent to treat ARDS.

Thermal Transport in Nanoporous Materials for Energy Applications
The present study investigates the complex relationship between nanostructures and microscale thermal transport in nanoporous thin films for energy applications. It experimentally and numerically demonstrates that the effective thermal conductivity of nanoporous materials can be tuned by controlling their nanoscale architectures including porosity, pore diameter, wall thickness, nanocrystal size, and crystallinity as well as surface passivation.This study reports measurements of the cross-plane thermal conductivity of nanoporous thin films with various architectures between 25 and 315 K. Physics-based models combining phonon transport theory and effective medium approximations were developed to interpret the experimental data. Ordered mesoporous titania and silicon thin films were prepared based on evaporation-induced self-assembly method. Pure silica zeolite films were produced by either <italic>in-situ</italic> growth or by spin coating a zeolite nanoparticle suspension followed by crystal growth upon heating. These synthesized thin films were systematically and fully characterized. They featured ordered nanopores with porosity, pore diameter, and film thickness ranging from 30% to 59%, 0.5 to 25 nm, and 120 to 370 nm, respectively. Their dense matrix was amorphous, polycrystalline, or consisted of an aggregate of nanocrystals. The thermal conductivity of all synthesized nanoporous films increased monotonically with temperature within the temperature range considered. At low temperatures, the nanoporous films behaved like amorphous or strongly disordered materials and their thermal conductivity was proportional to T<super>n</super> with n varied between 1 and 2.3. At high temperatures, the thermal conductivity increased slowly with temperature or reached a plateau due to strong phonon Umklapp scattering and the saturation of phonon modes. The presence of pores in <italic>amorphous</italic> mesoporous thin films had a purely geometrical effect by reducing the cross-sectional area through which heat can diffuse. By contrast, in <italic>crystalline</italic> mesoporous thin films the presence of pores also increased phonon scattering. In addition, the film thickness generally did not affect the measured thermal conductivity. Indeed, phonon scattering by pores and by nanocrystal grain boundary dominated over boundary scattering and were identified as the dominant scattering mechanisms for nanoscale energy transport in the synthesized nanoporous films.This study further establishes that the effective thermal conductivity k<sub>eff</sub> of crystalline nanoporous silicon was strongly affected not only by the porosity f<sub>v</sub> and the system's length L<sub>z</sub> but also by the pore interfacial area concentration A<sub>i</sub>. A modified effective medium approximation combining kinetic theory and the coherent potential approximation suggested that k<sub>eff</sub> was proportional to (1-1.5f<sub>v</sub>) and inversely proportional to the sum (A<sub>i</sub>/4+1/L<sub>z</sub>). This scaling law was in excellent agreement with the thermal conductivity of nanoporous silicon predicted by molecular dynamics simulations for spherical pores as well as for cylindrical pores and vacancy defects.Finally, this study demonstrated, using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, that surface passivation added another parameter for reducing the thermal conductivity of nanostructured materials. To do so, there should be strong acoustic vibrational modes coupling between surface and passivation atoms. For example, oxygen passivation reduced the thermal conductivity of nanoporous crystalline silicon. In addition, the effect of passivation reduced with temperature because of increasing contribution of Umklapp scattering.These results could help establish new strategies to control the thermal conductivity of nanoporous materials for a wide range of applications including thermoelectric devices, supercapacitors, dye-sensitized solar cells, and hydrogen storage devices.

Simulated diurnal rainfall physics in a multi-scale global climate model with embedded explicit convection
It is well known that the statistical methods ("parameterizations'') used to represent cloud processes for climate prediction distort the simulated diurnal rainfall cycle. In this study, the "superparameterization'' technique (embedding explicit models of convection) is investigated as a method of improving diurnal rainfall in order to study the mechanisms supporting it and to reduce uncertainties in climate prediction. Analysis of the effect of superparameterization on the simulated global diurnal rainfall cycle uncovers several unappreciated benefits of the technique: Diurnal rainfall becomes less well fit by a 24-hour sinusoid, more horizontally inhomogeneous within continents and oceans, and conforms better to transitions straddling coastlines. While these effects are robust to arbitrary configuration choices in the application of superparameterization, a favorable shift in the peak timing of continental rainfall is not. Regional deficiencies are documented associated with the Andean topography, and the Asian monsoon. Like conventional parameterizations that account for dilution, superparameterization favorably reduces the amplitude of the tropical land latent heating diurnal cycle. This removes an unrealistic deep barotropic subsidence wave that otherwise exerts undue remote control by land on the simulated diurnal cycle over the tropical ocean. The level of remote control of marine surface divergence is otherwise found to be undersimulated such that the tropical surface divergence signature of land-sea remote control does not validate well against scatterometer observations. Over the Gulf Stream, the pattern of warm season diurnal rainfall variability is captured in several simulations. Analysis suggests a giant sea breeze circulation fueled by convectively amplified cross-coastal radiative imbalances, may help explain the observed change in local rainfall timing with distance offshore. In the Central US warm season, the superparameterization approach is shown to capture packets of eastward traveling organized convection that underly a regional nocturnal convection maximum. The simulated rate and range of eastward travel validates against ground based radar data despite the fact that small scale storm propagation mechanisms (gust fronts and density currents) are artificially restricted to have only local effects under superparameterization. This is interpreted as evidence in support of an alternative "slow manifold'' view that these systems are primarily propagated by large-scale dynamics

A Distributed Hydrologic Model of The Woodlands, TX: Modeling Hydrologic Effects of Low Impact Development
This thesis utilizes a distributed hydrologic model to predict hydrologic effects of Low Impact Development (LID), and also analyzes runoff from small sub-areas within the watershed.  City planners and developers rely on accurate hydrologic models, which enable them to design flood-proof developments and effectively mitigate flooding downstream.  Common hydrologic models use a lumped approach, which averages the physical characteristics of basins for model calculations, limiting their ability to estimate runoff within the basin.  In contrast, distributed hydrologic models, which divide the watershed into a grid system, can be used to predict runoff at any location within the watershed.  The fully distributed hydrologic model, VfloTM, is used to model stormwater runoff in The Woodlands, TX watershed, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the master planned community.  This thesis also suggests that a calibrated VfloTM model can accurately predict stormwater runoff from small sub-areas within a watershed.

A study of x-pinch experiments has been performed on a compact (< 1 m²) pulse power generator which produced an 80 kA current with a risetime of 228}040 ns. The first quantitative study of the x-pinch limb ablation has shown a strong correlation with the results from a previously published analytical ablation model. Studies of the coronal plasma velocity and resistivity provided the first approximation of the magnetic Reynolds number in x-pinch plasmas. above one (Al) and below one (W) indicated varying plasma dynamics dominated by convection and diffusion respectively. Variation in the plasma behavior was verified experimentally. Additionally, the effect of a thin high-Z coating on the plasma development was investigated. Applications of the x-pinch plasma structures were also studied. The evolution of freely propagating supersonic plasma jets was recorded along the axis of the experiment. Mach numbers of 228}06 and cooling parameters (chi) in the range of 0.1-1 were found, and the correlation and scaling to large scale astrophysical plasma jets is discussed. Investigation of the cross point emission recorded the presence of multiple temporally separated x-ray bursts. Here the first peak (occurring around the time of maximum compression) was then utilized in an approach for the non-destructive characterization of inertial confinement fusion capsules, through phase contrast imaging

Characterizing Ligand-Protein Interactions by Ligand-Detected Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Methods
The study of ligand-protein interactions is important for understanding the biochemical basis of many diseases and provides an opportunity for the development of pharmaceutical compounds with agonistic or inhibitory activity. Biochemists and medicinal chemists often use structure-activity relationships (SARs) to gain insights into how a ligand's molecular structure is related to specific interactions with a receptor, such as a protein. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal technique for probing ligand-protein interactions because a single analysis can yield rich structural information without destroying the sample, it is universal, and analyte derivatization is unnecessary. NMR ligand epitope maps gives information on the ligand protons that interact most strongly with the protein and can provide some information about the ligand's orientation at the binding site. Ligand-detected NMR methods such as nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY), diffusion NMR, and saturation transfer difference (STD) can be used to generate ligand epitope maps. The goal of this dissertation is to evaluate the efficiency and reliability by which epitope maps of ligand-protein interactions are determined, advancing the study of fundamental biochemical interactions. The protein investigated in this research is the human plasma protein, á1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). AGP is heavily glycosylated with about 45% of its mass composed of carbohydrate. AGP binds to a variety of small basic ligands and is known to play an important role in inflammatory processes. Epitope mapping results will be presented and compared for the binding of the drugs lidocaine and disopyramide with AGP. Lidocaine is an anesthetic drug with a weak binding affinity for AGP, while disopyramide is a chiral drug with stronger binding affinity. The enantiomers of disopyramide were isolated using an AGP chiral stationary phase and the AGP epitope maps of each enantiomer were characterized.  Analytical challenges such as effects of nonspecific binding on STD epitope maps and designing the best practice for setting the ligand-protein concentration ratios are also addressed.AGP is utilized as a chiral chromatographic phase. Preliminary work using high resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) to characterize the interactions of lidocaine with the AGP stationary phase is presented.

Dielectric Elastomers for Actuation and Energy Harvesting
Dielectric elastomers are an emerging transducer technology that fit an interesting niche. They are soft and compliant by nature, and can be stretched, either via mechanical or electrically-induced means, to very large strains. They are capable of large strains, high energy densities, and low costs, while possessing the additional advantages of being light weight and conformable. Dielectric elastomers are well suited for both actuator and generator applications, with the actuators being heralded as artificial muscles. There remains, however, several issues that prevent the widespread adoption of dielectric elastomer technology. Each applications has its set of technical issues; for actuator purposes, the primary issues are that the driving voltage required for high performance is in excess of 2000 V for most dielectric elastomer actuators, and that the lifetime when operated at high performance levels is rather short. The requirement to prestrain the elastomers to achieve high performance actuation in most cases can also add significant bulk and mass to the actuator as well as reduce its shelf-life. Thus, materials capable of high-strain performance without the requirement for prestrain are sought after. The ability to operate over a wide range of temperatures and environmental conditions, as well as operate over a wide range of frequencies, is also very important for most actuator applications.The first part of this dissertation looks to tackle the aforementioned issues. Silicone materials are chosen as the base dielectric elastomer material as they are generally capable of operating over wide ranges of temperature and frequency and are generally unaffected by moisture and have good environmental stability. The work focuses on free-standing linear soft silicone actuators as this configuration is the most relevant for real applications. A particular soft silicone has been isolated a good candidate and was extensively tested in a free-standing linear actuator configuration to determine the effects of pre-stretch and the application of mechanical loads on its actuation performance. It is shown that when the mechanical loads are properly applied, large linear actuation strains of 120% and work density of 0.5 J/cm<super>3</super> can be obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when coupled with single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) compliant electrodes, fault-tolerance is introduced via self-clearing leading to significantly improved operational reliability. Driven at moderate electric fields, the actuators display relatively high linear actuation strain (25%) without degradation of the electromechanical performance even after 85,000 cycles.An issue related to the use of soft silicone actuators is that the work density is not very high when compared with many of the high-performance dielectric elastomer materials available. It is shown that the force output and work density of soft silicone actuators can be significantly enhanced by the addition of high permittivity titanium oxide nanoparticles. The nanocomposites are capable of maintaining the actuation strain performance of the pure silicone at relatively low electric fields while increasing the force output and work density due to the additive effects of mechanical reinforcement and permittivity enhancement.The high performance of the aforementioned soft silicone actuators requires the application of rather large levels of prestrain. In order to eliminate this requirement a novel all-silicone prestrain-locked interpenetrating polymer network (S-IPN) elastomer was developed. The elastomer is fabricated using a combination of two silicones: a soft room temperature vulcanizing silicone that serves as the host elastomer matrix, and a more rigid high temperature vulcanizing silicone that acts to preserve the prestrain in the host network. The free-standing prestrain-locked silicones show a more than twofold performance improvement over standard free-standing silicone films, with a linear strain of 25% and an area strain of 45% when tested in a diaphragm configuration. The S-IPN procedure was leveraged to improve electrode adhesion and stability as well as improve the interlayer adhesion in multilayer actuators. It is demonstrated that strongly bonded SWNT electrodes are capable of fault tolerance through self-clearing, even in multilayer actuators. The fault-tolerance and improved interlayer adhesion was used to fabricate prestrained free-standing silicone actuators capable of stable long life actuation (>30,000 cycles at >20% strain and >500 cycles at ~40% strain) while driving a load. Issues related to gradual electrode degradation are also addressed through the use of quasi-buckled electrodes.For generator purposes, the primary concerns are ensuring environmental stability, increasing energy density, lowering losses, and determining effective methods to couple the dielectric elastomer to natural energy sources. The factors that affect the energy density and efficiency are explored and it is found that energy density can be increased by applying larger mechanical strains and using stiffer materials. Increasing the permittivity of the material and bias voltage can also improve the energy density but reach a peak and decrease the energy density thereafter. The efficiency is shown to depend primarily on the shape of the stress-strain curve of the material, the applied strain, and a lumped parameter containing the stiffness, permittivity and nominal bias electric field. For a particular applied strain, the efficiency shows a peak at a particular value of the lumped parameter. Increasing stiffness shifts the location of the peak to higher values, and thus higher required electric fields, while increasing permittivity shifts it to lower values, and thus to lower electric fields.Using the results of this analysis, two material systems are explored: VHB acrylic elastomers at various prestrains and with various amounts of a stiffening additive, and a high energy density silicone-TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite elastomer with various amounts of additive. It is shown that increasing prestrain in the VHB acrylic system increases the energy density, while the stiffening additive has the effect of making the acrylic stiffer but results in increased losses, result in poorer performance. The silicone TiO<sub>2</sub> composite demonstrates an increase in permittivity and stiffness with increasing additive while maintaining very high dielectric breakdown strength values. These increases are partially offset by small increases in mechanical and electrical losses. Calculations based on a simple model show that the generator energy density can be improved by a factor of 3 for a 20wt.% TiO<sub>2</sub> loading at a strain of 50% in area. The calculated generator energy density values exceed the maximum values measured experimentally for highly prestrained VHB4910 acrylic elastomers.The focus on high energy density materials ignores the fact that not all applications require such a material, and that some applications may, in fact, benefit from the use of a softer material that is less intrusive. However, for lower energy density materials, parasitic losses due to electrode resistance and viscoelasticity play a larger role as relative energy gains are lower. With this is mind, a soft silicone single walled carbon nanotube composite is developed. The composite is very soft, has low viscoelastic losses, and is capable of being stretched up to >150% strain with only a marginal increase in resistance. The composite is also capable of being repeatedly stretched at up to 120% strain for over 1000 cycles without any appreciable change in resistance and is capable of being stretched at strain rate up to 100%/s or higher without affecting the performance of the electrode.Two applications for dielectric elastomer actuators are also explored. A pressure-based ocean wave energy harvesting concept was introduced that does not use any moving parts. A footfall energy harvester concept is also developed capable of being deployed inside the sole of a shoe or as a flexible floor tile.

Audio visual information fusion for human activity analysis
Human activity analysis in unconstrained environments using far-field sensors is a challenging task. The fusion of audio and visual cues enables us to build robust and efficient human activity analysis systems. Traditional fusion schemes including feature-level, classifier-level and decision-level fusion have been explored in task- specific contexts to provide robustness to sensor and environmental noise. However, human activity analysis involves the extraction of information from audio and visual cues at multiple levels of semantic abstraction. This naturally leads to a hierarchical fusion framework. In this dissertation, the limitations of existing fusion schemes are explored and new algorithms are developed to address some of these limitations. The iterative decoding algorithm (IDA) fuses the audio and video modalities at the decision level but unlike other schemes, it uses an iterative strategy to infer the joint likelihood of the hidden states from the unimodal likelihoods. The iterative decoding is advantageous to joint modeling and other decision level fusion schemes in terms of ease of training of the models and the performance under low SNR scenarios. The extension of the IDA to more complex tasks, such as audio-visual person tracking and meeting scene analysis, leads to hierarchical fusion frameworks. The multilevel iterative decoding framework for audio-visual person tracking (MID-AVT) uses the iterative decoding framework for tracking multiple subjects using both audio and visual cues from multiple cameras and microphone arrays. The local sensor-level tracks are fused using the IDA to obtain globally consistent tracks. The MID-AVT framework is robust to sensor calibration errors and requires only a rough calibration step to learn the correspondences between different sensors. The location specific speaker modeling (LSSM) framework for audio-visual meeting scene analysis augments the tracking information with speaker recognition information. Speaker recognition using far- field microphones is a challenging task. The LSSM framework addresses this issue by using the speaker's location information to select the corresponding location specific speaker recognition model. In practice, training such contextual models requires intensive labeling of audio-visual datasets. Semi-supervised techniques for model learning and sensor calibration are presented in this dissertation to address this issue. A particular case, learning the LSSM models using face recognition information, is explored in detail and found to perform well in practice. The overall contribution of this dissertation is the exploration of various aspects of hierarchical fusion in audio-visual human activity analysis and the extensive analysis of these hierarchical fusion frameworks on real world audio-visual testbeds

A Micro-Typology of Pluractionality
Pluractionality, a specific type of event plurality, is at best only partially understood. In this thesis, I survey four pluractional languages in order to compare and contrast them in search of generalizations across the pluractional strategies. I divide the pluractional markers between canonical and non-canonical pluractional strategies, and use the previous analyses of three of the four languages under discussion to build an analysis for never before seen pluractional data from Bole, a West Chadic language spoken primarily in Nigeria. Along the way I fashion a new analysis for Chechen using the tools provided in Henderson (2010) for Karitiana and Kaqchikel. My analysis of Bole is presented in both a static and a dynamic framework, showing how the analysis transcends framework limitations.

Full multiple scattering analysis of XANES at the Cd L3 and O K edges in CdO films combined with a soft-x-ray emission investigation
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) at the cadmium L3 and oxygen K edges for CdO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition method, is interpreted within the real-space multiple scattering formalism, FEFF code. The features in the experimental spectra are well reproduced by calculations for a cluster of about six and ten coordination shells around the absorber for L3 edge of Cd and K edge of O, respectively. The calculated projected electronic density of states is found to be in good agreement with unoccupied electronic states in experimental data and allows to conclude that the orbital character of the lowest energy of the conductive band is Cd-5s-O-2p. The charge transfer has been quantified and not purely ionic bonding has been found. Combined XANES and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements allow us to determine the direct and indirect band gap of investigated CdO films to be ~;;2.4-eV and ~;;0.9-eV, respectively.

Formation and Genotoxicity of Novel Oxidatively Generated Tandem DNA Lesions and N2-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine
Exogenous and endogenous agents can induce the formation of both single- and tandem-nucleobase lesions in DNA. In this dissertation, we assessed the formation and genotoxicity of three different types of DNA lesions; a novel guanine-thymine intrastrand cross-link lesion (G8-5mT), two tandem single-nucleobase lesions consisting of a thymidine glycol and an 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-(8-oxodG)-Tg-3' and 5'-Tg-(8-oxodG)-3' , and a single nucleobase lesion, N2-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N2-CEdG). In Chapter 2, We demonstrated the dose-dependent induction of the G8-5mT cross-link in human HeLa-S3 cells upon exposure to gamma rays by LC-MS/MS. The in-vitro replication studies on the lesion-bearing substrate showed that the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli (E. coli) DNA polymerase I stopped synthesis mostly after incorporating one nucleotide opposite the 3'-thymine moiety of the lesion. Yeast polymerase eta, a translesion synthesis DNA polymerase, could replicate past the lesion with a markedly reduced efficiency.  However, it could also induce nucleotide misincorporation (i.e., dAMP and dGMP) opposite the 5'-guanine moiety of the G8-5mT. In Chapters 3 and 4, we developed an LC-MS/MS-based strategy for quantitative analysis and demonstrated the efficient formation of a tandem lesion, 5'-Tg-(8-oxodG)-3', in calf thymus DNA upon exposure to Cu(II)/ascorbate along with H2O2 or gamma rays. Both in-vitro and in-vivo replication studies on two tandem lesions, 5'-(8-oxodG)-Tg-3' and 5'-Tg-(8-oxodG)-3', revealed that the tandem lesions blocked DNA replication mediated by the Klenow fragment and yeast pol eta; more readily than when the Tg or 8-oxodG was present alone and the mutagenicity of Tg or 8-oxodG differed while they were present alone or in tandem. Moreover, the activities of base excision repair enzymes were altered in substrates bearing the tandem lesions. The 5'-Tg-(8-oxodG)-3' could also give rise to a substantial frequency of TG to GT tandem double mutation. These results support that complex lesions could exert a greater cytotoxic effect than when the composing lesions are present alone and the mutagenic properties of the tandem lesions could be markedly affected by the spatial arrangement of the component lesions.In Chapter 5, we analyzed the formation and genotoxic properties of N2-CEdG, demonstrated that this major stable DNA adduct could be induced by methylglyoxal (MG) in human cancer cells. We also found that N2-CEdG is weakly mutagenic, and DinB (i.e., polymerase IV in E. coli) is the major DNA polymerase responsible for bypassing the lesion in vivo; the E. coli pol IV- and human polymerase kappa-mediated nucleotide incorporation opposite this lesion is both accurate and efficient. Our results supported N2-CEdG may constitute an important endogenous substrate for DinB DNA polymerase.

[gaba, activity, transition, excitatory, inhibitory, mouse, retina, switch, receptor, neural]

The role of activity in the development of inhibition in the mouse retina
Neural circuits rely on the interaction between excitation and inhibition to process information and require an appropriate balance between the two to avoid pathological consequences. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal neurotransmitter mediating inhibition in the adult central nervous system (CNS). However, during development GABAergic transmission is excitatory. Understanding the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABA provides insight into the development of mature brain function as well as devising treatments for diseases involving imbalanced excitation and inhibition. A leading hypothesis is that neural activity plays a critical role in the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABAergic transmission. Here I studied the role of neural activity in regulating the timing of the GABA switch in neurons in the ganglion cell layer of the mouse retina. I used three different knockout mice to demonstrate that the timing of the GABA switch is independent of nicotinic cholinergic activity, retinal waves, and glutamatergic activity. To further explore the role of activity in regulating the GABA switch, I developed a retinal explant model system in which neural activity could be pharmacologically manipulated. Blockade of GABA receptor-mediated activity did not prevent the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABA, in contrast to previous observations in hippocampus and retina. Further, sustained blockade of glutamate receptors, GABA receptors, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine receptors, voltage-gated sodium channels, gap junctions, and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) did not alter the transition. These results suggest that neuronal activity is not required for the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABA in the mouse retina. To determine if the GABA switch is independent of signaling from other cell types, I cultured purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in isolation. I found that purified RGCs did not develop an inhibitory response to GABA. These results indicate that unlike other parts of the nervous system, the transition from excitatory to inhibitory GABA signaling in mouse RGCs does not depend on activity but requires activity- independent signaling from another cell type

[phytoplankton, distribution]

New insights into small-scale vertical distributions of phytoplankton
Phytoplankton are the building blocks of marine pelagic food webs, fixing carbon through photosynthesis and providing food to higher trophic levels. Thus, how phytoplankton are distributed spatially can significantly affect important ecological processes such as carbon cycling and trophic dynamics. In this dissertation, I present analyses of vertical phytoplankton distributions on scales of a meter and less using data from a novel free -falling planar laser imaging fluorometer, the FIDO-Phi. I frequently observed peaks in fluorescent particle concentration with no coincident peaks in bulk fluorescence. These cryptic peaks may be regions of local importance for zooplankton foraging and aggregate formation, and are undetectable using methods that only measure bulk fluorescence. Small-scale variability was also observed in particle size spectra and the distribution of total particles throughout the water column. However, changes in these variables did not explain much of the observed structure in fluorescent particle concentration. This result suggests that small- scale phytoplankton distributions are likely controlled by complex interactions between different factors, and cannot be predicted accurately from simple correlations. To resolve these interactions, I developed a model that describes the control of gradients in phytoplankton abundance by biological and physical dynamics. The model predicted that the maximum strength of phytoplankton gradients is determined by a balance between turbulent mixing and the rate of phytoplankton layer formation. Comparing these results with phytoplankton gradient data and simultaneous physical measurements allowed estimation of the rate of layer formation and the minimum possible phytoplankton layer thickness. This understanding of the mechanisms underlying phytoplankton layer formation will allow better prediction of small-scale phytoplankton distributions. Analyzing images from the FIDO-Phi also allowed the investigation of the spatial distributions of phytoplankton on centimeter scales. The data revealed that individual large phytoplankton or fluorescent aggregates can cause microscale peaks in chlorophyll a fluorescence. The investigation of small-scale vertical phytoplankton distributions presented in this dissertation provides knowledge of local phytoplankton variability - the backdrop upon which fundamental ecological processes take place

Evolutionary genetics of self-incompatibility in solanaceae and papaveraceae
Flowering plants are able to avoid inbreeding by several genetically based mechanisms. Gametophytic self- incompatibility (GSI) occurs when pollen is rejected in the style or on the stigma if it possesses a matching allele with either of the ovule parent's S-alleles. This mechanism typically involves a single genetic locus that is highly polymorphic within populations and species. S- alleles are maintained by strong negative frequency dependent selection that essentially favors alleles when they become rare in a population. This type of balancing selection preserves variation at the S-locus for millions of years enabling us to infer ancient demographic patterns through phylogenetic analyses of genealogies of S-alleles. GSI has been described in several taxa of Solanaceae but only one genus of Papaveraceae, the genus Papaver. Although the molecular mechanisms of self-recognition in these respective families differ remarkably, the underlying theoretical predictions regarding their genetics and evolution are expected to be similar. In Chapter I of this dissertation, I first explore the evolutionary history of a genetic bottleneck in the Solanaceae. Self-incompatible species in the sister genera Physalis and Witheringia share restricted variation at the S-locus indicative of an ancient bottleneck that occurred in a common ancestor. Using phylogenic approaches to look at S-allele variation in species of the subtribe Iochrominae, the clade containing Physalis and Witheringia, we are able to determine when this bottleneck event occurred. We then use two chloroplast markers, fossil calibrations and a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach to determine the approximate date of the bottleneck. In Chapter II, I examine the molecular evolution of individual codons from S-alleles from the bottlenecked lineages of Physalis compared to those of the non-bottlenecked lineages of Solanum. Because Physalis S- RNases appear to have diversified more recently than those of Solanum, we find significantly different patterns among amino acids undergoing positive selection using maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian coalescent methods. (increase in subst. at 4 fold degenerate sites or 3rd position (general synonymous relative to 1-2nd pos.) HyPhy.docs, overall dS increase in Physalis relative to Solanum; overall increase in dN in Physalis?). In Chapter III, I explore the genetics of a putative S-locus polymorphism in three previously uncharacterized species of Papaveraceae native to California. Analyses of putative S-allele sequences from A. munita , P. californicus and Romneya coulteri sampled from natural populations have shown that each harbors substantial genetic polymorphism homologous to stylar S-alleles from Papaver rhoeas. These genes appear to be expressed only in female reproductive tissues as expected for stylar S-locus products. In A. munita and P. californicus, greenhouse crosses among full sibs with matching putative S-genotypes usually don't result in seed set while crosses among individuals with non-matching genotypes almost always do. In addition, potential duplications at or near this locus have been detected in diploid P. californicus. Contrary to other well known SI systems, allelic genealogies from Papaveraceae show a general pattern of monophyletic clustering according to species. Genealogies of these species' S-alleles and those from newly sequenced Papaver alleles show general patterns of monophyletic clustering. The reduced levels of trans-specific polymorphism may be explained by founder events or population bottlenecks in each of the species, though other possibilities must also be considered. We also employ maximum likelihood models to estimate positive selection among putative alleles from these taxa

Hydration of r(UGGGGU) Quadruplexes
For about 50 years it has been known that guanine-rich sequence can, under appropriateconditions, adopt a distinctive, four-stranded, helical fold known as a G-quadruplex.Interest in quadruplex folds has grown in recent years as evidence of their biologicalrelevance has accumulated from both sequence analysis and function-specific assays.The folds are unusually stable and their formation appears to require close managementto maintain cell health; regulatory failure correlates with genomic instability and anumber of cancer phenotypes.This thesis examines, by x-ray crystallography, the solvent structure of a pre-viously reported tetramolecular RNA quadruplex, UGGGGU stabilized by Sr 2+ ions.Crystal forms of the octameric assembly formed by this sequence exhibit unusuallystrong diffraction and anomalous signal enabling the construction of reliable models toa resolution of 0.85A. The solvent structure confirms hydration patterns reported forother nucleic acid helical conformations and provides support for the greater stabilityof RNA quadruplexes relative to DNA. Novel features detected in the octameric RNAassembly include a new crystal form and evidence of multiple conformations, amongwhich one leading to the formation of a well-hydrated internal cavity.Though solvent is generally acknowledged to play a fundamental role in nucleicacid structure, its characterization from diffraction data remains challenging. To assistwith this task, the thesis investigates two novel additions to the crystallographic meth-ods arsenal. The first is segmentation of electron density maps into Morse-Smale basinscharacterized by uniform gradient flow. The second is the use of level set Fast Marchingmethods to compute the full distance field defined by the molecular surface. Both tech-niques show promise, though additional work will be required to yield effective tools.Gradient-flow segmentation provides an unambiguous way to gather all map density as-sociated with a modeled atom and enables the calculation of novel volumetric propertiesincluding total basin density. Distance field calculation provides a unified framework forcombining molecular surface calculation with surface-related queries including pocketand cavity detection and solvent travel depth.

Comparative host protein interactions with HTLV-1 p30 and HTLV-2 p28: insights into difference in pathobiology of human retroviruses
AbstractBackgroundHuman T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) are closely related human retroviruses, but have unique disease associations. HTLV-1 is the causative agent of an aggressive T-cell leukemia known as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and other inflammatory diseases. HTLV-2 infection has not been clearly associated with any disease condition. Although both viruses can transform T cells in vitro, the HTLV-1 provirus is mainly detected in CD4+ T cells whereas HTLV-2 is mainly detected in CD8+ T cells of infected individuals. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 encode accessory proteins p30 and p28, respectively, which share partial amino acid homology and are required for viral persistence in vivo. The goal of this study was to identify host proteins interacting with p30 and p28 in order to understand their role in pathogenesis.ResultsAffinity-tag purification coupled with mass spectrometric (MS) analyses revealed 42 and 22 potential interacting cellular partners of p30 and p28, respectively. Of these, only three cellular proteins, protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), hnRNP K and 60&#8201;S ribosomal protein L8 were detected in both p30 and p28 fractions. To validate the proteomic results, four interacting proteins were selected for further analyses using immunoblot assays. In full agreement with the MS analysis two cellular proteins REG&#947; and NEAF-interacting protein 30 (NIP30) selectively interacted with p30 and not with p28; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNP H1) bound to p28 and not to p30; and PRMT5 interacted with both p30 and p28. Further studies demonstrated that reduced levels of PRMT5 resulted in decreased HTLV-2 viral gene expression whereas the viral gene expression of HTLV-1 was unchanged.ConclusionThe comparisons of p30 and p28 host protein interaction proteome showed striking differences with some degree of overlap. PRMT5, one of the host proteins that interacted with both p30 and p28 differentially affected HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viral gene expression suggesting that PRMT5 is involved at different stages of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 biology. These findings suggest that distinct host protein interaction profiles of p30 and p28 could, in part, be responsible for differences in HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 pathobiology. This study provides new avenues of investigation into mechanisms of viral infection, tropism and persistence.

Primary Frustration in the Red Opossum (Lutreolina crassicaudata)
Red opossums (Lutreolina crassicaudata) were trained in a Y-maze to locate a piece of food (the initial response, Ri) and afterwards to run back to the start box (the final response, Rf) where no reward was available immediately although a new trial was scheduled after a 30-s intertrial interval. Omission of food in some of the training sessions (Sessions 2, 10, 20, and 30) led to a decrement in latencies of the Rf, but only in Sessions 10 and 20, which was interpreted as evidence that primary frustration elicited by omission of an expected reward increases the vigor of ongoing instrumental behavior. The absence of this effect in the first and last extinction sessions ruled out an account based on post-ingestion factors, such as transitory satiation. The results are discussed in relation to vertebrate research on learning phenomena thought to depend on the frustrative consequences of nonreward.

The nature of the semantic scale : evidence from sign language research
A difficult learning problem for both children and artificial language learning systems is knowing what is intended to be conveyed based on what is literally said. For example, adults usually take "Some teas contain caffeine" to also convey that "Not all teas contain caffeine", an inference known as a scalar implicature. The present work investigates the role of language-specific knowledge in such inferences through three studies on scalar implicatures in American Sign Language (ASL). The first study illustrates a new experimental paradigm and compares prototypical scalar implicatures in ASL and English. The second study includes the first investigation of general use coordinators in ASL that can be interpreted as either conjunction ("and") or disjunction ("or"). This provides a test case for the role of language-specific lexical contrast in scalar implicatures, with results showing that lexically non-contrastive scales (i.e., lexical scales whose items differ in meaning but not in form) trigger less scalar implicatures than prototypical lexically contrastive scales, which are based on contrasting lexical items. In the third study, both lexically contrastive and non-contrastive scales are interpreted by deaf native signers and also deaf signers who learned ASL at later ages. Result show that later ASL learners calculated less implicatures than early learning signers, but only on the lexically contrastive scale. Together, these studies support a view that despite their context dependence, scalar implicatures are most likely to be triggered by lexical items which contrast with each other in form to create a context-independent "scale", and that there may even be advantages to learning scales early in life. The dissertation concludes with suggestions for incorporating lexical contrast into theories of implicature and for further study of the semantic/ pragmatic interface in sign languages

The Effect of Processing Parameters on the Thermoelectric Properties of Magnesium Silicide
Thermoelectric materials are unique in their ability to directly convert thermal energy into electrical. Various applications include: energy scavenging, spot cooling and heating, and interstellar power generation. Current research is geared towards improving thermoelectric materials for greater energy conversion efficiency. Mg2Si has been a good candidate for study due to its low toxicity, low density, and availability of constituent elements. Recent efforts to improve efficiency of bulk thermoelectric materials have included, but are not limited to, changing the electronic band structure through doping or altering the microstructure. While the former has been well studied and verified, the latter remains relatively untouched experimentally. There is evidence that thermoelectric materials with low dimensionality show improvement in certain properties. Thin films and nanowires are known to have lower thermal conductivities than their bulk counterparts. The goal of this work is to provide evidence of microstructural effects on the thermoelectric properties of bulk Mg2Si.	The three relevant properties for thermoelectric materials are thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and the Seebeck coefficient. Because commercial measurement systems are costly and have limited measurement ranges and accuracies, the development of custom equipment is sometimes necessary. An electrical AC current source is developed and used to measure the electrical conductivity and, through the 3&#969; method, thermal conductivity of bulk samples. The measured values are comparable, with a 3% agreement, to a separate well-established system.	The bulk samples are consolidated from powder using the Current Activated Pressure Assisted Densification (CAPAD) process. It is known that different processing temperatures alter the amount of grain growth during the densification process. Samples processed at higher temperatures show increasing thermal and electrical conductivities while the Seebeck coefficient decreases. These trends lead to a maximum figure of merit value with the sample processed at an intermediate temperature.

Engineering Nanoparticle-Protein Associations for Protein Crystal Nucleation and Nanoparticle Arrangement
Engineering the nanoparticle - protein association offers a new way to form protein crystals as well as new approaches for arrangement of nanoparticles.  Central to this control is the nanoparticle surface.  By conjugating polymers on the surface with controlled molecular weights many properties of the nanoparticle can be changed including its size, stability in buffers and the association of proteins with its surface.  Large molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coatings allow for weak associations between proteins and nanoparticles.  These interactions can lead to changes in how proteins crystallize.  In particular, they decrease the time to nucleation and expand the range of conditions over which protein crystals form.  Interestingly, when PEG chain lengths are too short then protein association is minimized and these effects are not observed.  One important feature of protein crystals nucleated with nanoparticles is that the nanoparticles are incorporated into the crystals.  What results are nanoparticles placed at well-defined distances in composite protein-nanoparticle crystals.  Crystals on the size scale of 10 - 100 micrometers exhibit optical absorbance, fluorescence and super paramagnetic behavior derivative from the incorporated nanomaterials. The arrangement of nanoparticles into three dimensional arrays also gives rise to new and interesting physical and chemical properties, such as fluorescence enhancement and varied magnetic response. In addition, anisotropic nanomaterials aligned throughout the composite crystal have polarization dependent optical properties.

Wind and tidal response of a semi-enclosed bay, Bahía Concepción, Baja California
In this dissertation, I report on a field study that took place in Bahía Concepción (BC), Baja California, and related modeling. The principal goal of this thesis is to extract the winter wind driven response of the bay and compare it with recently developed theoretical models. The first results of this thesis are nevertheless theoretical and derived from an extension of previous models to the time-dependent case. This extension allows to quantify the spin up time scale of the steady response. A damped resonant response is predicted at the inertial frequency. This is a result of importance for BC, which is located at 26.7⁰N where the diurnal sea breeze oscillates at a near- inertial frequency. This theoretical development guides the analysis of observations inside BC. This analysis consists first in understanding the sub-inertial response. The along-bay sea level set-up predicted by theory is observed. Wind driven currents proved to be more difficult to extract and the comparison with theory is partially successful. Downwind currents are present over shallow areas and cross-wind currents are sometimes observed. An analysis of the dynamics suggests the importance of stratification and nonlinearities which are ignored in the theoretical models. In the diurnal/inertial band, the response is similar to the theoretical predictions developed in the early part of this thesis. Two layer-like currents are present and rotate in the clockwise direction with time. When vertical stratification is present, baroclinic effects are shown to contribute to the dynamics. Finally, I extract the current and sea level response to sea level fluctuations at the mouth of BC. The sea level at the closed end of BC follows a theoretical model with two interconnected basins. There is a resonant response near 5 cycles per day, which is identified as the quarter wavelength of the bay. Along-bay currents are consistent with theoretical predictions. This is not the case for across-bay currents

Use of an Electronic Medical Record “Dotphrase” Data Template for a Prospective Head Injury Study
Introduction: The adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in emergency departments (EDs) has changed the way that healthcare information is collected, charted, and stored. A challenge for researchers is to determine how EMRs may be leveraged to facilitate study data collection efforts. Our objective is to describe the use of a unique data collection system leveraging EMR technology and to compare data entry error rates to traditional paper data collection. 
      
          
       
      
         Methods: This was a retrospective review of data collection methods during a multicenter study of ED, anti-coagulated, head injury patients. On-shift physicians at 4 centers enrolled patients and prospectively completed data forms. These physicians had the option of completing a paper data form or an electronic “dotphrase” (DP) data form. A feature of our Epic®-based EMR is the ability to use DPs to assist in medical information entry. A DP is a preset template that may be inserted into the EMR when the physician types a period followed by a code phrase (in this case “.ichstudy”). Once the study DP was inserted at the bottom of the electronic ED note, it prompted enrolling physicians to answer study questions. Investigators then extracted data directly from the EMR. 
      
          
       
      
         Results: From July 2009 through December 2010, we enrolled 883 patients. DP data forms were used in 288 (32.6%; 95% confidence interval CI 29.5, 35.7%) cases and paper data forms in 595 (67.4%; 95% CI 64.3, 70.5%). Sixty-six (43.7%; 95% CI 35.8, 51.6%) of 151 physicians enrolling patients used DP data entry at least once. Using multivariate analysis, we found no association between physician age, gender, or tenure and DP use. Data entry errors were more likely on paper forms (234/595, 39.3%; 95% CI 35.4, 43.3%) than DP forms (19/288, 6.6%; 95% CI 3.7, 9.5%), difference in error rates 32.7% (95% CI 27.9, 37.6%, P < 0.001). 
      
          
       
      
         Conclusion: DP data collection is a feasible means of data collection. DP data forms maintain all study data within the secure EMR environment, obviating the need to maintain and collect paper data forms. This innovation was embraced by many of our emergency physicians and resulted in lower data entry error rates. West J Emerg Med 2013;14(2):109-113.

Development of the B-Stark motional Stark effect diagnostic for measurements of the internal magnetic field in the DIII-D tokamak
A new diagnostic, B-Stark, has been developed at the DIII- D tokamak for measurements of the magnitude and direction of the internal magnetic field. The B-Stark system is a version of a motional Stark effect (MSE) diagnostic based on the Stark split D/alpha emission from injected neutral beams. This diagnostic uses the spacing of the Stark lines to measure the magnitude of the magnetic field, and the intensities of the pi₃ and sigma₁ lines to measure the magnetic pitch angle. These lines originate from the same upper level, and are therefore not dependent on the n=3 level populations. The measurement of the magnetic pitch angle requires a specific viewing geometry with respect to the neutral beams, which is provided by the B-Stark diagnostic installation. The B-Stark technique may have advantages over MSE polarimetry diagnostics in future devices with high densities and temperatures, such as ITER. Under these conditions coatings on the plasma facing mirrors are expected, which can cause changes in the polarization state of the reflected light. The B-Stark technique is insensitive to the polarization direction, and can calibrate for polarization dependent transmission by using an in-situ beam-into-gas calibration. This dissertation describes the development and characterization of the B-Stark diagnostic. The hardware design and spectral fitting techniques are discussed in detail. Calibration procedures are described including the in-situ determination of the beam emission line profiles, viewing geometry and properties of the collection optics. The performance of the system is evaluated over the range of plasma conditions accessible at DIII-D. Measurements of the magnetic field have been made with toroidal fields in the range 1.2 - 2.1Tesla, plasma currents in the range 0.5 - 2.0MA, densities between 1.7 - 9.0 x 10¹⁹m⁻³, and neutral beam voltages between 50 - 81keV. These results are compared to values found from plasma equilibrium reconstructions (EFIT) and the MSE polarimetry system on DIII-D. The B-Stark system has been shown to provide measurements with a random errors as low as 0.2-0.3° in the magnetic pitch angle and 0.001-0.002T in B. Finally, proposed future improvements for the B-Stark diagnostic are presented

The role of pathogen defense signaling components in ABA signal transduction and isolation of an ABA/C23 signaling mutant
In a place teeming with pathogens, maintaining a defense mechanism against pathogen attacks is critical for survival especially when other stress factors such as drought can also endanger plant life, a staple of our agriculture. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates major abiotic stress responses, while the hormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) all participate in plant defense against pathogen invasions. Previous research has provided evidence for the antagonistic relationship between ABA signaling and pathogen resistance. To determine the range at which ABA signaling affects plant defense signaling, stomatal responses of pathogenic mutants were examined under treatments of ABA and C23, a synthetic chemical that inhibits ABA signaling and induces expression of defense genes. Results reveal that the convergence points between ABA and defense signaling occur upstream of SA synthesis and signaling. To identify a new mutant that is interconnected between the two pathways, mutant screening and genetic cloning of N277 is performed, a mutant line shown to exhibit insensitivity to ABA and to the C23 pathogen-induced inhibition of ABA signaling. This study aims to understand the mechanism at which ABA signaling interacts with pathogen defense signaling to enhance plant protection from pathogen invasions without decreasing crop yield

Hypersurfaces of constant curvature in asymptotically hyperbolic spaces
The relationship between the geometry of a conformally compact manifold and the conformal geometry of its conformal infinity is of particular interest due to its association with the AdS/CFT correspondence of physics, a conjectured correlation between a string theory on a negatively curved Einstein manifold and a conformal field theory on its boundary at infinity. In the case of hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ with conformal infinity the round sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$, a very precise relationship has been established between conformal invariants (the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor) on $\mathbb{S}^n$ and Weingarten curvatures of immersed hypersurfaces \cite{MR2538508}. This same relationship has been extended to hyperbolic Poincar\'{e} manifolds \cite{MR2679632}. We establish a correspondence between constant scalar curvature metrics on conformal infinity and families of hypersurfaces of constant Weingarten curvature in a neighborhood of infinity. This generalizes results of Mazzeo and Pacard \cite{MR2815739} on existence of constant curvature foliations of asymptotically hyperbolic spaces to more arbitrary Weingarten curvatures.

Carbonic anhydrases function as mediators of CO₂-induced stomatal movements and regulators of stomatal development in Arabidopsis thaliana
Stomata are small pores in the epidermes of leaves that open and close in response to a variety of environmental signals including carbon dioxide (CO₂). In wild type plants, high levels of CO₂ cause stomata to close, as well as cause a decrease in stomatal density. However, the CO₂- binding proteins that control these responses remain unknown. Through guard cell and mesophyll cell specific microarrays, two highly expressed Beta-carbonic anhydrase genes, CA1 and CA4, were identified. Arabidopsis thaliana ca1ca4 double knockout mutants exhibit an insensitive stomatal closure response to 800ppm CO₂ and exhibit a higher stomatal density than wild type. To determine which gene, CA1 and/or CA4, is responsible for the CO₂ phenotype, the genomic DNA with native promoter of CA1 and CA4 and the cDNAs of CA1 and CA4 driven by a guard cell promoter were transformed into ca1ca4 double mutant plants. In these CA-expressing transgenic lines, stomatal density and CO₂ response recovered to wild type phenotypes , suggesting that the CA1 and CA4 genes are indeed responsible for the stomatal CO₂ insensitive response as well as for the high stomatal density of the ca1ca4 double mutant. To determine whether CA homologues from other species could complement the ca1ca4 phenotypes, the structurally unrelated Human CAII controlled by a guard cell promoter was also transformed into ca1ca4 plants. The HmCAII was able to restore the mutant phenotype of CO₂- induced stomatal closure as well as stomatal density. These results show that CA1 and CA4 function within the CO₂ signaling mechanisms that mediate CO₂ control of stomatal movements and development

Ixodes scapularis saliva mitigates inflammatory cytokine secretion during Anaplasma phagocytophilum stimulation of immune cells
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						Ixodes scapularis saliva enables the transmission of infectious agents to the mammalian host due to its immunomodulatory, anesthetic and anti-coagulant properties. However, how I. scapularis saliva influences host cytokine secretion in the presence of the obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum remains elusive.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and A. phagocytophilum. Cytokine secretion was measured in the presence and absence of I. scapularis saliva. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also stimulated with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-&#945; in the presence and absence of I. scapularis saliva and interleukin (IL)-8 was measured.
				
				
					
						Results
					
						I. scapularis saliva inhibits inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages during stimulation of Toll-like (TLR) and Nod-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathways. The effect of I. scapularis saliva on immune cells is not restricted to murine macrophages because decreasing levels of interleukin (IL)-8 were observed after TNF-&#945; stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. I. scapularis saliva also mitigates pro-inflammatory cytokine response by murine macrophages during challenge with A. phagocytophilum.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These findings suggest that I. scapularis may inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion during rickettsial transmission at the vector-host interface.

The phosphoprotein Rppa09976 bridges peroxisomal and isolation membranes during pexophagy
Peroxisomes are important single membrane organelles which are required for certain metabolic pathways. In yeast, Pichia pastoris, peroxisomes are degraded by selective autophagy pathway termed pexophagy. Autophagy is process whereby proteins and organelles are delivered to the vacuole and degraded. Previous studies indicated Atg30 as the receptor for pexophagy, which interacts with the autophagic machinery (Atg11 and Atg17) as well as peroxisomal membrane (Pex3 and Pex14). However, unlike other selective autophagy receptors, Atg30 does not interact with Atg8, a major component of the isolation membrane that sequester peroxisomes during pexophagy. Here, we found the missing link, a novel peroxisomal membrane protein Rppa09976, which bridges peroxisomal (Pex3 and Atg30) and isolation (Atg8) membranes. Rppa09976 is phosphoprotein that contains an N-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain, three putative Atg8 binding sites and two transmembrane domains. Rppa09976 is expressed in methanol medium and phosphorylated upon arrival to peroxisomes from ER. We purified the Rppa09976-HA fusion protein and mapped 21 phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry. The functional role of Rppa09976 phosphorylation awaits further studies. We showed that two of the three putative Atg8 binding sites at the N-terminal of the protein are required for Atg8 binding and pexophagy. Point mutation of the conserved acyl-CoA binding site also leads to a pexophagy defect. Hence, we propose that Rppa09976 provides acyl-CoA for the growing isolation membranes that sequester peroxisomes

Human neural stem cell therapy in a primate model for Parkinson's disease
Neural stem cells derived from various sources have shown considerable promise for the treatment of parkinsonian symptoms in a variety of animal models; however, the long- term potential of human neural stem cells to engraft, differentiate into dopamine neurons, and restore function in the dopamine-depleted non-human primate brain remains unknown. This dissertation describes a clinically relevant paradigm for transplantation of undifferentiated human fetal subventricular-zone derived NSC in the parkinsonian primate, including gene therapy enhancement with GDNF. Chapter 1 reviews literature regarding functional properties of NSC that make them a candidate for cellular transplantation in neurodegenerative disorders, the potent neurotrophic effects of GDNF, as well as the rationale for utilizing large animals to adequately test stem cell therapeutics. Chapter 2 describes a novel culturing system to overcome cellular senescence and efficiently expand large-scale human fetal NSC long-term without aberration. Included are clinically pertinent techniques to produce and deliver hfNSC into both the rodent and primate brain, as well as new advances in radiological tracking and imaging utilizing FDA-approved supra-magnetic iron-oxide particles. Chapter 3 demonstrates the first reported evidence that undifferentiated hfNSC differentiate into some TH-ir neurons and restore functional deficits in parkinsonian non-human primates. Normalization of dopamine -levels and nigrostriatal circuitry argue for neuroprotective effects of endogenous cells rather than direct cell replacement. To allow for morphological analysis of donor grafts, reporter hfNSC were created (Ch.2) for long-term studies. Chapter 4 presents a new paradigm in which hfNSC are homotopically transplanted concomitantly with striatal AAV-GDNF to enhance graft survival and promote axonal outgrowth. Transplanted cells engrafted for up to 11-months and differentiated extensively congruent with host circuitry, demonstrating for the first time that undifferentiated hfNSC retain developmentally relevant programs of differentiation and respond to host signals in the dopamine-depleted primate brain. Further, evidence supports the standing argument that fetal subventricular-zone derived NSC do not significantly differentiate into mature A9-subtype midbrain dopamine neurons in-vivo, even in a GDNF-rich environment. Chapter 5 discusses the significance of these findings to cellular transplantation in the adult CNS and the future application of stem cell transplantation with regards to Parkinson's disease

Chemical and Biological Studies of DNA Carboxymethylation
Chemical modification of DNA is of interest in toxicology and in evaluating human health risks associated with exposure to chemical carcinogens. Formation of various DNA adducts is considered an initial step for chemical species to exert their genotoxicity. DNA carboxymethylation has been suggested to be an important etiological factor in development of gastrointestinal cancers. In this dissertation, I focused on developing synthetic methods for preparation of novel carboxymethylated DNA lesions and incorporation of these lesions into oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) for biological studies. I also developed an LC-MS-based analytical method for identification of carboxymethylated DNA lesions formed in isolated DNA and in cultured human cells. The mutagenic and cytotoxic properties of these lesions in vivo were assessed by a newly developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) method.Chapters 2 and 3 described the synthetic methods developed for synthesizing four novel carboxymethylated DNA lesions: <italic>N</italic><super>4</super>-carboxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (<italic>N</italic><super>4</super>-CMdC), <italic>N</italic>3-carboxymethylthymidine (<italic>N</italic>3-CMdT), <italic>O</italic><super>4</super>-carboxymethylthymidine (<italic>O</italic><super>4</super>-CMdT) and <italic>N</italic><super>6</super>-carboxymethyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (<italic>N</italic><super>6</super>-CMdA). By using LC-MS/MS, I confirmed that these lesions could be induced in calf thymus DNA treated with potassium diazoacetate (KDA). I also extended these synthetic methods to the preparation of lesion-carrying phosphoramidite derivatives, which allowed for the site-specific incorporation of these lesions into ODNs, and confirmed the identities of these ODNs by tandem mass spectrometry. Chapter 4 described the synthesis of stable isotope-labeled, carboxymethylated nucleoside derivatives which could serve as internal standards for future quantification study. With the use of these standards and LC-MS/MS, I found that <italic>O</italic><super>4</super>-CMdT and <italic>N</italic><super>6</super>-CMdA could be induced in human kidney epithelial cells (HEK 293T/17) upon exposure to azaserine. In Chapter 5, we developed a high-throughput method for examining the mutagenic and cytotoxic properties of carboxymethylated DNA lesions in cells. Our results illustrated that <italic>N</italic>3-CMdT induces predominantly T&rarr;A transversion mutation while <italic>O</italic><super>4</super>-CMdT induces T&rarr;C transition mutation. Taken together, the combined chemical and biological approaches developed in this dissertation improved significantly our understanding of the biological implications of DNA carboxymethylation.

Chagas Disease in the United States and the Prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Southern California Woodrats
Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease. Millions of people are infected with the incurable disease and it is estimated that thousands die from Chagas every year. It is thought that all triatomine, which are almost exclusive to the Americas, are capable of being a disease vector and all mammals can be a host of the parasite. Parasites are transmitted from wildlife to man primarily in Latin America, but due to migration, blood transfusions, organ donations, and vertical transmission, the disease now exists worldwide. In addition to Latin America, autochthonous transmission has occurred in North America. Most of the reports of T. cruzi in the United States wildlife are from the southwest where the primary mammalian host is the woodrat. The health of 55 southern California N. fuscipes woodrats was evaluated by PCR using the TCZ1/TCZ2 primer set. None of the woodrats tested were found to be infected with the T. cruzi parasite.

Measurement of Thermal Diffusivity and Conductivity in Advanced Nanostructured Materials
Continuous device downscaling, growing integration densities of the nanoscale electronics and development of alternative information processing paradigms, such as spintronics, call for drastic increase in the data storage capacity. There is a strong need to engineer alternative materials, which can become foundation of new computational paradigms or lead to other applications such as efficient energy conversion.  In this thesis I review results for the thermal and magnetic characterization of the near-field optical transducer for the heat-assisted magnetic recording for beyond the 10-Tbit/in2 densities. In order to record information, the heat-assisted magnetic recording system uses not only magnetic but also thermal energy. For this reason the recording media with the substantially higher anisotropy could be utilized to achieve the ultra-high recording densities. The heat-assisted magnetic recording and spintronic information processing require accurate thermal management of magnetic thin films. Here I report the results of the investigation of the thermal transport in Pd/CoPd/Pd magnetic multilayers with the thickness of individual layers in the nanometer range.  Also, I investigate the thermal properties of FePt films when deposited on a Ag or Cu heat sink layer with varying thicknesses for the use in heat-assisted magnetic recording.  It was found that the FePt films grown on Cu demonstrated the L10-FePt (001) texture while the FePt films grown on Ag appeared to be isotropic. As the thickness of the heat sink layer increased from 15 to 120 nm, the coercivity of the FePt films decreased from 1.7 - 1.5 Tesla for Cu, and 1.3 - 1.0 Tesla for Ag. Thermal conductivity measurements showed that as Ag and Cu thickness increased, the out-of-plane thermal conductivity decreased, demonstrating that the thermal conductivity can be adjusted by varying the heat sink layer.

Invariant Imbedding Relation for the Principles Of Invariance
SIO Reference 57-45. The principle of invariant imbedding. recently stated by Bellmr and Kalaba, is a rule of action which may be followed in the mathematical formulation of any of a wide class of problems concerned with transfer phenomena in general media. The statement of the principle generalizes the methodology originally developed by Ambarzumian and extended by Chandrasekhar in their studies of the transfer of radiation through scattering and absorbing media. In this note we exhibit an explicit analytic embodiment of the principle for radiative transfer and neutron transport processes. This symbolic statement of the principle - which we shall call the invariant imbedding relation - yields in particular the general symmetric forms of the principles of invariance for these processes. The semi-group features which generally are associated with an invariantly imbedded process are also implicit in the invariant imbedding relation. The present discussion will be limited to the steady state case on a class of inhomogeneous one-parameter carrier spaces (e.g., plane-parallel, cylindrical, spherical, and general one-parameter space filling families of surfaces).

Deficiency of terminal complement pathway inhibitor promotes neuronal tau pathology and degeneration in mice
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms aggregates in tauopathies but the processes leading to this pathological hallmark are not understood. Because tauopathies are accompanied by neuroinflammation and the complement cascade forms a key innate immune pathway, we asked whether the complement system has a role in the development of tau pathology.
				
				
					
						Findings
					We tested this hypothesis in two mouse models, which expressed either a central inhibitor of complement or lacked an inhibitor of the terminal complement pathway. Complement receptor-related gene/protein y is the natural inhibitor of the central complement component C3 in rodents. Expressing a soluble variant (sCrry) reduced the number of phospho-tau (AT8 epitope) positive neurons in the brain stem, cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus of aged P301L mutant tau/sCrry double-transgenic mice compared with tau single-transgenic littermates (JNPL3 line). CD59a is the major inhibitor of formation of the membrane attack complex in mice. Intrahippocampal injection of adeno-associated virus encoding mutant human P301L tau into Cd59a&#8722;/&#8722; mice resulted in increased numbers of AT8-positive cells compared with wild-type controls. This was accompanied by neuronal and synaptic loss and reduced dendritic integrity.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Our data in two independent mouse models with genetic changes in key regulators of the complement system support the hypothesis that the terminal pathway has an active role in the development of tau pathology. We propose that inhibition of the terminal pathway may be beneficial in tauopathies.

Synthesis and applications of side chain-functionalized polylactic acid-based polymers and studies toward a chemical method to degrade Alzheimer's disease-related beta-amyloid peptides
The first part of this dissertation focuses on new methodology to prepare functionalizable derivatives of polylactic acid (PLA), an important biodegradable and biocompatible polymer often used for drug-delivery applications. Chapter 1 provides a brief background covering the uses and properties of biodegradable polymers and outlines previous strategies to synthesize functionalized PLA. Chapter 2 presents a novel synthetic route to functionalized lactide monomers via a Passerini- type condensation reaction. This methodology provides access to a variety of functionalized PLA molecules, including those with derivatizable alkyne and azide pendant groups. In addition, the chapter explores the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles from these functionalized PLAs for potential use in drug delivery applications. The second part of this dissertation focuses on studies toward the development of a small molecule capable of chemically degrading the Alzheimer's related beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide. Chapter 3 provides a brief introduction to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its potential impact on global health. The chapter discusses the amyloid cascade hypothesis (which implicates Abeta as a causative factor in developing AD) as well as the current drugs and therapeutic strategies used to stop or reverse the progression of this disease. Chapter 4 introduces target-directed degradation of Abeta with a small molecule as a potential approach for the treatment of AD. The chapter presents the design and synthesis of a small molecule comprised of a cyclic enediyne chemical "warhead" moiety and a benzothiazole aniline (BTA) Abeta binding group. This designed BTA-enediyne conjugate reduces the toxicity of Abeta, presumably by degrading the amyloid to lower molecular weight fragments that are less harmful than full-length Abeta. Chapter 5 describes the development of a methodology leading to an improved synthesis of oligoethylene glycol derivatives of BTA and the collaborations made possible because of the increased availability of these molecules. These compounds exhibit many interesting, biomedically relevant properties including the ability to inhibit SEVI and semen-mediated infectivity of HIV-1 and form ion channels in lipid bilayers

Solving Consistency Problems in Multiple Hypotheses Testing with Consonant Likelihood Ratio Test
In the past century, several multiple testing procedures have been developed based on the closure principle. Procedures following the closure principle are called closed test and they find individual tests for intersection hypotheses in the family and collates the results to control the familywise error rate. Almost all popular closed tests use the union-intersection method for their intersection hypotheses. However, due to computational issue, likelihood ratio test has not yet received much attention in closed testing.  Moreover, not being a union-intersection method, the likelihood ratio test will not satisfy the logical consistency requirement of consonance.In this dissertation, a general solution (consonance adjustment) to the consistency problem in multiple hypotheses testing is proposed under the framework of closure principle and partitioning principle. Simulation examples are used to show its advantages.Besides a general framework, also provided in this dissertation is a special form of the consonant test in the context of multiple comparisons with a control. Using likelihood ratio test with the closure principle and a consonance adjustment step, the consonant closed likelihood ratio test is introduced. The rejection region, shortcut and steps in critical constants calculation are discussed. Extensive simulation studies and pre-clinical trial example are provided.More recently, testing for efficacy in multiple endpoints has emerged as a challenging statistical problem in clinical trials. Current approaches to this problem are based on closed testing or partition testing, which test the efficacy in certain dose-endpoint combinations and collate the results. Partition testing is in general a more powerful approach since it tests fewer hypotheses to avoid unnecessary power loss. However, all current approaches are still based on various union-intersection tests. In my dissertation, I generalize the decision path principle proposed by Liu and Hsu (2009) to the cases with multiple primary endpoints. Then propose a new partition testing approach based on consonance adjusted likelihood ratio test. The new procedure provides consistent inferences and yet it is still conservative and does not rely on the estimation of endpoint correlations or independence assumption which might be challenged by the regulatory agencies.

A modified protocol for monitoring silicic acid uptake in natural phytoplankton assemblages
AbstractDiatoms are important contributors to many biogeochemical cycles in aquatic environments due to their relatively large size and rapid growth rates.  Amongst the factors that can limit their growth and productivity, the availability of silicic acid ranks high; the lack of this nutrient in the environment can also be the cause of increased toxicity in the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia. For these reasons, it is desirable to track the uptake and utilization of silicic acid by diatoms. Although stable and radio-labeled isotopes of silica exist, they are not commonly used by marine researchers because of the isotope cost and the complexity involved with analysis. PDMPO 2-(4-pyridyl)-5{4-dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamoyl)-methoxyphenyl}oaxzole is a low-cost, commercially available fluorophore for monitoring new silica production by siliceous phytoplankton species. PDMPO has been used by a variety of authors to study natural diatom populations for identifying which parts of a cell or which proportion of the phytoplankton assemblage are actively polymerizing silica. These studies however do not acknowledge possible false positive results due to exteriorly bound PDMPO on dinoflagellates and other non-siliceous organisms. Here, we use time series data from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf (Monterey Bay California) to show the reactivity of PDMPO with non-silicifying species in a natural, mixed phytoplankton community. Lab experiments using the ionophoric antibiotics monensin and nigericin, show that when used as rinsing agents, the extra cellular binding of PDMPO to various dinoflagellate species can be significantly reduced.  We feel that this is an important development for the application of the PDMPO probe to natural community Si kinetics studies in order to reduce false positive data when samples have been digested for quantification via spectrofluorometric analysis.

Solar fuels : integration of molecular catalysts with p-type semiconductor photocathode
Light assisted or driven fuel generation by carbon dioxide and proton reduction can be achieved by a p-type semiconductor/liquid junction. There are four different types of schemes which are typically used for carbon dioxide and proton reduction for fuel generation applications. In these systems, the semiconductor can serve the dual role of a catalyst and a light absorber. Specific electrocatalysts (heterogeneous and homogeneous) can be driven by p-type semiconductor where it works only as light absorber in order to achieve better selectivity and faster rates of catalysis. The p-type semiconductor/ molecular catalyst junction is primarily explored in this dissertation for CO₂ and proton photoelectrochemical reduction. A general principle for the operation of p-type semiconductor/molecular junctions is proposed and validated for several molecular catalysts in contact with p-Si photocathode. It is also shown that the light assisted homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis can coexist. This principle is extended to achieve direct conversion of CO₂ to methanol on Platinum nanoparticles decorated p-Si in aqueous medium through pyridine/ pyridinium system for CO₂ reduction. An open circuit voltage higher than 600 mV is achieved for p-Si/Re(bipy- tBu)(CO)₃Cl where bipy-tBu = 4,4'- tert-butyl-2,2'- bipyridine (Re-catalyst) junction. The photoelectrochemical conversion of CO₂ to CO₃ using a p-Si /Re-catalyst junction is obtained at 100 % Faradaic efficiency. The homogeneous catalytic current density for CO₂ by p-Si/Re-catalyst junction under illumination scales linearly with illumination intensity (both polychromatic and monochromatic). This indicates that the homogeneous catalysis is light driven for the p-Si/Re-catalyst junction system up to light intensities approaching one sun. The photoelectrochemical reduction of other active members of Re(bipyridyl)(CO)₃Cl molecular catalyst family is also observed on illuminated p-Si photocathode. Effects of surface modification and nanowire morphology of the p- Si photocathode on the homogeneous catalytic reduction of CO₂ by using p-Si/Re-catalyst junction are also described in this dissertation. For phenyl ethyl modified p-Si photocathode, the rate of homogeneous catalysis for CO₂ reduction by Re-catalyst is three times greater than glassy carbon electrode and six times greater than the hexyl modified and the hydrogen terminated p-Si photocathodes. When hexyl modified p-Si nanowires are used as photocathode, the homogeneous catalytic current density increased by a factor of two compared to planar p-Si (both freshly etched and hexyl modified) photocathode. A successful light assisted generation of syngas (H₂:CO = 2: 1) from CO₂ and water is achieved by using p-Si/Re- catalyst. In this system, water is reduced heterogeneously on p-Si surface and CO₂ is reduced homogeneously by Re- catalyst. The same principle is extended to the homogeneous proton reduction by using p-Si/FeFe complex junction where FeFe complex Fe₂(Mu-bdt)(CO)₆ (bdt = benzene-1,2-dithiolate) is a proton reduction molecular catalyst. A short circuit quantum efficiency of 79 % with 100 % Faradaic efficiency and 600 mV open circuit are achieved by using p-Si/FeFe complex for proton reduction with 300 mM perchloric acid as a proton source. Cobalt difluororyl-diglyoximate (Co-catalyst) is a proton reduction catalyst with only 200 mV of overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). The Co-catalyst is photoelectrochemically reduced with a photovoltage of 470 mV on illuminated p-Si photocathode. For p-Si photocathodes, the overpotential for proton reduction is over 1 V. In principle, p-Si/Co-catalyst junction can reduce proton to hydrogen homogeneously at underpotential. In a concluding effort, a wireless monolithic dual face single photoelectrode (multi junction photovoltaic cell which can generate a voltage higher 1.7 V) based photochemical cell is proposed for direct conversion of solar energy into liquid fuel. In this device, the two faces of the multijunction photoelectrode are serve as an anode and a cathode for water oxidation and fuel generation, respectively, and are separated by proton exchange membrane

               Cultivated cotton is an annual fiber crop derived mainly from two perennial species, Gossypium hirsutum L. or upland cotton, and G. barbadense L., extra long-staple fiber Pima or Egyptian cotton. These two cultivated species are among five allotetraploid species presumably derived monophyletically between G. arboreum and G. raimondii. Genomic-based approaches have been hindered by the limited variation within species. Yet, population-based methods are being used for genome-wide introgression of novel alleles from G. mustelinum and G. tomentosum into G. hirsutum using combinations of backcrossing, selfing, and inter-mating. Recombinant inbred line populations between genetics standards TM-1, (G. hirsutum) &#215; 3-79 (G. barbadense) have been developed to allow high-density genetic mapping of traits.

               This paper describes a strategy to efficiently characterize genomic variation (SNPs and indels) within and among cotton species. Over 1000 SNPs from 270 loci and 279 indels from 92 loci segregating in G. hirsutum and G. barbadense were genotyped across a standard panel of 24 lines, 16 of which are elite cotton breeding lines and 8 mapping parents of populations from six cotton species. Over 200 loci were genetically mapped in a core mapping population derived from TM-1 and 3-79 and in G. hirsutum breeding germplasm.
            
            
               
                  Conclusion
               
               In this research, SNP and indel diversity is characterized for 270 single-copy polymorphic loci in cotton. A strategy for SNP discovery is defined to pre-screen loci for copy number and polymorphism. Our data indicate that the A and D genomes in both diploid and tetraploid cotton remain distinct from each such that paralogs can be distinguished. This research provides mapped DNA markers for intra-specific crosses and introgression of exotic germplasm in cotton.

Small molecule Interactions with Heparan sulfate
Heparan sulfate (HS) has been shown to be involved in a variety of mechanisms indispensable for normal development and physiological functions, as well as pathophysiological processes such as cancer. Small molecule antagonists of HS -protein interactions could provide novel approaches to inhibiting a variety of disease processes. In a search for small molecule antagonists of HS we examined the activity of bis-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide (surfen). Fluorescence-based titrations indicate that surfen binds to glycosaminoglycans, neutralizes the anticoagulant activity of both unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins and inhibits enzymatic sulfation and degradation reactions in vitro. Addition of surfen to cultured cells blocks FGF2-binding and signaling dependent on cell surface HS, and prevents both FGF2 and VEGF165-mediated sprouting of endothelial cells in Matrigel. Surfen also blocks HS mediated cell adhesion to the Hep-II domain of fibronectin and prevents infection by Herpes simplex virus -1 dependent on glycoprotein D interaction with HS. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of identifying small molecule antagonists of HS and raise the possibility of developing pharmacological agents to treat disorders that involve glycosaminoglycan-protein interactions. Facilitating the uptake of molecules into living cells is of substantial interest for basic research and drug delivery. We show that a derivative of neomycin, guanidinoneomycin (GNeo), can deliver large bioactive molecules, and its uptake depends entirely on cell surface HS. The high selectivity of guanidinoneomycin for HS suggests the possibility of exploiting differences in proteoglycan compositions to target delivery to different cell types. Saporin-GNeo conjugates were used to test the possibility of differentially targeting cancer cells. To explore the utility of these molecules in therapeutic applications other than toxin delivery, we demonstrated that GNeo can be utilized to correct enzyme defects in lysosomal storage diseases, specifically mucopolysaccharidosis VII. The work presented in this dissertation represents the first characterization of the biological utility and therapeutic applicability of small molecules that interact with HS, and supports future development of more potent and selective derivatives

Memory-like CD8⁺ T cells generated during homeostatic proliferation defer to antigen-experienced memory cells
Naïve T cells proliferate in response to lymphopenia and acquire the phenotypic and functional qualities of memory T cells, providing enhanced protection against infection. How well 'memory-like' T cells generated during lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation (HP-memory) differentiate into secondary memory cells and compete with antigen-experienced 'true-memory' cells is previously unknown. We found that CD8⁺ HP-memory T cells generated robust responses upon infection and produced a secondary memory population comparable to true-memory cells in the absence of competition. However, when true-memory and HP- memory T cells competed during infection, HP-memory cells contributed less to the effector population, contracted earlier and formed fewer secondary memory cells than the true-memory cells, despite earlier expansion. The HP- memory T cells can in turn outcompete naïve T cells during the immune response, revealing the existence of a memory T cell response hierarchy. Furthermore, HP- and true-memory cells demonstrated distinct localization within the spleen during infection, indicating differential access to signals necessary for secondary memory formation. We attempted to rescue the HP-memory cells during the course of competition by administering saturating amounts of antigen and cytokine such as IL-7 and IL-15, but were not successful, indicating that they were not competing for those factors. Secondary memory derived from the HP-memory cells continued to defer to secondary memory derived from the true-memory cells in the course of the tertiary infection, indicating that the nature of the HP programming could not be overcome with antigen exposure. Thus, HP-memory T cells provide protection without compromising the true-memory population. This is of clinical relevance as HP-memory T cells can arise due to a multitude of medical causes. Their natural presence as part of the immune compartment will not contribute to the erosion of the established true-memory populations derived from vaccinations and prior infections. HP-memory cells are not an exact substitute for memory, but serve as a viable source of protection from pathogenic invasion. Differences in HP-and true-memory T cells may reveal the basis for competition for limited resources within the memory T cell compartment

[theory, emotion, source, james]

On the Nature of Emotion
When James (1890) enlarged on his theory of emotion he bemoaned the descriptive nature of psychological works on emotion and wrote "They give one nowhere a central point of view, or a deductive or generative principle." (p. 448 of 1950 Dover reprint). Output of theories after James'publication remained high and continued into the 1930's (see bibliographyby Raines, 1929, 1930, 1931; and historical reviews by Gardiner, Metcalf, & Beebe-Center, 1937; and Hillman, 1960). Then, although theories continued to appear, general interest in emotion flagged and in psychology textbooks the subject was relegated to chapters on motivation. Interest revived in the 1970's and is now high again. In a textbookon emotion Strongman (1973) gave vignettes of about thirty of the better known theories all post-dating James. More appeared by 1980 (Plutchik,1980; Plutchik & Kellerman, 1980; and a bibliography by Rorty, 1980) and this continued unabated in the 80's. Many of these theories are very well known and are examined in the reviews cited. It is neither possible nor necessary to review yet again so many theories if the present one is to be stated, developed and its implications explored. Similarly, the data or phenomena of emotion are too familiar to require detailed presentation here and instead sources of relevant descriptions will be cited. In citing both theoretical and data sources I have tried to use the earliest references since I believe they should be given priority over more recent sources that are essentially saying the same thing but in different terminology or in more elaborate detail. Current sources are given where they are fundamentally or significantly "new."

Biophysical and Molecular Determinants of Acrosome Formation and Motility Regulation of Sperm From the Water Strider
Sperm from a semi-aquatic insect, the water strider <italic>Aquarius remigis</italic>, are unusually long and possess a complex acrosome and flagellum. Like other animal systems, water strider sperm that emerge from the testis are incapable of fertilizing an egg and must undergo several highly regulated developmental steps in both the male and female reproductive tracts. However, in contrast to well-studied model animals such as mammals and echinoderms, little is known about these events in insects. In this dissertation, I describe the post-meiotic events in <italic>Aquarius remigis</italic> using biochemical and biophysical methodologies to follow the assembly, structure, and fate of the acrosome and the flagellum from spermatogenesis through fertilization and into early embryonic development. In contrast to other long insect sperm, half of the length of the <italic>A. remigis</italic> sperm consists of an acrosomal matrix that emerges as a 300 µm helical structure followed by a 2200 µm linear region. This unusually long acrosome contains an intrinsically fluorescent molecule with properties consistent with those of Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD). Biophysical analyses showed that FAD is immobilized and oriented during acrosome formation and may be involved in the formation of disulfide bond formation during its assembly. Further, using the intrinsic fluorescence as a marker, I followed the fate of the acrosomal matrix through fertilization and observed it inside the fertilized egg where it remained structurally intact through gastrulation. The acrosomal matrix may play roles in sperm transport and fertilization. Similar to the proximal acrosomal process, the axoneme and its associated structures, appears helical. I describe a unique motility pattern in which the flagellum loops back upon itself and forms a coil. This structure can then twist and undergo forward progressive motility with the loop acting as the anterior end. <italic>A. remigis</italic> sperm are quiescent in the seminal vesicles, but sperm motility was initiated by specific proteases or phosphatase inhibitors. Further, a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor blocked sperm motility initiation by trypsin. These results suggest that quiescence is maintained by high levels of endogenous phosphatase activity and that activation of motility is regulated by protein phosphorylation through the action of one or more kinases.

Synthesis and Characterization of Mesoporous Semiconductors
Widely studied mesoporous oxide materials have a range of potential applications, such as catalysis, absorption and separation.  However, they are not generally considered for their optical and electronic properties.  Elemental semiconductors with nano-sized pores running through them represent a different form of framework material with physical characteristics contrasting with those of the more conventional bulk, thin film and nanocrystalline forms.  This thesis describes two different routes to synthesize thin film mesoporous silicon and powder mesoporous germanium.Thin film of mesoporous silicon was produced from thin film of mesoporous silica at low temperature (<700C) using magnesium as reducing agent.  Excess magnesium risks the generation of volatile products and destruction of the bulk objects.  In thin films, excess magnesium was convenient resulting in some structural loss. However, our X-ray diffraction data show that conversion to silicon and retention of order is possible even after exposure to HCl to remove magnesia and HF to remove remnant silica.  Top-view SEM and low angle X-ray diffraction also proves retain in order and cross-section SEM shows retention of the surface features and pores in the bulk of the film. Nanoscale ordered germanium composite materials were produced from solution phase using surfactant as structural directing agents.  Non-classic anionic germanium Zintl clusters, discrete Ge94- or polymeric (Ge92-)n, co-assemble with cationic surfactant molecules via electrostatic interactions.  Depending upon size and overall charge of polymerized Zintl clusters, shape of the inorganic/organic hybrid micelle can be varied, and the periodical nano-structures of composites can be hexagonal, lamellar, or worm-like, as determined by low angle X-ray diffraction (XRD).  The anionic germanium framework of the 2-D hexagonally ordered germanium cluster/surfactant composite is condensed via oxidative coupling between the germanium Zintl clusters.  EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) study indicates that the germanium clusters were destroyed upon oxidation and tetrahedrally coordinated germanium was produced afterwards.  IR absorption shows that the surface of this material is mostly hydrogen terminated.  Majority of the cationic surfactant molecules inside the pores can be removed.  The resulting dark brown mesoporous germanium exhibits surface area up to 500 m2/g.

EXPLORATION OF SCHISTOSOMA MANSONI HAMMERHEAD RIBOZYME CATALYSIS AND STRUCTURE:  TOWARDS DIRECT OBSERVATION OF CLEAVAGE AND LIGATION, AND A 1.55 Å FULL-LENGTH MG2+-BOUND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
As a relatively simple and well-studied molecule, the hammerhead ribozyme is an ideal system to study RNA catalysis and structure.  A deeper understanding of the hammerhead catalytic mechanism and the role of divalent ions in catalysis lends support to the exploration of more complex RNA machinery such as the ribosome, and ultimately may assist in the design of new medical therapies.  Kinetic study of the hammerhead ribozyme to date has largely derived from bulk assays monitoring millions of molecules.  In contrast to such studies, which necessarily report average rates, the magnetic tweezers assay undertaken here reveals the heterogenous characteristics of individual RNA molecules in real time.  The crystal structure described in the later portion of this study advances a secondary aim concerning the study of the same full-length Schistosoma Mansoni subject; unmasking the role of physiologically relevant metal ions in full-length hammerhead catalysis.	The single molecule study presented reveals that supercoiled DNA embedded with a nucleolytic ribozyme acts in much the same way as supercoiled DNA.  Because the ribozyme is embedded in long DNA handles, the product strands of the ribozyme cannot dissociate, and the ligation rate consequently becomes more significant.  This permits us to suggest that in their natural context, hammerheads may well favor the ligated state, and may cleave in response to some form of structural perturbation.  This assay also conforms with a growing corpus of evidence suggesting RNA utilizes greater conformational freedom to overcome limited chemical diversity. 	The crystal structure described in Chapter 3 represents the highest-resolution structure of any reported hammerhead ribozyme to date (1.55 Å resolution).  With this improved resolution, new local rearrangements and hydrogen bonding interactions within the loop/bulge region are clear.  In addition, the new structure demonstrates that a divalent metal ion does indeed occupy the A9/G10.1, in addition to two peripheral sites in Stem I and III.   Crystal soaking experiments were not able to detect a metal ion at these sites in the 2006 structure.  These findings suggest that physiologically relevant divalent ions like Mg2+ may stabilize global folding of the full-length hammerhead and provide charge neutralization during the cleavage reaction.

Characterization of PHLPP1 in adult mouse ventricular myocytes
The fastest growing cardiovascular disease subclass is heart failure, brought about by factors such as cardiac hypertrophy. The serine/threonine kinase Akt is involved in many cellular processes including cell growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, angiogenesis, and studies have implicated Akt in regulating cardiac hypertrophy depending on Akt intensity, duration, and localization. Growth factors, hormones, and cytokines activate Akt by phosphorylating its activation loop (Thr308) and hydrophobic motif (Ser473). Though extensive research focuses on Akt activation by upstream kinases, the mechanism of inactivation by phosphatases are poorly understood. Our project focuses on the role of the newly discovered Akt phosphatase PHLPP (PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase) in adult mouse ventricular myocytes (AMVM). We hypothesized that removal of PHLPP1 will result in increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 after agonist stimulation in AMVM. We generated viable PHLPP1-/- mice to investigate physiological activation of Akt. PHLPP1 null AMVM had no overt phenotype differences at baseline compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Myocytes stimulated with the cytokine LIF displayed increased Akt Ser473 phosphorylation with no change at Thr308. Increased phosphorylation at Ser473 corresponded with increased activity as demonstrated by kinase assay, but there was no apparent changes in downstream GSK3 or MDM2 phosphorylation. Lastly, we found earlier Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in PHLPP1 KO myocytes in cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Our data suggests PHLPP is an important regulator of Akt signaling in AMVM and ultimately the heart where it may be an important regulator of cardiac hypertrophy

Molecular mechanisms of axon guidance in the developing spinal cord
The formation of intricate neural circuits requires that nascent axons navigate the complex environment of the developing embryo and precisely determine the trajectories that would lead them to their final synaptic targets. Although many guidance cues and their receptors have been identified, the intracellular signaling cascades that control and direct axonal growth remained to be fully understood. Developing axons constantly reassess the immediate environment to distinguish between a myriad of guidance molecules that are simultaneously present along their trajectory. Exactly how the axon interpret these signals at a specific time and space are limited, thus understanding how guidance cues work in concert during axonal pathfinding is a major goal in developmental neurobiology and in the regeneration of axonal connections after injury and disease. In this dissertation we studied the pathfinding of spinal cord commissural axons to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in axonal responses from attraction to repulsion during floor plate crossing at the spinal cord ventral midline. Here, we found that chemorepellent signals emanating from floor plate cells of the Slit and class 3 Semaphorin family of proteins synergize in vitro to repel precrossing commissural axons possibly through Neuropilin2 pathways. In addition, we propose that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) plays a pivotal role in mediating commissural axon repulsive guidance during floor plate crossing. We provide evidence that Shh is a regulator of class 3 Semaphorin signals in precrossing axons and specifically show that knockdown of Shh pathway components, Patched1 (PTC1) and Smoothened (Smo) disrupted proper guidance of commissural axons during floor plate crossing. We also show that both Smo and PTC1 are expressed around the developmental stages we studied and are key determinants of this regulation. The third major finding of this dissertation is that the activation of Semaphorin3 signals by Shh might be induced through the alteration of cAMP/PKA levels via Smo dependent activation of inhibitory G alpha proteins. Together the data presented in this dissertation propose new exciting models in which axon guidance regulatory pathways can induce profound changes in axonal navigational responses by successfully integrating and interpreting signaling inputs from external and internal axon guidance systems

Linear acoustic sensitivity kernels and their applications in shallow water environments
Time of arrival information from acoustic transmissions is the primary means through which ocean sound-speed structure is estimated. While initially limited to large scale coarse observations using ray theory to model the propagation of sound through the environment, ocean acoustic tomography evolved to incorporate a normal-mode representation of observed peak-arrivals. This wave- theoretic approach was enhanced, using the first Born approximation to perturbations in the wave equation, producing the travel-time sensitivity kernel (TSK): a linear relationship between sound-speed variations and observed changes in arrival times. This dissertation extends sensitivity kernel analysis to both the amplitude and phase of complex-demodulated broadband acoustic transmissions, producing both a qualitative and quantitative picture of how ocean sound-speed variability affects acoustic observations, and complementing prior work on travel-time sensitivity. The linearity and information content of these kernels is explored in simulation for a 3--4̃kHz broadband pulse transmission through a 1̃km shallow-water Pekeris waveguide, and in simulated inversions with a more realistic summer-type sound-speed profile, the results from which demonstrate the additional information amplitude contains over phase data alone. Differences in phase measurements were assumed to be directly relatable to travel-time changes, and thus the phase sensitivity kernel was expected to represent the same details as the travel-time sensitivity kernel. However, even a cursory visual inspection of the two kernel types shows that they have different spatial structures and hence different sensitivities to changes in the environment. A numerical survey was conducted comparing the performance of these sensitivity kernels (along with amplitude) to observations from perturbed simulations - including a synthetic time-evolving ocean - and the results suggest that phase and peak travel-time do indeed diverge in the presence of more complicated ocean sound-speed structure, with phase being the more linear observable. Additionally, the phase-derived sensitivity kernel is shown to be a better estimator of travel-time than the TSK, for which a possible explanation is suggested. The Born approximation has also been used to derive the acoustic sensitivity to perturbations at the boundary of an environment, in contrast to the volume perturbations discussed before. A sensitivity kernel for surface scattering is presented here, along with a numerical and experimental investigation of the acoustic response to surface displacements in an ultrasonic scale waveguide. The results are presented in both point-to- point and beam-to-beam formats, and suggest the potential use of sensitivity analysis in inverting for sea-surface structure

Synthesis and applications of quinazoline-based fluorescent nucleoside analogues
A family of quinazoline-based fluorescent nucleoside analogues is synthesized for photophysical studies and applications in probing nucleic acid structure, dynamics, and recognition. These size-expanded U analogues exhibit fluorescent emission wavelengths that span 155 nm, from 335 to 490 nm. Each nucleoside has unique characteristic response to changes in its microenvironment. These distinct features lead to a variety of applications in biological assays, many of which have been explored. The fluorescent nucleoside analogues are useful in Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments. The 5- methoxyquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione based nucleoside acts as the donor fluorophore to commercially available 7- diethylaminecoumarin. The FRET pair is used in a robust analysis and discovery platform for antibiotics targeting the bacterial ribosomal RNA A-site. The emissive U surrogate is incorporated into a model RNA construct of the A-site and the aminoglycosides are labeled with the 7- diethylaminecoumarin fluorescence acceptor. Titrating the coumarin labeled aminoglycosides into the emissive A-site construct shows a decrease in donor emission and concurrent increase of the acceptor emission. Titration curves faithfully generate EC50 values. Titration of unlabeled ligands into the pre-formed FRET complex yields valuable data regarding competitive displacement of aminoglycosides. Furthermore, an orthogonal FRET assembly reports antibiotic affinities to two different RNA targets. A binder was labeled with a fluorophore that acts both as an acceptor for the emissive nucleoside on the bacterial A-site and a donor fluorophore for the terminally-labeled human A-site. Unlabeled drugs were used to dissociate the labeled antibiotic. The nucleoside based on 5-aminoquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione makes a good FRET acceptor to tryptophan, one of the most infrequently occurring amino acids in proteins. The FRET pair facilitates the study of RNA-protein interactions, which is demonstrated in studying the binding of the Rev peptide to the RRE. Additionally, upon incorporation into a RNA oligonucleotide, 5-aminoquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione detects the presence of a RNA bulge by fluorescence enhancement and hypsochromic wavelength shift. In another single fluorophore experiment, the fluorescent U-analogue 7-aminoquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione detects mismatch G upon incorporation into a DNA oligonucleotide by displaying G-specific fluorescence enhancement

Dopamine D3 regulation of sensorimotor gating
The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target for several neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, schizophrenia is currently treated with medications that nonspecifically target D3 as well as D2 receptors. However, due to the homology between these receptor subtypes, the tools available for specifically studying the D3 system in vivo are limited. While intracellular signaling pathways of D3 receptors have been described using cell lines in vitro, the applicability of these models to intact neural systems and behavior remain unclear. This dissertation utilizes behavioral, pharmacological, genetic, and cellular/molecular techniques in mice, rats, and humans to examine the role of D3 receptors in regulating sensorimotor gating. Sensorimotor gating is the inhibition of a motor response by a sensory event and can be operationally measured with prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. PPI - the reduction in response to a startling stimulus when it is preceded by a weak prestimulus - is diminished in patients with schizophrenia and these deficits may be related to dopaminergic dysfunction. In animal models, PPI is disrupted acutely by dopaminergic agonists, and blockade of this effect predicts clinical efficacy of antipsychotics. After determining that the D3-preferential agonist pramipexole offers advantages for studying the PPI -disruptive effects of D3 stimulation, studies in this thesis described the stereochemical, anatomical and receptor-specific effects of this drug on PPI, and dissociated these effects from those on other behaviors. Using conditions that simulated D3R-mediated PPI deficits, brain regions relevant to PPI circuitry were analyzed for corresponding intracellular signaling changes. Specific signaling elements were altered by both D3 and D2 stimulation, but Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens appeared to be differentially suppressed by pramipexole and not the selective D2 agonist, sumanirole, and consistent findings were detected using D2- and D3- preferential antagonists. Collectively, these studies establish a strategy for parsing the anatomical, neurochemical and molecular substrates underlying the regulation of sensorimotor gating by forebrain D2 vs. D3 receptors, and identify divergent mechanisms that might be important targets for future drug development

Multiple-omic data analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 reveals its transcriptional architecture and regulatory features
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The increasing number of infections caused by strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae that are resistant to multiple antibiotics has developed into a major medical problem worldwide. The development of next-generation sequencing technologies now permits rapid sequencing of many K. pneumoniae isolates, but sequence information alone does not provide important structural and operational information for its genome.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Here we take a systems biology approach to annotate the K. pneumoniae MGH 78578 genome at the structural and operational levels. Through the acquisition and simultaneous analysis of multiple sample-matched &#8211;omics data sets from two growth conditions, we detected 2677, 1227, and 1066 binding sites for RNA polymerase, RpoD, and RpoS, respectively, 3660 RNA polymerase-guided transcript segments, and 3585 transcription start sites throughout the genome. Moreover, analysis of the transcription start site data identified 83 probable leaderless mRNAs, while analysis of unannotated transcripts suggested the presence of 119 putative open reading frames, 15 small RNAs, and 185 antisense transcripts that are not currently annotated.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					These findings highlight the strengths of systems biology approaches to the refinement of sequence-based annotations, and to provide new insight into fundamental genome-level biology for this important human pathogen.

Alternative Approaches in Multi-label Neutral Zone Classification Problems
Various multi-label classification algorithms are broadly developed in the literature. Each of these existing methods has different strengths and drawbacks, and very few attempts have been performed to address the uncertainty. Recently, neutral zone classifiers have been presented to deal with ambiguous data to improve the accuracy of the estimated classification results by trading off the relatively high penalty of an incorrect classification with a lower penalty for remaining neutral about class membership. The existing neutral zone methods was developed to construct multiple single-label classifiers for multi-label data. In this work, we present different classification alternatives for multi-label data using a standard logistic regression model, a generalized linear mixed model and Markov random field to relax the current underlying assumptions. The proposed neutral zone classification methods are implemented and tested on simulation data sets and on the biological data set. Their results suggest that our proposed classification approaches are useful alternatives for practical application when working with multi-label data.

NeuroPedia : neuropeptide database and spectral library
Neuropeptides are essential for cell-cell communication in neurological and endocrine physiological processes in health and disease. While many neuropeptides have been identified in previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the main technology for high throughput neuropeptide identification. Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths (e.g., shorter/longer than common peptides) and lack of appropriate residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation. NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences (including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known NeuroPedia sequences improves the sensitivity of database search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral libraries also enables the utilization of spectral library search tools, and further improves the sensitivity of peptide identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra

[brain, action, behavior, goal]

Performance of intelligent systems governed by internally generated goals.
Intelligent behavior is characterized by flexible and creative pursuit of endogenously defined goals. It has emerged in humans through the stages of evolution that are man- ifested in the brains and behaviors of other vertebrates. Perception is a key concept by which to link brain dynamics to goal-directed behavior. This archetypal form of intentional behavior is an act of observation into time and space, by which informa- tion is sought to guide future action, and by which the perceiver modifies itself through learning from the sensory consequences of its own actions. Chaotic brain dynamics creates the goals, expresses them by means of behavioral actions, and defines the meaning of the requested information. These acts include the making of representations (e.g. numbers, words, graphs, sounds, gestures) for communication to other brains in validation and coordination of experience. The failure of artificial intelligence to achieve its stated aims can be attributed to taking too literally these man-made descriptive representations as the tokens ofbrain action, whereas in brains there is no information, only dynamic flows and operators.

Petroglyphs, Lighting, and Magnetism
The passage of a lightning discharge over the surface of a rock is shown to produce two roughly parallel loci of maximum anomalous magnetization, having opposite polarities, marking the edges of the discharge path. For an electron flow from sky to earth, the north-seeking end of a compass needle is attracted to the right-hand locus. Perpendicular to the path, the magnetization varies like that of the field induced in and around a long, straight cylindrical conductor by the flow of an electrical current. Magnetization due to lightning has been observed on the surfaces of rocks in the Providence Mountains of southern California. Petroglyphs on one of these rocks appear to be related to the magnetic anomalies. The present study suggests that a lodestone may have been used to detect and mark certain of these anomalies, rather than observing the actual lightning strikes or their physical traces on the surfaces of the rock.

ZOOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGE IN OPUNOHU AND COOK’S BAYS (MOOREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA) AND THE RESPONSE OF COPEPODS TO CHANGES IN SALINITY
As secondary producers, zooplankton species are crucial as a vehicle for energy transfer in marine ecosystems worldwide yet few studies have observed the zooplankton community in tropical island estuaries. This study aims to understand the distribution of the zooplankton community in two of the largest estuaries (Opunohu and Cook’s Bays) in the volcanic tropical island of Moorea, French Polynesia. The results show that a few taxonomic groups, especially copepod, dominate the zooplankton composition. Moreover, the zooplankton community and diversity is highly variable at each bay and between bays. In the laboratory, copepod salinity response was examined. Copepods were placed at different salinity treatments for 16 hrs and dead copepods were counted. The salinity experiments show greater mortality of copepods at the extreme ends of salinity concentration, 40ppt and 0 ppt, suggesting that salinity is a major component influencing the abundance in these systems. Monitoring fluctuations in the zooplankton abundances will help understand changes in the marine food web as the result of climate change.

Controlling Magnetism at the Nanoscale
In this thesis, we look at controlling the magnetic properties at the nano-scale in single crystal thin film through structural modifications and external static electric fields (i.e. magnetoelectric effects).  The first part of the thesis focuses on changing the magnetic properties in thin films through sample structure modifications.  The other half focuses on using static electric fields to tune the magnetic properties within magnetic thin films.  We show that the magnetic anisotropy can be changes through the application of static electric fields.  Most interestingly though, we find that the phase transition in magnetite can be tuned with electric fields leading to an enhanced magentoelectric effect.

Analysis of Biofilm Growth in the Presence of Osmotic Pressure and Temperature Effects
Transient mass transfer in a diffusion-reaction biofilm with a moving boundary was investigated analytically. The analysis incorporates both the diffusion processes into the biofilm as well as the reaction processes that lead to the expansion of the system. For first and second order reaction terms, the biofilm synthesis as a function of time was presented. The temporal development of the biomass was found to be in very good agreement with numerical results. The effects of osmotic pressure and temperature were also investigated and it was found that osmotic pressure plays a significant role in first order reactions but the temperature dependence is primarily found in the reaction kinetics and does not significantly influence osmotic pressure effects.

Boric Acid Causes ER Stress and Activates the eIF2alpha/ATF4 and ATF6 Branches of the Unfolded Protein Response in Prostate Cancer Cells and Using Toxicology in the Public Interest
Nutritional chemoprevention is a growing area in the field of toxicology.  What we do and do not eat has a major impact on the development of cancer.  However, it is difficult to show a causal relationship between a natural product and cancer prevention because mechanistic biochemical data are often missing and animals studies can be inconclusive.  Both determining and elucidating molecular mechanisms that modulate pathological endpoints are necessary components in the risk assessment process used to determine if chemicals that show chemoprevention properties in the laboratory are safe for public use.  The research presented in this dissertation focuses on chemoprevention through the consumption of a nutrient or the avoidance of toxic food additives.  Part I presents research that elucidated a molecular pathway activated by boric acid (BA), an essential plant nutrient, which may provide insight into the inhibition of cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells and reduced risk of prostate cancer.  Part II consists of molecular toxicology research in application to public interest and health.  It is a critical analysis of two commonly consumed FDA-approved food additives, rebaudioside A, an artificial sweetener, and artificial food dyes.  In Part I, it was shown that BA is not an isoform-specific antagonist to the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium (Ca2+) channel, but is a RyR antagonist that functions by interacting and competing with the receptor's only known endogenous agonist.  This results in altered Ca2+ signaling that induces ER stress and the eIF2alpha/ATF4 and ATF6 branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in DU-145 prostate cancer cells.  ER stress and the UPR are tightly associated with cell proliferation.  The specific pathway that we have unfolded in BA-treated DU-145 cells is correlated with cell survival and an inhibition of cell proliferation.  In Part II, we describe how in vivo and in vitro studies on rebaudioside A and food dyes demonstrated their toxicity.  The assessment of toxicology studies on food dyes showed they do present an increased health risk and this is important given their widespread use by the public.  The research presented here thus presents both the molecular mechanistic and public health sides of molecular toxicology.

[insb, nw, nanowire, no2]

Synthesis, Characterization and Applications of InSb Semiconductor Nanowires
Synthesis of InSb nanowires using a chemical vapor deposition technique, as a function of growth temperature and time, was investigated. High aspect ratio InSb nanowires, having a diameter of about 5-10nm, were grown at 400oC for 1 hr on InSb (111) substrate onto which 60nm Au particle was used as a metal catalyst. The synthesized InSb nanowires had zinc blend single crystal structure without any stacking faults, and they were covered with a thin (~1nm thick) amorphous layer. Electrical characterization of InSb nanowires was conducted utilizing a back-gated SNWFET. Device characterization demonstrated that NWs were n-type and exhibited a high   ION/IOFF ratio of 106 and device resistance of 250 k&#937;.   Furthermore, room temperature detection of NO2 down to one part-per-million (ppm) using single crystalline n-type InSb nanowires (NWs) chemiresistive gas sensor fabricated by the combination of chemical vapor deposition and dielectrophoresis alignment techniques is investigated. The sensor devices showed an increase in resistance upon exposures to successive increment of NO2 concentration up to 10 ppm. The reduction in conductance of n-type InSb NWs exposed in NO2 atmosphere is made possible due to the charge transfer from the InSb NW surface to the adsorbed electron acceptor NO2 molecules. The demonstrated results suggest InSb NW as a promising candidate in sensing applications being environmentally friendly over existing arsenic and/or phosphorous-based III-V NW sensors.

Analysis of Holliday junction-binding compounds
Holliday junctions (HJs) are critical intermediates in many recombination-dependent DNA repair pathways. Our lab has identified several hexameric peptides that target HJ intermediates formed in DNA recombination reactions. One of the most potent peptides, WRWYCR, is active as a homodimer and has shown bactericidal activity due in part to its ability to interfere with DNA repair proteins that act upon HJs. In order to increase the possibility of developing a therapeutic that targets DNA repair, we searched for small molecule inhibitors that were functional surrogates of the peptides. Initial screens of heterocyclic small molecule libraries resulted in the identification of several N-methyl aminocyclic thiourea inhibitors. Like the peptides, these inhibitors trapped HJs formed during recombination reactions in vitro, but were less potent than the peptides in biochemical assays and had little antibacterial activity. In this work we describe the development of functional analogs based on either WRWYCR or the thiourea inhibitors. Our focus was on symmetry in an effort to mimic the symmetry of a WRWYCR homodimer and its target, the HJ. A set of 36 pyrrolidine bis-cyclic guanidine inhibitors were synthesized, and purified candidates were found to bind protein-free HJs and to interfere with the processing of HJs by DNA repair enzymes, in vitro. In addition, they are potent inhibitors of Gram-negative and especially Gram-positive bacterial growth, in contrast to the previously identified thiourea inhibitors. We also developed a single-chain linear analog of WRWYCR that does not require homedimer formation for activity. That analog, WRWYRGGRYWRW, binds to protein-free HJs and inhibits their resolution in vitro, in addition to causing DNA damage in bacteria and inhibiting bacterial growth. Finally, we implemented a peptide labeling strategy and demonstrated the effective isotope enrichment of several peptides using 2D and 3D nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Together these inhibitors and the labeling strategy add to a "molecular toolbox" for studying the diverse set of reactions involving HJs. Additionally, these molecules are proof-of-principle of two classes of compounds each with novel activities which may in the future be developed into a new antibiotics that will expand the available choices for therapy against drug resistant bacteria

Comparative Psychophysics: Some Contextual Effects in Birds and Humans
Three different types of psychophysical context effects have been studied in comparative experiments with animals and humans. The main context variables investigated were: (1) range of the test series; (2) asymmetry of training to test stimuli (anchor effects); and (3) frequency distribution of the test stimuli. A two-stimulus, two response training procedure, followed by various generalization tests, was used. All subjects (19 chickens and 128 humans) were trained and tested with cubes of different sizes. The psychometric functions support the general assumption that perception in birds undergoes psychophysical context effects similar to that observed in humans. However, while all three variables affected the judgments of human subjects, the choices of chickens and human infants were not strongly affected by the frequency distribution of the test stimuli. These data suggest that two factors are responsible for the three contextual effects investigated: a basic perceptual factor invariant across species and age groups and a cognitive component.

Turbulence and internal waves in numerical models of the equatorial undercurrents system
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of simplified model problems is used to investigate the role of turbulence and internal waves in the Equatorial Undercurrents (EUC) system. Prior observational studies of the Pacific EUC have established a strong correlation between deep-cycle turbulence in the thermocline and internal waves. The object of the thesis is to understand and quantify the dynamical processes underlying turbulence and internal waves in the EUC. The investigation has three phases. In the first phase, an idealized problem of a weakly- stratified shear layer located above a thermocline is simulated to investigate internal waves excited by unstable shear. The evolution of the shear layer consists of coherent Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers and small-scale turbulence. Internal waves excited by the KH rollers are narrow-band and of stronger amplitude that of the broadband wave field generated by turbulence. Internal waves are shown to carry significant amount of momentum and energy away from the shear layer. In the second phase, the EUC is represented by a weakly stratified shear layer on top of a stable stratified jet. The objective is to investigate the interaction between the jet and the waves excited by the adjacent shear layer. Two simulations are performed: one with the jet located far from the shear layer (far jet) and the other with the shear layer on top of the jet (near jet). In the far jet, waves excited by the KH rollers are reflected and trapped in the region between the shear layer and jet and lead to little dissipation. In the near jet, more representative of the EUC configuration, waves with wavelength larger than that of the KH rollers are found in and below the jet. Pockets of hot fluid associated with horseshoe vortices that originate from the shear layer penetrate into the jet region, initiate turbulence and disrupt the internal wave field. In the third final phase of the thesis, a stratified jet situated below a well-mixed surface layer driven by a constant wind stress and a surface buoyancy flux is considered. Turbulence is generated in the surface layer and deepens into the jet upper-flank. Waves generated by the turbulent surface layer propagate downward across the jet. The momentum flux and energy flux carried by the waves are significantly weaker than the waves generated by the unstable shear in the problem studied during the first phase. Intermittent patches of intense dissipation inside the jet upper-flank are the result of ejections of fluid parcels

[peptide, tryptophan, membrane, interaction, prokaryotic, bilayer]

Spectroscopic studies of tryptophan and membrane- associated peptides
Protein folding and dynamics are largely governed by stabilizing noncovalent interactions such as hydrophobic packing, hydrogen-bonding, and aromatic interactions. In this work, we probe vibrational structures and electronic properties that reflect these important noncovalent interactions for the membrane-associating amino acid tryptophan. This investigation reports the absorption, fluorescence, and UV resonance Raman spectra of tryptophan model compounds and peptides in well-defined environments to identify spectral markers for environment polarity, hydrogen bonding in hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments, cation-pi interactions, and pi-pi interactions. Results from these foundational studies have been applied to investigate the folding and insertion of membrane-disrupting peptide toxins and antimicrobial peptides into synthetic lipid bilayers. An important goal of this work is to elucidate the molecular basis for selectivity : toxins damage eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes whereas antimicrobial peptides primarily disrupt prokaryotic membranes. Each peptide of study - melittin, cecropin A, and a melittin-cecropin hybrid (CM15) - contains one tryptophan residue which offers a facile spectroscopic handle of these systems. Investigation of the tryptophan microenvironment is further motivated by the fact that tryptophan is often crucial to the activity of membrane-disrupting peptides in nature, and is also important for anchoring and guiding membrane protein folding into the lipid bilayer. Here, we combine vibrational analyses of tryptophan and peptide backbone with investigation of relative potency by measuring membrane disruption of synthetic bilayers that mimic eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes. Our results suggest that deep insertion of tryptophan in both types of membranes is a hallmark of potent, non-selective disruption of bilayers by peptide toxins, such as melittin. This deep insertion is accompanied by formation of secondary structure. In contrast, the antimicrobial peptide cecropin A is not potent against eukaryotic mimics, and only folds in the presence of prokaryotic membranes. The tryptophan residue resides in the headgroup region of the bilayer in prokaryotic mimics. The hybrid CM15 is a moderate membrane disruptor with its tryptophan localized to the headgroup region, but remains largely unfolded in its disruptive form. These results demonstrate the possibility for peptides to associate with and disrupt membranes in an unfolded state, and suggest new models may be required to explain peptide-membrane interactions

Virtual invariants on Quot Schemes over Fano surfaces
Moduli theory, a subfield of algebraic geometry, focuses on computing geometric enumerative invariants. Building on earlier classical methods, algebraic geometers in the 20th century began approaching these questions using intersection theory, allowing many new and interesting examples. The primary focus of this paper is the computation of several (virtual) enumerative invariants on the Quot scheme of rank N-r quotients of On/s with Euler characteristic chi and first Chern class beta over a Fano surface S, for which we use the shorthand notation Quots. This project is a natural generalization of the work of Aaron Bertram, Alina Marian, Dragos Oprea, and others, who considered the analogous problem on a Quot scheme over a smooth projective curve C and obtained the well known Vafa-Intriligator formula. Our main computational technique will be virtual localization, a limiting procedure in intersection theory in which enumerative invariants are computed in terms of data from the fixed locus of a torus action. While such techniques would only yield results for toric surfaces such as P² and P¹ x P¹, we extend these results using cobordism classes to any surface S for which Quots admits a virtual fundamental class. In particular, our results hold over any Fano surface. The examples computed here outline a computational algorithm for further enumerative invariants on Quots

Thermal Transport in Graphene Multilayers and Nanoribbons
As the electronic industry aggressively moves towards nanometer designs thermal issues are becoming increasingly important for the high-end electronic chips. One of the approaches to mitigate the self-heating problems is the high-heat-flux hot-spot removal via incorporation into the chip designs of materials with the high thermal conductivity. Graphene is found to be one of the best known heat conductors, thus it can be used in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices as a heat spreader component. Graphene, the latest isolated allotrope of carbon made of individual atomic sheets bound in two dimensions, shows many remarkable properties. A non-contact method of measuring G peak position of the Raman spectrum as a function of both the temperature of the graphene sample and the power of the heat source was used to measure the thermal conductivity of graphene. The samples in the experiment had approximately rectangle geometry and the assumption about the plane heat wave was used for the data extraction. In this dissertation research we propose to develop a model and numerical procedure for the (i) accurate modeling-based data extraction for the thermal conductivity measurements; and (ii) simulate heat propagation in semiconductor device structures with graphene layers incorporated as heat spreaders. To achieve the goals of this dissertation research we simulated the heat transport in graphene using the finite element method (FEM) with the help of COMSOL software package, which solves numerically the partial differential equations. The modeling based data extraction was necessary to determine thermal conductivity of the graphene flakes of arbitrary shape. It also substantially improved the accuracy of the measurements. The simulation of heat propagation in device structures with graphene heat spreaders allows one to assess the feasibility of the graphene high-heat-flux thermal management. We focused on understanding how thermal transport is influenced by a surface geometry of the sample and geometries of the heat sources. The simulation results showed that the size, shape and heat source geometry impact heat propagation in different ways and have to be included in the experimental data extraction. The simulation procedure provided a necessary input for next experiments on heat conduction in graphene structures e.g., graphene multi-layers and graphene-heat sink structures and other device-level thermal management applications. It was found that the incorporation of graphene or few-layer graphene (FLG) layers with proper heat sinks can substantially lower the temperature of the localized hot spots. The developed model and obtained results are important for the design of graphene heat spreaders and interconnects and lead to a new method of heat removal from nanoelectronic and 3-D chips.

Multi-scale Characterization of Collagen-based Material and its Correlation to the Neuronal Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cell
The ultimate goal of regenerative medicine is to create functional engineered biomaterial to repair or replace the damaged tissues. My work firstly was to perform multi-scale characterization on the collagen hydrogels used as scaffolds. Different initial collagen concentrations and incubation temperatures were identified to affect the properties of collagen hydrogels, such as the microstructure obtained with second harmonic generation imaging (SHG), nanostructure imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and molecular structures detected with Raman spectroscopy. Comparing to the real tissues, the drawback of collagen hydrogels is the lack of mechanical strength. Cross-linking has been known to increase the mechanical strength. I then characterized the effect of different cross-linking reagents including glycation reagents, genipin and 1-Ethyl-3 (3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) on the collagen hydrogel. SHG imaging showed that glycation reagents and genipin modify the microstructure within collagen hydrogel but EDC has no effect on the microstructure. TEM images revealed that glycation reagents and genipin also remove the native-like striation pattern in nanostructure but EDC has no effect on it.  Raman spectroscopy showed that glycation reagents and EDC affect the molecular information of collagen hydrogels.  Lastly, two different types of stem cell, mouse embryonic stem cell (ES cell) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) were seeded to the collagen hydrogels and then examined the effect of different structure of collagen hydrogel on the neuronal differentiation of stem cells. The behaviors of G-Olig2 ES cell and a7wt iPS cell were compared during early differentiation with retinoic acid into a neural lineage employing separately the encapsulated or topographic 3D collagen hydrogel models. For the encapsulated model, the differentiation of ES cell and iPS cell were slower for the cells encapsulated within 4 g/l collagen hydrogels compared to the cells in 2 g/l hydrogels. The differentiation process of both cells types seeded on top of the 3D collagen hydrogels was affected by the structure modified by cross-linking. For example, the differentiation rate of ES cells was slower on the cross-linked hydrogels but the differentiation rate of iPS cells was faster on the cross-linked hydrogels.

Dynamic Models of Earthquake Rupture on Fault Stepovers and Dip-Slip Faults Using Various Friction Formulations
The functional form of the friction law employed in dynamic earthquake simulations is directly related to the energy partitioning of rupture and slip (e.g., Kanamori and Rivera, 2006).  Earthquake ruptures can propagate along geometrically complex faults by bending and jumping along fault segments (Wesnousky, 1988), however, this is dependent on how much energy is available to further rupture propagation and how much energy is needed.  For planar fault stepovers with homogeneous stress, rupture can jump segments or it can arrest at the edge of a segment.  Since friction laws, along with stress regimes, implicitly specify the energy budget, different laws can lead to different rupture dynamics.  Using realistic, laboratory-derived friction laws to simulate rupture is a constant ambition in seismology.  The rate-state friction formulation includes intuitive variables such as time, slip speed history, and normal stress history as well as exhibits reasonable properties such as stick-slip sliding, creep, and healing (Dieterich, 1978b, 1979; Linker and Dieterich, 1992).  Particularly, including the change in friction coefficient with normal stress history is imperative for earthquakes that produce large dynamic fluctuations in normal stress, including both stepovers and dip-slip faults that penetrate the free surface.In this study we use FaultMod to run dynamic earthquake simulations on fault stepovers using the various friction formulas listed above.  Firstly, we investigate effects of the functional form of the friction laws on jumping rupture at stepovers. The functional forms are associated with unique energy budgets that can determine how far rupture can jump within a given amount of time.  We find that making the energy budgets similar between the friction parameterizations makes the rupture processes more similar at the stepover region (e.g., similar maximum jump distances).   We also find that for larger jumps the rupture speeds increase to supershear speeds, even though the initial stress conditions would preclude such a result on a planar strike-slip fault (Andrews, 1976b).  Secondly, we add to the stepover simulations by introducing the Linker-Dieterich formulation, in which friction coefficient depends on normal stress.  It is well known that stepovers exhibit perturbations in normal stress along the offset region during rupture, with the sign being opposite for compressional and dilational stepovers.  Adding the normal-stress-dependent state variable to the friction formulation decreases the maximum rupture jump for both types of stepover, however.  Additionally, we apply the Linker-Dieterich formulation to normal and reverse dip-slip faults, both of which are known to exhibit dynamic fluctuations in normal stress due to the free surface (Brune, 1996; Nielsen, 1998; Oglesby et al., 1998).  Differences in shear stress direction between normal and reverse faults produce asymmetric normal stress perturbations along the fault during rupture, causing the motion from a reverse fault to be larger than that of an otherwise equivalent normal fault.  Adding a normal-stress-dependent state variable serves to mitigate this effect.  We also find that decreasing the initial shear stress inhibits rupture more on normal faults than on reverse faults, given that the faults intersect the free surface.

RNA-Interference Mediated Antiviral Immunity  in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster
Infection of RNA viruses induces RNA interference (RNAi) - directed antiviral immunity in plants and invertebrates. However, it is not known if the RNAi machinery in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has an antiviral function. Replication of Flock House Virus (FHV) genomic RNA1 and its mutant deficient in the expression of the viral suppressor of RNAi (VSR) was examined in both wild type and RNA-defective mutant <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains. The results indicated that the primitive RNAi pathway in <italic>S. pombe</italic> was incompetent to inhibit viral RNA replication. Deep sequencing of small RNAs also did not detect production of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) following FHV replication in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Since most of the previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> used cell culture and embryos, little is known about the population structure, biogenesis pathway and relative potency of virus-derived siRNAs in adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Deep sequencing of small RNAs from wild type and RNAi-defective <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants challenged by a VSR-deficient FHV mutant showed that virus-derived siRNAs were produced by the type III ribonuclease Dicer-2, were predominantly 21 nucleotides in length with an approximately equal ratio of positive and negative strands, and sufficiently potent to terminate virus infection in adult flies. Importantly, two dsRNA-binding proteins, Loquacious and R2D2, which act sequentially in the biogenesis and loading of siRNAs in the canonical RNAi pathway, appeared to function redundantly in antiviral RNAi, whereas loss of Argonaute-2 resulted in a strong bias for positive-strand viral siRNAs. Further genetic studies revealed a prominent antiviral role for the PIWI gene, which encodes an Argonaute protein required for silencing transposons and repeat elements in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline. Notably, enhanced accumulation of FHV proteins in the epithelial sheath and follicle cells surrounding the developing egg chambers in the ovaries was illustrated in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant heterozygous for PIWI. Consistently, presence of the <italic>piwi</italic> mutant allele resulted in significantly enhanced levels of FHV and Drosophila C virus in the progenies of virus-infected adult flies. Thus, Piwi may be essential for virus clearance in the developing oocytes, and hence prevent vertical transmission of certain RNA viruses in fruit flies.

The mucosal/epithelial barrier disruption and transport of pancreatic digestive enzymes in early stages of intestinal ischemia
Following reduced blood flow or trauma (e.g. in a car accident, explosion, burn, major surgery) a cascade of reactions leads to Shock and subsequently multi-organ failure (MOF) even if the organs were not affected by the initial trauma. Identifying the root cause of shock is of extraordinary importance and one of the greatest challenges for Bioengineering analysis. Shock is associated with one of the highest levels of mortality and no effective medical treatment exists. We have obtained evidence that pancreatic digestive enzymes are key players and we hypothesize that the intestinal mucosal/epithelial layer provides a physical barrier that prevents the entry of digestive enzymes, normally contained within the lumen of the intestine, and during ischemic states this layer becomes disrupted allowing access of these enzymes into the intestinal wall. The rationale for the proposed study is to provide an enhanced understanding of fundamental mechanisms in the degradation of the mucosal epithelial barrier and subsequent transport of digestive enzymes. In this study I propose to investigate during early stages of intestinal ischemia the transport and activity of digestive enzymes across the epithelial wall and determine changes in the mucosal epithelial barrier. I will investigate mechanisms leading to the disruption of the mucosal barrier using a rat model of splanchnic ischemia as well as non-ischemic models designed to understand whether events characteristic of ischemia, such hypoxia, ATP depletion or drop in pH, are responsible for the disruption of the mucosal/epithelial barrier. Furthermore, I will investigate alterations in intestinal permeability in order to understand the mechanism by which digestive enzymes or any other cytotoxic mediators are transported into the systemic circulation. The results of these studies will determine the role of the mucosal epithelial barrier in the transport of digestive enzymes into the intestinal wall and it will provide insight into the development of new treatments for shock

Electromagnetic exploration of the Exmouth and Vøring rifted margins
In this work, we present improvements to and the use of two marine electromagnetic exploration methods at the Exmouth and Vøring Plateaus. First we discuss the marine controlled-source electromagnetic method (CSEM), specifically the formation and characteristics of custom binary and ternary waveforms as well as improvements to time-series processing which allow derivation of noise estimates. We then apply these improvements to the study of the Scarborough gas reservoir beneath the Exmouth Plateau off the northwest shelf of Australia, over which we collected the world's largest academic CSEM dataset. Using these data we (1) discuss methods for determining uncertainties in CSEM, (2) investigate the resolution of CSEM in an environment where multiple resistive geologic layers lie in close repose, (3) develop the prejudiced minimum norm as a regularization method in 1D CSEM inversion, discussing its strengths and limitations, and (4) develop the 1D/2D and 1D/3D inversion methods in which the forward model is 1D but the regularization is 2D or 3D. All of the new inversion methods derive more realistic results than 1D smooth inversion alone and may form a good starting point for higher dimensional inversion. Finally we target the deep structure of the Exmouth Plateau with marine magnetotellurics and compare the results to the Vøring Plateau off the northwest shelf of Norway. Magnetotelluric data reveal that both plateaus host a body of unexpectedly low resistivity (̲< 0.1 Ohmm) at ̃10 km depth. We show that the depth of each body is consistent with known sills and theorize that the low resistivity is due to magnetite cumulates precipitated as layers in mafic -ultramafic sills. Both plateaus exhibit the features of volcanic passive margins in which the final continental rifting event was relatively quick and accompanied by voluminous volcanism. Our data are consistent with this explanation and suggest that a large volume of mafic material was injected into the crust forming a relatively interconnected network of conductive minerals

Proteomic biomarkers predicting lymph node involvement in serum of cervical cancer patients. Limitations of SELDI-TOF MS
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Lymph node status is not part of the staging system for cervical cancer, but provides important information for prognosis and treatment. We investigated whether lymph node status can be predicted with proteomic profiling.
				
				
					
						Material &amp; methods
					Serum samples of 60 cervical cancer patients (FIGO I/II) were obtained before primary treatment. Samples were run through a HPLC depletion column, eliminating the 14 most abundant proteins ubiquitously present in serum. Unbound fractions were concentrated with spin filters. Fractions were spotted onto CM10 and IMAC30 surfaces and analyzed with surface-enhanced laser desorption time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Unsupervised peak detection and peak clustering was performed using MASDA software. Leave-one-out (LOO) validation for weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM) was used for prediction of lymph node involvement. Other outcomes were histological type, lymphvascular space involvement (LVSI) and recurrent disease.
				
				
					
						Results
					LSSVM models were able to determine LN status with a LOO area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.95, based on peaks with m/z values 2,698.9, 3,953.2, and 15,254.8. Furthermore, we were able to predict LVSI (AUC 0.81), to predict recurrence (AUC 0.92), and to differentiate between squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas (AUC 0.88), between squamous and adenosquamous carcinomas (AUC 0.85), and between adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas (AUC 0.94).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Potential markers related with lymph node involvement were detected, and protein/peptide profiling support differentiation between various subtypes of cervical cancer. However, identification of the potential biomarkers was hampered by the technical limitations of SELDI-TOF MS.

Multi-Scale Optical Metrology of Biomaterials and Nanomaterials for Medical and Industrial Applications
Nanotechnology is a promising field that is focused on working at the atomic and nanoscale. Many helpful materials and imaging techniques have been developed in nanotechnology. Graphene, a nanomaterial consisting of a single atomic layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exhibits excellent optical, electrical, and thermal properties and has many applications in the semiconductor, energy, and thermal management industries. Additionally, iron oxide nanoparticles are excellent candidates for drug delivery and labeling applications in medicine due to their high biocompatibility and customizable size and surface chemistry. Near-field microscopy is a nanoscale imaging technique with the capability of providing the label-free tissue diagnostics medical field with information about the intrinsic optical properties of tissue that cannot be probed by any other techniques. Despite the benefits that near-field microscopy offers for medicine, its use in imaging biomaterials has been limited due to the large topographic variations that these samples exhibit. This gap between the nanoscale and the scales of interest for industry and medicine also presents an obstacle in the application of iron oxide nanoparticles in medicine and graphene in industry. In this work, I develop multi-scale optical metrology techniques for characterizing graphene at the industrial scale, identifying unlabeled nanoparticles within cultured human cells, and studying the intrinsic optical properties of tissue with near-field microscopy. Through fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM), I map the layer thickness and uniformity of entire centimeter-scale graphene sheets and identify fluorine-doped regions. I utilize scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) to identify iron oxide nanoparticles in cultured human cells through their scattering behavior, and I develop SNOM for label-free tissue diagnostics, quantifying image creation in SNOM of large biological samples and then revealing the cause of scattering dependence on the hydration state of fixed human breast tissue. This work contributes knowledge to the graphene growth, nanoparticle design, and label-free tissue diagnostics fields and facilitates the integration of nanotechnology with medicine and industry.

Brain transcriptome variation among behaviorally distinct strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio)
AbstractBackgroundDomesticated animal populations often show profound reductions in predator avoidance and fear-related behavior compared to wild populations. These reductions are remarkably consistent and have been observed in a diverse array of taxa including fish, birds, and mammals. Experiments conducted in common environments indicate that these behavioral differences have a genetic basis. In this study, we quantified differences in fear-related behavior between wild and domesticated zebrafish strains and used microarray analysis to identify genes that may be associated with this variation.ResultsCompared to wild zebrafish, domesticated zebrafish spent more time near the water surface and were more likely to occupy the front of the aquarium nearest a human observer. Microarray analysis of the brain transcriptome identified high levels of population variation in gene expression, with 1,749 genes significantly differentially expressed among populations. Genes that varied among populations belonged to functional categories that included DNA repair, DNA photolyase activity, response to light stimulus, neuron development and axon guidance, cell death, iron-binding, chromatin reorganization, and homeobox genes. Comparatively fewer genes (112) differed between domesticated and wild strains with notable genes including gpr177 (wntless), selenoprotein P1a, synaptophysin and synaptoporin, and acyl-CoA binding domain containing proteins (acbd3 and acbd4).ConclusionsMicroarray analysis identified a large number of genes that differed among zebrafish populations and may underlie behavioral domestication. Comparisons with similar microarray studies of domestication in rainbow trout and canids identified sixteen evolutionarily or functionally related genes that may represent components of shared molecular mechanisms underlying convergent behavioral evolution during vertebrate domestication. However, this conclusion must be tempered by limitations associated with comparisons among microarray studies and the low level of population-level replication inherent to these studies.

Bio-crude transcriptomics: Gene discovery and metabolic network reconstruction for the biosynthesis of the terpenome of the hydrocarbon oil-producing green alga, Botryococcus braunii race B (Showa)*
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Microalgae hold promise for yielding a biofuel feedstock that is sustainable, carbon-neutral, distributed, and only minimally disruptive for the production of food and feed by traditional agriculture. Amongst oleaginous eukaryotic algae, the B race of Botryococcus braunii is unique in that it produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons of terpenoid origin. These are comparable to fossil crude oil, and are sequestered outside the cells in a communal extracellular polymeric matrix material. Biosynthetic engineering of terpenoid bio-crude production requires identification of genes and reconstruction of metabolic pathways responsible for production of both hydrocarbons and other metabolites of the alga that compete for photosynthetic carbon and energy.
				
				
					
						Results
					A de novo assembly of 1,334,609 next-generation pyrosequencing reads form the Showa strain of the B race of B. braunii yielded a transcriptomic database of 46,422 contigs with an average length of 756 bp. Contigs were annotated with pathway, ontology, and protein domain identifiers. Manual curation allowed the reconstruction of pathways that produce terpenoid liquid hydrocarbons from primary metabolites, and pathways that divert photosynthetic carbon into tetraterpenoid carotenoids, diterpenoids, and the prenyl chains of meroterpenoid quinones and chlorophyll. Inventories of machine-assembled contigs are also presented for reconstructed pathways for the biosynthesis of competing storage compounds including triacylglycerol and starch. Regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, and the extracellular localization of the hydrocarbon oils by active transport and possibly autophagy are also investigated.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The construction of an annotated transcriptomic database, publicly available in a web-based data depository and annotation tool, provides a foundation for metabolic pathway and network reconstruction, and facilitates further omics studies in the absence of a genome sequence for the Showa strain of B. braunii, race B. Further, the transcriptome database empowers future biosynthetic engineering approaches for strain improvement and the transfer of desirable traits to heterologous hosts.

The design, synthesis, and evaluation of compounds that bind to Alzheimer's-related and HIV-1-related amyloids
Amyloids--misfolded, aggregated peptides--have been implicated in over thirty human diseases. This thesis focused on the study of two different amyloids--Abeta(1- 42) and SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of virus infection)-- associated with two distinct conditions--Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), respectively. Abeta aggregates are a hallmark of AD and may play a central, causative role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Abeta-amyloid-targeting small molecules have, therefore, attracted wide interest as potential agents for the treatment or diagnosis of AD. This thesis describes the development of a general method to evaluate small molecule-Abeta-amyloid binding interactions via a modified quantitative ELISA protocol. The implementation of an in vitro model to evaluate the blood-brain barrier permeability of beta-amyloid- targeting compounds is also discussed in this thesis. The design and evaluation of a new class of fluorescent probes that bind to Abeta aggregates is described in this thesis. The advantage of these compounds is that their spectroscopic properties can be altered and fine-tuned via simple synthetic methods. The second portion of this thesis discusses the study of small molecules that bind to SEVI, a naturally abundant amyloid found in semen. SEVI can potentially increase the infectivity of HIV-1 in cells by up to 400,000-fold. Although the mechanism of SEVI- mediated transmission of HIV-1 remains poorly understood, evidence suggests that SEVI binds to both HIV-1 virions and cell membranes, thereby facilitating viral infection. We hypothesized that BTA-EG₆, a derivative of the well- known amyloid-binding compound Thioflavin T, could coat SEVI fibrils, thereby inhibit HIV-1 interactions with SEVI fibrils, and thus, reduce SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV -1 infectivity. The results of these investigations are presented in this thesis. The final project described in this thesis is the design, synthesis, and evaluation of multivalent analogs of BTA-EG6. The goals of this project were 2-fold : 1) Create compounds that bind with high affinity to both Abeta fibrils and SEVI fibrils based on the multivalent design strategy and 2) evaluate whether oligomers of the BTA moiety exhibit improved ability over the BTA monomer to inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity. The results of this project are presented in this thesis

Naziism, Biological Determinism, Sociobiology, and Evolutionary Theroy:  Are They Necessairly Synonymous?
Richard Lerner's new book, Final Solutions: Biology, Prejudice, and Genocide, is a powerful and troubling treatise. It weaves together several topical strands into a direct, clear, and compelling argument. The chief strength of the book lies in its focus on a single aspect of Nazi ideology (biological determinism), the role played in the maintenance of that ideology by medical and biological scientists, and Lerner's warnings about those he views as the contemporary successors of these scientists. Unlike Lerner's other contributions to the scholarly literature, this book is less a psychological treatise than it is a polemical history of some behavioral sciences in the twentieth century, Lerner's argument is provocative, clearly reasoned, and demands consideration by social scientists, humanists, and those who would avoid both the repetition of the past and our ignorance of its costs and lessons.

Effects of materials on electrophysiology when interfaced with whole heart and cardiomyocytes
Myocardial infarction (MI) is occlusion of the heart coronary artery. The resulting breakdown of extracellular matrix and adverse remodeling of the myocardium lead to heart failure. Cell and material transplantation therapies have been investigated to help in regeneration and improve heart function. Some cell types like skeletal myoblasts show increased risk for arrhythmias compared to saline injections, but arrhythmia inducibility of materials has not been studied. To assess the safety of injectable materials, programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was used with a rat MI model. This involves burst and extra- stimulation of the heart with rapid pulses alone or preceded by pulses of lower frequency. We found similar arrhythmia inducibility in myocardial matrix, Polyethylene Glycol, and PBS injections. Arrhythmogenicity of materials being similar to that of PBS indicates that use of materials is safe. The materials were injected largely into the infarct region (already a conduction block), which may be a reason for the low occurrence of arrhythmias. Since materials can be injected with cells, a study of electrophysiological effects of the biomaterial on cardiomyocytes (CM) is necessary, and was done with optical mapping (OM) of monolayers. OM uses a voltage sensitive dye that, when the monolayer is stimulated, fluoresces and is recorded to measure action potential duration (APD) and conduction velocity (CV). This showed significantly lower CV and APD at 20% repolarization in cells cultured on myocardial matrix versus collagen. Reduced APD indicates increased maturity of the CM, while lower CV suggests reduced connexin gap junctions and current channels

Notch4 is required for tumor onset and perfusion
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Notch4 is a member of the Notch family of receptors that is primarily expressed in the vascular endothelial cells. Genetic deletion of Notch4 does not result in an overt phenotype in mice, thus the function of Notch4 remains poorly understood.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We examined the requirement for Notch4 in the development of breast cancer vasculature. Orthotopic transplantation of mouse mammary tumor cells wild type for Notch4 into Notch4 deficient hosts enabled us to delineate the contribution of host Notch4 independent of its function in the tumor cell compartment.
				
				
					
						Results
					Here, we show that Notch4 expression is required for tumor onset and early tumor perfusion in a mouse model of breast cancer. We found that Notch4 expression is upregulated in mouse and human mammary tumor vasculature. Moreover, host Notch4 deficiency delayed the onset of MMTV-PyMT tumors, wild type for Notch4, after transplantation. Vessel perfusion was decreased in tumors established in Notch4-deficient hosts. Unlike in inhibition of Notch1 or Dll4, vessel density and branching in tumors developed in Notch4-deficient mice were unchanged. However, final tumor size was similar between tumors grown in wild type and Notch4 null hosts.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Our results suggest a novel role for Notch4 in the establishment of tumor colonies and vessel perfusion of transplanted mammary tumors.

Measurement and Modeling of Solute Diffusion Coefficients in Unsaturated Soils
Solute diffusion in unsaturated soils refers to the transport of dissolved constituents in liquid phase from a higher to a lower concentration point. Several empirical and conceptual models were proposed to predict the solute diffusion coefficients in unsaturated soils, but they were not systematically tested and evaluated under the same conditions using soils of different textures. Our experimental data showed that there is no perfect model that can depict the behavior of solute diffusion coefficient in soil at ranging soil-water contents across soil textures. Therefore, we proposed a new model using matric potential as the variable. The new model combines the two-region linear relationship of the soil-water content versus logarithm tortuosity with the Campbell soil-water retention model. It has compatible predictive capability with previous empirical models while reduces the uncertainty of constants estimation. Also, the use of matric potential instead of soil-water content as the independent variable directly incorporates the soil pore structural properties, and consequently the diffusive pathway, in the solute diffusion coefficient prediction. Moreover, the new model is applicable to soils of different textures and degrees of aggregation. Although solute diffusion in soil has been widely examined under the influence of both soil-water content and matric potential, little information is available about the impact of soil-water content/matric potential hysteresis on solute diffusion. Our research shows that the unequal soil-water content at a given matric potential when a soil is subjected to drying or wetting process has substantial impact on solute diffusion. The measured solute diffusion coefficients of drying were greater than those of wetting in certain soil-water content range. When fitted the solute diffusion coefficients of drying and wetting limbs by proposed predictive models, the drying limb is better described by a power function of soil-water content with empirical constants estimated by particle-size distribution and bulk density; while the wetting limb is better described by a conceptual model which assumes the solute diffusive pathway is comprised of the serial arrangement of pore water and film water. This research concluded that the behavior of solute diffusion in unsaturated soils is essentially determined by the liquid phase distribution.

Probabilistic evolutionary models of cancer
Cancer is currently viewed as an evolutionary process. In an organ there is a population of cells that give birth, die and mutate according to population dynamics that are determined by the types of cells under consideration. If certain cell mutations are acquired then the cells can become cancerous. In this manuscript we consider two evolutionary models that may each be viewed as a model of cancer. The first model we consider is a Moran-type model. Individuals each have an integer valued fitness. Individuals with a higher fitness value are more likely to give birth and individuals with a lower fitness value are more likely to die. We fix the mutation rate and consider the limiting rate of adaptation as the population size tends to infinity. Similar models have been used to model cancers in liquids such as leukemia. The second model we consider is a hierarchical model which differentiates between stem cells and progenitor cells. It has been proposed as a model of colorectal cancer. We find the limiting distribution for the time it takes for a cell to acquire two mutations as the population size tends to infinity and the mutation rates tend to 0. There are several different results depending how the mutation rates tend to 0 as a function of the population size. The two mutations represent the loss of two tumor suppressor genes. We also determine whether or not the mutations occur on stem cells or progenitor cells

Timing the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila
Because Drosophila do not grow after initiation of metamorphosis, their final body size is determined by larval growth rate and duration of the larval growth phase. Drosophila metamorphosis is triggered by the steroid hormone ecdysone, which is produced in the prothoracic gland (PG). Ecdysone synthesis requires expression of the "Halloween" genes, which encode ecdysone biosynthetic enzymes. Growth rate is regulated by Insulin-like peptides, which are released from the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Genetic ablation of the IPCs decreases growth rate and delays onset of metamorphosis, suggesting that ecdysone synthesis is induced by insulin signaling. Inhibiting PI3 Kinase (PI3K), the major effector of insulin signaling, in the PG similarly delays metamorphosis as a consequence of decreased ecdysone synthesis and decreased Halloween gene expression. In contrast, activating PI3K in the PG advances the onset of metamorphosis and increases Halloween gene expression. Here I report that increased insulin signaling, accomplished inhibiting the protein kinase A pathway in the IPCs increases insulin signaling and increases growth rate but also advances the onset of metamorphosis by increasing expression of at least one Halloween gene. Ecdysone synthesis is promoted by a second peptide hormone, PTTH, which activates Halloween gene expression via the Torso receptor followed by Ras and Raf in the PG. Null mutations in the transcription factor broad (br ) prevent torso transcription and thus prevent Halloween gene expression and metamorphosis. Here I identify Br as the mechanistic link between PI3K activity and Halloween gene expression. I found that PI3K activity is required for br expression by inhibiting the downstream kinase GSK-3. I provide evidence that three nuclear hormone receptors, βFTZ-F1, HR3 and E75, link GSK-3 activity with br expression: RNAi-mediated βFTZ-F1 or HR3 knockdown, or E75A overexpression, in the PG prevents br expression. I also found that ectopic Torso pathway activation, accomplished by expressing the constitutively active Rafgof , restores Halloween gene transcription to larvae lacking br or βFTZ-F1 , suggesting that these larvae fail to express Halloween genes because they fail to transcribe torso . These studies identify a potential molecular mechanism linking growth rate with competence to respond to the PITH metamorphic signal and thus initiate metamorphosis.

Insights in two plasmid families from the SIO Pier metagenome
From coastal California seawater, a complex and diverse environment, the marine cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus were enriched by flow cytometry-based sorting and the population metagenome was analyzed with 454 sequencing technology. Interestingly, at least three distinct mobile DNA elements not found in model Synechococcus strain genomes were detected in the assembled contigs. These contigs were confirmed to be plasmids. p27638e, p31635e, and p31454e, were sequenced and described. p27638e, p31635e, and p314543e are 1425, 1558, and 1479 kb in length, respectively. Further analysis of natural samples has shed light on their diversity over time. A recombinant plasmid, pTOPO27638 was constructed for sequencing and development of a shuttle vector capable of transforming both Escherichia coli and Synechococcus CC9311. Sixteen presumptive ORFs were identified which may code small peptides. The deduced amino acid sequence of the largest ORFs were significantly similar to that of a putative plasmid replication, repA. Comparison of the replication proteins from p27638e, p31635e and p31454e to other plasmid replication proteins show that it may replicate via rolling circle replication. p27638e and p31635e were found to be positively correlated with marine Synechococcus over time in the environment

Restoration of Experience-Dependent Plasticity through Enhancement of Glutamatergic Neurotransmission after Developmental Traumatic Brain Injury
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children can cause persistent cognitive and behavioral dysfunction and inevitably raises concerns about lost potential or the inability to return to "normalcy" in these injured youths.   After a diffuse model of traumatic brain injury, lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI), there is evidence of pathological activation of major ionotropic glutamate receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-proprionate receptors (AMPAR), and an NMDAR-mediated downstream effector (calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II - CAMKII) in the hippocampus.  These injury-induced molecular alterations have been shown to last longer in the developing brain compared to the mature brain.  Moreover, these molecules are crucial mediators of experience-dependent plasticity and normal cerebral development, which prime the synaptic milieu for pro-plasticity circuitry formation.  FPI administered to weanling rats has further been shown to impair enriched environment (EE)-induced experience-dependent plasticity that persists into adulthood.  Glutamate neurotransmission is essential in normal physiology, maturation and plasticity, and is greatly perturbed by TBI.  While spontaneous recovery still occurs, the young injured brain is less receptive to the benefits of behavioral experience.  Injured subjects may still recover to pre-injury baseline, depending on the severity of injury; however, they could demonstrate altered development and never perform at the same level as their non-injured peers.  This is translated into lost potential.  Clinically, however, glutamate blockade as a therapeutic intervention has failed to show neuroprotection or promote functional recovery clinically.  Recently there is a shift in focus to agents that target the glutamatergic system positively.  NMDAR agonists have facilitated recovery of learning and memory after experimental TBI in the mature brain.  Particularly, when treated with NMDA or D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDAR glycine-binding site, brain injured animals have shown rapid functional recovery.  The central hypothesis of this dissertation is that the administration of an NMDAR agonist (DCS) during the post-injury period of diminished glutamatergic neurotransmission would do the following two things: 1) restore hippocampal glutamate-mediated markers of plasticity in the post-subacute time point (one week post-injury); and 2) reinstate hippocampal-dependent, EE-induced experience-dependent plasticity.  This translates into the restoration of lost plasticity after developmental FPI.Twenty-four to seventy-two hours post-injury, DCS was administered intra-peritoneally, once every 12 hours, to postnatal day 19 rats that received either sham or FPI.  In Chapter 1, the effects of DCS treatment on glutamate-mediated pro-plasticity molecules (NMDAR, AMPAR, and CAMKII) were investigated on post-injury day four (PID4) using western blotting.  At the same time point, the effects of DCS were assessed using novel object recognition (NOR), a hippocampally-mediated, NMDAR-dependent working memory task.  Not only was NOR used as a functional assay of NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission in the subacute PID4 time point, but also as measure of capacity for EE-induced plasticity.  The ability to distinguish novelty would be essential in benefiting from the EE experience.  In Chapter 2, following either an FPI or a sham procedure, postnatal day 19 rat pups were differentially housed in standard cages or an EE for 17 days.  The extent of EE-induced experience-dependent plasticity was measured by testing the animals' performance in a spatial learning paradigm (Morris water maze) thirty days after injury when they have matured.  How early DCS treatment after developmental FPI influences experience-dependent plasticity was investigated.  From the results of Chapter 1 and 2, enhancing NMDAR function during the period of reduced glutamatergic transmission following traumatic brain injury in young rats can reinstate molecular and behavioral responses.  This subsequently manifests as rescued potential and experience-dependent plasticity later with long-lasting beneficial consequences.  Furthermore, glutamatergic neural activity can now be indirectly quantified by mapping the coupled change in relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI).  The noninvasive and translatable potential of this measure allows for a powerful within subject experimental design.  In Chapter 3, a stimulation dose of an NMDAR agonist (DCS) was used to induce increases of rCBV specific to the hippocampus in intact developing rats.  This evoked change in the NMDAR-mediated rCBV was explored as a physiological biomarker for FPI.  Clinical translational potential for this type of noninvasive diagnostic measure include the ability to assess the extent of diminished NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic activity and the efficacy of a glutamate-mediated treatment after TBI.  Using converging operations, this dissertation demonstrates that NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic dysfunction is an underlying mechanism of long-lasting impaired plasticity after developmental FPI.  NMDAR agonist treatment after FPI during a critical period of development can reinstate the pro-plasticity milieu, which is crucial for acquiring beneficial experience-dependent plasticity.

Understanding Anti-Viral Immunity Mechanisms in C. elegans
C. elegans, a free-living nematode, forms an excellent model system to study severalaspects of biology including host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we looked atfactors involved in anti-viral immunity mechanisms in C. elegans with a prospect of being able to extrapolate into other systems. A reporter worm strain was used(MS1395), in which GFP expression directly indicates the extent of viral replication in the system. A feeding RNAi screen was performed to identify genes in anti-viral immunity and a total of 11,700 C. elegans genes were knocked down and screened for the presence/ absence of GFP. Of these genes, 2180 genes were screened by me. A total of 691 genes (6% of total number of genes) were found to be positive. The screen was repeated to eliminate false positives and 260 genes (2.2% of the total number of genes) were found to be positive.  Meanwhile, discovery of a naturally infecting C. elegans virus, Orsay, by Felix et al., helped us further our research. A subset of genes positive from the secondary screen was tested for susceptibility to Orsay infection. Chromosomal mutations for two of the genes identified by RNAi, him-14(it44) and nhr-68(gk708) showed increased susceptibility to Orsay infection. qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization and Northern blots showed higher levels of Orsay RNA1 molecules in these two mutants compared to the wild-type strain. We are currently in the process of understanding the roles played by these two genes in anti-viral immunity. him-14 gene encodes a protein that is required for promoting crossing over between homologous chromosomes and therefore is expressed in the germ-line. Evidence suggests that the increased susceptibility to Orsay infection in him-14(it44) mutants is germ-line dependent. Prior reports have linked the germline to longevity, suggesting that him-14 indirectly affects virus susceptibility by modifying some aspect of body physiology. nhr-68 belongs to nuclear hormone receptor family and are transcription factors typically regulated by lipophilic molecules like steroids, retinoids, bile and fatty acids. nhr-68 mutants also have increased fat content compared to wild-type animals. We hypothesize that the increase to Orsay susceptibility in these worms is due to increased lipid molecules in the body. Currently, the lab is trying to understand the mechanism of action of these two genes in anti-viral immunity. We believe this study will provide a better understanding of the nature of host- pathogen interaction and will open a wide area of interesting biology for further investigation.

Inflammatory cytokines induce human bronchial smooth muscle cell proliferation via an NCX-1 dependent mechanism
Airway smooth muscle hyperplasia is a characteristic of airway remodeling in asthma and this is thought to be, at least in part, cytokine mediated. Because cytosolic free calcium (Ca²⁺cyt) plays an important role in smooth muscle proliferation, we chose to examine the role of Ca²⁺cyt, focusing on the expression of the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger 1 (NCX1) protein and its link to human airway smooth muscle proliferation. In vitro studies were done to examine the function and expression of NCX1 protein in human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMC). Cells were grown in the presence/absence of the inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-13, and IL-33 and assessed for proliferation using a colorimetric assay. Proliferation was induced in the presence of inflammatory cytokines and blocked in the presence of SN-6, a selective NCX1 inhibitor. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative PCR revealed that inflammatory cytokines upregulate NCX1 protein and mRNA expression. In vivo studies were done in mice using an ovalbumin model of asthma. NCX1 expression in asthmatic mice airway was compared with control mice. Immunoblotting revealed a substantial increase in NCX1 protein expression in asthmatic mice. We have demonstrated that NCX1 is expressed in HBSMC and that this expression is increased by cytokines associated with asthma. Moreover, cells proliferate with these cytokines, which is blocked by NCX1 inhibition. NCX1 is also expressed and upregulated in asthmatic mice airway. These data suggest that NCX1 may play an important role in airway remodeling associated with asthma

Reductions and propositional proofs for total NP search problems
This dissertation studies TFNP, the class of total NP search problems, and TFNP², a relativized version of TFNP. Resolving the exact computational complexities of TFNP and its subclasses is closely tied to the P versus NP question, thus the main focus is on the relativized class TFNP². The subclasses of TFNP² which we study are "syntactic", meaning that their totality is guaranteed by some combinatorial lemma. A main result is that there is a strong connection between TFNP² and propositional proofs. We show that a Turing reduction from Q₁ to Q₂ gives rise to constant depth, polynomial size propositional (Frege) proofs between the underlying combinatorial lemmas. We show that a similar result holds for polylogarithmic degree Nullstellensatz refutations. These results were shown only for the many-one case in 9. These new translations provide new Turing separations by using existing upper and lower bounds from proof complexity. We also solve an open problem stated in 9 by showing that a reverse construction also holds. Namely, we prove that constant depth, polynomial size propositional proofs of the totality of one combinatorial lemma from another combinatorial lemma give rise to a Turing reduction between the corresponding TFNP² problems. Another point of investigation is the relation between many-one and Turing reducibility. We show that for many natural TFNP² classes many-one and Turing reducibility are equivalent. To show that this result does not hold in general, we construct a TFNP² problem whose Turing closure is strictly larger than its many-one closure. To generalize these results, we introduce a new type of reducibility called k-reducibility, and show that k- and (k + 1)-reducibility are not equivalent. This last result makes use of modular counting principles. These have been previously studied as propositional formulas, but we introduce them as TFNP² problems called MODd. We prove results about the relative complexity of the MODd's between themselves and other interesting TFNP² classes. By constructing equivalences between the propositional translation of MODd and the modular counting principles of 3, we can use the provability results in 3 to prove separations

Career perspective: John B West
Abstract
				I have been fortunate to work in two areas of extreme physiology and medicine: very high altitude and the microgravity of spaceflight. My introduction to high altitude medicine was as a member of Sir Edmund Hillary's Silver Hut Expedition in 1960&#8211;1961 when a small group of physiologists spent the winter and spring at an altitude of 5,800 m just south of Mt. Everest. The physiological objective was to obtain a better understanding of the acclimatization process of lowlanders during exposure to a very high altitude for several months. As far as we knew, no one had ever spent so long at such a high altitude before. The success of this expedition prompted me to organize the 1981 American Medical Research Expedition to Everest where the scientific objective was to determine the physiological changes that allow humans to survive in the extreme hypoxia of the highest point on earth. There is good evidence that this altitude is very near the limit of human tolerance to oxygen deprivation. Much novel information was obtained including an extraordinary degree of hyperventilation which reduced the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2) to about 8 mmHg (1.1 kPa) on the summit, and this in turn allowed the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, to be maintained at a viable level of about 35 mmHg (4.7 kPa). The low Pco2 caused a severe degree of respiratory alkalosis with an arterial pH exceeding 7.7. These were the first physiological measurements to be made on the Everest summit, and essentially, none has been made since. The second extreme environment is microgravity. We carried out an extensive series of measurements on astronauts in the orbiting laboratory known as SpaceLab in the 1990s. Many aspects of pulmonary function are affected by gravity, so it was not surprising that many changes were found. However, overall gas exchange remained efficient. Some of the findings such as an anomalous behavior of inhaled helium and sulfur hexafluoride have still not been explained. Measurements made after astronauts were exposed to 6 months of microgravity in the International Space Station indicate that the function of the lung returns to its preexposure state within a few days.

THE COMPOSITION OF BRYOPHYTE COMMUNITIES ON LIMESTONE VERSUS BASALT SUBSTRATES IN COASTAL AND MID-ELEVATION FORESTS OF MO'OREA, FRENCH POLYNESIA
Communities of non- vascular plants called bryophytes grow on limestone and basalt on Mo'orea, French Polynesia. The abiotic properties associated with living on each substrate is not well known, however. This study looks at the soil pH, buffering capacity, phosphate levels and substrate water holding ability associated with each substrate. In general, limestone has greater water holding capacity than basalt and its soils are more basic, have higher phosphate levels and have a greater pH buffering capacity than soils on basalt. This study also looks at the biological impact of these substrate abiotic differences by using multivariate discriminate analysis to compare bryophyte communities on each substrate. Five species are tightly correlated with a particular substrate. Ectropothecium sandwichense and Floribundaria aerunginosa prefer limestone whereas  Calymperes aongstroemii, Taxithelium vernieri, and Ectropothecium sodale, prefer basalt. Because the distribution of these species is highly correlated with substrate in nature, a reciprocal transplant experiment was designed to see if substrate directly affected a specie's growth. Ectropothecium sodale and Ectropothecium sandwichense can, physiologically, grow on either substrate. This suggests that other factors like elevation, predation and community effects might be contributing to the segregated bryophyte communities observed in nature. Understanding the abiotic and potential biotic factors that influence the distributions of bryophytes enables locals, scientists and developers to use these plants as bioindicators of habitat change.

Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor protein expression in cells treated with alcohol and cytokines; a study on alcoholism
Alcoholism is a complex disease that impacts the cnS through tolerance, dependence, brain damage and neurological and cognitive deficits. chronic exposure to ethanol brings neurodegeneration and an increase in the level of an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, PBr for short. In this study, western blotting and immunocytochemical methods were used to detect the effects of ethanol and cytokine treatments on astrocytes, astrocytomas, and microglia. Although ethanol seemed to have led to a decrease in PBr in the astrocytes and microglia, it did produce an increase in astrocytomas. Additionally, LPS and cytokine mix seemed to have at least physically altered the appearance of these ethanol-exposed cells.

High Spatial Resolution BRDFs with Metallic powders Using Wave Optics Analysis
This manuscript completes the analysis of our SIGGRAPH 2013 paper "Fabricating BRDFs at High Spatial Resolution Using Wave Optics" in which photolithography fabrication was used for manipulating reflectance effects. While photolithography allows for precise reflectance control, it is costly to fabricate. Here we explore an inexpensive alternative to micro-fabrication, in the form of metallic powders. Such powders are readily available at a variety of particle sizes and morphologies. Using an analysis similar to the micro-fabrication paper, we provide guidelines for the relation between the particles' shape and size and the reflectance functions they can produce.

Influenza A H3N2 subtype virus NS1 protein targets into the nucleus and binds primarily via its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS to nucleolin and fibrillarin
Abstract


Background
Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a virulence factor, which is targeted into the cell cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus. NS1 is a multi-functional protein that inhibits host cell pre-mRNA processing and counteracts host cell antiviral responses. Previously, we have shown that the NS1 protein of the H3N2 subtype influenza viruses possesses a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) that also functions as a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and targets the protein into the nucleolus.


Results
Here, we show that the NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus subtype interacts in vitro primarily via its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via its N-terminal NLS1 with the nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and fibrillarin. Using chimeric green fluorescence protein (GFP)-NS1 fusion constructs, we show that the nucleolar retention of the NS1 protein is determined by its C-terminal NLS2/NoLS in vivo. Confocal laser microscopy analysis shows that the NS1 protein colocalizes with nucleolin in nucleoplasm and nucleolus and with B23 and fibrillarin in the nucleolus of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus-infected A549 cells. Since some viral proteins contain NoLSs, it is likely that viruses have evolved specific nucleolar functions.


Conclusion
NS1 protein of the human H3N2 virus interacts primarily via the C-terminal NLS2/NoLS and to a minor extent via the N-terminal NLS1 with the main nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin.

Nanoparticle "theranostic" platforms for applications in cancer
The study and implementation of nanotechnology as applied to biology is making substantial progress toward the expansion of the dialogue between synthetic and biological systems. This dialogue leads to a deeper understanding of the origins, manifestations, and characteristics of biological phenomenon that ultimately will lead to improved methods of diagnosing and treating a variety of pathologies. Perhaps the most prevalent application of this new technology is in the field of cancer research, encompassing an array of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for in vivo utilization. These approaches include novel ways of enhancing tumor imaging for earlier detection or delivering toxic therapeutics directly to the site of action, sparing the systemic damage that so often accompanies cancer treatment. However, it is the combination of these essential and orthogonal functionalities that is the hallmark of the promise of nanotechnology. Such materials, coined as "theranostics" for their therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities, allow for a new depth of understanding of the behavior of nanoparticles in vivo, and in particular their efficacy as therapeutic treatments. This dissertation discusses the development of platforms and materials that may be employed as theranostic cancer agents from two distinct philosophical approaches--what may be called "traditional" and "non-traditional" nanotechnology. The "non- traditional" approach details the development of a novel DNA nanoparticle platform created through an exponential enrichment process for selected cell targeting. The products compose a novel class of nanoparticles that possess all of the naturally advantageous properties of DNA. The remainder of the dissertation presents a more "traditional" approach to hierarchical nanoparticle construction, discussing synthesis, stabilization and functionalization of theranostic materials of iron oxide and gold and their combination into novel nanostructures for more efficacious in vivo imaging agents. Ultimately, the preferred path between traditional non-traditional methods rests on whether biological selection is more powerful for functionality than rational design, or whether the most efficacious route is a combination thereof

Systems biology analysis of Escherichia coli for discovery and metabolic engineering
Systems biology is an emerging field of research that utilizes high-throughput experimental data and computational analysis methods to study biochemical networks. One of the common denominators of systems biology is the genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic networks. These reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured knowledgebases that seek to formally represent the known metabolic activities of an organism. In the first part of this dissertation, the general properties of these reconstructions, along with the use of constraint-based modeling to analyze these networks, is described in detail. Metabolic network reconstructions have many practical uses, including use in discovery of new gene functions and metabolic reactions, and for metabolic engineering. The core E. coli metabolic model, a small- scale model that can be used for in-depth analysis of new constraint-based methods, is presented and analyzed in detail. In the second part of the dissertation, the genome -scale metabolic reconstruction of E. coli was updated and analyzed. This reconstruction was first published in 2000, and has been updated and periodically published since then. The current version of the reconstruction is called iJO1366, and was updated based on new literature and database information. The remaining network gaps were analyzed, and a new gap-filling workflow was developed and used to predict the missing metabolic reactions and genes in iJO1366. Model predicted growth phenotypes were compared to a large experimental dataset of gene knockout strain phenotypes, and model errors were identified. Several in vivo experiments were performed to validate these model-based predictions. In the third part of the dissertation, the metabolic network model of E. coli was used for metabolic engineering. A large-scale computational screen using the algorithms OptKnock and OptGene was performed to design many growth-coupled production strains for various useful compounds. In order to validate the accuracy of these predictions and to determine if adaptive laboratory evolution can be utilized as an effective strain engineering tool, two strain designs were selected for experimental analysis. These knockout strains were constructed and evolved to optimize their phenotypes. One evolved strain worked as expected, producing a high yield of lactate from glucose. The other failed to produce 1,2-propanediol as predicted. This strain was analyzed by expression profiling, providing evidence for another metabolic gene function

Differential effects of simvastatin on IL-13-induced 
cytokine gene expression in primary mouse tracheal 
epithelial cells
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Asthma causes significant morbidity worldwide in adults and children alike, and incurs large healthcare costs. The statin drugs, which treat hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases, have pleiotropic effects beyond lowering cholesterol, including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties which may benefit lung health. Using an allergic mouse model of asthma, we previously demonstrated a benefit of statins in reducing peribronchiolar eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, goblet cell hyperplasia, and lung IL-4 and IL-13 production.
				
				
					
						Objectives
					In this study, we evaluated whether simvastatin inhibits IL-13-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression of asthma-related cytokines in well-differentiated primary mouse tracheal epithelial (MTE) cell cultures. We hypothesized that simvastatin reduces the expression of IL-13-inducible genes in MTE cells.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We harvested tracheal epithelial cells from na&#239;ve BALB/c mice, grew them under air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture conditions, then assessed IL-13-induced gene expression in MTE cells using a quantitative real-time PCR mouse gene array kit.
				
				
					
						Results
					We found that simvastatin had differential effects on IL-13-mediated gene expression (inhibited eotaxin-1; MCP-1,-2,-3; and osteopontin (SPP1), while it induced caspase-1 and CCL20 (MIP-3&#945;)) in MTE cells. For other asthma-relevant genes such as TNF, IL-4, IL-10, CCL12 (MCP-5), CCL5 (RANTES), and CCR3, there were no significant IL-13-inducible or statin effects on gene expression.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Simvastatin modulates the gene expression of selected IL-13-inducible pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells. The airway epithelium may be a viable target tissue for the statin drugs. Further research is needed to assess the mechanisms of how statins modulate epithelial gene expression.

Identification of somatic and germline mutations using whole exome sequencing of congenital acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed within the first month of life is classified as congenital ALL and has a significantly worse outcome than ALL diagnosed in older children. This suggests that congenital ALL is a biologically different disease, and thus may be caused by a distinct set of mutations. To understand the somatic and germline mutations contributing to congenital ALL, the protein-coding regions in the genome were captured and whole-exome sequencing was employed for the identification of single-nucleotide variants and small insertion and deletions in the germlines as well as the primary tumors of four patients with congenital ALL.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Exome sequencing was performed on Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, California). Reads were aligned to the human reference genome and the Genome Analysis Toolkit was used for variant calling. An in-house developed Ensembl-based variant annotator was used to richly annotate each variant.
				
				
					
						Results
					There were 1&#8211;3 somatic, protein-damaging mutations per ALL, including a novel mutation in Sonic Hedgehog. Additionally, there were many germline mutations in genes known to be associated with cancer predisposition, as well as genes involved in DNA repair.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					This study is the first to comprehensively characterize the germline and somatic mutational profile of all protein-coding genes patients with congenital ALL. These findings identify potentially important therapeutic targets, as well as insight into possible cancer predisposition genes.

[cell, cobinamide, radiation, percent, irradiation]

Cobinamide as a radioprotective agent
Ionizing radiation is classified as a potent carcinogen and its injury to cells is, to a large extent, due to oxidative damage generated by reactive oxidative species (ROS). The biomolecules most often reported to be damaged by ionizing radiation are lipids and DNA. Dr. Boss has shown that cobinamide, a structural analogue of cobalamin (vitamin B12), binds to superoxide anion in vitro. We now show that in cultured cells cobinamide can work as a possible therapeutic agent for radiation-induced injury. First, in HeLa cells cobinamide improved increased DNA synthesis by an average of 19 percent when given prior to irradiation, and 7 percent when given 24 hours post- irradiation. Secondly, in irradiated MDA MB-231 cells, the doubling rate was 19 percent higher in cobinamide-treated cells than in non-treated cells. And finally, cells treated with cobinamide showed less fragmentation and blebbing following irradiation than non-treated cells. These data suggest that cobinamide might be beneficial in treating the effects of ionizing radiation

Homeostatic control of IkappaB metabolism determines NF- kappaB responsiveness
Cellular signal transduction begins with an input signal that activates a pathway or network of signaling proteins to exert a specific output or change in cellular behavior. A useful approach to understanding signal transduction and mapping signaling pathways has been to examine changes to specific proteins, either in their expression, interaction with other proteins, post-translation modifications, or enzymatic activities, in cells after application of the input. As useful as this approach may be, it does not answer how the pathway may be regulated in the absence of an input signal, nor does it explain how the output may be more or less responsive to an input depending on the homeostatic regulation within the particular network. Tight regulation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor is mediated by the coordinated control of the synthesis and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB proteins, the IkappaBs. My dissertation takes a mechanistic approach to understanding how steady state IkappaB synthesis and degradation affect constitutive NF-kappaB activity and NF-kappaB responses to inflammatory and metabolic stress signals. Biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology, are used in conjunction with mathematical modeling to explore how homeostatic mechanisms determine UV-induced NF-kappaB activity and how type I and type II interferons alter NF-kappaB responsiveness to inflammatory signals. This work suggests that the targeting of the steady-state reactions of a network may be important consideration when designing therapeutics to specifically target certain aspects of a signaling pathway

Feature Extraction in Volumetric Bioimages
Automatic analysis of biological image datasets is one of the important achievements of applied image processing research. Feature extraction in volumetric bioimages obtained from numerous biomedical imaging techniques is becoming extremely critical for biologists and medical professionals to find the answers to many problems. In this work, we show how to extract effective features in two kinds of volumetric bioimages - plant shoot apical meristem(SAM) cell images taken by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and the nematode images taken by Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy.For actively developing tissues, a computational platform capable of automatically segmenting and tracking cells in the volumetric image stacks is very critical to obtaining high-throughput and quantitative spatiotemporal measurements of a range of cell behaviors, which will lead to a better understanding of the underlying dynamics of morphogenesis. The cells in the SAM are tightly clustered in space and have very similar shapes and intensity distributions, thus choosing reliable features to compute cell correspondences in space and time can be very challenging. In our research we propose a local graph matching based method to track the cells both spatially and temporally, and identify cell divisions. The geometric structure and topology of the cells' relative positions are efficiently exploited as the basic feature to match the cells. Furthermore, we build a joint segmentation and tracking system, where the tracking output acts as an indicator of the quality of segmentation and, in turn, the optimized segmentation can be improved to obtain better tracking results. In the end, the cell correspondences across multiple slices and time windows are fused together to obtain the final cell lineages. Experiments on multiple plant datasets show the proposed image analysis pipeline can effectively segment and track the SAMs cells. Another contribution of this work on volumetric bioimages analysis lies in multilinear feature extraction and classification for nematode Digital Multi-focal Images (DMI). In such images, morphological information for a transparent specimen is captured in the form of a stack of high quality images, representing individual focal planes through the specimen's body. We present a method that can effectively exploit the entire information in the stack using the 3D X-Ray projections at different viewing angles. These DMI stacks represent the effect of different factors - shape, texture, viewpoint, different instances within the same class and different classes of specimens. For this purpose, we embed the 3D X-Ray Transform within a multilinear framework and propose a Multilinear X-Ray Transform feature representation. The experimental results on the nematode DMI data show that the proposed feature extraction and analysis method can give reliable recognition rate on a real-life database.

Naturally derived myocardial matrix as an injectable scaffold for cardiac repair
As cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the Western world, new therapies are needed to treat end stage heart failure (HF). Post- myocardial infarction (MI), the extracellular matrix (ECM) is degraded, and thus cellular or acellular scaffold materials have been explored to repair the damaged ECM. Injectable scaffolds offer the advantage of intramyocardial delivery, as well as potential minimally invasive catheter delivery. However, current materials being explored for cardiac repair do not mimic the complexity of native cardiac ECM and may not be compatible with catheter delivery. The objective of this dissertation is to test the hypothesis that a naturally derived myocardial matrix, developed specifically to mimic the native myocardial ECM, can serve as an injectable acellular scaffold for cardiac repair. Herein, a solubilized myocardial matrix material has been developed from the decellularization of porcine ventricular tissue. Characterization indicates a retained biochemical complexity after decellularization. Additionally, the solubilized myocardial matrix is able to self-assemble, forming a nanofibrous and porous structure, similar to native ECM, at 37°C in vitro. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the myocardial matrix gel can be altered via crosslinking, leading to increased storage modulus, slowed degradation, and decreased cell migration rates. After initial development and characterization, the myocardial matrix was shown to gel and allow for infiltration of vascular cells, upon injection into rat myocardium. Additionally, effects of myocardial matrix injection in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model were evaluated. This work assesses effects on left ventricular (LV) geometry, shows preserved cardiac function, and attempts to understand local effects of the matrix upon injection into the ischemic region. Finally, the myocardial matrix was tested for feasibility of clinical translation, through percutaneous transendocardial delivery in a porcine model. Following successful injection of matrix post-MI, animals were evaluated for up to three-months, without harmful side effects. This work provides the field of injectable materials for cardiac tissue-engineering with a novel injectable scaffold, designed specifically for the heart that is able to be chemically crosslinked, is able to preserve cardiac function, and has potential for clinical translation to treat HF post-MI

Regularized Equally Sloped Tomography Algorithm for Low Dose X-Ray Computed Tomography
X-ray Computed Tomography is widely  used in a  broad range of fields including astronomy, geophysics, material science, biology and radiology. It has the advantage to achieve the  cross section  information of  the  object  without  physically  damaging  or  penetrating  it,  which  is especially important for in-vivo biology imaging systems or clinical imaging systems. However, due  to  the  requirement  of  sufficiently high  flux  projections  from  multiple  directions  for achieving high quality images, a major concern in  X-ray CT is the unavoidable radiation dose delivered  to  the  imaging  objects,  especially  to  the  more radiosensitive  patients  or  biology specimens.  With  the  conventional unregularized  tomography  algorithms,  the  accuracy  of  the reconstruction images has to be compromised by lowering the number of projections or reducing the  source  flux  per  projection.  Therefore, many  more  sophisticated  reconstruction  algorithms have been developed recently to solve the missing data and suppress the noise level in the low dose tomography modalities by incorporating mathematical regularization techniques into a real space iterative process. These methods perform well under certain circumstances but also have the limitation in computational speed, which is crucial for real time imaging systems.  In  this  dissertation,  an  efficient  iterative  Fourier  based  reconstruct technique  termed  Equally- Sloped Tomography (EST), which combines the efficiency of Fourier transform and advanced iterative  process  and allows  for  accurate  tomographic  reconstruction  from  low  flux  and undersampled projection data, is presented and investigated. This work focuses on integrating the mathematical regularization methods into the EST algorithm, studying its performances through numerical experiments,  comparing  the  results  with  other  reconstruction algorithms  and developing  the  data  preparation  procedure  for  three major  tomography  geometries:  parallel beam, fan beam and helical cone beam. Furthermore, the algorithm was implemented into two important tomography systems: the X-ray medical CT and phase contrast X-ray mammography CT. The performances were studied by conducting experiments using phantom and clinical data at  different  low  dose levels.  After  carefully  evaluated  by  both  visualized  comparisons  and quantified measurements, the results demonstrate that the regularized EST algorithm  is capable to  computational  efficiently  achieve significant  radiation  dose  reduction  through  both  the reduction  of flux  and  the  number  of  projections,  while  producing  comparable  image quality results as the full-dose conventional reconstructions do.

Fabrication and Low-Frequency Noise Characterization of Devices Made From Dirac Materials
Materials with Dirac-type electronic band structure have recently drawn much interest. These materials revealed unique electrical, thermal and optical properties, which can be potentially used in future high-speed electronics. In this dissertation research, I investigate on two different classes of Dirac materials: graphene and topological insulators of the bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) family. The first part of the dissertation reports on fabrication of the suspended graphene structures using the selective dry and chemical etching and investigation of the low frequency1/f noise in graphene field-effect transistors under electron beam irradiation. Raman spectroscopy has been used for identification and quality control of the suspended and supported graphene. It also provided the quantitative assessment of the radiation induced defects. It was found that the suspended graphene layers had larger I(2D)/I(G) intensity ratio than that of the supported graphene. The latter was attributed to weaker impurity scattering from the substrate defects. The data for graphene device performance after exposure to different irradiation doses, which was obtained in this dissertation research, is important for graphene device fabrication and proposed applications in communications. The second part of the dissertation focuses on electrical and low-frequency noise characterization of the mechanically exfoliated films of bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3). This material belongs to the topological insulators, which are characterized by the presence of the Dirac-cone dispersion in their surface states. It was found that the field-effect devices with the channels made of topological insulator materials reveal 1/f noise below 10 kHz. The noise amplitudes scaled up with the channel resistance. The transport measurements revealed that the normalized resistance of the devices made from the exfoliated thin films of Bi2Se3 did not scale inversely with the film thickness. The latter indicates that the surface transport component was significant as compared to the bulk electron conduction. The scattering-protected surface states of topological insulator materials can lead to new methods of noise reduction. The obtained results are important for understanding the traps and carrier dynamics in topological insulators, and can potentially lead to ultra-low power and ultra-low noise electronics applications.

The ecology of coral-microbe interactions
At every moment, a tropical reef coral interacts with millions of microbial organisms from tens of thousands of different species. Among these viruses, bacteria, archaea, dinoflagellates, and protists are cooperative symbionts as well as pathogens and parasites. Each interaction between a coral and a microscopic organism has ecological consequences for the coral community. In this dissertation, I show that juveniles of the Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata suffer distance-dependent mortality in the presence of adult corals of the same species which is caused by microbial communities near these adults. This previously undiscovered structuring force will affect the spatial patterning of reefs and appears strong enough to drive the evolution of habitat selection behavior by coral larvae. The behavior of pre-settlement larvae differs based on both the microbial environment and the manner in which that environment is altered, indicating that water column microbes may be used as navigational information by dispersing corals. Sterilized seawater and penicillin both increase larval swimming rates, perhaps because larvae cannot detect the microbial "smell" of a suitable reef habitat, however only penicillin inhibits settlement and metamorphosis. Five antibiotics each induce a different pattern of abnormal behavior, indicating that the behavior of coral larvae could form the foundation of a new model system in toxicology. Furthermore, settlement failure on reefs may have a large behavioral component that has been underappreciated until now. The coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis is the best-known coral-microbe interaction however coral bleaching remains enigmatic. Based on observations made after a tropical storm, I propose that corals evolved bleaching as an adaptive mechanism to readjust symbiont communities after storm damage moves corallites into new light regimes. In a survey of viral diversity in the coral Diploria strigosa, I demonstrate that coral-associated viruses likely infect all other cells in the coral holobiont, including symbionts and potential pathogens. I propose that interactions among these viral groups could help to stabilize mutualistic coral-microbe interactions. Four additional natural history observations demonstrate the diversity of behaviors and interactions corals exhibit at the micron to millimeter scales and reveal that we have many more coral- microbe interactions left to discover

BROMUS TECTORUM INVASION AND GLOBAL CHANGE: LIKELIHOOD OF SPREAD AND FEASIBILITY OF CONTROL
<italic>Bromus tectorum</italic> L. is an annual grass native to Eurasia that was introduced into the U.S.A. in the late 1800s and has become dominant in large parts of the Intermountain West.  At high density, it can alter the fire regime and subsequently act to displace native shrub and bunchgrass communities.  In the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, <italic>B. tectorum</italic> exists in low-density populations and its impacts have been minimal.  However, agents of global change, such as changing climate and increased anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition, will likely affect plant species distributions and may facilitate the spread of <italic>B. tectorum</italic>.  In this dissertation, I examine: (1) how climate change and increased N deposition might affect <italic>B. tectorum</italic> spread, (2) how increased N deposition might affect species diversity and <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominance, (3) the ecological effectiveness of <italic>B. tectorum</italic> control techniques, and (4) the feasibility of <italic>B. tectorum</italic> control in the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, considering social logistical, and regulatory factors.Through a series of <italic>in-situ</italic> experiments, I found that a shift from snow to rain could increase <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominance in the region, depending on timing, frequency, and magnitude of rain events.  Effects of increased N on <italic>B. tectorum</italic> were dependent on rainfall.  Through a four-year study monitoring species composition, I found that <italic>B. tectorum</italic> dominance has increased significantly at the site at the expense of native forb species richness.  In disturbed areas, <italic>B. tectorum</italic> cover is approaching the threshold for increased fire risk, which could result in more significant impacts for the region.  Several methods of control were effective in reducing <italic>B. tectorum</italic> and increasing the dominance of native species, including hand pulling, soil solarization, and mulching.  However, through interviews with local land managers, I identified a number of regulatory, social, and logistical obstacles to active <italic>B. tectorum</italic> control in the region.  Future work should be focused on overcoming these barriers to prevent increased impacts of <italic>B. tectorum</italic> at its high elevation range margin.

Synergistic Effect of Fullerene-Capped Gold Nanoparticles on Graphene Electrochemical Supercapacitors
We report the synthesis of graphene/fullerene-capped gold nanoparticle nanocomposite film which was used to construct supercapacitor electrodes. The fullerene-based self-assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were attained via the fullerene(C60)-gold interaction. The fullerene-capped AuNPs effectively separated the graphene sheets preventing aggregation. A synergistic effect was observed—the specific capacitance of graphene/fullerene-capped AuNP electrode is 197 F/g, which is higher than that of graphene electrode (31 F/g), graphene/AuNP electrode (126 F/g), and graphene/fullerene electrode (118 F/g). The results render a novel route of synthesis and modification of graphene-based materials for the construction of electrochemical energy storage devices.

RegTransBase -- a database of regulatory sequences and interactions based on literature: a resource for investigating transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Due to the constantly growing number of sequenced microbial genomes, comparative genomics has been playing a major role in the investigation of regulatory interactions in bacteria. Regulon inference mostly remains a field of semi-manual examination since absence of a knowledgebase and informatics platform for automated and systematic investigation restricts opportunities for computational prediction. Additionally, confirming computationally inferred regulons by experimental data is critically important.
				
				
					
						Description
					RegTransBase is an open-access platform with a user-friendly web interface publicly available at http://regtransbase.lbl.gov. It consists of two databases &#8211; a manually collected hierarchical regulatory interactions database based on more than 7000 scientific papers which can serve as a knowledgebase for verification of predictions, and a large set of curated by experts transcription factor binding sites used in regulon inference by a variety of tools. RegTransBase captures the knowledge from published scientific literature using controlled vocabularies and contains various types of experimental data, such as: the activation or repression of transcription by an identified direct regulator; determination of the transcriptional regulatory function of a protein (or RNA) directly binding to DNA or RNA; mapping of binding sites for a regulatory protein; characterization of regulatory mutations. Analysis of the data collected from literature resulted in the creation of Putative Regulons from Experimental Data that are also available in RegTransBase.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					RegTransBase is a powerful user-friendly platform for the investigation of regulation in prokaryotes. It uses a collection of validated regulatory sequences that can be easily extracted and used to infer regulatory interactions by comparative genomics techniques thus assisting researchers in the interpretation of transcriptional regulation data.

Shock Wave Acceleration of Monoenergetic Protons using a Multi-Terawatt CO<sub>2</sub> Laser
Compact and affordable ion accelerators based on laser-produced plasmas have potential applications in many fields of science and medicine. However, the requirement of producing focusable, narrow-energy-spread, energetic beams has proved to be challenging. In this thesis, an experimental demonstration of the generation of monoenergetic ions via collisionless electrostatic shock waves driven in a laser produced plasma is presented.The physical processes behind shock wave formation, propagation, and their potential to produce monoenergetic ion beams is explored using 1D OSIRIS simulations. It is observed that a shock wave can be formed from the interpenetration of two plasmas via the expansion from a density discontinuity or an initial relative drift velocity. These processes can be instigated in the laser driven case where the laser can produce a moving sharp density spike and strong electron heating as it bores a hole through an overdense plasma. Under appropriate conditions, an electrostatic shock is formed that detaches from he laser and propagates in the plasma even after the laser is turned off. This shock can then overtake and reflect ions from the upstream plasma and accelerate them to yield a relatively narrow energy spread.A multi-terawatt CO<sub>2</sub> laser system was developed at the UCLA Neptune Laboratory for exploring laser-driven shock wave acceleration of ions. The theory behind CO<sub>2</sub> amplification of picosecond pulses where the bandwidth is provided by the pressure of the CO<sub>2</sub> gas and the field of the laser pulse itself is developed. These ideas are applied for the production of 3 ps CO<sub>2</sub> laser pulses with peak powers of up to 15 TW, currently the most powerful CO<sub>2</sub> laser pulses ever produced.These laser pulses were used for laser-driven shock wave acceleration of protons in a hydrogen gas jet where the peak plasma density is in the range of 3-5 n<sub>cr</sub>, where n<sub>cr</sub> is the critical plasma density for 10 &mu;m radiation. Interferometry using a picosecond 532 nm laser pulse showed that the plasma has a dynamically formed profile with a sharp (10&lambda;) rise to overcritical densities and a long exponential fall (30&\lambda;). Protons accelerated from this interaction reach energies of 22 MeV, are contained within a narrow energy spread of ~1%, and have geometrical emittances as low as a mm mrad. 2D OSIRIS simulations show that the laser-driven shock overtakes and reflects the protons in the slowly expanding hydrogen plasma resulting in a narrow energy spectrum. Scaling of this mechanism to higher laser powers through simulations predict the production of ~200 MeV protons needed for radiotherapy by using current laser technology.

SIO Reference 58-41. The most general relation for the divergence of the light vector is derived from the equation of transfer for an arbitrary optical medium, and is shown to yield a direct means of determining the volume absorption function in natural aerosols and hydrosols. It is also shown that a correct special form of the divergence relation (for the slab geometry) is derivable from the classical Schuster equations and their solutions.

Observation of the dynamics leading to a conical intersection in dissociative electron
attachment to water
Following prior work on the lower-energy resonances, we apply techniques of momentum imaging and ab initio scattering calculations to the process of dissociative electron attachment to water via the highest-energy 2B2 resonance. We focus on the H- anion fragment, which is produced via dynamics passing through and avoiding the conical intersection with the lower A1 state, leading to OH (2Pi) and OH (2Sigma), respectively. The momentum imaging technique, when combined with theoretical calculations on the attachment amplitude and dissociation dynamics, demonstrates that the angular distributions provide a signature of the location of the conical intersection in the space
of nuclear configurations.

A reference genetic map of C. clementina hort. ex Tan.; citrus evolution inferences from comparative mapping
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Most modern citrus cultivars have an interspecific origin. As a foundational step towards deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence was produced by the International Citrus Genome Consortium from a haploid derived from Clementine mandarin. The availability of a saturated genetic map of Clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. Clementine is believed to be a &#8216;Mediterranean&#8217; mandarin &#215; sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. Skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female Clementine mapping data. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between &#8216;Mediterranean&#8217; mandarin and sweet orange. The results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					A reference genetic map of citrus, used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the first citrus reference genome sequence, was established. The high conservation of marker order observed at the interspecific level should allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences by mapping next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the reference genome sequence. The genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence appears to have been inherited primarily from the &#8216;Mediterranean&#8217; mandarin. The high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the male Clementine data underline the probable extent of deviation from Mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in male parents.

[phosphate, life, span]

Genetic Determinants of Phosphate Response in Drosophila
Phosphate is required for many important cellular processes and having too little phosphate or too much can cause disease and reduce life span in humans. However, the mechanisms underlying homeostatic control of extracellular phosphate levels and cellular effects of phosphate are poorly understood. Here, we establish Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the study of phosphate effects. We found that Drosophila larval development depends on the availability of phosphate in the medium. Conversely, life span is reduced when adult flies are cultured on high phosphate medium or when hemolymph phosphate is increased in flies with impaired Malpighian tubules. In addition, RNAi-mediated inhibition of MAPK-signaling by knockdown of Ras85D, phl/D-Raf or Dsor1/MEK affects larval development, adult life span and hemolymph phosphate, suggesting that some in vivo effects involve activation of this signaling pathway by phosphate. To identify novel genetic determinants of phosphate responses, we used Drosophila hemocyte-like cultured cells (S2R+) to perform a genome-wide RNAi screen using MAPK activation as the readout. We identified a number of candidate genes potentially important for the cellular response to phosphate. Evaluation of 51 genes in live flies revealed some that affect larval development, adult life span and hemolymph phosphate levels.

Ecology and Management of Canyon Flies (Fannia benjamini complex) in California
Host seeking "canyon flies" (<italic>Fannia benjamini</italic> complex) (Diptera: Muscidae) cause significant nuisance to humans and animals. To determine if a barrier trapping system using attractive traps would reduce the number of canyon flies reaching a human host within a protected area, a barrier of CO<sub>2</sub>-baited CDC-type suction traps (without light) was evaluated during the peak fly activity season at a location known for high <italic>F. conspicua</italic> Malloch activity in southern California. To select a suitable radius for the barrier, the effect of an operating CO<sub>2</sub>-baited trap on the fly capture rate of a nearby human was evaluated with traps placed at 10, 20, 30 and 40m away from the human collector. The number of flies captured by the human collector was very significantly reduced by traps placed 10m away, only slightly by traps 20m away, and unaffected by traps > 30m away. Because of site characteristics and the rapidly decreasing human-trap interaction between 10-20 m, a 15m radius circular trap barrier was erected, comprised of 8 CO<sub>2</sub> traps. This barrier reduced <italic>F. conspicua</italic> capture by the human collector by 51 %. Reducing the barrier radius to 5m resulted in a 39 % reduction. The diel activity of <italic>F. benjamini</italic> Malloch and the "trail gnat", <italic>Amiota picta</italic> Coquillett, in the Carmel Valley, California was determined by hourly sweep net collections in September. Both species had a high activity period during early morning (0830-0930) with a second high activity period in the late afternoon and early evening (1630-1830). <italic>A. picta</italic> activity almost ceased during the inter-peak period, while <italic>F. benjamini</italic> remained active, though at reduced numbers, throughout the day. Capture rates of <italic>F. benjamini</italic> was higher at shaded locations than at sun-exposed locations. Neither the specific human collector nor the clothing color of a human collector had a significant effect on the rate of capture of <italic>F. benjamini</italic>.  Substantially fewer <italic>F. benjamini</italic> were captured in a CO<sub>2</sub> trap relative to the number captured by a human collector, even when traps were baited with the host odors ammonia and 1-octen-3-ol in addition to the CO<sub>2</sub>. The implications of these studies for management of canyon flies are discussed.

Role of RNA Binding Proteins and Post-Transcriptional Regulation in Response to Environmental Changes in Arabidopsis thaliana
Light and temperature are two of the most important factors that regulate plant growth and development. The adaptation to alterations in light and temperature involves programed changes in gene expression that are necessary for physiological and morphological adaptations. Transcript abundance is frequently used to monitor changes in gene expression in response to sub-optimal growth conditions. However, transcript accumulation may not accurately mirror gene expression due to extensive post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. In this dissertation, the significance in post-transcriptional regulation in response to unanticipated alterations in light availability was evaluated in seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Early darkness resulted in translational inhibition and sequestration of a subset of cellular mRNAs. The translationally regulated mRNAs were enriched in transcripts encoding chloroplastic and protein synthesis machinery. The reduced engagement of the majority of these transcripts with ribosomes was rapidly reversed upon re-illumination. These results suggest that regulation of the translational status of chloroplastic and protein synthesis mRNAs may aid in energy conservation during unanticipated darkness. Towards the elucidation of RNA binding proteins that control selective mRNA translation, the complexes of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Cold Shock Proteins (CSPs 1-4) were characterized. Transgenic lines over-expressing epitope-tagged CSPs were established and used for cellular fractionation and mass spectrometric protein identification of immunopurified CSP complexes. Fluorescently-tagged CSPs and associated proteins were localized in transiently transformed cells by confocal microscopy. Together, the results of this survey indicate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CSPs are involved in multiple processes of post-transcriptional regulation, including pre-mRNA/rRNA processing and mRNA translation.  Of the four CSPs, CSP1 co-fractionated with ribosome. A mild RNase A treatment of ribosome complexes combined with sucrose gradient fractionation confirmed that CSP1 is a polysome-associated RNA binding protein. CSP1 accumulated under normal growth condition and was induced by low-temperature. A polyclonal antibody prepared to specifically recognize CSP1 protein was used to co-immunopurify native CSP1 complexes. DNA microarray hybridization was used to compare total (transcriptome), polysomal (translatome), and CSP1-associated mRNAs from plants grown under normal or low-temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that CSP1 preferentially associated with mRNAs involved in RNA processing and protein synthesis. Many of the CSP1-associated mRNA also have high 5'-UTR with a high G+C content. The transcriptome and translatome adjustments during low-temperature stress were highly correlated, in contrast to the findings with early darkness. This work provides new perspectives on post-transcriptional gene regulation in response to environmental cues in<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as well as a foundation for future in-depth characterization of mRNA-RNP control networks in plants.

Characterization of Trapped Lignin-Degrading Microbes in Tropical Forest Soil
Lignin is often the most difficult portion of plant biomass to degrade, with fungi generally thought to dominate during late stage decomposition. Lignin in feedstock plant material represents a barrier to more efficient plant biomass conversion and can also hinder enzymatic access to cellulose, which is critical for biofuels production. Tropical rain forest soils in Puerto Rico are characterized by frequent anoxic conditions and fluctuating redox, suggesting the presence of
lignin-degrading organisms and mechanisms that are different from known fungal decomposers and oxygen-dependent enzyme activities. We explored microbial lignin-degraders by burying bio-traps containing lignin-amended and unamended biosep beads in the soil for 1, 4, 13 and 30 weeks. At each time point, phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme activity was found to be elevated in the lignin-amended versus the unamended beads, while cellulolytic enzyme activities were significantly depressed in
lignin-amended beads. Quantitative PCR of bacterial communities showed more bacterial colonization in the lignin-amended compared to the unamended beads after one and four weeks, suggesting that the lignin supported increased bacterial abundance. The microbial community was analyzed by small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA genes using microarray (PhyloChip) and by high-throughput amplicon pyrosequencing based on universal primers targeting bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic communities. Community
trends were significantly affected by time and the presence of lignin on the beads. Lignin-amended beads have higher relative abundances of representatives from the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria compared to unamended beads. This study suggests that in low and fluctuating redox soils, bacteria could play a role in anaerobic lignin decomposition.

AC Electrokinetic separation and detection of nanoparticles and DNA nanoparticulates under high conductance conditions
In biomedical research and diagnostics, it is a significant challenge to directly isolate and identify rare cells and potential biomarkers in blood, plasma and other clinical samples. Additionally, the advent of bio- nanotechnology is leading to numerous drug delivery approaches that involve encapsulation of drugs and imaging agents within nanoparticles, which now will also have to be identified and separated from blood and plasma. AC electrokinetic techniques such as dielectrophoresis (DEP) offer a particularly attractive mechanism for the separation of cells and nanoparticles. Unfortunately, present DEP techniques require the dilution of blood/ plasma, thus making the technology less suitable for clinical sample preparation. The current dissertation explores methods and techniques of overcoming the high conductivity barrier in AC Electrokinetics to isolate nanoparticles. It further explores the various applications of isolating nanoparticles from complex physiological solutions. Using array devices with microelectrodes over-coated with porous hydrogel layers, AC electric field conditions have been found which allow the separation of DNA nanoparticles to be achieved under high conductance (ionic strength) conditions. At AC frequencies in 3000Hz to 10,000Hz range and 10 volts peak- to-peak, the separation of 10 micron polystyrene particles into low field regions, and 60nm DNA derivatized nanoparticles and 200nm nanoparticles into high field regions was carried out in 149mM 1xPBS buffer (1.68S/m). Furthermore, SYBR-Green fluorescent-stained hmw-DNA was separated from whole undiluted blood, at a level of <260ng /ml. While this DEP process concentrates hmw-DNA (>10kb) in high-field areas and cells into the low-field areas, very low molecular weight DNA <100bp and small protein molecules are only minimally affected by the process. These results may allow AC electrokinetic systems to now be developed, which can be used as seamless sample-to- answer systems for point-of-care diagnostics based on detection of early disease biomarkers directly from whole blood

Radiative and climate impacts of absorbing aerosols
By integrating experimental data, radiative transfer theory, and numerical modelling, this dissertation aims to improve our understanding of the radiative and the climate impacts of the major absorbing aerosols: mineral dust, black carbon (BC) and brown carbon. The research presented here combines existing surface, satellite and aircraft measurements and develops self-consistent models for aerosol mixing state, global and regional radiative forcing of absorbing aerosols and their climate effects. The first part of this dissertation presents the climatology and radiative impacts of dust plumes over the Pacific, the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans using multiple satellite datasets in conjunction with MACR (Monte Carlo Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation) model. A core-shell internally mixed aerosol model has been developed using the microphysical, chemical, and radiative observations as constraints. It is shown that internal mixing enhances the aerosol absorption and contributes to over 20% increase of radiative forcing. The aerosol mixing model is validated by comparing model simulated spectrally-resolved irradiance with observations. The results show that aerosol induced forcing is mainly confined in the visible band and the largest forcing occurs in the blue channel. distribution of the spectral radiative forcing is obtained. The aerosol forcing is used to drive a general circulation model (GCM) with prescribed sea surface temperature to investigate the impact of absorbing aerosols on regional climate. One of the main model findings is that heating of the atmosphere by absorbing aerosols can contribute to significant reductions in low level clouds, which in turn amplifies the warming. The simulated cloudiness reduction is particularly strong over the Arctic and China and the simulated warming over the Arctic exceeds 1.5°C. The findings of cloud reduction over China and the warming over the Arctic are consistent with observations. The above effects are relatively weak or negligible when absorbing aerosols are treated as externally mixed which is used as the assumption by most GCM studies thus far. This study reveals the fundamental importance of accounting for the observed chemical and physical properties of absorbing aerosols

The gospel according to LUCA (the last universal common ancestor)
One of the central ideas of Darwin's theory of descent with modification is that all life had a single origin, and all the various forms we see today are the result of variation and selection. 150 years later in the age of genomics we have realized there are three fundamentally distinct superkingdoms of life: the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. How did this these three groups evolve from one common ancestor? This dissertation attempts to answer that question with a variety of bioinformatics tools. The standard approach to this problem is to use mutations in protein sequence as a guide to construct phylogenetic trees. The failure of this approach has led many to argue there is no "tree of life". I argue against that strategy and conclusion by looking at the limitations of protein sequence data, and instead supplement it with other data sources. I argue that the rRNA trees which have been a standard of phylogeny for 30 years are misleading. They imply the root of the tree of life lies between the Archaea and the Bacteria. Instead of constructing trees, I have focused on creating timelines by differentiating between ancestral and derived taxa. The divergences in question occurred billions of years ago, so much of the signal present in sequence has degraded. Protein structure is more conserved than protein sequence on these time scales, so I use it as my tool of choice where ever possible. I argue the root of the tree of life is actually within the Gram-negative Bacteria and may have had a U-DNA genome. I have developed three polarizations that imply the Archaea are derived, and refuted all arguments that exclude the root from the Gram-negative Bacteria. One of these transitions led to the discovery of two novel proteasome homologs in Bacteria. It is not sufficient to argue the Archaea are derived from the Bacteria, one most provide a detailed explanation of how the most fundamental biological systems could all go through such a dramatic change to give rise to a novel superkingdom. I present a novel hypothesis that is a combination of selective pressure from antibiotic warfare, the right preadaptation in a Gram-positive bacterium, and relaxation of constraints from a viral endosymbiosis starting a chain of events that led to the birth of the Archaea

Equilibrium Selection in Experimental Games on Networks
We study behavior and equilibrium selection in experimental network games. We varytwo important factors: (a) actions are either strategic substitutes or strategic complements, and(b) subjects have either complete or incomplete information about the structure of a randomnetwork. Play conforms strongly to the theoretical predictions, providing an impressivebehavioral confirmation of the Galeotti, Goyal, Jackson, Vega-Redondo, and Yariv (2010)model. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, even with incomplete information. We findthat under complete information, subjects typically play the stochastically-stable (inefficient)equilibrium when the game involves strategic substitutes, but play the efficient one with strategiccomplements. Our results suggest that equilibrium multiplicity may not be a major concern.Subjects’ actions and realized outcomes under incomplete information depend strongly on boththe degree and the connectivity. When there are multiple equilibria, subjects begin by playing theefficient equilibrium, but eventually converge to the inefficient one.

Uncovering Factors and Molecular Mechanisms in Transcriptional Regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana
Although every cell contains a full complement of genes, not every gene is expressed equally.  It is through different types of regulation that each cell is able to differentiate into various cell types to generate a multi-cellular organism.  One such type of regulation is at the transcriptional level.  In my thesis work, I have gained a better understanding of how transcriptional regulation occurs in Arabidopsis thaliana through two divergent projects.  First, I have characterized the molecular mechanism by which APETALA2 (AP2), a floral homeotic gene, acts in floral development, by identifying its elusive target binding sequence, TTTGTT and/or AACAAA.  In addition, I have found that AP2 modulates the expression of AGAMOUS (AG), another floral homeotic gene involved in floral organ specification as well as stem cell maintenance, through this site in vivo.  This finding provided a molecular link between AP2 and AG, thereby answering a long-standing question in the field of floral development.  Second, using a forward chemical genetics screen for players involved in transcriptional gene silencing, I have identified a chemical, Camptothecin (CPT), which released a transcriptionally silenced luciferase-based reporter.  CPT is a well-known anti-cancer compound known to target DNA Topoisomerase I&#945;.  Topoisomerases are used to relieve torsional stress on the DNA double helix during replication.  Here in my thesis work, I have found that in Arabidopsis, TOP1&#945; is also involved in transcriptional gene silencing through several different modes: body methylation and RNA-directed DNA methylation.  Addition of the chemical resulted in the release of not only DNA methylation at the reporter transgene, but also endogenous loci as well.  These findings highlight the diverse functions of TOP1&#945; in development and provide implications in the study of cancer biology.

Elucidation of G-Protein Signal Transduction in Neurospora crassa Using Chemical Genomics, Metabonomics, and Genetics
The filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> is a model organism for filamentous fungi and has been studied for many years due to its many advantages as an organism for study.  Conidiation is a major mode of dispersal utilized by fungal pathogens, and it is evident that conidiation is a common biological response to adverse conditions and a means by which the fungus can reestablish itself in a more favorable environment.  <italic>N. crassa</italic> produces a type of asexual spore, the macroconidium (referred to as a conidium) for dissemination in the environment. In order to interact with its surroundings, fungi must be able to receive extracellular signals.  A major signaling pathway that detects and responds to external signals in fungi and other eukaryotes is mediated by heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits). Three G alphas (GNA-1, GNA-2, and GNA-3), one G beta (GNB-1) and one G gamma subunit (GNG-1) have been identified in <italic>N. crassa</italic>.  Loss of <italic>gna-3</italic> has dramatic effects on conidiation, leading to production of short aerial hyphae and premature conidiation in plate cultures and inappropriate conidiation in submerged cultures. RIC8 is a novel guanine exchange factor (GEF) found in Neurospora crassa and has been shown to also interact with GNA-1 and GNA-3 in N. crassa. Yeast2Hybrid cDNA library screening has shown that RIC8 interacts with STE50, an adaptor protein working in the pathway of MAPK. A <italic>ric8</italic> deletion mutant shares several phenotypes with <italic>ste50</italic> deletion mutants.  Also, without STE50, CAT formation is compromised.  Localization of STE50 was investigated using a GFP-fused STE50; it localized to the cytoplasm as well as to the hyphal septa.  Finally, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to verify that RIC8 and STE50 do physically interact was carried out.   	As a participating student of the IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship), I was privileged to partake in a chemical genomics study; my goal was to find a chemical that perturbed asexual sporulation (conidiation) or spore germination in Neurospora crassa.  From screens of the Chembridge library, I identified a compound that inhibited conidiation of <italic>gna-3</italic> deletion mutants.  However, subsequent testing showed that newer batches of the chemical did not elicit the same phenotype; hence, this compound was dropped.  However, during the screening of the Chembridge library, a unique phenotype was observed from one of the compounds that was tested.  Compound #5979758 caused a "blebbing" effect on the conidia of all Neurospora strains tested so far. 	Furthermore, I entered into a collaboration with Dr. Cythia Larive and Kayla Kaiser to use proton NMR to study metabonomics in <italic>gna-3</italic> deletion mutant and wild-type strains under different conditions. The metabolic profiles for wild type and <italic>gna-3</italic> deletion mutants were well-documented.  From this study, it was revealed that the metabolome of <italic>gna-3</italic> deletion mutant does not vary greatly from that of the wild-type, even though it conidiates in submerged conditions.  Also, it was shown that GNA-3 is involved in a nutrient sensing pathway.  A paper titled "Use of proton NMR to measure intracellular metabolite levels during growth and asexual sporulation in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>", with authors James Kim, Kayla Kaiser, Cynthia Larive and Katherine Borkovich, was published in the journal <italic>Eukaryotic Cell</italic>.

Progress and bottleneck in induced pluripotency
Abstract
				
				With their capability to undergo unlimited self-renewal and to differentiate into all cell types in the body, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), reprogrammed from somatic cells of individual patients with defined factors, have unlimited potential in cell therapy and in modeling complex human diseases. Significant progress has been achieved to improve the safety of iPSCs and the reprogramming efficiency. To avoid the cancer risk and spontaneous reactivation of the reprogramming factors associated with the random integration of viral vectors into the genome, several approaches have been established to deliver the reprogramming factors into the somatic cells without inducing genetic modification. In addition, a panel of small molecule compounds, many of which targeting the epigenetic machinery, have been identified to increase the reprogramming efficiency. Despite these progresses, recent studies have identified genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of iPSCs as well as the immunogenicity of some cells derived from iPSCs. In addition, due to the oncogenic potential of the reprogramming factors and the reprogramming-induced DNA damage, the critical tumor suppressor pathways such as p53 and ARF are activated to act as the checkpoints that suppress induced pluripotency. The inactivation of these tumor suppression pathways even transiently during reprogramming processes could have significant adverse impact on the genome integrity. These safety concerns must be resolved to improve the feasibility of the clinic development of iPSCs into human cell therapy.

MTH1 and RGT1 demonstrate combined haploinsufficiency in regulation of the hexose transporter genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The SNF3 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a low glucose sensor that regulates expression of an important subset of the hexose transporter (HXT) superfamily. Null mutations of snf3 result in a defect in growth on low glucose concentrations due to the inability to relieve repression of a subset of the HXT genes. The snf3 null mutation phenotype is suppressed by the loss of either one of the downstream co-repressor proteins Rgt1p or Mth1p. The relief of repression allows expression of HXT transporter proteins, the resumption of glucose uptake and therefore of growth in the absence of a functional Snf3 sensor.
				
				
					
						Results
					Strains heterozygous for both the RGT1 and MTH1 genes (RGT1/rgt1&#916; MTH1/mth1&#916; snf3&#916;/snf3&#916;) but homozygous for the snf3&#8710; were found to grow on low glucose. Since null alleles in the heterozygous state lead to suppression, MTH1 and RGT1 display the phenomenon of combined haploinsufficiency. This observed haploinsufficiency is consistent with the finding of repressor titration as a mechanism of suppression of snf3. Mutants of the STD1 homolog of MTH1 did not display haploinsufficiency singly or in combination with mutations in RGT1. HXT gene reporter fusion assays indicated that the presence of heterozygosity at the MTH1 and RGT1 alleles leads to increased expression of the HXT2 gene. Deletion of the HXT2 gene in a heterozygous diploid, RGT1/rgt1&#916; MTH1/mth1&#916; snf3&#916;/snf3&#916; hxt2&#916;/hxt2&#916;, prevented the suppression of snf3&#916;.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					These findings support the model of relief of repression as the mechanism of restoration of growth on low glucose concentrations in the absence of functional Snf3p. Further, the observation that HXT2 is the gene responsible for restoration of growth under these conditions suggests that the numbers of repressor binding domains found in the regulatory regions of members of the HXT family may have biological relevance and enable differential regulation.

Aggression on Roadways
Aggression and the automobile have had a long standing association, yet research on aggressive behavior has neglected the roadway context. This chapter reviews existing work which has included archival analysis, field interview studies, personality research, and field experiments. Among the recurrent themes have been the relationship between aggressivity in driving to accident liability and to violence in the larger social context. Validity issues in road aggression research are discussed, and a typology of roadway aggression is presented. The typology maps a range of contemporary forms, most of which have never been investigated scientifically and have received sparse academic attention otherwise, despite having high social and scientific relevance. Disinhibiting influences that heighten the probability of roadway aggression are discussed.

On a generalization of the rank one Rubin-Stark conjecture
This thesis is concerned with the extended abelian rank one Stark conjecture stated for the first time in Erickson's thesis. Here, we investigate it in more depth then has been done so far. We formulate a stronger question which seems easier to investigate both theoretically and computationally. This question includes a generalization of the Brumer-Stark conjecture on annihilation of class groups. We link it with a conjecture of Gross and in the process find some new integrality properties of the Stickelberger element. We provide some numerical examples, when the base field is the rational number field, for which the stronger question, and thus the extended abelian rank one Stark conjecture, have an affirmative answer

[signaling, response, innate, factor, tlr, regulator, immune, receptor]

Identification and characterization of novel innate immune signaling regulators
The recognition of foreign pathogens by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) serves as the first line of defense against harmful microorganisms. One family of PRRs, known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), are expressed on plasma and endocytic membranes in order to detect extracellular or endocytosed bacteria-, fungus-, or virus- derived ligands. The sensing of pathogen-encoded patterns by TLRs activates these receptors, which transmit downstream signals resulting in the activation of NF- kappaB transcription factors and the production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, as well as the activation of IRF (interferon regulatory factor) transcription factors and the induction of type I interferons. The production of both mediators is critical for the immediate innate response to pathogen infection and for further signaling to engage long-term adaptive immune responses. Altogether, these pathways are exquisitely regulated to ensure clearance of invading microbes while limiting harmful autoimmune responses. Here, we report the characterization of novel regulatory co-factors that are required for TLR- directed innate immune signaling responses. These factors were identified using two screening approaches. First, the set of cellular components associated with TLR7- and TLR9- dependent responses were uncovered using an integrative systems-based genome-wide RNAi screen. This loss-of- function screen characterized 190 genes necessary for TLR7 /9 signaling, and further mapped 90 of these factors to a relative position on the TLR signaling cascade. HRS (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) was also found to be essential for the ubiquitin-dependent targeting of TLR9 to endolysosomes. Second, a biased gain-of-function screening approach was used to identify genes that increased NF-kappaB signaling. This method classified the gamma subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1-gamma) as a specific regulator of MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, and a more extensive mechanistic study demonstrated that PP1-gamma enhances the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 towards itself and IKK--gamma. Collectively, this analysis has identified proteins that are critical regulators of TLR-dependent innate responses and has provided significant insight into the molecular events underlying this complex signaling pathway

An experimental apparatus for diffraction-limites soft x-ray nanofocusing
Realizing the experimental potential of high-brightness, next generation synchrotron and free-electron laser light sources requires the development of reflecting x-ray optics capable of wavefront preservation and high-resolution nano-focusing. At the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 5.3.1, we are developing broadly applicable, high-accuracy, in situ, at-wavelength wavefront measurement techniques to surpass 100-nrad slope measurement accuracy for diffraction-limited Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors.
The at-wavelength methodology we are developing relies on a series of wavefront-sensing tests with increasing accuracy and sensitivity, including scanning-slit Hartmann tests, grating-based lateral shearing interferometry, and quantitative knife-edge testing. We describe the original experimental techniques and alignment methodology that have enabled us to optimally set a bendable KB mirror to achieve a focused, FWHM spot size of 150 nm, with 1 nm (1.24 keV) photons at 3.7 mrad numerical aperture. The predictions of wavefront measurement are confirmed by the knife-edge testing.
The side-profiled elliptically bent mirror used in these one-dimensional focusing experiments was originally designed for a much different glancing angle and conjugate distances. This work demonstrates that high-accuracy, at-wavelength wavefront-slope feedback can be used to optimize the pitch, roll, and mirror-bending forces in situ, using procedures that are deterministic and repeatable.

Variation in the Aggressive Behavior of the Parthenognetic Lizard (Cnemidophorus uniparens, Teiidae)
The desert-grassland whiptail (Cnemidophorus uniparens) is an  all-female lizard species that reproduces clonally by parthenogenesis. Here we report marked geographic variation in the aggressive behavior of paired individuals in which pairs consisted either of individuals from within study sites or individuals representing each of two different study sites. Although we document allozyme variation within each study site, this did not differ significantly between sites. Previously reported restriction endonuclease analysis of mitochondrial DNA indicates that the two lizard populations used in the present study arose from the same or closely related maternal ancestors by interspecific hybridization. Gross climatological differences do not appear to explain the behavioral variation between sites. The possible roles of polygenic effects not detected by the biochemical analyses and laboratory ies of environmental effects on the development of aggressive behavior await further investigation.

[equilibrium, game, player, chapter]

Multiple-group games
Evolutionary game theory is a formal framework which enables one to model how behaviour in large populations might develop. One of the most promising features of evolutionary game theory is that by assuming agents follow simple rules of thumb, equilibria can emerge as the end result of a dynamic process, rather than just as a static, self-enforcing prescription of play. This in turn allows path-dependent predictions to be made on which equilibrium will be reached. The concept of stochastic stability (Foster and Young, 1990), allows a unique equilibrium to be selected if one also accepts that that the above simple rules of thumb are subject to occasional errors. My dissertation consists of four essays discussing various aspects of evolutionary models, in particular focusing on equilibrium selection in a new class of games. Chapter 1 proposes a new class of stage games, Multiple-Group Games (MGG), which extends existing frameworks by allowing more than one type of pairwise interaction. This surprisingly unstudied feature complicates the analysis slightly but is necessary for describing certain settings with large numbers of heterogeneous agents. Chapter 2 studies a particular MGG with two groups, The Language Game, in which all pairs of players potentially interact. In particular it focuses on stochastically stable equilibria when the rules of thumb that players follow are myopic best response, and the manner in which they err is uniform. It is shown that three properties affect equilibrium selection: group size, group payoffs, and rates of response. Chapter 3 looks at The Language Game where all pairs of players are not necessarily connected. It is shown that network architecture immediately affects the set of stochastically stable equilibria. This result seems intuitive and should be contrasted with the homogeneous agent models, in which network structure has no effect on equilibrium selection. Chapter 4, though technically a paper on equilibrium refinements, examines the ways in which players might make mistakes. It places a simple and reasonable constraint on the set of ways that players may err: if strategy A performs worse against the current population behaviour than strategy B, then strategy A is less likely to be played

Design, Control, and Measurement of Molecular and Supramolecular Assemblies
Molecular switches and motors respond structurally, electronically, optically, and/or mechanically to external stimuli, testing and potentially enabling extreme miniaturization of optoelectronic devices, nanoelectromechanical systems, and medical devices. Assemblingmotors and switches on surfaces makes it possible both to measure the properties of individual molecules as they relate to their environment, and to couple function between assembled molecules. We designed molecules with precise functionality and assembled them on solid substrates either as isolated single molecules, linear one-dimensional chains, or as two dimensional islands in order to measure and to test the fundamental limits and cooperative function of the assemblies. We established that proximate functional molecules interact with each other to drive unprecedented cooperative motion at the nanoscale. In conjunction with theory, we establish the mechanism by which the molecules perform this nanoscale action. We modify the environments in which these assemblies are adsorbed to tune their dipole-dipole interactions via self- and directed assembly. We establish the role of the tethers that decouple the functional molecules from the underlying conductive substrates. By varying the composition of the tether we understood that the molecular function varies inversely with the conductance of the tether. In order to circumvent problems with steric hindrance in molecular assemblies, novel functional molecules were designed and tested at single-molecule and at ensemble scales. This thesis details the effects of parameters such as the molecular environment, intermolecular interactions, and internal functional groups of molecular switches on their nanoscale actuation.

Reliable GPS Integer Ambiguity Resolution
To operate, guide and control vehicles in low visibility conditions, it is critical that the states of the vehicle are accurately estimated, which includes the three dimensional position, velocity, and attitude. This can be accomplished by GPS (Global Positioning System) aided encoder or GPS aided inertial approaches. The overall positioning accuracy of either approach will be determined by the GPS performance. Real-time centimeter accuracy GPS positioning can be achieved using carrier phase measurements. This requires fast and reliable on-the-°y integer ambiguity resolution.
      In this dissertation, we focus on resolving GPS ambiguity problem, including both integer ambiguity estimation and integer ambiguity validation. For integer ambiguity estimation, a brief overview of previous work on integer ambiguity resolution is first presented. Then, an improved integer ambiguity resolution method is proposed. Subsequently, simulations and real-world data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We also present integer ambiguity algorithms with auxiliary measurements and algorithms with multiple epoch measurements, both of which are useful in GPS challenging areas. For integer ambiguity validation, a brief overview is first presented, and then analytic discussion and test results on several popular validations methods are studied. Finally we discuss GPS modernization and its effect on integer estimation and validation.

Designed Assembly of Biomimetic Membrane From Amphiphilic Copolymers
ABSTRACT OF THE THESISDesigned assembly of biomimetic membrane from amphiphilic copolymers byChun-Che TsengMaster of Science in Chemical and Environmental EngineeringUniversity of California, Riverside, March 2011Dr. Jianzhong Wu, ChairpersonAt appropriate condition amphiphilic block copolymers may self-assemble into well-organized mesoscopic structures such as micelles, vesicles, microscopic sheets and rods useful for practical applications. Vesicles of charged amphiphilic block copolymers have been utilized for fabrication of biomimetic membranes that exhibit properties similar to those of biological cell membranes but with exceptional durability and mechanical strength. Such membranes are suitable for embedding proteins/enzymes for various industrial applications.In this work, amphiphilic block copolymers of complementary charges are used in a cascade self-assembly process that involves sequential formation of vesicles in solution and their fusion on a charged substrate. Each copolymer chain links a strong polyelectrolyte (hydrophilic) block with a hydrophobic polymer that provides the driving force of the vesicle self-assembly in an aqueous environment. Biomimetic membranes are formed by layer-by-layer deposition/fusion of oppositely charged vesicles at a strongly charged mica surface. The cascade self-assembly process allows us to have a precise control of the membrane microscopic structure, thickness and composition. We have identified optimal solution conditions for formation of various mesoscopic block copolymer structures. The morphologies of cationic and anionic block copolymer structures at dry and at wet conditions are characterized by, respectively, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. Moreover, the thicknesses of these biomimetic membranes on the substrate have been measured by AFM scratching experiments. While the practical utility of these biomimetic membranes is yet to be demonstrated, this work provides deeper understanding of the size variation and spreading of amphiphilic block copolymer vesicles on mica surface and the selection of appropriate conditions for membrane fabrication.

Prolonged &#945;-amanitin treatment of cells for studying mutated polymerases causes degradation of DSIF 160 and other proteins
A useful method for studying the function of the mammalian RNA polymerase II takes advantage of the extreme sensitivity of its largest subunit, Rpb1, to alpha-amanitin (a-amanitin). Mutations of interest are introduced into an a-amanitin-resistant version of Rpb1, which is then expressed ectopically in cells. The phenotypes of these cells are then examined after inhibiting the endogenous wild-type polymerase with a-amanitin. Here, we show that cells that are enabled to grow in a-amanitin by expression of an a-amanitin-resistant Rpb1 exhibit changes in cell physiology that can lead to misleading experimental outcomes. The changes we have characterized include the accelerated degradation of some proteins, such as DSIF160, and the reduced rate of synthesis of others. In one series of experiments, we examined an a-amanitin-resistant construct, with a mutant C-terminal domain (CTD), that was unable to direct poly(A)-dependent transcription termination in cells growing in a-amanitin. The potential interpretation that the termination defect in this construct is due to the mutation in the CTD was rejected when the construct was found to be termination-competent in cells grown in the absence of a-amanitin. Instead, it appears that certain termination factors become limiting when the cells are grown in a-amanitin, presumably due to the a-amanitin-induced degradation we have characterized and/or to the inadequate transcription of certain genes by the a-amanitin-resistant Rpb1-containing polymerase.

Detection of horizontal transfer of individual genes by anomalous oligomer frequencies
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Understanding the history of life requires that we understand the transfer of genetic material across phylogenetic boundaries. Detecting genes that were acquired by means other than vertical descent is a basic step in that process. Detection by discordant phylogenies is computationally expensive and not always definitive. Many have used easily computed compositional features as an alternative procedure. However, different compositional methods produce different predictions, and the effectiveness of any method is not well established.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					The ability of octamer frequency comparisons to detect genes artificially seeded in cyanobacterial genomes was markedly increased by using as a training set those genes that are highly conserved over all bacteria. Using a subset of octamer frequencies in such tests also increased effectiveness, but this depended on the specific target genome and the source of the contaminating genes. The presence of high frequency octamers and the GC content of the contaminating genes were important considerations. A method comprising best practices from these tests was devised, the Core Gene Similarity (CGS) method, and it performed better than simple octamer frequency analysis, codon bias, or GC contrasts in detecting seeded genes or naturally occurring transposons. From a comparison of predictions with phylogenetic trees, it appears that the effectiveness of the method is confined to horizontal transfer events that have occurred recently in evolutionary time.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					The CGS method may be an improvement over existing surrogate methods to detect genes of foreign origin.

Antimicrobial nanoparticle for the treatment of bacterial infection
Liposomes are spherical lipid vesicles with bilayered membrane structure, which have been recognized as one of the most widely used carriers for delivering a myriad of pharmaceuticals. Liposomes can carry both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents with high efficiency and protect them from undesired effects of external conditions. However, the applications of liposomes are usually limited by their instability during storage. They are inclined to fuse with one another immediately after preparation, resulting in undesired mixing, increase in size, and payload loss. To overcome this limitation, this dissertation will focus on the technology to stabilize liposomes during storage and destabilize at specific conditions in order to allow controllable therapeutic release, as well as demonstrate their application to treat one of the bacterial infection diseases, acne vulgaris. The first area of this research is stimuli-responsive liposomes development, where the liposomes are stabilized by introducing gold nanoparticles to adsorb to their surface. As a result, the liposomes are prevented from fusing with one another and undesirable payload release during storage or physiological environments. Moreover, therapeutic is controllably released depending on environment conditions, such as acidic pH and bacterial virulence factor. In case of acid- responsive liposomes, the bound gold nanoparticles can effectively prevent liposomes from fusing with one another at neutral pH value, while at acidic environment (e.g. pH< 5), the gold particle stabilizers will fall off from the liposomes, thereby reinstalling the fusion activity of liposomes. The fusion activity of the stabilized liposomes is found to be 25% at pH=7, in contrast to 80% at pH=4. Another stimulus that can activate drug release from liposomes is virulence factor released from bacteria themselves, such as bacterial toxin. When nanoparticle- stabilized liposomes encounter with bacteria that secrete toxin, the toxin will insert into the liposome membranes and form pores, through which the encapsulated therapeutic agents are released. The released drugs subsequently impose antimicrobial effects on the toxin-secreting bacteria. It was observed that in the presence of toxin- secreting bacteria, 100% of the encapsulated antibiotics were released from the gold nanoparticle-stabilized liposomes and bacterial growth was effectively inhibited by the released antibiotics in 24 h. The second area is to demonstrate an application of the invented technology to treat acne vulgaris by delivering therapeutics to the acne -causing bacteria, named Propionibacterium acnes (P.acnes). First, lauric acid (LA), an antimicrobial with strong activity against P. acnes, is encapsulated in liposomes (LipoLA), which is shown to effectively kill the bacteria by fusion with the bacterial membrane, resulting in a direct insertion of LA molecules to the membrane and destruction of its surface structure in vitro and in vivo. The system is then further improved by the acid-responsive technology based on the fact that the acne lesions on human skin are typically acidic. Demonstrated by fluorescent and antimicrobial experiments, the bound gold nanoparticles effectively prevent LipoLA from fusing with one another at neutral pH value. However, at acidic condition, the gold particles detach from LipoLA surface, allowing the fusion with P.acnes membrane and lauric acid delivery, resulting in a complete killing effect. The stimuli-responsive liposomes presented here provide a new, safe, and effective approach to treat bacterial infections. They can be broadly applied to treat a variety of infections caused by bacteria that reside in acidic environment and secrete pore-forming toxins

Nanoscale contact engineering for Si/Silicide nanowire devices
Metal silicides have been used in silicon technology as contacts to achieve high device performance and desired device functions. The growth and applications of silicide materials have recently attracted increasing interest for nanoscale device applications. Nanoscale silicide materials have been demonstrated with various synthetic approaches. Solid state reaction wherein high quality silicides form through diffusion of metal atoms into silicon nano-templates and the subsequent phase transformation caught significant attention for the fabrication of nanoscale Si devices. Very interestingly, studies on the diffusion and phase transformation processes at nanoscale have indicated possible deviations from the bulk and the thin film system. Here we studied growth kinetics, electronic properties and device applications of nanoscale silicides formed through solid state reaction.    We have grown single crystal PtSi nanowires and PtSi/Si/PtSi nanowire heterostructures through solid state reaction. TEM studies show that the heterostructures have atomically sharp interfaces free of defects. Electrical measurement of PtSi nanowires shows a low resistivity of &#8764;28.6 &#956;&#937;*cm and a high breakdown current density beyond 108 A/cm2. Furthermore, using single-crystal PtSi/Si/PtSi nanowire heterostructures with atomically clean interfaces, we have fabricated p-channel enhancement mode transistors with the best reported performance for intrinsic silicon nanowires to date.  In our results, silicide can provide a clean and no Fermi level pinning interface and then silicide can form Ohmic-contact behavior by replacing the source/drain metal with PtSi. It has been proven by our experiment by contacting PtSi with intrinsic Si nanowires (no extrinsic doping) to achieve high performance p-channel device.    By utilizing the same approach, single crystal MnSi nanowires and MnSi/Si/MnSi nanowire heterojunction with atomically sharp interfaces can also been grown. Electrical transport studies on MnSi nanowire shows an abrupt resistance reduction due to the spin ordering at ~29.7 K. A negative magnetoresistance (MR) ~1.8% under 5 Tesla at 1.6 K is achieved, demonstrating the ferromagnetic behavior of MnSi. Furthermore, using the MnSi/p-Si/MnSi heterostructure, we have studied the charge injection at various temperatures via the Schottky barrier, and the spin scattering was observed through magnetotransport studies of MnSi/p-Si/MnSi heterojunction. Our results represent the first report of magnetic contact fabrication through the formation of single crystal heterojunction nanowires and the first demonstration of spin injection and detection in such Si nanowire devices. The magnetic silicides approach thus opens a new pathway to create ferromagnetic/semiconductor junction with clean and sharp interface, and maysignificantly impact the future of spintronics.    Beyond those applications, silicide phase control at nanoscale is investigated. Three nickel phases, Ni31Si12, Ni2Si and NiSi2 are observed in one step annealing at 550 oC. NiSi2 grows initially through the Si NW and then the area close to nickel pad transforms into the nickel-rich phase, Ni31Si12. With prolonged annealing over 5 minutes, the Ni2Si starts to show up in between Ni31Si12 and NiSi2. The growth sequence is different from the thin film system where Ni2Si usually appears as the initial phase in the beginning as the annealing temperature is higher than 400 oC. Interfacial energy differences and surface free energy are believed to play an important role here at the nanoscale, which lead to the formation of normally unfavorable silicide phases in Si NWs. In addition, Si/SiOx core/shell NW structure is used to explore the phase transformation of silicides in the structure-confined nano environment. Nickel silicides in the structure-confined core/shell Si NW shares the similar phase formation sequences as those appeared in the bared SiNWs, while the growth rate is significantly retarded. This may be attributed to the high compressive stress built-in in the core/shell NW structure that retards the diffusion of the nickel atom as well as limits the volume expansion of the metal-rich phases. As a result, the high stress at this finite scale hinders the continuous growth of Ni31Si12 into the core/shell NWs and totally eliminates the formation of Ni2Si in core/shell NWs with thick oxide shells (~ 50 nm). Through these studies, we have demonstrated first time the phase formation sequences of nickel silicides in Si and Si/SiOx NW structures, which is of great importance for reliable contact engineering for Si NW devices. Furthermore, we have provided a clear picture of the hindered nickel silicide growth in confined nanoscale environment and showed the deviated behavior of silicides growth under stress. The information rendered here will be useful for Si NW device applications as well as for the silicon device engineering at nanoscale in general.     To further investigate the oxide shell effect, Mn5Si3 and Fe5Ge3 NW were grown within various oxide thickness to explore the nucleation and growth in the nanowire structure. A oxide shell exerted a compressive stress on the silicide or germanide materials will make those materials with single-crystal properties. Interestingly, single-crystal growth of contact materials can be also implemented for germanide materials. The iron-rich germanide, Fe5Ge3, was successfully grown with single-crystal properties. It shows ferromagnetic properties with a Curie temperature above the room temperature verified by magnetic force microscope (MFM). Two different epitaxial relations found at germanide/germanium interface due to the different sizes of the germanium NW templates. These two different crystal structures exhibited magnetic anisotropy in magnetic force microscope (MFM) measurement, showing differently preferred domain orientations. In-plane and out-of-plane magnetization in the Fe5Ge3 NWs are observed in our experiment. The crystal orientation or engineering stress may have influence on the magnetic domain structure. This ferromagnetic contact material may open the way for spintronics to grow the magnetic materials on the semiconducting materials and control the direction of magnetization in the future.    Those silicide studies indicated silicide metal-heterojunction field effect transistor has excellent device performance. In addition, Si channel region can be shrunk to less than 10 nm and also keep semiconducting properties without high leakage current. This approach has the potential for future nanoelectronics. However, silicide phase transformation shows a deviated behavior from the studies in bulk system. It may be associated with stress effect or nucleation behavior at nanosclae, leading the different formation phase or sequence. For those interesting phenomena, it has attracted more and more attention and may gain more insight studies in the near future.

P-type ATPase analysis in cyanobacteria and six miscellaneous bacterial phyla with fully sequenced genomes
Nine cyanobacteria and 14 genera of bacteria from six phyla, with fully sequenced genomes, were analyzed for genes encoding P-type ATPase catalytic alpha-subunits. These miscellaneous phylas are Aquificae, Chlamydia, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus and Thermotogae. In cyanobacteria 59 such proteins were identified, and in the miscellaneous phyla, a total of 31 ATPases were identified. The P-type ATPase representation in genomes of closely related species was greatly varied, suggesting a gain or loss of genes. Along with the examined phyla, an integrative approach was taken to examine the P-type ATPase representation across all the major kingdoms of life. The Clustal X and TreeView programs were used to construct multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, respectively. The families of proteins identified were either functionally characterized or previously uncharacterized. The alignments of the families were then used to examine motif conservation. Novel toplogies were discovered for families unique to both the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes, while the known toplogoical types were reinforced by the integrative approach to the research. The constructed 16S rRNA trees were used along with the family trees to gain evidence for orthology, and further shed light on the evolutionary descendency of the proteins. The same approaches taken at the individual phyla level were then applied to the integrated data. Overall, these studies reveal the nature of cyanobacterial P-type ATPases, and the ATPases from the six miscellaneous phyla. The integrated approach was also used to reinforce known ideas about the proteins as they are represented across the major kindgoms of life, and also to reveal novel information about the P-type ATPase proteins in general

How would I know that this could be my fate : transcriptional regulation of specification and differentiation in the Drosophila mechanosensory organ lineage
Molecular and genetic studies over the past two decades have established that animals ranging from the fruit fly to the human utilize a common "toolkit" of genes to create the myriad cell types during development. For even some of the most well studied developmental paradigms, however, little is known of the transcriptional regulatory networks activated by these core components. Moreover, how these networks manifest the initial cell fate decision remains a rigorous topic of investigation. The Drosophila melanogaster mechanosensory organ lineage has long been a model for binary cell fate specification mechanisms. While it is well-established that the Notch signaling pathway is the dominant cell fate specification mechanism in this lineage, little is known of the battery of genes downstream of the canonical pathway components that enforce the cell fate decision. In this body of work I analyze the Notch signaling events at opposite ends of the lineage with the specification of the mechanosensory organ precursor cell (SOP) at the beginning and the post-mitotic socket and shaft cells at the penultimate of the lineage. These studies focus on the transcriptional regulation of three genes, neuralized, Sox15 and sv. I utilize a number of loss of function mutants, misexpression studies, and transgenic reporter constructs to identify enhancer modules and tease out their regulatory factors. Chapter 2 comprises an analysis of the transcriptional regulation of neuralized during SOP specification where I present evidence that neuralized is both a participant in and a target of Notch signaling, requiring two partially redundant. Chapter 3 focuses on the transcriptional regulation and function of Sox15, a transcription factor specifically expressed in the post-mitotic socket cell. I show that Sox15 is a target of Notch signaling in the socket cell and is required for the proper differentiation of the socket cell as it relates to mechanosensory function. Chapter 4 dovetails off Sox15 and examines regulation of sv in the shaft cell, where I find the dominant theme is auto-regulation. Lastly, Chapter 5 describes the development of a new transgenic reporter system I developed for the rapid screening of genomic fragments for enhancer activity.

Electrochemical Synthesis and Characterization of Nanostructured Chalcogenide Materials
Nanostructured materials have attracted extensive attention due to their small dimension and enhanced properties compared to bulk materials, and their large range of potential applications in energy harvesting devices. Among these materials, nanostructured chalcogenides play an important role in thermoelectric and solar cell devices. Electrochemical techniques have drawn attention as an improved method for synthesizing nanostructured chalcogenide materials, since they provide a cost-effective, simple, and versatile method for depositing various kind of chalcogenides with tunable nanostructures and properties.The overall objective of this dissertation work is to develop the following electrochemical techniques: 1)	to synthesize nanostructured chalcogenide materials (<italic>e.g.</italic> Bi<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>, Pb<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> and Cd<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>) with well-controlled dimensions, surface morphologies and compositions2)	to systematically investigate the effect of experimental parameters on their nanostructures3)	to characterize their tunable properties4)	and ultimately to establish a guidance of experimental design for further synthesis of other nanostructured chalcogenide materials. In this dissertation, the viability of using electrochemical methods for synthesizing nanostructured three chalcogenide materials - Bismuth telluride (Bi<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>) Lead telluride (Pb<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>) and Cadmium telluride (Cd<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub>) was tested. An easy way to tune their size (nano to micro), surface morphology (from novel nanostructures to nanoparticles and core/shell hybrid nanostructure) and composition (excess either electropositive element or chalcogens) by tailoring the electrochemical parameters such as electrolyte composition, type and thickness of sacrificial materials, and reaction time of electrochemical techniques, including electrodeposition (ED) and galvanic displacement (GD), was demonstrated.

Chemo-sensors development based on low-dimensional codoped Mn2O3-ZnO nanoparticles using flat-silver electrodes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Semiconductor doped nanostructure materials have attained considerable attention owing to their electronic, opto-electronic, para-magnetic, photo-catalysis, electro-chemical, mechanical behaviors and their potential applications in different research areas. Doped nanomaterials might be a promising owing to their high-specific surface-area, low-resistances, high-catalytic activity, attractive electro-chemical and optical properties. Nanomaterials are also scientifically significant transition metal-doped nanostructure materials owing to their extraordinary mechanical, optical, electrical, electronic, thermal, and magnetic characteristics. Recently, it has gained significant interest in manganese oxide doped-semiconductor materials in order to develop their physico-chemical behaviors and extend their efficient applications. It has not only investigated the basic of magnetism, but also has huge potential in scientific features such as magnetic materials, bio- &amp; chemi-sensors, photo-catalysts, and absorbent nanomaterials.
				
				
					
						Results
					The chemical sensor also displays the higher-sensitivity, reproducibility, long-term stability, and enhanced electrochemical responses. The calibration plot is linear (r2 = 0.977) over the 0.1 nM to 50.0 &#956;M 4-nitrophenol concentration ranges. The sensitivity and detection limit is ~4.6667 &#956;A cm-2 &#956;M-1 and ~0.83 &#177; 0.2 nM (at a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio, SNR of 3) respectively. To best of our knowledge, this is the first report for detection of 4-nitrophenol chemical with doped Mn2O3-ZnO NPs using easy and reliable I-V technique in short response time.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					As for the doped nanostructures, NPs are introduced a route to a new generation of toxic chemo-sensors, but a premeditate effort has to be applied for doped Mn2O3-ZnO NPs to be taken comprehensively for large-scale applications, and to achieve higher-potential density with accessible to individual chemo-sensors. In this report, it is also discussed the prospective utilization of Mn2O3-ZnO NPs on the basis of carcinogenic chemical sensing, which could also be applied for the detection of hazardous chemicals in ecological, environmental, and health care fields.

The glucocorticoid receptor dimer interface allosterically transmits sequence-specific DNA signals
Glucocorticoid receptor binds to genomic response elements and regulates gene transcription with cell- and gene-specificity. Within a response element, the precise sequence to which the receptor binds has been implicated in directing its structure and activity. We use NMR chemical shift difference mapping to show that non-specific interactions with particular base positions within the binding sequence, such as those of the “spacer”, affect the conformation of distinct regions of the rat glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain. These regions include the DNA-binding surface, the “lever arm” and the dimerization interface, suggesting an allosteric pathway that signals between the DNA binding sequence and the associated dimer partner. Disrupting this path by mutating the dimer interface alters sequence-specific conformations, DNA-binding kinetics and transcriptional activity. Our study demonstrates that glucocorticoid receptor dimer partners collaborate to read DNA shape and to direct sequence specific gene activity.

Discovery and characterization of the mechanisms of a vaccinia viral Bcl-2 homolog, F1L, on Inhibition of caspase-9 and NLRP1
The innate immune system detects invading pathogens and provides immediate response to eliminate pathogens and infected cells, and to trigger secondary immune response to inhibit infection. Programmed cell death (Apoptosis) and cytokine secretion, which are mediated by activation of different caspase-family protease cascades, are examples of the numerous mechanisms of our innate immunity against viral infections. Nonetheless, the virus has evolved a variety of strategies to cope with the anti- viral responses of the host. In this dissertation, I discovered that the vaccinia virus (VACV)-encoded Bcl-2 homologue, F1L, directly inhibits caspase-9, the apical caspase in the mitochondrial cell death pathway, and NLRP1 (also known as NALP1), one of the inflammasome proteins that facilitates caspase-1 activation and cytokine secretion. We provide multiple lines of evidence that F1L directly and selectively binds and suppresses caspase-9 and NLRP1. In cells, F1L specifically represses caspase-9- dependent apoptosis and NLRP1-dependent IL-1Beta secretion. We identified two conserved motifs at the N- terminus of F1L preceding the Bcl-2-like domain by mutagenesis studies that are responsible for interaction and inhibition of caspase-9 and NLRP1, respectively. I further show that two short peptides derived from these motifs are sufficient to inhibit caspase-9 and NLRP1, respectively. Moreover, F1L is critical for suppression of caspase-1 activation and IL-1Beta secretion during VACV infection in macrophage cultures. In mice, I show that F1L is a prominent virulence factor that inhibits cytokine secretion upon VACV infection. In summary, we revealed two novel functions of F1L that are important for the virulence of VACV. F1L is the first caspase-9 inhibitor that is a Bcl-2-like protein, and the first example of viral protein inhibitor of the NLRP family protein

Fate, Transport, and Removal of Engineered Nanomaterials in the Aquatic Environment
The overall goal of this research was to identify the mechanisms involved in the fate, transport, and removal of nanomaterials in both natural and engineered systems. The project was developed based upon the hypothesis that nanomaterial properties (type, size, shape) and environmental parameters including solution chemistry (pH, ionic strength, and ion valence), as well as the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and bacteria will control the transport and removal of nanomaterials. Nine different nanomaterials were used including three metal oxides, three sizes of TiO<sub>2</sub> and three types of single walled carbon nanotubes(SWNTs).  Wide variation in physicochemical properties among these nanomaterials allowed the comparison with respect to size, shape, type, and synthesis method.  Complementary transport studies were conducted in both macroscopic (column) and microscopic (flow cells) systems.  This dissertation work has allowed for the following critical observations to be made.  Sonication, nanoparticle concentration and solution chemistry can significantly alter physicochemical properties of metal oxide nanoparticles to ensure reproducible dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles for transport and toxicity studies.  Transport of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (TNPs) through macroscopic porous media showed that a combination of mechanisms including straining, blocking, DLVO and hydrodynamic forces were involved.  Additionally experiments in the parallel plate chamber indicated that deposition of TNPs was controlled by a combination of DLVO and non-DLVO-type forces, aggregation, shear and gravitational forces.  Also,  the presence of both NOM and bacteria resulted in much less deposition than NOM or bacteria alone, indicating a combination of factors involved in deposition including electrosteric, electrostatic effects, and aggregation state of TNPs and TNP-bacteria.  Another study with three distinctly sized TNPs revealed that heterogeneity in the nanoparticle aggregate - due to its composition of primary nanoparticles - plays a significant role in the transport and aggregate breakup.  Finally, SWNTs synthesized by different methods resulted in distinctive breakthrough curves due to catalysts used in synthesis, whereas metal content of SWNTs affects the relative elution of SWNTs through column.  This collection of studies suggests that consideration of these mechanisms is necessary to improve our ability to predict fate, transport and removal nanomaterials in the aquatic environments as well as set-up environmental regulations.

Inhibitory circuits in the olfactory cortex
In sensory areas of cortex, inhibitory neurons play a critical role in regulating the activity of principal cells in space and time. The diversity of intrinsic electrical properties and connectivity patterns among inhibitory cells suggests that different cell types contribute specific functions to the processing of sensory information by cortical circuits. In pyramidal cells of primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, odors evoke widespread and broadly-tuned inhibition, but the cells producing this inhibition are not known. Here, using acute slices of piriform cortex, we identify three inhibitory circuits that are recruited by activation of sensory afferents and act over distinct spatial and temporal domains. We find that physiologically realistic burst stimulation of mitral and tufted (M/T) cell axons results in early but transient dendritic inhibition progressing to somatic feedback inhibition in pyramidal cells of piriform cortex. Interneurons in layer 1a (L1a) receive highly convergent M/T cell input and govern feedforward inhibition onto the dendrites, but short-term synaptic depression decreases their influence as the burst progresses. Dendritic inhibition from L1a interneurons is branch-specific and locally blocks the calcium transients associated with back-propagating action potentials. The late-onset feedback inhibitory circuit is composed of layer 3 (L3) fast-spiking and low threshold-spiking cells that target pyramidal cell bodies and basal dendrites. L3 interneurons are highly interconnected with local pyramidal cells and we demonstrate that activation of pyramidal cells leads to recurrent inhibition that dominates excitation. Our results reveal the diversity of inhibitory circuits in olfactory cortex and suggest that separate classes of interneurons may have distinct functional roles regulating spike timing, odor tuning, and plasticity. This work defines a basic set of features by which inhibitory circuits can be identified in piriform cortex and demonstrates a diversity of functional roles played by distinct interneuron cell types. Our findings offer testable hypotheses regarding the influence of specific inhibitory circuits in olfactory information processing and odor representations in the piriform cortex

Isoperimetric profile of algebras
The main topic of this thesis is the isoperimetric profile of algebras, introduced by Gromov in 21. This is an asymptotic geometric invariant of algebras which has a strong connection with the property of amenability. We pursue a systematic study of this invariant, which will lead us to new insights into the phenomenon of amenability of algebras. Also, we show the connections of the isoperimetric profile with other invariant of algebras, like the GK-dimension, the growth and the lower transcendence degree. We will use our tools to provide answers to some questions on these topics

The biomechanical basis of DNA breakage in chronic myelogenous leukemia
Chronic myelogenous leukemia, a cancer of white blood cells, is characterized by a chromosome translocation between ABL and BCR due to their close proximity during BCR replication. Twenty seven DNA breakpoints are within a major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR), but why these breakpoints are clustered remains unclear. Initially, a Monte-Carlo algorithm calculating the sequence-dependent bending energy was used to position nucleosomes simultaneously in (M-BCR). MNase digestion followed by adapter-mediated PCR was then used to map experimentally the nucleosome boundaries. The discrepancy prompted the development of a replication-directed (RD) algorithm predicting nucleosome positions from the replication origin, one after another, each at the local minimum of bending energy. The better agreement confirms the spatial and temporal importance in nucleosome assembly in vivo. Therefore, a stepwise model for coupled nucleosome disassembly/reassembly across a replication fork was proposed: Unwinding of DNA by helicases may generate positive superhelical tension to facilitate the disassembly of downstream nucleosomes, which in turn may facilitate the reassembly of upstream nucleosomes. The latter may include a DNA loop formation followed by a sequential closing of two DNA arms around each histone core. Chromatin conformation capturing PCR, involving cross-linking, AluI digestion, re-ligation and PCR, preserved the core DNA conformation in 3-D and confirmed a 292-bp nucleosome-excluded region (A-rich region) containing a stretch of 17 consecutive A (17-A). Nineteen breakpoints are upstream from this region: 6 are clustered immediately upstream to the 17-A, and 10 out of 13 further upstream ones are spread in 4 nucleosome cores. It is likely that (1) the long A-rich region may extrude from the chromatin fiber or form an empty loop or other unusual secondary structures, which may experience greater mechanical stress locally without the "protection" of a histone core; (2) DNA in the newly reassembled nucleosome cores upstream to the A-rich region may lose histone cores under mechanical stress or in a stalled replication. These mechanisms may account for most of the M-BCR breakpoints and at least two other diseases caused by chromosome translocation, suggesting a functional role for the histone core as a "uniform curvature controller" to minimize the DNA breakage

Longitudinal in vitro surveillance of Plasmodium
falciparum sensitivity to common anti-malarials in
Thailand between 1994 and 2010
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Drug and multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has existed in Thailand for several decades. Furthermore, Thailand serves as a sentinel for drug-resistant malaria within the Greater Mekong sub-region. However, the drug resistance situation is highly dynamic, changing quickly over time. Here parasite in vitro drug sensitivity is reported for artemisinin derivatives, mefloquine, chloroquine and quinine, across Thailand.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Blood was drawn from patients infected with P. falciparum in seven sentinel provinces along Thai international borders with Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Malaysia. In vitro parasite sensitivity was tested using the World Health Organization&#8217;s microtest (mark III) (between 1994 and 2002) and the histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (in 2010). Following World Health Organization protocol, at least 30 isolates were collected for each province and year represented in this study. Where possible, t-tests were used to test for significant differences.
				
				
					
						Results
					There appears to be little variation across study sites with regard to parasite sensitivity to chloroquine. Quinine resistance appears to have been rising prior to 1997, but has subsequently decreased. Mefloquine sensitivity appears high across the provinces, especially along the north-western border with Myanmar and the eastern border with Cambodia. Finally, the data suggest that parasite sensitivity to artemisinin and its derivatives is significantly higher in provinces along the north-western border with Myanmar.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Parasite sensitivity to anti-malarials in Thailand is highly variable over time and largely mirrors official drug use policy. The findings with regard to reduced sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives are supported by recent reports of reduced parasite clearance associated with artemisinin. This trend is alarming since artemisinin is considered the last defence against malaria. Continued surveillance in Thailand, along with increased collaboration and surveillance across the entire Greater Mekong sub-region, is clearly warranted.

Influence of soil permeability on liquefaction-induced lateral pile response
Pile foundations have been significantly damaged by liquefaction-induced lateral spreading during earthquakes. There are large uncertainties regarding the effects of various soil properties on this pattern of soil-structure interaction. The main concern of this study is to numerically investigate the role of soil permeability in such lateral spreading scenarios. Through extensive calibration, finite element analysis models were developed in which the response reasonably matched experimental data from shake-table testing and centrifuge testing. The overall impact of permeability on the soil stratum and the pile response was similar for both situations. In most cases, soil displacement increased with increasing permeability, while pile load decreased

This study examined the relationships between acculturative stress, social-emotional resiliency, ethnic identity, and academic outcomes. A total of 78 middle and high school students from two different schools in California participated in this study during the 2010-2011 school year.  Students reported on their perceived levels of acculturative stress, social-emotional resiliency, and ethnic idenity. Academic data (reading fluency, GPA, and scores on state tests) were collected for all participants.  A significant negative correlation was found between acculturative stress and social-emotional resiliency, suggesting that students with higher levels of acculturative stress tend to have lower levels of social-emotional resiliency. No other significant relationships were found between the variables being analyzed, however several limitations to pursuing research in this area were identified.

Off-road obstacle classification and traversability analysis in the presence of negative obstacles
In order for an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to drive in off-road terrain at high speeds, it must analyze and understand its surrounding terrain in real- time; it must know where it intends to go, where are the obstacles, and many details of the topography of the terrain. Much research has been done in the way of obstacle avoidance, terrain classification, and path planning, Yet few UGV systems can effectively traverse off -road environments at high speeds autonomously. This paper presents algorithms that analyze off-road terrain using a point cloud produced by a 3D laser rangefinder, determine potential obstacles both above ground and those where the ground cover has a negative slope (negative obstacles), then plan safe routes around those obstacles. To classify negative obstacles, this research uses a combination of a geometry-based method called the Negative Obstacle DetectoR (NODR) and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The terrain is analyzed with respect to a large UGV with the sensor mounted up high as well as a small UGV with the sensor mounted low to the ground

Molecular identification of microorganisms associated with the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Prior research on the microorganisms associated with the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, has mainly been limited to culture-based identification techniques or feeding studies for aquaculture. Our objective was to identify bacteria and archaea associated with Artemia adults and encysted embryos to understand the role of microbes in the Artemia life cycle and, therefore, their importance in a hypersaline food chain.
				
				
					
						Results
					We used small subunit (SSU) 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to identify bacteria and archaea associated with adults and encysted Artemia embryos from one of their natural environments &#8211; Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, USA. We found that bacterial sequences most closely related to the genera Halomonas and Vibrio were commonly extracted from GSL adult Artemia, while bacterial sequences most similar to the genera Halomonas, Psychroflexus and Alkalilimnicola dominate in GSL water. Encysted embryos (cysts) yielded bacterial sequences from the genera Idiomarina and Salinivibrio, which were absent from adults and water. Common archaeal sequences in adults were most closely related to the genera Haloterrigena and Haloarcula, while all of the archaeal sequences from GSL water were most similar to the genus Halogeometricum. Cyst derived archaeal sequences were most closely related to the genera Halorubrum and Haloarcula.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					In addition to identifying microbial rRNA sequences that are specific to different stages of the Artemia life cycle, we observed striking differences in the sequences associated with the adult Artemia population in samples collected from GSL at different times and locations. While our study was limited in scope and the sample was small, our findings provide a foundation for future research into how the bacteria and archaea associated with Artemia influence the Artemia life cycle, and GSL food web.

Synthesis and Applications of Dirhodium Metallopeptides
The work describes the development of a new class of synthetic metallopeptides that features a dirhodium metal center. Combination of peptide and dirhodium properties leads to unique effects on peptide structure, peptide-protein interactions, and metal catalytic activity aimed at small molecule as well as protein substrates. Dirhodium is directly bound to carboxylate side chains of aspartate or glutamate yielding kinetically inert coordination complexes. This improves stability, allows purification and provides enhanced biocompatibility. Bridging of two side chains in the same sequence enables control of the peptide secondary structure. Dirhodium metallopeptides are applied to regulate coiled coil dimerization, stabilize and induce helical secondary structure, catalyze enantioselective organometallic transformation, and serve as ligands for proteins. These results lead to the development of hybrid organic-inorganic therapeutic agents, biological probes for study of protein-protein interactions, and enantioselective metallopeptide catalysis.

GAISE and many school curriculum reforms around the world aim to enhance the process of statistical inquiry across the curriculum from a very early age and to make young students statistically literate. To improve understanding of the data gathering process, its purposes and benefits to society, taking advantage of students’ interests outside the classroom to engage them in data gathering about themselves and bringing their data back to the classroom is an alternative that teachers could explore further. In this paper, we explore how the SOCCER4Stats innovative activities of Statistics South Africa could be integrated into our school’s path towards statistical literacy. The paper describes the SOCCER4Stats activities for youth and prior use of them in the International Statistical Literacy Project. The paper also assesses the incidence of interest of soccer among youth in the U.S. Discussion of the use of these activities to implement the Common Core Standards in a consistent way with GAISE is also presented.

Song Structure and Function of Mimicry in the Australian Magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen): Compared to Lyrebird (Menura ssp.)
This paper compares two species of songbird with the aim of elucidating 
      the function of song and also of mimicry. It attempts to understand why some birds 
      mimic and takes as examples the lyrebird (Menura sp.) and the Australian magpie 
      {Gymnorhina tibicen). Mimicry by the magpie and its development has been recorded 
      and analysed. The results show that magpies mimic in the wild and they do so 
      mimicking species permanently settled in their own territory. So far 15 types of 
      mimicry have been identified. One handraised Australian magpie even developed the 
      ability to vocalise human language sounds, words and phrases. Results show that 
      mimicry is interspersed into their own song at variable rates, not in fixed sequences as 
      in lyrebirds. In one case it was possible to show an extremely high retention rate of 
      learned material and a high plasticity for learning. Spectrogram comparisons of 
      sequences of mimicry with the calls of the original species, and comparison of magpie 
      mimicry with lyrebird mimicry is made. Both species may justifiably vie for the 
      position of the foremost songbirds of Australia, and both are territorial, yet the function, 
      structure and development of song are different in the two species. It is argued that 
      possible functions of mimicry are related not only to social organisation but also to the 
      niche each species occupies. Territoriality may go some way to explaining the 
      complexity of song but not necessarily the different functions of mimicry or the varying 
      degrees of complexity of communication. We need to ask what conditions may foster 
      development of complex communication patterns in avian species.

Dynamics of the L-fucose/H+ symporter revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy
The transmembrane protein FucP of Escherichia coli is a symporter that catalyzes the cotransport of L-fucose and H+ across cytoplasmic membrane, and a crystal structure in an outward-facing conformation has been reported. However, nothing is known about FucP conformational dynamics. Here, it is shown that addition of L-fucose to purified FucP in detergent induces ~20% quenching of tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner without a shift in &#955;max. Quenching is essentially abolished when both Trp38 and Trp278, which are positioned on opposing faces of the outward-facing cavity walls, are replaced with tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe), and reduced quenching is observed when either Trp is mutated. Therefore, both Trp residues are involved in the phenomenon. Furthermore, replacement of either Trp38 or Trp278, predominantly Trp38, causes decreased quenching, decreased apparent affinity for L-fucose and significant inhibition of active L-fucose transport, indicating that the two residues are likely involved directly in sugar binding. It is proposed that sugar binding induces a conformational change in which the outward-facing cavity in FucP closes, thereby bringing Trp38 and Trp278 into close proximity around the bound sugar to form an `occluded' intermediate.  The unique location of these two Trp residues provides a novel method for analyzing structural dynamics in FucP.

Vulnerability of a subarctic barrier spit to global warming induced changes in storm surge and wave runup: Shaktoolik, Alaska
The native Inupiaq community of Shaktoolik, in northwestern Alaska, is located on a low-lying barrier spit in Norton Sound.  The inhabited portion of the spit is 7.1 m above MLLW at its highest and only ~200 m across.  The community is vulnerable to marine flooding on both the open ocean and lagoon sides of the spit during large storms.  Storm events in this region typically occur during the fall and winter months, often when the coastline is protected from flooding and erosion by shorefast ice.  High latitudes are experiencing the greatest increases in temperature due to global warming and the reduced duration and extent of sea ice is affecting Alaskan coastal communities.  Continued reduction of sea ice, which typically protects the coastline from exposure during large storm events in late fall and winter, may result in the need to relocate many Native Alaskan coastal settlements.The goal of this study was to quantify changes in storm surge and wave runup during ice-free months for the mid- to late-21st century.  A combination of field data, including beach profiles, offshore bathymetry, debris line position, and sediment grain size, as well as modeled meteorological data were used to address the research goals.  An analytical approach was developed to quantify storm surge in Alaskan coastal communities with historical meteorological data from the North American Regional Reanalysis.  This analytical model was used to calculate projected storm surge flooding levels in Shaktoolik for the mid- and late-21st century for both a moderate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively), with meteorological output from the MIROC5 global climate model.  Additionally, projected wave runup heights during storm events were determined numerically using WAVEWATCH III to calculate wave height and period from the projected MIROC5 meteorological data and SBEACH to model the maximum runup heights along the Shaktoolik shoreline.Total storm water levels (storm surge plus wave runup height) were calculated for 236 projected storm events in the Bering Sea and used to find the return periods of flooding for each emissions scenario.  When compared to modeled historic storm surge, the results show that the moderate emissions scenario is similar to the historical.  The 100-yr surge level is +6.3 m above MLLW for the moderate emissions scenario and +6.1 m historically.  The high emissions scenario produces lower storm frequency than the moderate emissions scenario and the return periods of flooding for storm surge are lower than the historical values, the 100-yr surge level is +5.0 m.  When wave setup and runup are included in the total flood levels the 100-yr flood level is +10.2 m above MLLW for the moderate emissions scenario and +8.7 m for the high emissions scenario, compared to +10.4 m historically.  All three of these flooding levels overtop the highest ground elevation in the community.

Impact of DNA damage proteins on the adenoviral lifecycle
Viruses manipulate the cellular environment to promote productive infection. Cells mount anti-viral defenses to combat and limit viral productivity. Viruses in turn either hijack the anti-viral responses or inactivate them in order to overcome cellular defenses. Adenovirus (Ad) has been shown to inactivate the cellular DNA damage response by targeting the sensor for DNA damage, the MRN complex (composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1). Our lab has shown that the adenoviral E1B55K/E4orf6 complex and E4orf3 proteins inactivate MRN. E1B55K/E4orf6 promote the degradation of the MRN complex, while E4orf3 mislocalizes MRN into intranuclear tracks. Infection with adenovirus lacking the E4 region is less productive than wild type Ad5 infection and fails to inactivate MRN, which results in activation of the DNA damage response and concatemerization of viral genomes. The impact of the DNA damage response proteins on the viral lifecycle was not well understood. The work presented in this thesis provides evidence that the DNA damage response proteins negatively affect the adenoviral lifecycle at multiple stages. Using mutants of E1B55K, we found that degradation of MRN requires distinct domains of E1B55K and promotes viral late protein synthesis. We demonstrated that production of viral late proteins occurs independently of concatemer formation. Using hypomorphic cell lines we have found that the MRN complex negatively impacts viral DNA replication independently of both concatemer formation and signaling by DNA damage response kinases, ATM and ATR. We concluded that the viral proteins E1B55K, E4orf6, and E4orf3, promote viral DNA replication by inactivating the MRN complex. Additionally, we found that ATR signaling, but not ATM signaling, negatively impacts the accumulation of late viral mRNA during Deltaviral infection. We believe that the DNA damage response has multiple ways to limit adenoviral infection and that the virus has evolved strategies to inactivate these responses. Our data elucidate the anti-viral activity of the MRN complex during adenoviral infection, and provides further insight into the functions of MRN and ATR signaling

Dichroic coherent diffractive imaging
Understanding electronic structure at nanometer resolution is crucial to understanding physics such as phase separation and emergent behavior in correlated electron materials. Nondestructive probes which have the ability to see beyond surfaces on nanometer length and sub-picosecond time scales can greatly enhance our understanding of these systems and will impact development of future technologies, such as magnetic storage. Polarized x-rays are an appealing choice of probe due to their penetrating power, elemental and magnetic specificity, and high spatial resolution. The resolution of traditional x-ray microscopy is limited by the nanometer precision required to fabricate x-ray optics. In this thesis, a novel approach to lensless imaging of an extended magnetic nanostructure is presented. We demonstrate this approach by imaging ferrimagnetic "maze" domains in a Gd/Fe multilayer with perpendicular anisotropy. A series of dichroic coherent diffraction patterns, ptychographically recorded, are numerically inverted using non-convex and non-linear optimization theory, and we follow the magnetic domain configuration evolution through part of its magnetization hysteresis loop by applying an external magnetic field. Unlike holographic methods, it does not require a reference wave or precision optics, and so is a far simpler experiment. In addition, it enables the imaging of samples with arbitrarily large spatial dimensions, at a spatial resolution limited solely by the coherent x-ray flux and wavelength. It can readily be extended to other non-magnetic systems that exhibit circular or linear dichroism. This approach is scalable to imaging with diffraction-limited resolution, a prospect rapidly becoming a reality in view of the new generation of phenomenally brilliant x-ray sources

Experimental Investigation of Cell Membrane Nano-mechanics and Plasma Membrane-Cytoskeletal Interactions Using Optical Tweezers
The mechanical properties of the cell components, cell plasma membrane and cytoskeleton, as well as membrane-cytoskeleton associations, determine the mechanical properties of the whole cell which is important in cellular shape change behavior and mechanical signal transduction in living cells. Examples of biologically important processes involving cellular shape changes are deformation of erythrocytes in capillaries, cell division, phagocytosis, pseudopodium and dendritic spine formation, and electromotility of the outer hair cells. This dissertation focuses on investigating the mechanical properties of the living cell plasma membrane and the local mechanical associations of the plasma membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton. Mechanical properties of the living cell plasma membrane are investigated by forming membrane nanotubes (tethers) from human embryonic kidney cells using optical tweezers technique. In order to analyze the role of membrane composition on its nano-mechanical properties, the membrane cholesterol content, the major lipid component of the plasma membrane, is manipulated and the obtained membrane mechanical properties are correlated to the membrane cholesterol content. The results reveal significant effects of membrane cholesterol in specific, and membrane composition in general, on membrane nano-mechanical properties. Specifically, decreases in membrane cholesterol content were associated with increased plasma membrane equilibrium force, plasma membrane tether stiffness and plasma membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion energy per unit area. Elevation of the membrane cholesterol content was followed by lower membrane tether equilibrium force, lower stiffness values, and lower membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion energy. The membrane bending modulus was almost unchanged upon membrane cholesterol manipulations.  In order to discern the role of cell cytoskeleton on membrane mechanical properties the experiments were repeated after F-actin disruption and in control cell and cholesterol manipulated cells. The disruption of F-actin filaments showed a noticeable impact on the membrane mechanical properties and diminished the observed disparity in membrane mechanical properties upon cholesterol depletion and cholesterol enrichment. This dissertation also focuses on local cell deformations (protrusions). These deformations occur at an intermediate region between deformations at cell plasma membrane level and whole cell deformation, and are biologically important in formation of pseudopodia and filopodia, deformation of macrophages to engulf particles, and the surface protrusions on the cells preceding formation of membrane tethers. We used a combined optical tweezers-fluorescent microscopy technique to study cellular protrusions in adherent living cells. The mechanical properties of the protrusions were analyzed by obtaining the associated force-length plots and a Maxwell viscoelastic model is used to fit the force-length plots a. The experiments are performed on adherent human embryonic kidney cells, under cholesterol depleted and cholesterol enriched conditions to examine the effects of membrane cholesterol on protrusions. The experiments indicated greater maximum protrusion forces and shorter protrusion length under cholesterol depleted conditions in addition to greater values of the protrusion stiffness. Cholesterol enrichment experiments were associated with lower values of maximum protrusion force and protrusion stiffness, and formation of longer protrusions The observations suggest a significant contribution of the cytoskeletal F-actin filaments on the observed mechanical properties of protrusion regardless of membrane cholesterol content.

On the relationship between stress and elastic strain for porous and fractured rock
Modeling the mechanical deformations of porous and fractured rocks requires a stress–strain relationship. Experience with inherently heterogeneous earth materials suggests that different varieties of Hooke’s law should be applied within regions of the rock having significantly different stress–strain behavior. We apply this idea by dividing a rock body conceptually into two distinct parts. The natural strain (volume change divided by rock volume at the current stress state), rather than the engineering strain (volume change divided by the unstressed rock volume), should be used in Hooke’s law for accurate modeling of the elastic deformation of that part of the pore volume subject to a relatively large degree of relative deformation (i.e., cracks or fractures). This approach permits the derivation of constitutive relations between stress and a variety of mechanical and/or hydraulic rock properties. We show that the theoretical predictions of this method are generally consistent with empirical expressions (from field data) and also laboratory rock experimental data.

Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide by rhenium and manganese polypyridyl catalysts
The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to carbon monoxide (CO) is explored for both rhenium and manganese complexes. Electrochemistry, X-ray crystallography, Infrared spectroelectrochemistry, and stopped-flow kinetics are employed in order to identify catalysts and probe their mechanism and selectivity. Two catalysts in particular, Re(bipy-tBu)(CO₃(L) and Mn(bipy- tBu)(CO₃L (where bipy-tBu = 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'- bipyridine and L = Cl⁻, Br⁻ or (MeCN)(OTf)⁻), were studied extensively and displayed high activity, Faradaic efficiency, and selectivity for the reduction of CO₂ to CO. The Re-Cl catalyst exhibits a turnover frequency of > 200 s⁻¹, one of the fastest reported rates for a catalyst with appreciable turnover number. The Mn catalysts, when Brönsted acid sources are added to the electrochemical solution, exhibit current densities rivaling those of the Re-Cl catalyst. Amazingly, these catalysts showed high selectivity for CO₂ in both dry solvents and those with significant amounts of Brönsted acid added. Stopped-flow UV-Vis kinetics experiments showed that the reaction of the active form of the catalysts, M(bipy-tBu)(CO)₃⁻¹, is ca 50 times faster with CO₂ than they do with protons. Stopped-flow IR kinetics experiments comparing the reactions Re(bipy-tBu)(CO)₃⁻¹ with CO₂ and Re(bipy)(CO)₃⁻¹ with CO₂ shows, that at equal CO₂ concentrations, the bipy-tBu analog reacts ten times faster than the bipy analog. CO₂ also appears to react with both complexes via a concerted, two-electron oxidative addition of CO₂ to the metal center. The heterogenization of these catalysts was also explored with limited success. Intercalation, covalent bonds to gold, and covalent bonds to p-Si were all demonstrated, but none displayed activity towards the reduction of CO₂. Future experiments are suggested to solve this issue

Atomic and electronic structures of oxides on III-V semiconductors :
The surface reconstructions of decapped InAs(001) and In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001) have been studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Quantitative comparison of the In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2) and InAs(001)-(4x2) show the reconstructions are almost identical, but In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2) has at least a 4x higher surface defect density even on the best samples. For both In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2) and InAs(001)-(4x2), density functional theory (DFT) simulations at elevated temperature are consistent with the experimentally observed 300 K structure being a thermal superposition of three structures. The passivation of InAs(001) and InGaAs(001) surface using three different oxides (SiO, Ga₂O and In₂O) was studied using STM, STS, and DFT modeling of bonding and electronic structures. SiO molecules have higher self-binding energy so that they bond themselves and form nanoclusters on InAs(001)-(4x2) surface. Conversely, both Ga₂O and In₂O molecules bond to the As atoms at the edge of the rows. However, Ga2O molecules also bond to preexisting Ga₂O oxide on the surface. At full coverage with post-deposition annealing, SiO oxide remains as nanoclusters, Ga₂O oxide forms disordered structures with the large flat terraces on the surface, while In₂O oxide bonds with the trough In atoms to form new O-In bonding sites and forms ordered structures running in the 110 direction on In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2). STS results show that Ga₂O oxide does not passivate the interface nor unpin the In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2) surface consistent with its inability to form monolayer ordered islands on the surface; conversely, In₀.₅₃Ga₀.₄₇As(001)-(4x2) has an ordered monolayer coverage and is unpinned

Development of tools for the preparation of genomic libraries for next-generation sequencing
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to decrease the cost and time requirements for genomic sequencing by orders of magnitude. Investments in novel sequencing methods and improvements to existing next-generation sequencing platforms have resulted in much higher accuracy and lower cost-per-base for genomic sequencing using a variety of chemistries. However, one of the bottlenecks for all next- generation sequencing methods is the amount of time and resources required for template and library preparation. This process typically results in considerable sample loss and low throughput. Two of the steps that are in need of improvement are the fragmentation of long DNA strands and the amplification of fragmented genomes. To enable the creation of high quality genomic libraries, I have developed an automated device, based on a syringe pump, for the random fragmentation of genomic DNA. The length of the resulting fragments is tunable using a single parameter and the ends are easily repaired for the efficient ligation of adapters. I have also developed a method for the unbiased linear amplification of long DNA fragments using the concerted activities of a nicking endonuclease and a polymerase. The optimization of reaction conditions resulted in markedly better performance than existing similar protocols and I have demonstrated the utility of this method in amplifying a fragmented phage genome. I explored methods of using a highly specific homing endonuclease for use with this technique, including the incorporation of non-native nucleotides and the engineering of the enzyme's catalytic site. Lastly, I have made significant progress in efforts towards the engineering of the nuclease's DNA recognition residues in order to create a highly specific nicking enzyme for use in the modification or amplification of large genomes

Hail ice impact on composite structures at glancing angles
Aircraft structures are susceptible to damage due to high velocity hail ice impact. These impacts can create nonvisible damage in the structure, jeopardizing its structural integrity. Experiments were completed with simulated hail ice (SHI) impacting T800/3900-2 carbon/ epoxy tape laminates and aluminum panels at various angles. The angled impacts were similar to the normal impacts in the failure propagation of ice as well as the size and shape of the delaminations. Experimental failure threshold values were not in agreement with the trigonometric scaling of the failure threshold energy (FTE) or the failure threshold velocity (FTV) of normal impacts but seemed to be bounded by the two curves. Simulations in Abaqus/Explicit were created at the experimental failure threshold velocities (FTV) to study delaminations. Peak interlaminar shear stresses were found to be between 104 and 130 MPa. The peak interlaminar shear stress was a good indication of failure onset, while the Northwestern University (NU) and Hashin-Rotem failure criteria seem to require adjusted material properties for the higher strain rates. Dent depths in the composite panels were not indications of existing delaminations, and there was no correlation found between dent depth and delamination size. Impacts on the aluminum panels with similar energies created dent depths that were an order of magnitude higher than the composite panels and thus clearly more visibly detectable

The role of proteases in Twist induced tumor invasion
Metastasis is a complex multi-step process by which cancer cells disseminate from a primary site to distant organs. The transcription factor Twist has been shown to play a key role in metastasis in a mouse mammary tumor metastasis model. It has also been implicated in invasive human cancers and correlated with increased incidence of metastasis and poor disease progression in vivo. One cellular function of Twist that contributes to metastasis is to promote Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition, allowing cancer cells to lose cell to cell adhesion and gain motility. However, the role of Twist in other steps of the metastatic cascade has not yet been examined. My project focuses on the role of Twist in promoting tumor invasion and the formation of invasive cellular structures called invadopodia. Fluorescent gelatin degradation assays as well as immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that Twist is necessary and sufficient for local matrix degradation and invadopodia formation. It was unclear the mechanism by which Twist induced invadopodia formation. I hypothesize that Twist may regulate proteases that are associated with invadopodia, playing a key role in invadopodia formation and matrix degradation. My study showed that Twist expression specifically upregulated the expression of three proteases associated with invadopodia: ADAM12, FAPa, and DPPIV. I further investigated the role of ADAM12 studying matrix degradation and invadopodia formation. We found that expression of ADAM12 is necessary for proper matrix degradation and functional invadopodia formation. Together, these results indicate that induction of ADAM12 plays a critical role in Twist-induced matrix degradation and local invasion

Investigation of Transcription Factor Binding Sequences and Target Genes using Protein Binding Microarrays
This thesis describes the investigation of binding rules and DNA binding sequences for several transcription factors (TFs). We develop Protein Binding Microarrays (PBMs) to study the interactions between TFs and <italic>in vitro</italic> and we use a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to capture these interactions <italic>in silico</italic>. We then apply this methodology to study the binding of TFs to promoters and repetitive sequences in a genomewide fashion. In Chapter 2, we thoroughly investigate HNF4&alpha; DNA binding interactions using PBMs. We investigate binding specificities for various isoforms and species of HNF4&alpha;. We then use PBMs to rank ~ 4,000 HNF4&alpha; binding sequences in order of binding affinity. Using this training set we identify/predict novel HNF4&alpha; binding sequences and rules, and from these rules we generate a model for HNF4&alpha; binding. We then use this large dataset, in combination with ChIP-on-chip and RNAi followed by an expression profiling to identify hundreds of novel HNF4&alpha; direct target genes.  In Chapter 3, we identify HNF4&alpha; association with Alu repeats, a novel finding. We investigate HNF4&alpha; binding to Alu sequences in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the promoters of HNF4alpha-regulated genes, and thus reveal a novel association between HNF4&alpha; and  Alu repeats.Finally in Chapter 4, we leverage the PBM technology to investigate the binding properties of transcription factors COUP-TF2 and  TCF-1. We identify many sequences that bind both HNF4&alpha;and TCF-1 and those bind both HNF4&alpha; and COUP-TF2. This finding suggests competition between these TFs on the promoters of their target genes. Additionally, we investigate the effect of coregulator PGC&alpha; and  the effect of the endogenous ligand linoleic acid HNF4&alpha; DNA binding. This study significantly advances our knowledge of binding sequences, binding motifs, target genes, and transcriptional regulation for several transcription factors, HNF4&alpha;, COUP-TF2 and TCF-1. It also sheds light on evolution of HNF4&alpha; binding sequences through Alu repetitive elements. It suggests a strong framework for comprehensive investigation of transcriptional regulation in mammalian systems for other transcription factors.

Superfluid Theory: Vortex Theory of the Phase Transition, Pressure Dependencies in Equilibrated Three-Dimensional Bulk, and Vortex Pair Density in Quenched Two-Dimensional Film
The vortex theory of the helium-4-type superfluid phase transition, in both the 3D-bulk form and 2D-film form, is herein explained and intuitively derived.  New evidence is provided supporting the accuracy of the 3D vortex loop theory in equilibrium over all pressures up to the solidification point.

Metabolite imaging with mass-spectrometry to unravel the surface of plants
The acetyl-CoA metabolic network is complex, being juxtaposed between anabolic and catabolic processes, and between core metabolism common to all life forms and specialized (secondary) metabolism that is often discreetly distributed among different taxa.  Examples of metabolites that are generated from the acetyl-CoA network include such high-energy molecules as oils, hydrocarbons, waxes, and terpenoids, many of which have structural and/or signaling properties.  This complexity is further compounded by the fact that within a specific taxon, these metabolic processes are often discreetly compartmentalized at the cellular and/ or subcellular levels.  Therefore, to gain detailed insights into the structure and regulation of these metabolic processes one needs technologies that can visualize gene expression products at very high spatial resolution (at the single cell or subcellular level of resolution).  Technologies for achieving this high-level of spatial resolution are relatively abundant for nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins, however techniques for visualizing metabolites with high spatial resolution need to be developed.  We are developing mass-spectrometry based techniques to visualize the distribution of metabolites among plant cells and are exploring its utility in deciphering the surface metabolites of plants, which are products of the acetyl-CoA metabolic network.

Environmental Chamber Study of Atmospheric Chemistry and Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation Using Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy
Air pollution and global climate change are important environmental issues that affect our society. Deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry is required to understand these problems and to develop effective control strategies. Environmental chambers have been used for the past few decades to study atmospheric chemistry and investigate processes leading to secondary pollutant formation. This thesis work provides two different high sensitivity real time cavity enhance absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) instruments to detect NO3 radical and NO2/ glyoxal for environmental chamber study. These CEAS instruments can monitor these species with high sensitivity (in sub-ppb concentrations), with good selectivity, and with high spatial resolution in real time and in situ.Environmental chamber studies using CEAS instruments include NO3 behavior and reaction kinetics between NO3 and amine; sources and sinks for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the atmospheric photooxidation reactions; glyoxal uptake by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) under dry and humid conditions and glyoxal formation from the photooxidation of aromatic and isoprene. These studies provide insightful data in atmospheric processes and lead to a better understanding of the atmospheric system, which will eventually extend to environmental policy. This thesis is only a part of my research work. For more information about my other work, including cavity ring down spectroscopy studies for peroxy radical, aerosol optical extinction, transparent thin and time of flight mass spectrometry studies for the initial steps of ozone and alkenes reaactions, please refer to my PhD thesis in Chemistry department, UC-Riverside.

Dominance Behavior in Asexual Gecko, Lepidodac lugubris, and its Possible Relationship to Calcium
Investigations of dominance behavior and its relationship to  calcium gland size were conducted in the asexual gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris. In an initial study, geckos,immediately after laying eggs, were randomly assigned to one of six groups where time of social contact (2 vs. 7 days) and type of social contact (direct experience with a gravid or non-gravid gecko or indirect experience) were varied in a 2 X 3 factorial design. Behaviors displayed by geckos in social contact were system atically recorded. Dominance hierarchies were readily formed between gecko  dyads that received 7 days of social contact with each other. Dominance was not related to gecko size or reproductive state. A second study examined the relationship between dominance, calcium gland size and egg development. Geckos were housed in groups of 4 for 28 days and were subsequently transferred into either dyads or housed individually for an additional 28 days. During the final 28 days, half of the geckos received extra calcium. Dominance, size of calcium glands and egg development were recorded. Dominant geckos developed a greater number of eggs and had larger initial  calcium glands than subordinates, but extra calcium was not related o gland size. The function of dominance in L. lugubris populations may be two-fold: it may act as a spacing mechanism in low density environments and may facilitate the development and laying of eggs by more nutritionally fit individuals in high density environments.

Feasibility of using nanoporous materials in water harvesting
The study on using nanoporous materials for harvesting water from the environment is still in its early stage, involving multiple methodologies, materials, and levels of technology. Insight on several experimentally novel directions shed light on the challenges and prospects associated with atmospheric condensation behavior, pressurized filtration, and ion adsorption on various nanoporous materials. The condensation of water throughout the surface of a porous cylinder was found to be difficult to extract in large quantities. In pressurized filtration, zeolites exhibit ion exclusion effects. It is also found that nanoporous carbon discs have a relatively low capacity of adsorption which is one order of magnitude insufficient to achieve a detectable decrease in solution salinity

Effects of Land Surface Characteristics on Pedogenesis, Biological Soil Crust Community Diversity, and Ecosystem Functions in a Mojave Desert Piedmont Landscape
Abiotic and biotic land surface properties are often highly heterogeneous but can assemble in a repetitive manner forming landform mosaics at a mesoscale (ten to hundreds of meters). Nonetheless, we still do not fully understand their interactions or the mechanisms involved that change these properties during landscape evolution. The goal of this work was to relate land surface properties to functional group diversity of biological soil crusts and vascular plants, ecosystem functions and pedogenesis within a Mojave Desert landscape. Seven mosaic types were visually identified that occurred on three geomorphic-aged surfaces: young bars and swales, intermediate-aged flattened bars, flattened swales and bioturbation units, and old desert pavement and shrub zones. Sixty-three randomly selected landform mosaics served as study plots. In each plot a suite of morphometrical, physical and biological variables were determined. Multivariate analysis revealed that landform mosaics are statistically distinct according to specific sets of abiotic and biotic land surface properties. Within each landform type I also detected significant differences in functional group diversity of plants and biological soil crusts. The aggregate stability, nitrogen and carbon fixation of crusts were measured. An area based quality index (ABQI) was developed to evaluate these microbial communities based on ecological functions. The ABQI was computed for each landform mosaic and statistically compared. The ABQI was highest for bars and lowest for desert pavements.Two landform evolutionary trajectories were identified: an abiogenic and a biogenic tract. In the abiogenic track, vegetation contracted and the surface increased in physical components. In the biogenic track vegetation diversity and abundance increased, and crust cover and diversity was high.  Both of these trajectories were linked to different pedogeneses. Abiogenic soils promoted vesicular and calcic horizon development, as well as sodicity and alkalinity. Organic carbon and total nitrogen decreased. Biogenic soils were well mixed. No vesicular horizon could develop and calcic horizons were weakly expressed. Furthermore, these soils increased in organic carbon and total nitrogen. Overall, this work showed that desert landscapes are highly diverse in landform mosaics defined by abiotic and biotic land surface properties at the mesoscale. Moreover, strong linkages and feedbacks occur between physical, biotic and pedologic landscape components that over time result in quite contrasting surface features.

In vitro and in vivo effects of geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor P61A6 on non-small cell lung cancer cells
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Therapies against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are particularly needed, as this type of cancer is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We recently identified GGTI compounds that are designed to block geranylgeranylation and membrane association of signaling proteins including the Rho family G-proteins. One of the GGTIs is P61A6 which inhibits proliferation of human cancer cells, causes cell cycle effects with G1 accumulation and exhibits tumor-suppressing effects with human pancreatic cancer xenografts. In this paper, we investigated effects of P61A6 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo.
				
				
					
						Methods
					Three non-small cell lung cancer cell lines were used to test the ability of P61A6 to inhibit cell proliferation. Further characterization involved analyses of geranylgeranylation, membrane association and activation of RhoA, and anchorage-dependent and &#8211;independent growth, as well as cell cycle effects and examination of cell cycle regulators. We also generated stable cells expressing RhoA-F, which bypasses the geranylgeranylation requirement of wild type RhoA, and examined whether the proliferation inhibition by P61A6 is suppressed in these cells. Tumor xenografts of NSCLC cells growing in nude mice were also used to test P61A6&#8217;s tumor-suppressing ability.
				
				
					
						Results
					P61A6 was shown to inhibit proliferation of NSCLC lines H358, H23 and H1507. Detailed analysis of P61A6 effects on H358 cells showed that P61A6 inhibited geranylgeranylation, membrane association of RhoA and caused G1 accumulation associated with decreased cyclin D1/2. The effects of P61A6 to inhibit proliferation could mainly be ascribed to RhoA, as expression of the RhoA-F geranylgeranylation bypass mutant rendered the cells resistant to inhibition by P61A6. We also found that P61A6 treatment of H358 tumor xenografts growing in nude mice reduced their growth as well as the membrane association of RhoA in the tumors.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					Thus, P61A6 inhibits proliferation of NSCLC cells and causes G1 accumulation associated with decreased cyclin D1/2. The result with the RhoA-F mutant suggests that the effect of P61A6 to inhibit proliferation is mainly through the inhibition of RhoA. P61A6 also shows efficacy to inhibit growth of xenograft tumor.

A divergent variant of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 is present in California
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses are a problem for grape production globally. Symptoms are caused by a number of distinct viral species. During a survey of Napa Valley vineyards (California, USA), we found evidence of a new variant of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3). We isolated its genome from a symptomatic greenhouse-raised plant and fully sequenced it.
				
				
					
						Findings
					
					In a maximum likelihood analysis of representative GLRaV-3 gene sequences, the isolate grouped most closely with a recently sequenced variant from South Africa and a partial sequence from New Zealand. These highly divergent GLRaV-3 variants have predicted proteins that are more than 10% divergent from other GLRaV-3 variants, and appear to be missing an open reading frame for the p6 protein.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					This divergent GLRaV-3 phylogroup is already present in grape-growing regions worldwide and is capable of causing symptoms of leafroll disease without the p6 protein.

JContextExplorer: a tree-based approach to facilitate cross-species genomic context comparison
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Cross-species comparisons of gene neighborhoods (also called genomic contexts) in microbes may provide insight into determining functionally related or co-regulated sets of genes, suggest annotations of previously un-annotated genes, and help to identify horizontal gene transfer events across microbial species. Existing tools to investigate genomic contexts, however, lack features for dynamically comparing and exploring genomic regions from multiple species. As DNA sequencing technologies improve and the number of whole sequenced microbial genomes increases, a user-friendly genome context comparison platform designed for use by a broad range of users promises to satisfy a growing need in the biological community.
				
				
					
						Results
					Here we present JContextExplorer: a tool that organizes genomic contexts into branching diagrams. We implement several alternative context-comparison and tree rendering algorithms, and allow for easy transitioning between different clustering algorithms. To facilitate genomic context analysis, our tool implements GUI features, such as text search filtering, point-and-click interrogation of individual contexts, and genomic visualization via a multi-genome browser. We demonstrate a use case of our tool by attempting to resolve annotation ambiguities between two highly homologous yet functionally distinct genes in a set of 22 alpha and gamma proteobacteria.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					JContextExplorer should enable a broad range of users to analyze and explore genomic contexts. The program has been tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is implemented both as an executable JAR file and java WebStart. Program executables, source code, and documentation is available at http://www.bme.ucdavis.edu/facciotti/resources_data/software/.

Differential Plasmodium falciparum infection of
Anopheles gambiae s.s. molecular and chromosomal
forms in Mali
AbstractBackgroundAnopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) is a primary vector of Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some physiological differences among molecular and chromosomal forms of this species have been demonstrated, the relative susceptibility to malaria parasite infection among them has not been unequivocally shown. The objective of this study was to investigate P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein infection (CSP) positivity among An. gambiae s.s. chromosomal and molecular forms.MethodsWild An. gambiae from two sites Kela (n&#8201;=&#8201;464) and Sidarebougou (n&#8201;=&#8201;266) in Mali were screened for the presence of P. falciparum CSP using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples were then identified to molecular form using multiple PCR diagnostics (n&#8201;=&#8201;713) and chromosomal form using chromosomal karyotyping (n&#8201;=&#8201;419).ResultsOf 730 An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) mosquitoes, 89 (12.2%) were CSP ELISA positive. The percentage of positive mosquitoes varied by site: 52 (11.2%) in Kela and 37 (13.9%) in Sidarebougou. Eighty-seven of the positive mosquitoes were identified to molecular form and they consisted of nine Anopheles arabiensis (21.4%), 46&#8201;S (10.9%), 31&#8201;M (12.8%), and one MS hybrid (14.3%). Sixty of the positive mosquitoes were identified to chromosomal form and they consisted of five An. arabiensis (20.0%), 21 Savanna (15.1%), 21 Mopti (30.4%), 11 Bamako (9.2%), and two hybrids (20.0%).DiscussionIn this collection, the prevalence of P. falciparum infection in the M form was equivalent to infection in the S form (no molecular form differential infection). There was a significant differential infection by chromosomal form such that, P. falciparum infection was more prevalent in the Mopti chromosomal forms than in the Bamako or Savanna forms; the Mopti form was also the most underrepresented in the collection. Continued research on the differential P. falciparum infection of An. gambiae s.s. chromosomal and molecular forms may suggest that Plasmodium &#8211; An. gambiae interactions play a role in malaria transmission.

Widespread spin polarizationeffects in photoemission from topological insulators
High-resolution spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES) was performed on the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3 using a recently developed high-efficiency spectrometer. The topological surface state's helical spin structure is observed, in agreement with theoretical prediction. Spin textures of both chiralities, at energies above and below the Dirac point, are observed, and the spin structure is found to persist at room temperature. The measurements reveal additional unexpected spin polarization effects, which also originate from the spin-orbit interaction, but are well differentiated from topological physics by contrasting momentum and photon energy and polarization dependencies. These observations demonstrate significant deviations of photoelectron and quasiparticle spin polarizations. Our findings illustrate the inherent complexity of spin-resolved ARPES and demonstrate key considerations for interpreting experimental results.

Compressive Wideband Spectrum Sensing based on Cyclostationary Detection
Efficient use of the under-utilized spectrum is primarily dependent upon the accuracy of spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radios(CRs). To this end, wideband spectrum sensing is highly desirable as it increases the probability of detecting unused spectrum but it comes with a challenge of designing very high-speed A/D converters. Further, to achieve high throughput in CRs, primary users(PUs) must be detected within a constrained sensing time and under energy limitations. Here, we develop a reduced complexity compressive sampling cyclostationary detection method which exploits the two dimensional sparsity of the spectral correlation function (SCF). Detection is performed on the reconstructed Nyquist SCF which is obtained directly from the sub-Nyquist samples using a closed-form solution. For a given SCF sparsity, we quantify the bounds on the minmum lossless sampling rates which result in a unique reconstruction. Due to the additional sparsity introduced in the SCF with respect to the power spectral density, the minimum sampling rates for cyclostationary detection are shown to be lower than those required for energy detection.

This study describes a facile nickel-catalyzed method to achieve the synthetically useful amination of aryl sulfamates and carbamates. This approach uses an air-stable Ni(II) precatalyst, which, when employed with a mild reducing agent, efficiently delivers aminated products in good yields. The scope of the method is broad with respect to both coupling partners. For instance, substrates with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are tolerated, as well as those that possess ortho and para substituents. Furthermore, heteroaryl substrates may also be employed as coupling partners.

Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics
Over the past decades, significant efforts have been devoted to explore the use of various nanoparticle-based systems in the field of nanomedicine, including molecular imaging and therapy. Supramolecular synthetic approaches have attracted lots of attention due to their flexibility, convenience, and modularity for producing nanoparticles. In this dissertation, the developmental story of our size-controllable supramolecular nanoparticles (SNPs) will be discussed, as well as their use in specific biomedical applications. To achieve the self-assembly of SNPs, the well-characterized molecular recognition system (i.e., cyclodextrin/adamantane recognition) was employed. The resulting SNPs, which were assembled from three molecular building blocks, possess incredible stability in various physiological conditions, reversible size-controllability and dynamic disassembly that were exploited for various in vitro and in vivo applications. An advantage of using the supramolecular approach is that it enables the convenient incorporation of functional ligands onto SNP surface that confers functionality (e.g., targeting, cell penetration) to SNPs. We utilized SNPs for molecular imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) by introducing reporter systems (i.e., radio-isotopes, MR contrast agents, and fluorophores) into SNPs. On the other hand, the incorporation of various payloads, including drugs, genes and proteins, into SNPs showed improved delivery performance and enhanced therapeutic efficacy for these therapeutic agents. Leveraging the powers of (i) a combinatorial synthetic approach based on supramolecular assembly and (ii) a digital microreactor, a rapid developmental pathway was developed that is capable of screening SNP candidates for the ideal structural and functional properties that deliver optimal performance. Moreover, SNP-based theranostic delivery systems that combine reporter systems and therapeutic payloads into a single SNP for both diagnosis and therapy were generated. The results show that this type of theranostic SNPs may have a great contribution in the optimization of therapeutic efficacy for individual patients in clinical translation in the near future. It is anticipated that our supramolecular synthetic approach could be adopted to assemble various SNP-based delivery agents for molecular diagnostics and therapeutics that pave the way toward personalized medicine.

Laser tweezers to Investigate sperm motility and mitochondrial respiration in three vertebrate species
The purpose of this study is to investigate how the mitochondrial membrane potential affects sperm motility using laser tweezers and the fluorescent probe, DiOC6(3). A 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 continuous wave laser was used to trap motile sperm at a power of about 450 mW in the focused trap spot. Using customized tracking software, the curvilinear velocity (VCL) and the escape force (Pesc) from the laser tweezers were measured. Human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis lupis familiaris), and drill (Mandrillus lecuophaeus) sperm were labeled with the fluorescent dye DiOC6(3) to measure membrane potential in the mitochondria-rich sperm midpiece. The VCL was measured frame by frame before trapping, and the fluorescence was measured before and during trapping. Fluorescence intensity of the dye-treated sperm was compared to unlabeled sperm. Controls were performed to verify that the DiOC6(3) does not affect sperm motility. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was used to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and cause a loss of fluorescence. The results show that DiOC6(3) has no effect on the VCL and Pesc of the sperm even though there was a marked reduction in dye fluorescence when the CCCP was applied. Drill sperm exhibited a drop in VCL upon addition of CCCP, indicating a potential reliance on both glycolysis and aerobic respiration for motility. These results confirm that aerobic mitochondrial respiration is not the primary driving force for motility in human and dog sperm, but may be important for some primate species. DiOC6(3) was also proven to be an effective dye to study sperm mitochondrial energetics

Synthetic genetic arrays have been very effective at measuring genetic interactions in yeast in a high-throughput manner and recently have been expanded to measure quantitative changes in interaction, termed 'differential interactions', across multiple conditions. Here, we present a strategy that leverages statistical information from the experimental design to produce a novel, quantitative differential interaction score, which performs favorably compared to previous differential scores. We also discuss the added utility of differential genetic-similarity in differential network analysis. Our approach is preferred for differential network analysis, and our implementation, written in MATLAB, can be found at http://chianti.ucsd.edu/~gbean/compute_differential_scores.m.

Use of an Electronic Medical Record “Dotphrase” Data Template for a Prospective Head Injury Study
Introduction: The adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in emergency departments (EDs) has changed the way that healthcare information is collected, charted, and stored. A challenge for researchers is to determine how EMRs may be leveraged to facilitate study data collection efforts. Our objective is to describe the use of a unique data collection system leveraging EMR technology and to compare data entry error rates to traditional paper data collection.
      Methods: This was a retrospective review of data collection methods during a multicenter study of ED, anti-coagulated, head injury patients. On-shift physicians at 4 centers enrolled patients and prospectively completed data forms. These physicians had the option of completing a paper data form or an electronic “dotphrase” (DP) data form. A feature of our Epic®-based EMR is the ability to use DPs to assist in medical information entry. A DP is a preset template that may be inserted into the EMR when the physician types a period followed by a code phrase (in this case “.ichstudy”). Once the study DP was inserted at the bottom of the electronic ED note, it prompted enrolling physicians to answer study questions. Investigators then extracted data directly from the EMR.
      Results: From July 2009 through December 2010, we enrolled 883 patients. DP data forms were used in 288 (32.6%; 95% confidence interval CI 29.5, 35.7%) cases and paper data forms in 595 (67.4%; 95% CI 64.3, 70.5%). Sixty-six (43.7%; 95% CI 35.8, 51.6%) of 151 physicians enrolling patients used DP data entry at least once. Using multivariate analysis, we found no association between physician age, gender, or tenure and DP use. Data entry errors were more likely on paper forms (234/595, 39.3%; 95% CI 35.4, 43.3%) than DP forms (19/288, 6.6%; 95% CI 3.7, 9.5%), difference in error rates 32.7% (95% CI 27.9, 37.6%, P < 0.001).
      Conclusion: DP data collection is a feasible means of data collection. DP data forms maintain all study data within the secure EMR environment, obviating the need to maintain and collect paper data forms. This innovation was embraced by many of our emergency physicians and resulted in lower data entry error rates. West J Emerg Med.

A phosphoproteomics approach towards identifying signaling pathway modulators induced by small molecules :
Chemical genetics seeks to use chemical entities to identify novel proteins and cellular processes that are responsible for complex biological processes. Unlike classical forward genetics, however, the identification of the proteins and signaling pathways targeted by small molecules remains extremely challenging. Affinity approaches are limited by their inherent low throughput and high incidence of identifying irrelevant proteins that interact with the chemical probe. Here an approach is described that attempts to discover targets based on the chemical-induced changes in phosphoproteins. As a test case, the small molecule benzimidazole derivative termed 206A that synergizes with Wnt signaling by an unknown mechanism was chosen. Initial studies focused on the quantitative western blotting-based Kinexus' Phosphosite Profiling service, but the small proportion of the phosphoproteome probed and the inherent low sensitivity of the western blotting limits antibody-based methods. Label- free mass spectrometry analysis with phosphopeptide enrichment provided a vastly greater number of proteins, resulting in semi-quantitative phosphoprotein data for 206A-treated RKO cells over a time course. Custom software was developed to process the data, including modifications to the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline software suite to convert manual phosphopeptide validation to an automated system. Furthermore, a novel binning algorithm was used to detect 742 statistically significant differentially phosphorylated protein "hits" despite the lack of experimental replicates. The protein set was expanded using a protein-protein interaction database, and analysis with the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources website demonstrated that 243 of the original 742 proteins interacted directly with Wnt signaling proteins. These were assessed by selective siRNA knockdown, revealing RPLP0 as a Wnt pathway modulator induced by 206A. Taken together, these data indicate that mass spectroscopy-based phosphoproteomics analysis coupled with systems-level network analysis can be used to identify unknown targets of small molecules in a complex biological setting

Chapter 2 is a study in which the role of flocculation in sedimentary magnetization is analyzed with the help of laboratory redeposition experiments and a simple numerical model. At small floc sizes DRM acquisition is likely to be non-linear but it may record the directions with higher fidelity. In environments having bigger flocs the sediments are likely to record either intensities or directions with high fidelity, but not both. Also flocculation may inhibit a large fraction of magnetic grains from contributing to the net remanence and this might have consequences for intensity normalization in sediments. Chapter 3 presents a fresh perspective on the long standing debate of the nature of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORBs). A new parameter, IRAT, defined as the ratio of the isothermal remanences in antiparallel directions is used to differentiate between uniaxial single domain grains (IRAT ̃1) and multiaxial single domain grains (IRAT <1). The theoretical predictions were first validated with standard samples and then multiple MORB samples were analyzed. The observed IRAT ratios indicate a dominant non -uniaxial anisotropy in the MORBs. Chapters 4 and 5 are archeointensity studies from two data poor regions of the world viz., Africa and India. With stringent data selection criteria and well established archeological constraints these datasets provide important constraints on the field intensity from 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in Africa and 500 BCE to 1000 CE in India. The African dataset has a higher age resolution than the Indian dataset. The African dataset matches well with the global CALS3k.4 model and shows significant non-axial-dipolar contribution in the region. The Indian dataset is not of a similar resolution but shows that the field might have dropped by as much as 40% in the first half of the first century BCE and remained low during the first century CE

Combinatorial control of temporal gene expression in the Drosophila wing by enhancers and core promoters
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The transformation of a developing epithelium into an adult structure is a complex process, which often involves coordinated changes in cell proliferation, metabolism, adhesion, and shape. To identify genetic mechanisms that control epithelial differentiation, we analyzed the temporal patterns of gene expression during metamorphosis of the Drosophila wing.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					We found that a striking number of genes, approximately 50% of the Drosophila transcriptome, exhibited changes in expression during a time course of wing development. While cis-acting enhancer sequences clearly correlated with these changes, a stronger correlation was discovered between core-promoter types and the dynamic patterns of gene expression within this differentiating tissue. In support of the hypothesis that core-promoter type influences the dynamics of expression, expression levels of several TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) and other core promoter-associated components changed during this developmental time course, and a testes-specific TAF (tTAF) played a critical role in timing cellular differentiation within the wing.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our results suggest that the combinatorial control of gene expression via cis-acting enhancer sequences and core-promoter types, determine the complex changes in gene expression that drive morphogenesis and terminal differentiation of the Drosophila wing epithelium.

Capturing circulating tumor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Early metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be detected by the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. During the course of therapeutic attempts, monitoring CTC changes in patients with HCC is helpful for the efficacy assessment. Nevertheless, the markers used for the detection, such as α-feto protein, asialoglycoprotein receptor or epithelial cell adhesion molecule, CD133 or CD90, are not specific for HCC CTCs. In spite of these limitations, a timely determination of the existence of CTCs will be beneficial for the monitoring of distant metastases, the evaluation of therapeutic attempts, and the prediction of prognosis.

Multiple Syntrophic Interactions in a Terephthalate-Degrading Methanogenic Consortium
Terephthalate (TA) is one of the top 50 chemicals produced worldwide. Its production results in a TA-containing wastewater that is treated by anaerobic processes through a poorly understood methanogenic syntrophy. Using metagenomics, we characterized the methanogenic consortium tinside a hyper-mesophilic (i.e., between mesophilic and thermophilic), TA-degrading bioreactor.  We identified genes belonging to dominant Pelotomaculum species presumably involved in TA degradation through decarboxylation, dearomatization, and modified ?-oxidation to H2/CO2 and acetate. These intermediates are converted to CH4/CO2 by three novel hyper-mesophilic
methanogens. Additional secondary syntrophic interactions were predicted in Thermotogae,  Syntrophus and candidate phyla OP5 and WWE1 populations. The OP5 encodes genes capable of anaerobic autotrophic butyrate production and Thermotogae, Syntrophus and WWE1 have the genetic potential to oxidize butyrate to CO2/H2 and acetate. These observations suggest that the TA-degrading consortium consists of additional syntrophic interactions beyond the standard H2-producing syntroph ? methanogen partnership that may serve to improve community stability.

Some Results on Factorization in Integral Domains
In this dissertation, we study three recent generalizations of unique factorization; the almost Schreier property, the inside factorial property, and the IDPF property.  Let R be an integral domain and let p be a nonzero element of R.  Then, p is said to be almost primal if whenever p divides xy, there exists a positive integer k and a, b in R such that p^k=ab with a | x^k and b | y^k.  R is said to be almost Schreier if every nonzero element of R is almost primal.  Given  an M-graded domain R=(bigoplus_{m in M} R_m), where M is a torsion-free, commutative, cancellative monoid, we classify when R is almost Schreier under the assumption that the extension from R to its integral closure is root.  We then specialize to the case of commutative semigroup rings and show that if RM to its integral closure is a root extension, then RM is almost Schreier if and only if R is an almost Schreier domain and M is an almost Schreier monoid. Let D_n(a) denote the set of non-associate irreducible divisors of a^n.  R is said to be IDPF, if for every nonzero, nonunit element a of R, the ascending chain D_1(a) subset D_2(a) subset ... stabilizes on a finite set.  Also, a monoid H is inside factorial if there exists a divisor homomorphism phi : D -> H from a factorial monoid D such that for any x in H there is a positive integer n with x^n in the image of D under phi.  R is inside factorial if its multiplicative monoid R-{0} is inside factorial.  Continuing our investigation of semigroup rings, we prove that no proper numerical semigroup ring RS of characteristic zero is IDPF. Let R be an order in any quadratic integer ring and let n be the least positive integer in the conductor ideal.  We tie the IDPF, inside factorial, and the almost Schreier properties together by proving that RX is IDPF if and only if RX is almost Schreier if and only if RX is inside factorial if and only if every prime divisor of n also divides the discriminant of Q(sqrt{d}).

The site-specific integration reaction of Listeria phage A118 integrase, a serine recombinase
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					A large subfamily of serine recombinases contains long polypeptide segments appended to the C-terminal end of the conserved catalytic domain. Members of this subfamily often function as phage integrases but also mediate transposition and regulate terminal differentiation processes in eubacteria. Although a few members of this subfamily have been studied in purified in vitro systems, key mechanistic aspects of reactions promoted by these recombinases remain to be determined, particularly with respect to the functions of the large C-terminal domain.
				
				
					
						Results
					We have developed and characterized a robust in vitro recombination reaction by the Listeria phage A118 integrase, a member of the subfamily of serine recombinases containing a large C-terminal domain. The reaction occurs in a simple buffered salt solution and exhibits a modest stimulation by divalent cations or spermidine and DNA supercoiling. Recombination with purified A118 integrase is unidirectional, being efficient only between attP and attB DNA sites to either join separate DNA molecules (intermolecular recombination) or to generate deletions or inversions depending on the relative orientation of att sites in cis (intramolecular recombination). The minimal attP site is 50 bp but requires only 44 bp of base sequence information, whereas the minimal attB site is 42 bp and requires 38 bp of base sequence information. DNA exchange occurs between the central 2 bp of attP and attB. Identity between these two base pairs is required for recombination, and they solely determine the orientation of recombination sites. The integrase dimer binds efficiently to full att sites, including the attL and attR integration products, but poorly and differentially to each half-site. The large C-terminal domain can be separated from the N-terminal catalytic by partial proteolysis and mediates non-cooperative DNA binding to att sites.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					The basic properties of the phage A118 integrase reaction and its substrate requirements have been elucidated. A118 integrase thus joins the handful of biochemically characterized serine integrases that are serving as models for mechanistic studies on this important class of recombinases. Information reported here will also be useful in exploiting this recombinase for genetic engineering.

THE FAILURE OF UNCOVERED INTEREST PARITY, FORWARD BIAS AND RELATED PUZZLES
Three puzzles are closely related to the forward-bias puzzle and the failure of uncovered interest parity: (1) UIP failure is greater for short than long maturities, (2) forward bias is larger between developed than between developing countries and (3) there is no systematic forward bias in commodity markets. A convincing explanation for these puzzles should also explain two other 'facts': (a) the time dependency of the forward bias and failure of UIP and (b) that UIP holds better under a gold standard than under flexible rates. A combination of covered interest parity and monetary policy provides the best available explanation.

Tracking Hemicellulose and Lignin Deconstruction During Hydrothermal Pretreatment of Biomass
The development of transportation fuels with low greenhouse gas emissions is imperative due to growing demand for transportation fuels, decreasing conventional petroleum supplies, and global warming. Ethanol from cellulosic biomass could address all of these challenges but current conversion technologies are not commercially feasible. Expensive pretreatments and enzymes are needed to recover fermentable sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin represents an additional barrier to sugar recovery. The pretreatment step, key to the conversion process, hydrolyzes xylan, part of hemicellulose, and disrupts lignin. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are closely associated in the cell wall but the effect of these associations during pretreatment has not been studied despite suggestions that they are important. Better knowledge of hemicellulose and lignin deconstruction during pretreatment could lead to breakthroughs that would bring cellulosic ethanol one step closer to reality.Key to this study of biomass deconstruction was the use of a fixed bed flowthrough pretreatment reactor. Pretreatment products are swept out of the reactor quickly thus facilitating the tracking of products as a function of time, limiting side and degradation reactions, and product precipitation at the end of pretreatments. The implementation of a metal 96 well plate for pretreatment resulted in the implementation of indirect steam heating, which raised questions about the adequacy of fluidized sand baths for heating. The results of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis using each system were not significantly different although indirect steam did prove to be the superior heating system. Confident in the performance of the fluidized sand bath, baseline-operating conditions for flowthrough pretreatment were selected based on review of the literature, modeling, and trial and error. Populus trichocarpa, a potential bioenergy crop, was subjected to batch and flowthrough pretreatment along with model substrates: holocellulose, the hemicellulose and cellulose portion of P. trichocarpa, birchwood xylan, and cellulolytic enzyme lignin isolated from P. trichocarpa. The differences in the pretreatment results among these substrates indicate that the associations between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin limit the hydrolysis of xylan but increase the extractability of lignin. The findings of this thesis provide new research directions and suggest new plant modification and pretreatment strategies.

The Direct Observation of Secondary Radical Chain Chemistry in the Heterogeneous Reaction of Chlorine Atoms with Submicron Squalane Droplets
The reaction of Cl atoms, in the presence of Cl2 and O2, with sub-micron squalane particles is used as a model system to explore how surface hydrogen abstraction reactions initiate chain reactions that rapidly transform the chemical composition of an organic particle. The heterogeneous reaction is measured in a photochemical flow tube reactor in which chlorine atoms are produced by the photolysis of Cl2 at 365 nm. By monitoring the heterogeneous reaction, using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer, the effective reactive uptake coefficient and the distributions of both oxygenated and chlorinated reaction products are measured and found to depend sensitively upon O2, Cl2, and Cl concentrations in the flow reactor. In the absence of O2, the effective reactive uptake coefficient monotonically increases with Cl2 concentration to a value of ~;;3, clearly indicating the presence of secondary chain chemistry occurring in the condensed phase. The effective uptake coefficient decreases with increasing O2 approaching a diffusion corrected value of 0.65 ? 0.07, when 20percent of the total nitrogen flow rate in the reactor is replaced with O2. Using a kinetic model it is found that the amount of secondary chemistry and the product distributions in the aerosol phase are controlled by the competitive reaction rates of O2 and Cl2 with alkyl radicals. The role that a heterogeneous pathway might play in the reaction of alkyl radicals with O2 and Cl2 is investigated within a reasonable range of reaction parameters. These results show, more generally, that for heterogeneous reactions involving secondary chain chemistry, time and radical concentration are not interchangeable kinetic quantities, but rather the observed reaction rate and product formation chemistry depends sensitively upon the concentrations and time evolution of radical initiators and those species that propagate or terminate free radical chain reactions.

Novel biodiversity of natural products-producing tropical marine cyanobacteria
During the last three decades, tropical marine cyanobacteria have emerged as an extraordinarily prolific source of promising biomedical natural products (NPs). Creative endeavors have been used to explore this novel chemical diversity, but lagging behind is the recognition and description of the biological diversity responsible for these NPs. Instead of being recognized as unique taxa, tropical marine NP-producing groups have been identified, with few exceptions, based on classification systems tied to morphospecies of terrestrial and freshwater specimens from temperate regions. This lack of proper classification systems is primarily due to the fact that tropical marine cyanobacteria have only recently been explored. As a result, our current perspective of the taxonomic origin and distribution of NPs in marine cyanobacteria is extraordinarily incomplete. A major aspect of this thesis research has focused on providing a better understanding of how NPs are distributed among different cyanobacterial groups so as to improve the efficiency of future investigations. The initial perception was that bioactive secondary metabolites are unequally distributed among different taxonomic groups with a few groups being responsible for the majority of the isolated NPs. However, based on polyphasic characterization of globally distributed populations, many of the most chemically prolific groups were found to constitute polyphyletic groups. Moreover, a large proportion of the secondary metabolites attributed to these groups are in fact produced by morphologically similar but evolutionarily distant cyanobacteria. I argue that this morphological resemblance of different cyanobacterial lineages is a major reason why some cyanobacterial groups have such an apparent richness of secondary metabolites. In my efforts to provide taxonomic clarity as well as to better guide future natural product drug discovery investigations, I have proposed a revision of the NP-rich genus Lyngbya on the basis of phylogenetic, genomic, secondary metabolism and ultrastructural comparisons with the genus reference strain PCC 7419T. In conclusion, this proposed revision of "tropical marine Lyngbya"as a new genus (Moorea gen. nov.) highlights the underestimated biodiversity of tropical marine cyanobacteria

Mammalian Host Responses to Proinflammatory Stimuli by Microbial Pathogens
The complex interplay between infectious agents and host defenses in both the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system determines the outcome of host-pathogen interactions.  Bacteria use virulence strategies to invade biological barriers, but active processes of host epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles.  To focus on the latter, the uptake of fixed bacterial particles by the inflamed intestinal epithelium was modeled in vitro by Caco-2BBe cells conditioned with TNF-&alpha and an agonist antibody to the lymphtoxin-&beta receptor. Staphylococcus and Yersinia  were readily endocytosed, compared with scant uptake of the enteric and pulmonary pathogens Shigella , Salmonella, and Klebsiella.  Endocytosed S. aureus, but not Yersinia, was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles, suggesting that cytokine treatment upregulated at least two distinct endocytic pathways.   Treatment induced epithelial redistribution of &beta1 integrin; consistent with this effect, &beta1 integrin blockade reduced uptake of bacterial particles in epithelial layers.  Together, these data indicate that cells of the inflamed mucosa selectively enhance endocytic sampling of bacteria from the lumen, perhaps as a mechanism for enhancing the antigen-specific repertoire of the mucosal lymphocyte population. Other biological barriers to infection form a bulwark between immune cells in circulation and tissues at high risk for damage secondary to inflammation; these include the brain and eye.  Infection of these tissues with the intracellular protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>induces a proinflammatory adaptive response.  This is accompanied in the brain by the emergence of localized extracellular fiberlike networks along which parasite-specific T cells migrate.  To identify molecules associated with tissue remodeling in the infected brain, matrix metalloprotease transcripts were measured. Substantial post-infection upregulation of MMP-8 and MMP-10 together with their endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1 was observed.  Intracellular staining of brain mononuclear cells showed MMP-8 and -10 to be expressed by CD4+ and CD8+ cells; these populations, along with CNS-resident microglia and astrocytes, upregulated TIMP-1 during chronic infection. <italic>T. gondii</italic> burden was significantly reduced in the brains of TIMP-1 null animals. Together, these findings identify a role for specific MMPs and TIMP-1 in matrix remodeling and pathogen clearance associated with migration of brain-infiltrating leukocytes during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection.

I kappa B epsilon provides negative feedback to control NF-kappa B oscillations, signaling dynamics, and inflammatory gene expression
NF-kappa B signaling is known to be critically regulated by the NF-kappa B-inducible inhibitor protein I kappa B alpha. The resulting negative feedback has been shown to produce a propensity for oscillations in NF-kappa B activity. We report integrated experimental and computational studies that demonstrate that another I kappa B isoform, I kappa B epsilon, also provides negative feedback on NF-kappa B activity, but with distinct functional consequences. Upon stimulation, NF-kappa B-induced transcription of I kappa B epsilon is delayed, relative to that of I kappa B alpha, rendering the two negative feedback loops to be in antiphase. As a result, I kappa B epsilon has a role in dampening I kappa B alpha-mediated oscillations during long-lasting NF-kappa B activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the requirement of both of these distinct negative feedback regulators for the termination of NF-kappa B activity and NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression in response to transient stimulation. Our findings extend the capabilities of a computational model of I kappa B-NF-kappa B signaling and reveal a novel regulatory module of two antiphase negative feedback loops that allows for the fine-tuning of the dynamics of a mammalian signaling pathway.

Experience-dependent co-regulation of excitation and inhibition within primary somatosensory cortex
Sensory representations in the cortex adapt during experience and learning to shape perception. Behaviorally relevant stimuli strengthen and expand within cortical sensory maps, while irrelevant or unused stimuli weaken and shrink. These changes in maps are known to include modifications of excitatory neurons and circuits, but it remains uncertain how inhibitory plasticity may be involved. This thesis investigates the cellular basis for experience-dependent plasticity of feedforward inhibition within layer 2/3 (L2/3) of rodent somatosensory cortex and addresses how changes of excitatory and inhibitory circuits are coordinated during map plasticity. Experiments revealed that sensory deprivation weakens feedforward inhibition onto L2/3 excitatory pyramidal cells via local fast-spiking (FS) interneurons. This weakening reflected reduced excitatory synaptic input to FS interneurons, partially offset by increased strength of unitary FS to pyramidal cell synapses. These changes occur in parallel with previously reported decreases of feedforward excitation onto L2/3 pyramids and preserve mean excitatory-inhibitory balance during experience- dependent plasticity

Evolutionary Diversification of Reproductive Modes in Livebearing Fishes
Placental matrotrophy has evolved independently in many lineages, which is indicative of strong selection.  Several ad-hoc hypotheses and one mathematical model have been proposed to explain its evolution, but little experimental data exists to support these claims.  Recent studies have attempted to find correlates between placental matrotrophy and other life history traits, but the only common correlate found was a reduction in reproductive allocation (RA).  Here I report on three studies.  The first two focus on the Trexler-DeAngelis model for the evolution of matrotrophy.  In chapter one, I use closely related placental and non-placental species from the northern clade of <italic>Poeciliopsis</italic> to test an assumption imperative to the model, that placental species abort a subset of developing offspring in low food conditions.  The results show no evidence of abortion due to food level.  Instead, placental species appear to be tethered to a brood once initiated, and sacrifice body condition to maintain reproduction when resources are restricted.  However, an alternative explanation for these results is that the pattern of resource allocation is a function other life history traits, rather than placentation alone.  Chapter two distinguishes between these alternatives, by performing a similar experiment on the southern clade of <italic>Poeciliopsis</italic>, which has the opposite relationship between life history traits and placentation seen in the northern clade.  The results mirror those from the northern clade, indicating reproductive mode, rather than life history, dictates the pattern of resource allocation.  This further adds to the difficulties of explaining the evolution of the placenta within the constraints of the Trexler-DeAngelis model.  The third study characterizes locomotor consequences related to differences in reproductive allocation using the Trinidadian Guppy (<italic>Poecilia reticulata</italic>), because placentation is correlated with a reduction in reproductive allocation.  Females with the highest RA were less streamlined, had lower escape velocities, and had to work harder during prolonged swimming. In low predation natural habitat, these same females were restricted to habitat with slower moving water, while females with lower RAs were able to use faster flows, which are thought to be preferred feeding grounds.  All high predation fish used slow moving water, irrespective of RA.

Enhancing trappable antiproton populations through deceleration and frictional cooling
CERN currently delivers antiprotons for trapping experiments with the
Antiproton Decelerator (AD), which slows the antiprotons down to about 5 MeV.
This energy is currently too high for direct trapping, and thick foils are
used to slow down the beam to energies which can be trapped.
To allow further deceleration to $\sim 100 \;\mbox{keV}$,
CERN is initiating the construction of ELENA,
consisting of a ring which will combine RF deceleration
and electron cooling capabilities. We describe a simple frictional
cooling scheme that can serve to provide significantly improved
trapping efficiency, either directly from the AD or first using
a standard deceleration mechanism (induction linac or RFQ).
This scheme could be implemented in a short time.
The device itself is short in length, uses accessible voltages,
and at reasonable cost could serve in the interim before
ELENA becomes operational, or possibly in lieu of ELENA for some experiments.
Simple theory and simulations provide a preliminary assessment of the
concept and its strengths and limitations, and highlight important areas for
experimental studies, in particular to pin down the level of multiple
scattering for low-energy antiprotons.  We show that the frictional
cooling scheme can provide a similar energy spectrum to that of ELENA,
but with higher transverse emittances.

Genetic analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression levels in whole blood of healthy human subjects
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					The predominant model for regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation is an inverse association in which increased methylation results in decreased gene expression levels. However, recent studies suggest that the relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation and expression is more complex.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Systems genetic approaches for examining relationships between gene expression and methylation array data were used to find both negative and positive associations between these levels. A weighted correlation network analysis revealed that i) both transcriptome and methylome are organized in modules, ii) co-expression modules are generally not preserved in the methylation data and vice-versa, and iii) highly significant correlations exist between co-expression and co-methylation modules, suggesting the existence of factors that affect expression and methylation of different modules (i.e., trans effects at the level of modules). We observed that methylation probes associated with expression in cis were more likely to be located outside CpG islands, whereas specificity for CpG island shores was present when methylation, associated with expression, was under local genetic control. A structural equation model based analysis found strong support in particular for a traditional causal model in which gene expression is regulated by genetic variation via DNA methylation instead of gene expression affecting DNA methylation levels.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Our results provide new insights into the complex mechanisms between genetic markers, epigenetic mechanisms and gene expression. We find strong support for the classical model of genetic variants regulating methylation, which in turn regulates gene expression. Moreover we show that, although the methylation and expression modules differ, they are highly correlated.

Gene Regulatory Machinery and Proteomics of Sexual Reproduction in  Phytophthora infestans
Mating is important for the survival of <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, the causal agent of potato and tomato late blight. The mating process increases population fitness and produces thick-walled oospores that can survive harsh environmental conditions. To better understand the mechanisms that regulate of sexual reproduction in <italic>P. infestans</italic>, the promoters of two mating-induced genes, PITG_002525 and PITG_00483, were studied in order to identify their cis-regulatory elements. PITG_02525 encodes an elicitin-like protein, and PITG_00483 encodes a PUMILIO (Pum) protein. The promoter of PITG_02525 was sequentially deleted and fused with a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene to identify its regulatory motifs. The full length promoter was found to be active in young and mature, and male and female, structures. The deletion analysis identified a potential repressor element and an activator. Similar studies of the <italic>pum</italic> promoter showed expression both during oosporogenesis and sporulation. One promoter element was found to be essential for the expression of the gene in both stages. Fusing this element with a minimal promoter indicated that it was sufficient for gene expression during sporulation, but not in mating. The RNA binding domain (RBD) of Pum then was used as a model to develop a system for <italic>P. infestans</italic> protein interaction studies. Expression of the RBD with a tandem affinity purification tag designed with <italic>P. infestans</italic> codon bias, allowed the successful purification of the Pum RBD with a potential binding partner. This system is adaptable for future studies of other protein interactions. A MudPIT global proteomics comparison of oospores with nonsporulating hyphae (NSH) was then conducted to profile the protein composition of oospores and identify important proteins for germination. It was proposed that the proteins detected in dormant oospores were synthesized during early oosporogenesis and stored for germination. Our study identified proteins that are more abundant in oospores belonging to several functional groups. These included enzymes involved in carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation to produce energy, and anti-oxidant and anti-stress proteins that may protect the germ tubes, and secreted proteins that could be involved in host infection. This revealed that <italic>P. infestans</italic> has a very well designed life cycle.

Investigations into Peach Replant Disease and Nematophagous Fungi
The research described in this dissertation examined peach replant disease and two nematode biological control systems using traditional plant pathology methods and molecular microbial ecology methods. In Chapter 1, the experiments identified microbes associated with peach replant disease in soils with various levels of disease symptoms. To identify bacteria, fungi and oomycetes associated with the replant disease, culture and culture-independent analyses were performed on DNA extracted from plant roots. Among the most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units, 27 were negatively correlated with peach top weights while 10 were positively correlated. Among the most abundant fungi and oomycetes, negative and positive associations were identified between P. vexans and Trichoderma spp. and peach top weights, respectively, and verified with sequence-selective quantitative PCR analyses. In Chapter 2, the population dynamics between Dactylella oviparasitica and Heterodera schachtii were investigated. Higher initial D. oviparasitica populations were associated with lower final H. schachtii populations. Regression models showed that the initial densities of D. oviparasitica were only significant when predicting the final densities of H. schachtii J2 and eggs as well as fungal egg parasitism, while the initial densities of J2 were significant for all final H. schachtii measurements. H. schachtii-associated D. oviparasitica populations were greatly reduced in nematodes collected from soil compared to nematodes collected from roots. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of rRNA genes suggested that D. oviparasitica belongs to a clade of nematophagous fungi with a large geographical distribution. In Chapter 3, three strains of Pochonia chlamydosporia var. chlamydosporia were genetically characterized and examined for their biocontrol efficacies against Meloidogyne incognita. All strains exhibited different patterns with the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR analysis. Strains 1 and 4 were similar in the PCR analyses of ß-tubulin and the rRNA internal transcribed spacer. In greenhouse trials, all strains reduced the numbers of nematode egg masses. Strain 4 reduced almost 50% of the eggs, and reduced the numbers of J2 and root-galling.

Human Endogenous Retrovirus K(HML-2) Gag and Env specific T-cell responses are not detected in HTLV-I-infected subjects using standard peptide screening methods
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					An estimated 10&#8211;20 million individuals are infected with the retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). While the majority of these individuals remain asymptomatic, 0.3-4% develop a neurodegenerative inflammatory disease, termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP results in the progressive demyelination of the central nervous system and is a differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The etiology of HAM/TSP is unclear, but evidence points to a role for CNS-inflitrating T-cells in pathogenesis. Recently, the HTLV-1-Tax protein has been shown to induce transcription of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families W, H and K. Intriguingly, numerous studies have implicated these same HERV families in MS, though this association remains controversial.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					Here, we explore the hypothesis that HTLV-1-infection results in the induction of HERV antigen expression and the elicitation of HERV-specific T-cells responses which, in turn, may be reactive against neurons and other tissues. PBMC from 15 HTLV-1-infected subjects, 5 of whom presented with HAM/TSP, were comprehensively screened for T-cell responses to overlapping peptides spanning HERV-K(HML-2) Gag and Env. In addition, we screened for responses to peptides derived from diverse HERV families, selected based on predicted binding to predicted optimal epitopes. We observed a lack of responses to each of these peptide sets.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					
					Thus, although the limited scope of our screening prevents us from conclusively disproving our hypothesis, the current study does not provide data supporting a role for HERV-specific T-cell responses in HTLV-1 associated immunopathology.

The encoding of spatial, temporal, and affective dimensions in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
Memory of an event must fundamentally include not only the time and place of its occurrence but also a measure of its significance for an organism to maintain and update the most relevant information in its world. It must then follow that the brain structures necessary for learning provide a mechanism to account for these details that cumulatively compose complex memories. To investigate the degree to which the hippocampus accounts for spatial, temporal and affective dimensions in its activity at the single cell and local field potential levels, in vivo electrophysiological recordings were performed in the dentate gyrus of rats during experiments explicitly designed to examine encoding along temporal and affective dimensions. First, to test for the presence of time- dependent single cell activity in the dentate gyrus, rats were exposed to three distinct behavioral contexts presented either simultaneously or separated in time. In this experiment, single cell activity accounted for temporal segregation of contexts by demonstrating activity selective to a single context. In a subset of rats with reduced levels of hippocampal adult neurogenesis, temporally selective contextual encoding was reduced, suggesting that adult neurogenesis contributes to the encoding of temporal dimensions. In a second experiment designed to examine mechanisms by which affective associations are made in the hippocampus, local field potentials were acquired from the dentate gyrus during reinforcement learning. Robust decreases in the amplitude of theta frequency oscillations (4-12Hz) occurred concurrently with increases in the amplitude of beta frequency oscillations during time intervals key to associational learning. These changes in amplitude were observed only during learning epochs and in the presence of reinforcers, suggesting that these oscillatory changes are dedicated to facilitating the encoding of associations with an affective dimension. The results of these experiments further our understanding of how complex memories requiring associations across multiple dimensions are formed in the hippocampus

The phylogenetics of Anguillicolidae (Nematoda: Anguillicolidea), swimbladder parasites of eels
Abstract


Background
Anguillicolidae Yamaguti, 1935 is a family of parasitic nematode infecting fresh-water eels of the genus Anguilla, comprising five species in the genera Anguillicola and Anguillicoloides. Anguillicoloides crassus is of particular importance, as it has recently spread from its endemic range in the Eastern Pacific to Europe and North America, where it poses a significant threat to new, na&#239;ve hosts such as the economic important eel species Anguilla anguilla and Anguilla rostrata. The Anguillicolidae are therefore all potentially invasive taxa, but the relationships of the described species remain unclear. Anguillicolidae is part of Spirurina, a diverse clade made up of only animal parasites, but placement of the family within Spirurina is based on limited data.


Results
We generated an extensive DNA sequence dataset from three loci (the 5' one-third of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA, the D2-D3 region of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA and the 5' half of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene) for the five species of Anguillicolidae and used this to investigate specific and generic boundaries within the family, and the relationship of Anguillicolidae to other spirurine nematodes. Neither nuclear nor mitochondrial sequences supported monophyly of Anguillicoloides. Genetic diversity within the African species Anguillicoloides papernai was suggestive of cryptic taxa, as was the finding of distinct lineages of Anguillicoloides novaezelandiae in New Zealand and Tasmania. Phylogenetic analysis of the Spirurina grouped the Anguillicolidae together with members of the Gnathostomatidae and Seuratidae.


Conclusions
The Anguillicolidae is part of a complex radiation of parasitic nematodes of vertebrates with wide host diversity (chondrichthyes, teleosts, squamates and mammals), most closely related to other marine vertebrate parasites that also have complex life cycles. Molecular analyses do not support the recent division of Anguillicolidae into two genera. The described species may hide cryptic taxa, identified here by DNA taxonomy, and this DNA barcoding approach may assist in tracking species invasions. The propensity for host switching, and thus the potential for invasive behaviour, is found in A. crassus, A. novaezelandiae and A. papernai, and thus may be common to the group.

Molecular Mechanism of Beta-Arrestin-dependent ERK activation Downstream of Protease-activated Receptor-2
&#946;-arrestins, originally discovered in the context of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization and internalization, also function in signaling of these receptors independently of G protein coupling. These novel functions involve the roles for &#946;-arrestins as scaffolds. It has been reported that &#946;-arrestins interact with a number of binding partners including trafficking proteins, cytosolic kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, and non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Downstream of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), &#946;-arrestin scaffolds the components of the ERK cascade, Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK1/2 with the receptor at the plasma membrane, leading to activation of cytoplasmic/membrane ERK1/2 signaling independent of G-protein coupling. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that stimulation of PAR-2 resulted in prolonged activation of ERK1/2 in pseudopodia in a &#946;-arrestin-dependent manner and &#946;-arrestins were required in PAR-2 mediated ERK1/2 activation at the membrane and cell migration in metastatic tumor cell lines, suggesting &#946;-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation might play a role in cell motility. Although a number of recent studies reported that &#946;-arrestins are required for ERK1/2 activation independently of G protein coupling, molecular mechanism of &#946;-arrestin- mediated ERK1/2 activation via c-Raf has remained unclear. We hypothesized that the ability of &#946;-arrestins to scaffold and prolong MAPK signaling at the membrane, is dependent upon precise molecular interactions that are facilitated by interaction of &#946;-arrestins with PAR-2. To investigate the hypothesis, we determined the sites/domains in &#946;-arrestin-1 that interact with components of the ERK module (c-Raf, MEK1, and ERK1/2) both in vitro and in cells using GST pull down assay, sandwich immunoassay, and co-immunoprecipitation and investigated the role of these identified regions of &#946;-arrestin for interaction and activation of ERK1/2 using truncated mutants of &#946;-arrestin or &#946;-arrestin mutants lacking domains. In addition, a mysterious link in functional mechanism of &#946;-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 activation is how c-Raf relieves autoinhibition engendering a conformation change from a closed, inactive state to an open, active state, without small GTPase Ras, which is critical for c-Raf activation in the classical G protein dependent ERK activation. We hypothesized that &#946;-arrestins behave similar to Ras for &#946;-arrestin-dependent ERK activation to relieve autoinhibition of c-Raf. We have proved that &#946;-arrestin-1 binds to the regulatory domain of c-Raf where Ras was indentified to bind. Therefore, binding of &#946;-arrestin-1 to c-Raf might ensure formation of scaffolding complex containing &#946;-arrestin-1 and the ERK cascade and play a critical role to activate c-Raf in &#946;-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation.

Physical and perceptual aspects of percussive timbre
This dissertation explores relationships between perceptual dimensions of percussive timbres and measurements produced by several signal analysis algorithms. The literature of psychophysical timbre experiments since 1941 is reviewed with respect to two contrasting approaches. The earliest attempts at unraveling the interdependent aspects of timbre perception employed multiple adjective scales intended to describe various sonic features. Following developments in the technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS) in the 1960s, several researchers began to apply scaling techniques to data sets of timbre similarity judgments. At present, the majority of timbre studies are based on MDS. In spite of such advancements, the range of musical timbres has only begun to be explored from a perceptual viewpoint, and a significant gap exists in the literature for percussive instruments. The signal analysis algorithms employed in this research are introduced in the context of timbreID--a timbre analysis software library written by the author. The library's adaptability is illustrated with respect to several musical research applications in Pure data. This flexibility is shown to be beneficial in the case of two percussive instrument classification tests, in which the effectiveness of perceptually weighted spectral features like mel- and Bark-frequency spectrum are evaluated alongside other standard analysis techniques from the music information retrieval literature. In the final chapter, a perceptual experiment involving 30 diverse percussion timbres is carried out. The study confirms the importance of spectral centroid and attack duration as predictors of perceptual dimensions, and reveals two additional dimensions that may be unique to percussive timbres: "dryness" and "noisiness." A predictive model is generated using multiple linear regression, and results indicate that the noisiness dimension cannot be predicted as accurately as dimensions relating to spectral center of gravity and attack time. Thus, there is a clear need for an effective measure of perceptual noisiness for accurate description of percussive timbre

Composition and organization of active centromere sequences in complex genomes
AbstractBackgroundCentromeres are sites of chromosomal spindle attachment during mitosis and meiosis. While the sequence basis for centromere identity remains a subject of considerable debate, one approach is to examine the genomic organization at these active sites that are correlated with epigenetic marks of centromere function.ResultsWe have developed an approach to characterize both satellite and non-satellite centromeric sequences that are missing from current assemblies in complex genomes, using the dog genome as an example. Combining this genomic reference with an epigenetic dataset corresponding to sequences associated with the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), we identify active satellite sequence domains that appear to be both functionally and spatially distinct within the overall definition of satellite families.ConclusionsThese findings establish a genomic and epigenetic foundation for exploring the functional role of centromeric sequences in the previously sequenced dog genome and provide a model for similar studies within the context of less-characterized genomes.

[cell, stem, niche, tissue, gsc, aging]

Characterization of germline stem cell behavior during aging in Drosophila melanogaster
Adult stem cells replenish tissues during normal cellular turnover or injury. A stem cell divides asymmetrically to produce one stem cell (a process called self-renewal), and one daughter cell that initiates differentiation. The mechanisms ensuring the balance of cells are critical for tissue homeostasis. Misregulation of stem cells during disease or aging can lead to impaired tissue maintenance and repair resulting in diminished life quality or death of an individual. Stem cells are located in a microenvironment, or niche, within a tissue. The niche, composed of other cells, ECM, and/or a basement membrane, provides extrinsic cues to stem cells that regulate self- renewal, maintenance, and survival. Therefore, analyses of stem cells should include the niche, to ensure that an observation is physiologically relevant. While in vivo studies of stem cells are critical, complex vertebrate tissues are difficult for 1) identifying stem cells 2) determining niche components 3) deciphering signaling pathways within stem cells, and between stem cells and the niche. Therefore, studies of stem cells within the context of disease or aging would add more hurdles to the research process. This dissertation presents research using the powerful model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to study the effects of aging on germline stem cell (GSC) behavior in the testis, a well-characterized tissue. Chapter 2 shows that aging results in reduced GSC function due to extrinsic changes to the niche and intrinsic changes to the GSCs. Janus kinase -Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription, Jak-STAT, signaling that regulates stem cell maintenance, was reduced during aging, and restoration of signaling led to a rescue of GSC number within the niche in aged animals. Male flies are able to replace lost GSCs through reversion (dedifferentiation) of early germline progenitor cells. Chapter 3 shows that GSC numbers are lower during aging possibly due to compromised reversion. Analysis of early cyst cells, one of the components of the niche, shows defects in response to reversion in aged flies. This dissertation summarizes that interactions between the stem cells and their niche dictate tissue health; changes to the niche and stem cells lead to decreased tissue homeostasis during aging

Statistical Hypothesis Generation: Determining the Most Probable Subset
This article develops an axiomatic theory for statistical hypothesis generation that is based on the ideas of Gauss’ Theoria Motus. At the core of the theory is Bernoulli’s fifth axiom: Between two, the one that seems more probable should always be chosen. Under supplementary assumptions well-known special cases appear, such as regression analysis and principal component analysis. Through rigor, the abstracted theory provides clarity as to how different statistical hypothesis generation methods are interrelated, how they differ, and which method that should be used in a given situation.

Detection of MMPs and their inhibitors using a whole blood protease assay
The level of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) in whole blood has been investigated, with an emphasis on the effect of certain MMP inhibitors. A synthetically derived charge changing substrate, which has a cleavage site specific to enzymes MMP-2 and MMP-9, was used for detection. Presence of these enzymes was tested both with and without inhibitors, first in a buffer solution, and then in whole blood. The blood was taken from insulin resistant volunteers at different time points after the consumption of a meal rich in protein and fat. The volunteers were part of a twelve-week study performed to assess the change in levels of MMPs in the blood after being on a low-glycemic index diet. The presence of these enzymes in blood was assessed by reacting the blood with the synthetic substrate for a fixed period of time, and then using PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). After electrophoresis, the gel was imaged and enzyme levels quantified using a fluorescent detector. The gels were analyzed for intensity of fluorescence, which had a direct correlation with the amount of the MMP-2/9 present. Results indicated that there were slight changes in the levels of these enzymes after the 12-week period. However, the various MMP inhibitors such as grape seed extract (GSE), and doxycycline showed a definite decrease in enzyme activity, after reacting these inhibitors in whole blood in reaction tubes

Graphene and its Hybrid Nanostructures for Nanoelectronics and Energy Applications
This dissertation focuses on investigating the synthesis of graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, as well as their applications in nanoelectronics and energy conversion/storage. The substantial understanding of interaction of graphene layers between the bio-molecules and gas molecules will enable the improvement in the applications of graphene in bio-sensor and chemical sensor. To achieve these objectives, graphene field effect transistors are fabricated to study the interactions of graphene between single stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acids (ssDNA) and gas molecules. ssDNA is found to act as negative potential gating agent that increases the hole density in single layer graphene (SLG). The molecular photodesorption and absorption from pristine and functionalized graphene are studied. The photodesorption induced current decrease in functionalized graphene by concentrated HNO3 becomes less significant than pristine graphene layers. We suggest this is due to the passivation of oxygen-bearing functionalities to CVD grown graphene structure defects via HNO3 functionalization, which prevents the further absorption of gas molecules.        The advance of synthesis of graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by CVD promotes their applications in the industrial level. We synthesize the graphene both on nickel thin film and copper foils by CVD, and investigate the grow kinetics, such as the effect of growth pressure on the uniformity and quality of Cu-grown graphene. By controlling the growth pressure we achieve uniform single layer graphene sheets and suggest the feasible methods of synthesizing uniform few-layer graphene. To decrease the sheet resistance, we stack the single layer graphene using layer-layer transfer technique. Highly concentrated HNO3 is employed to improve the conductivity and surface wettability of graphene layers. Four-layer graphene films with optical transmittance of 90% after HNO3 treatment are applied in organic solar cell as anode. Further, we report the fabrication of highly conductive, large surface-area 3D pillar graphene nanostructures (PGN) films from assembly of vertically aligned CNT pillars on flexible copper foils and directly employed for the application in electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC). The PGN films with MWCNTs on graphene layers, which were one-step synthesized on flexible copper foil (25 um) by CVD process, exhibit high conductivity with sheet resistance as low as 1.6 Ohm per square and high mechanical flexibility. The fabricated EDLC supercapacitor based on high surface-area PGN electrodes (563m2/g) showed high performance with high specific capacitance of 330F/g.        We demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of three dimensional heterostructures graphene hybrid nanostructures (HGN) comprising continuous large area graphene layers and ZnO nanostructures, fabricated via two-step CVD process. The material characterizations exhibit the highly crystalline ZnO nanostructures synthesized on few-layer graphene film. Ultraviolet spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicate that the CVD grown HGN layers has excellent optical properties. The electrical study on the graphene/ZnO/graphene devices suggests that graphene readily form Ohmic contact to ZnO, although rarely Shockley may exist.  The electron transport properties highly depend on the temperature. Devices show photoconductive effect under UV illumination. A combination of electrical and optical properties of graphene and ZnO building blocks in ZnO based HGN provides unique characteristics for opportunities in future optoelectronic devices.

<bold>ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION</bold><italic>Brassica tournefortii:</italic> Phenology, Interactions and Management of an Invasive Mustardby Robin Gene Marushia Doctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Plant Biology University of California, Riverside, June 2009 Dr. Jodie S. Holt, Chairperson <italic>Brassica tournefortii</italic> (Gouan), or Sahara mustard, is a nonnative, invasive annual forb currently invading the deserts of North America. Despite its increasing distribution and dominance in desert plant communities, little is known about the biology or impacts of <italic>B. tournefortii</italic>, and few options exist for management. This dissertation sought to answer three basic questions. First, this dissertation questioned "Why is <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> able to invade desert ecosystems, whereas closely-related invasive mustards are not?" Four biotypes of invasive Brassicaceae, including desert and more mesic populations of <italic>B. tournefortii</italic>, <italic>Brassica nigra</italic>, and <italic>Hirschfeldia incana</italic> were grown with climate and watering treatments over three years. Results show that all biotypes are capable of equal fitness under desert and drought conditions. Although no differences were found between mesic and desert populations of <italic>B. tournefortii</italic>, the species had a more rapid phenology than its congeners, suggesting that <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> succeeds because it can reproduce quickly. Second, this dissertation asks, "What are the interactions of <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> with native annual forbs?" Because native annuals fill a similar ecological niche, I hypothesized that <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> would have negative impacts on natives with increasing density and cover. Success of the plant community and individual native species was correlated to <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> dominance. Results show that <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> has mostly negative interactions with natives with high precipitation, but positive relationships with low precipitation, suggesting that interactions of <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> with natives change from negative to positive based on resource availability. Finally, this dissertation asks, "Can <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> be selectively managed in desert ecosystems?" This research compared hand-weeding, a common control technique, to an emergence-stage application and rosette-stage application of glyphosate, <italic>vs.</italic> no treatment. Emergence-stage application was hypothesized to selectively control <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> and other invasives by taking advantage of their non-specific germination requirements and rapid emergence. This hypothesis was supported by results showing that native cover can be maintained by applying herbicide at emergence while reducing exotic cover. Hand-weeding selectively removed <italic>B. tournefortii</italic>, but promoted annual cover and richness only underneath shrubs at a site with few other invasives present. Late herbicide produced high mortality in all species. Results suggest that herbicide can be used as a selective technique to remove most desert invasives, not just <italic>B. tournefortii</italic>. In conclusion, <italic>B. tournefortii</italic> is a unique case study for biological invasions in extreme ecosystems, and presents challenges for ecologists and land managers alike.

Systems analysis of primary Sjogren's syndrome pathogenesis in salivary glands identifies shared pathways in human and a mouse model
Abstract
Introduction
Primary Sj&#246;gren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with complex etiopathogenesis. Despite extensive studies to understand the disease process utilizing human and mouse models, the intersection between these species remains elusive. To address this gap, we utilized a novel systems biology approach to identify disease-related gene modules and signaling pathways that overlap between humans and mice.

Methods
Parotid gland tissues were harvested from 24 pSS and 16 non-pSS sicca patients and 25 controls. For mouse studies, salivary glands were harvested from C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice at various times during development of pSS-like disease. RNA was analyzed with Affymetrix HG U133+2.0 arrays for human samples and with MOE430+2.0 arrays for mouse samples. The images were processed with Affymetrix software. Weighted-gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify disease-related and functional pathways.

Results
Nineteen co-expression modules were identified in human parotid tissue, of which four were significantly upregulated and three were downregulated in pSS patients compared with non-pSS sicca patients and controls. Notably, one of the human disease-related modules was highly preserved in the mouse model, and was enriched with genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further comparison between these two species led to the identification of genes associated with leukocyte recruitment and germinal center formation.

Conclusion
Our systems biology analysis of genome-wide expression data from salivary gland tissue of pSS patients and from a pSS mouse model identified common dysregulated biological pathways and molecular targets underlying critical molecular alterations in pSS pathogenesis.

Desalination-of water by vapor-phase transport through hydrophobic nanopores
We propose a new approach to desalination of water whereby a pressure difference across a vapor-trapping nanopore induces selective transport of water by isothermal evaporation and condensation across the pore. Transport of water through a nanopore with saline water on one side and pure water on the other side under a pressure difference was theoretically analyzed under the rarefied gas assumption using a probabilistic framework that accounts for diffuse scattering from the pore walls as well as reflection from the menisci. The analysis revealed that in addition to salinity, temperature, and pressure difference, the nanopore aspect ratio and the probability of condensation of a water molecule incident on a meniscus from the vapor phase, known as the condensation coefficient, are key determinants of flux. The effect of condensation coefficient on mass flux becomes critical when the aspect ratio is small. However, the mass flux becomes independent of the condensation coefficient as the pore aspect ratio increases, converging to the Knudsen flux for long nanopores. For design of a nanopore membrane that can trap vapor, a minimum aspect ratio is derived for which coalescence of the two interfaces on either side of the nanopore remains energetically unfavorable. Based on this design criterion, the analysis suggests that mass flux in the range of 20–70 g/msuperscript 2 s may be feasible if the system is operated at temperatures in the range of 30–50 °C. The proposed approach further decouples transport properties from material properties of the membrane, which opens the possibility of engineering membranes with appropriate materials that may lead to reverse osmosis membranes with improved flux, better selectivity, and high chlorine resistance.

An integrative approach to the identification of Arabidopsis and rice genes involved in xylan and secondary wall development
Xylans constitute the major non-cellulosic component of plant biomass. Xylan biosynthesis is particularly pronounced in cells with secondary walls, implying that the synthesis network consists of a set of highly expressed genes in such cells. To improve the understanding of xylan biosynthesis, we performed a comparative analysis of co-expression networks between Arabidopsis and rice as reference species with different wall types. Many co-expressed genes were represented by orthologs in both species, which implies common biological features, while some gene families were only found in one of the species, and therefore likely to be related to differences in their cell walls. To predict the subcellular location of the identified proteins, we developed a new method, PFANTOM (plant protein family information-based predictor for endomembrane), which was shown to perform better for proteins in the endomembrane system than other available prediction methods. Based on the combined approach of co-expression and predicted cellular localization, we propose a model for Arabidopsis and rice xylan synthesis in the Golgi apparatus and signaling from plasma membrane to nucleus for secondary cell wall differentiation. As an experimental validation of the model, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant in the PGSIP1 gene encoding one of the Golgi localized candidate proteins has a highly decreased content of glucuronic acid in secondary cell walls and substantially reduced xylan glucuronosyltransferase activity.

Random graphs with attribute affinity
In this thesis, we study problems related to random graphs generated via attribute affinity. A random graph with attribute affinity is a graph for which we associate to each vertex an attribute vector from an alphabet Gamma, and generate edges randomly, where the probability of an edge is determined by comparing the attributes of the associated vectors. In particular, we shall do the following : 1. For general random graphs in which the probability that v/i ̃ v/j is p/i, we develop a technique for obtaining concentration of both the adjacency and normalized Laplacian eigenvalues. This technique can be used to asymptotically establish the spectra of a stochastic Kronecker graph, an affinity graph with vertex set fixed at Gamma/t. 2. We then generalize these results to a multiplicative attribute graph, an attribute affinity model in which the vertex set is chosen randomly from Gamma/t. Specifically, we can determine asymptotically the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues in this regime. This allows us to determine asymptotic bounds on the diameter of the graph, which was shown to be asymptotically constant by Kim and Leskovec. 3. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of a giant component of a stochastic Kronecker graph with Gamma = {0, 1}. Moreover, the proof is adapted to establish the uniqueness and asymptotic size of such a component. This extends previous work of Mahdian and Xu, in which necessary and sufficient conditions were established in certain cases. 4. Using techniques similar to those for the spectrum, we can determine the uniqueness and asymptotic size of a giant component in a multiplicative attribute graph, when it exists. Conditions on the emergence of the component were established by Kim and Leskovec

Additionally, floral nectar from <italic>P. x fraseri</italic> and honeydew from<italic> A. gossypii</italic> had a statistically similar effect on the longevity, fecundity, percent emergence, and sex ratio of <italic>A. colemani</italic> and enhanced the parasitoid more than extrafloral nectar from <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic>.  In common garden field studies, <italic>A. colemani</italic> remained for the entire seven days tested in the presences of resources while in the absence of resources, the parasitoid was detected for only 3 days.  Further field studies using floral food of<italic> P. x fraseri</italic>, honeydew of <italic>A. gossypii</italic>, and a flowers x aphids treatment were conducted to determine the effects on the abundance and movement of the parasitoid in a common garden.  Significantly more parasitoids were initially associated with flowers x aphids treatment 24 h post release.  This was followed by a switch to the aphids treatment 1 week later.  Parasitoids were found in both the treatment plots and associated crop plots (no resources) suggesting that <italic>A. colemani</italic> moves in search of resources and may be switch-foraging to maximize fitness.  Imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide commonly used in nursery systems, was detected in the xylem, nectar, pollen, and leaves of <italic>P. x fraseri</italic> treated with a full or half label rate.  The concentration of imidacloprid detected in the xylem and nectar was greater than the determined LC<sub>50</sub>, LC<sub>75</sub>, and LC<sub>90</sub> of imidacloprid for <italic>A. colemani</italic>.  Bioassay data suggested the survival of the parasitoid is negatively impacted by feeding on nectar from imidacloprid treated plants.  No effect was observed when the parasitoid was exposed to leaves from imidacloprid treated plants.  These findings suggest that soil-applied imidacloprid is moderately compatible with biological control due to toxicity occurring through contact with nectar from treated plants rather than direct exposure.

Cell extrinsic consequences of epithelial stress: activation of pro-tumorigenic tissue phenotypes
Abstract
Introduction
Tumors are characterized by alterations in the epithelial and stromal compartments, which both contribute to tumor promotion. However, where, when, and how the tumor stroma develops is still poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that DNA damage or telomere malfunction induces an activin A-dependent epithelial stress response that activates cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic consequences in mortal, nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs and vHMECs). Here we show that this epithelial stress response also induces protumorigenic phenotypes in neighboring primary fibroblasts, recapitulating many of the characteristics associated with formation of the tumor stroma (for example, desmoplasia).

Methods
The contribution of extrinsic and intrinsic DNA damage to acquisition of desmoplastic phenotypes was investigated in primary human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) co-cultured with vHMECs with telomere malfunction (TRF2-vHMEC) or in HMFs directly treated with DNA-damaging agents, respectively. Fibroblast reprogramming was assessed by monitoring increases in levels of selected protumorigenic molecules with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunocytochemistry. Dependence of the induced phenotypes on activin A was evaluated by addition of exogenous activin A or activin A silencing. In vitro findings were validated in vivo, in preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions by using immunohistochemistry and telomere-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization.

Results
HMFs either cocultured with TRF2-vHMEC or directly exposed to exogenous activin A or PGE2 show increased expression of cytokines and growth factors, deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and a shift toward aerobic glycolysis. In turn, these "activated" fibroblasts secrete factors that promote epithelial cell motility. Interestingly, cell-intrinsic DNA damage in HMFs induces some, but not all, of the molecules induced as a consequence of cell-extrinsic DNA damage. The response to cell-extrinsic DNA damage characterized in vitro is recapitulated in vivo in DCIS lesions, which exhibit telomere loss, heightened DNA damage response, and increased activin A and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. These lesions are surrounded by a stroma characterized by increased expression of &#945; smooth muscle actin and endothelial and immune cell infiltration.

Conclusions
Thus, synergy between stromal and epithelial interactions, even at the initiating stages of carcinogenesis, appears necessary for the acquisition of malignancy and provides novel insights into where, when, and how the tumor stroma develops, allowing new therapeutic strategies.

Indium Antimonide Nanowires: Synthesis, Characterization, and Applications
Indium Antimonide (InSb) nanowires with a diameter ranging from 30 nm to 200 nm, were synthesized by electrochemical disposition in anodized alumina and polycarbonate porous membranes. In addition, epitaxial single crystalline InSb nanowires with diameters ranging from 5 nm to 100 nm, were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using Au nanoparticles as catalyst. Structural and material characterization of InSb nanowires was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrical characterization of InSb nanowires was conducted by fabricating nanowire field effect transistors (FETs) by electron-beam lithography and direct metal deposition assisted by focused ion-beam (FIB). Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) was employed in current-voltage (I-V) measurements of InSb nanowires as a local contact electrode measuring conductivity of a short cannel InSb nanowire. In addition, CAFM probe tip was also used as a local gate electrode to InSb nanowire FET. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements were conducted to elucidate the transport mechanism through the metal contact-nanowire junction. Rapid thermal annealing was applied for fabricating Ohmic contacts to InSb nanowires. Depletion mode n-type back-gated FETs based on CVD grown InSb nanowires, exhibited high I<subr>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF</sub> ratio of 10<super>6</super>, a subthreshold slope as low as 90 mV/dec, and electron mobility as high as 110 cm<super>2</super>V<super>-1</super>s<super>-1</super>. Diameter-dependent dependent I-V measurements were performed on the InSb nanowires, revealing the correlation between electron mobility, doping concentrations and nanowire diameter. InSb nanowire-based FET chemical sensors were used for detection of water, Isopropanol, and Acetone vapors. The mechanism of operation of these sensor devices was investigated. In addition, Pt nanoparticle decorated InSb nanowire sensors were employed for detection of 0.1% H<sub>2</sub> gas. The performance of InSb nanowire sensor was compared to a graphene-based Hydrogen sensor.

5¿ tRNA halves are present as abundant complexes in serum, concentrated in blood cells, and modulated by aging and calorie restriction
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Small RNAs complex with proteins to mediate a variety of functions in animals and plants. Some small RNAs, particularly miRNAs, circulate in mammalian blood and may carry out a signaling function by entering target cells and modulating gene expression. The subject of this study is a set of circulating 30&#8211;33 nt RNAs that are processed derivatives of the 5&#8242; ends of a small subset of tRNA genes, and closely resemble cellular tRNA derivatives (tRFs, tiRNAs, half-tRNAs, 5&#8242; tRNA halves) previously shown to inhibit translation initiation in response to stress in cultured cells.
				
				
					
						Results
					In sequencing small RNAs extracted from mouse serum, we identified abundant 5&#8242; tRNA halves derived from a small subset of tRNAs, implying that they are produced by tRNA type-specific biogenesis and/or release. The 5&#8242; tRNA halves are not in exosomes or microvesicles, but circulate as particles of 100&#8211;300 kDa. The size of these particles suggest that the 5&#8242; tRNA halves are a component of a macromolecular complex; this is supported by the loss of 5&#8242; tRNA halves from serum or plasma treated with EDTA, a chelating agent, but their retention in plasma anticoagulated with heparin or citrate. A survey of somatic tissues reveals that 5&#8242; tRNA halves are concentrated within blood cells and hematopoietic tissues, but scant in other tissues, suggesting that they may be produced by blood cells. Serum levels of specific subtypes of 5&#8242; tRNA halves change markedly with age, either up or down, and these changes can be prevented by calorie restriction.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					We demonstrate that 5&#8242; tRNA halves circulate in the blood in a stable form, most likely as part of a nucleoprotein complex, and their serum levels are subject to regulation by age and calorie restriction. They may be produced by blood cells, but their cellular targets are not yet known. The characteristics of these circulating molecules, and their known function in suppression of translation initiation, suggest that they are a novel form of signaling molecule.

Impact of homologous and non-homologous recombination in the genomic evolution of Escherichia coli
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
						Escherichia coli is an important species of bacteria that can live as a harmless inhabitant of the guts of many animals, as a pathogen causing life-threatening conditions or freely in the non-host environment. This diversity of lifestyles has made it a particular focus of interest for studies of genetic variation, mainly with the aim to understand how a commensal can become a deadly pathogen. Many whole genomes of E. coli have been fully sequenced in the past few years, which offer helpful data to help understand how this important species evolved.
				
				
					
						Results
					We compared 27 whole genomes encompassing four phylogroups of Escherichia coli (A, B1, B2 and E). From the core-genome we established the clonal relationships between the isolates as well as the role played by homologous recombination during their evolution from a common ancestor. We found strong evidence for sexual isolation between three lineages (A+B1, B2, E), which could be explained by the ecological structuring of E. coli and may represent on-going speciation. We identified three hotspots of homologous recombination, one of which had not been previously described and contains the aroC gene, involved in the essential shikimate metabolic pathway. We also described the role played by non-homologous recombination in the pan-genome, and showed that this process was highly heterogeneous. Our analyses revealed in particular that the genomes of three enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) strains within phylogroup B1 have converged from originally separate backgrounds as a result of both homologous and non-homologous recombination.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Recombination is an important force shaping the genomic evolution and diversification of E. coli, both by replacing fragments of genes with an homologous sequence and also by introducing new genes. In this study, several non-random patterns of these events were identified which correlated with important changes in the lifestyle of the bacteria, and therefore provide additional evidence to explain the relationship between genomic variation and ecological adaptation.

[cell, actin, chapter, model, adhesion]

Computational models on cell migration
Cell migration is one of the most intriguing areas in cell biology and has attracted many interdisciplinary studies. It is regulated by complex biochemical signaling networks and comprises many mechanical processes, including protrusion, adhesion, translocation of the cell body and retraction of the rear. This dissertation starts with the signaling pathway that senses external chemoattractant, specifically, the Ras pathway (Chapter 2). We found that the response of an activated Ras shows near perfect adaptation. We attempted to fit the results using mathematical models for the two possible simple network topologies that can provide perfect adaptation. Only one, the incoherent feedforward network, is able to accurately describe the experimental results. This analysis revealed that adaptation in this Ras pathway is achieved through the proportional activation of upstream components and not through negative feedback loops. From Chapter 3 to Chapter 5, we integrated chemical reactions inside the cell with the mechanical process of cell migration. In Chapter 3, we set up a framework, based on phase field method, to describe the cell shape and the chemical reactions in a moving cell. Under this framework, we developed a computational model on cell morphodynamics in Chapter 4. Our model incorporates the membrane bending force and the surface tension and enforces a constant area. Furthermore, it implements a cross linked actin filament field and an actin bundle field that are responsible for the protrusion and retraction forces, respectively. The model was successfully applied to fish keratocytes and Dictystelium cells. In Chapter 5, we studied the coupling between adhesion mechanism and actin flow in keratocytes. The adhesion mechanism incorporated both the gripping mode and the slipping mode. The model-predicted maps of actin flow, substrate stress and the alignment between the two are quantitatively consistent with experimental observations. Furthermore, we explored the phase diagram of cell migration by varying myosin II and adhesion strength. Our model suggested that the pattern of the actin flow inside the cell, the cell velocity and the cell shape are determined by the integration of actin polymerization, myosin contraction, the adhesion and membrane forces

[ligand, coordination, ditopic, heteroscorpionate, metal, structure]

Coordination polymers and building blocks based on ditopic heteroscorpionate ligands
Ditopic heteroscorpionate ligands emerge as attractive from the point of view of crystal engineering because of their potential coordination versatility. By placing the donor group in a phenyl-substituted heteroscorpionate in a para or meta position rather than an ortho arrangement, we change the ligand from a facially coordinating tripodal one favoring mononuclear complexes, into one capable of bridging interactions-possibly leading to multidimensional metallosupramolecular structures. To this end, using our standard synthetic methodology, we have prepared three new ditopic heteroscorpionate ligands that have either OH or COOH groups located on the meta or para positions of the aromatic ring. We showed that the new heteroscorpionate ligands, designated L3c (m-carboxy) and L4c (p-carboxy), can adopt a variety of coordination modes toward Cu(II), Co(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II) which depend on the coordination geometry preferences of the metal ion, solvent polarity, the presence of anions, and pH. Under high pH conditions, the dominant species are dinuclear complexes of stoichiometry M₂L₂Z₂ or M₂L₄. These building blocks can be linked together to form interesting coordination polymers. By substitution of the simple monodentate "Z" ligands with ditopic linkers such as terephthalate or biphenyldicarboxylate, we developed 1- and 2-D polymeric structures. An alternate strategy for producing higher dimensional structures is to make use of H-bonding. We have found that as the pH is lowered so that either a mixture of protonated and deprotonated or completely protonated species are present, mononuclear metal complexes form where the coordination of the ligand is strictly through the pyrazole nitrogens leaving the uncoordinated carboxylates to engage in H-bonding interactions between molecules in the solid state. Similar chemistry was obtained by using ditopic ligand designated as L5v, where the presence of different anions (i.e. BF₄-С , CF₃SO₃-С, NO₃-С, or SbF₆-С) lead to different crystal packing schemes due to different H-bonding patterns that depend on the relative charge delocalization and/or shape of the anion. Since the metal monomers (tectons) possess chirality due to the asymmetric coordination of the achiral ligands to the metal Ni (II) or Ag (I), all of the solid-state materials were isolated as racemic mixtures or as mesohelical structures

[spine, cofilin, dendritic, neuron, activity, mature, remodeling]

The Regulation of Dendritic Spine Plasticity by EphB and N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptors Through Spatial Control Over Cofilin Activity in Mature Hippocampal Neurons
Dendritic spines are the post-synaptic sites of most excitatory synapses in the brain, and changes in their morphology are implicated in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. F-actin dynamics are thought to be a basis for both the formation of dendritic spines during development and their structural plasticity (Ethell and Pasquale, 2005; Pontrello and Ethell, 2009). We have shown that the F-actin-severing protein cofilin, which is regulated by phosphorylation, can induce remodeling of mature dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons (Shi <italic>et al</italic>., 2009). We also demonstrate that &beta;-Arrestins play an important role in spatial control over cofilin activity in dendritic spines, which underlies NMDA-mediated dendritic spine remodeling. Cofilin activity in dendritic spines is regulated through CaMKII-mediated suppression of cofilin activity by phosphorylation, and calcineurin-dependent cofilin activation through its dephosphorylation. In addition, while the EphB receptor promotes spine stabilization through cofilin inactivation, the NMDA receptor prevents EphB-mediated cofilin inactivation through calcineurin. NMDAR activation also promotes the translocation of cofilin to dendritic spines, an event that requires cofilin dephosphorylation and is also dependent on &beta;-Arrestins, which have recently been shown to scaffold cofilin with its regulators, LIM kinase and slingshot phosphatase (Zoudilova <italic>et al</italic>., 2010). Our studies demonstrate that cofilin clustering in the spines is affected in both &beta;-Arrestin1- and &beta;-Arrestin2- deficient neurons under normal synaptic activity, and a constitutively-active cofilin<super>S3A</super> mutant fails to translocate to spines in response to NMDA in &beta;-Arrestin2 KO neurons. Moreover, while wt neurons display dendritic spine remodeling in response to NMDA or with over-expression of cofilin<super>S3A</super>, &beta;-Arrestin2-deficient neurons are resistant to both NMDA-induced and cofilin<super>S3A</super>-induced spine remodeling. In contrast, dominant-negative cofilin<super>S3D</super> prevents NMDA-induced dendritic spine remodeling in wt neurons, and also rescues a mature spine phenotype that is lost in &beta;-Arrestin1 KO neurons. In addition, over-expression of &beta;-Arrestin in the KO neurons rescues spine abnormalities. &beta;-Arrestin1-deficient neurons also develop immature spines  <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas hippocampal neurons lacking &beta;-Arrestin2 develop normal mature spines, but fail to remodel in response to NMDA. Our studies demonstrate novel functions of &beta;-Arrestin1 in the development of mature dendritic spines, and &beta;-Arrestin2 in NMDAR-mediated dendritic spine plasticity through spatial control over cofilin activity.

[e-tmod, erythrocyte, network, membrane]

Role of erythrocyte tropomodulin in the biomechanics and topology of the erythrocyte membrane skeletal network
The erythrocyte membrane skeleton is a multi-protein complex providing mechanical properties and stability to erythrocytes. Defects in the skeleton can manifest in dysfunction and disease such as hemolytic anemia. Erythrocyte tropomodulin (E-Tmod) is a slow-growing end actin-capping protein and has been proposed that together with tropomyosin 5 or 5b they form a "molecular ruler" which dictates protofilament length of 37 nm in the network. In this study, the role for E-Tmod in the network organization and erythrocyte mechanics was investigated. The embryonic lethality of the E-Tmod⁻/⁻ mice was rescued by breeding with E-Tmod overexpressing transgenic (TOT) mice. The morphological changes in E-Tmod⁻/⁻ erythrocytes and the topology of the network were evaluated using light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of E-Tmod⁻/⁻ erythrocytes were quantified using micropipette aspiration and ektacytometry. Blood count analyses of E-Tmod⁻/⁻ erythrocytes showed a lower mean corpuscular volume (p < 0.015) and a higher percentage of MuRBCs (p < 0.01) indicating mild spherocytosis. TEM analysis revealed a more compacted network with smaller openings. The denser network could be caused by membrane loss due to the irregular actin filament lengths without the regulation of E-Tmod. During circulation, such irregularity may have resulted in altered stress-strain distribution across spectrin tetramers in the network. Without the proper support of the network some lipid bilayer may be lost, resulting mild spherocytosis and increased oxidative stress. Approximately 10 times more dimerization of the 29 -kDa isoform of E-Tmod was detected in the cytosol as compared to E-Tmod⁺/⁺ and E-Tmod⁺/⁻ counterparts. In micropipette aspiration, E-Tmod⁻/⁻ erythrocytes had a higher elastic shear modulus of 7 pN/Mum versus 5 pN/ Mum for E-Tmod⁺/⁺ and E-Tmod⁺/⁻ erythrocytes. Ektacytometry also showed they were more rigid, having a lower integrated elongation index p < 0.0001). Both findings could be linked to spherocytosis or oxidation of the network. These findings demonstrate the importance of E-Tmod in the organization of the network and the cellular deformability. Without it, erythrocytes can suffer from loss of membrane, denser membrane skeleton, becoming spherocytic, as well as greater oxidative stress, and consequently, significantly less deformable than normal erythrocytes

Bulk metallic glasses and their composites : composition optimization, thermal stability, and microstructural tunability
A design protocol utilizing common elements for bulk metallic glass formation has been employed to develop novel, low cost Fe-, and Ti- based bulk metallic glasses. A critical obstacle that was successfully overcome in this work is the omission of beryllium in these alloys. Beryllium is of vital importance in many bulk metallic glass forming systems, but it is expensive and poses considerable health risks. Bulk metallic glasses in these novel Fe-, and Ti-based systems exhibit extremely high mechanical strength and excellent thermal stability. Devitrification and cooling rate experiments were used to identify crystalline phase formation and assess activation energy for crystallization, as well as to explore and develop ductile BMG composites. To better control microstructure in these BMG composites, a novel processing technique, called semi-solid forging was developed, wherein the alloy melt is heated to above the melt temperature of the glass, but below the melt temperature of the ductile crystalline phase. Such an approach permits the maintenance of a glassy, or nanocrystalline matrix phase, while simultaneously coarsening and homogenizing the ductile, secondary phase. This processing approach leads to enhanced ductility in the alloys, which, to this point, has not been observed using conventional casting methods. The combination of novel, low-cost, alloy compositions with semi-solid forging has been successfully utilized to develop new high strength structural materials with enhanced ductility and toughness. Microstrutural and mechanical properties of these novel, toughened, BMG composites are presented. A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between deformation mechanisms and microstructure reveals that enhanced ductility is predicated on matching fundamental mechanical and microstructural length scales in a Ti-Ni-Si-Mo BMG composite. Under optimized microstructural conditions, a maximum compressive strength exceeding 2400 MPa with ̃30% total strain to failure was achieved. Furthermore, a 400% increase in fracture toughness over the monolithic glass, and tensile ductility of 3.5% were observed. The design of conventional, crystalline, high-performance structural materials is governed by optimizing combinations of mechanical properties such as strength, ductility, toughness, and elasticity. In general though, high strength comes at the expense of ductility. The development of ductile BMG composites represents the dawn of a new era in structural materials that couples ultra high strength with considerable ductility and enhanced fracture toughness

Micrometeorite Impacts in Beringian Mammoth Tusks and a Bison Skull
We have discovered what appear to be micrometeorites imbedded in seven late Pleistocene Alaskan mammoth tusks and a Siberian bison skull. The micrometeorites apparently shattered on impact leaving 2 to 5 mm hemispherical debris patterns surrounded by carbonized rings. Multiple impacts are observed on only one side of the tusks and skull consistent with the micrometeorites having come from a single direction. The impact sites are strongly magnetic indicating significant iron content. We analyzed several imbedded micrometeorite fragments from both tusks and skull with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). These analyses confirm the high iron content and indicate compositions highly enriched in nickel and depleted in titanium, unlike any natural terrestrial sources. In addition, electron microprobe (EMP) analyses of a Fe-Ni sulfide grain (tusk 2) show it contains between 3 and 20 weight percent Ni. Prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA) of a particle extracted from the bison skull indicates ~;;0.4 mg of iron, in agreement with a micrometeorite ~;;1 mm in diameter. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and XRF analyses of the skull show possible entry channels containing Fe-rich material. The majority of tusks (5/7) have a calibrated weighted mean 14C age of 32.9 +- 1.8 ka BP, which coincides with the onset of significant declines <36 ka ago in Beringian bison, horse, brown bear, and mammoth populations, as well as in mammoth genetic diversity. It appears likely that the impacts and population declines are related events, although their precise nature remains to be determined.

Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: a cross-sectional single-centre experience with bone histomorphometry and quantitative computed tomography
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a rare condition of poorly understood etiology and pathophysiology that affects otherwise healthy children. This condition is characterized clinically by bone pain and vertebral fractures; spontaneous recovery is observed after puberty in the majority of cases. Although decreased trabecular bone turnover has been noted previously, cortical and trabecular bone characteristics as determined by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and their relationship to bone histomorphometry are unknown.
				
				
					
						Methods
					All children with a clinical diagnosis of IJO who were followed in our center since 1995 and who had undergone at least one diagnostic bone biopsy were included in this cross-sectional analysis.
				
				
					
						Results
					Fifteen patients (11 males/4 females) with median ages of 5.8 and 10.2&#160;years at first symptoms and at referral, respectively, were included in the analysis. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated decreased trabecular bone turnover (BFR/BS) in the majority of patients with heterogeneous parameters of trabecular mineralization and volume. QCTresults demonstrated that bone mineral density (BMD) was reduced in both trabecular/lumbar and cortical/femoral bone: Z score: -2.1 (&#8722;3.6;&#8211;1.0) and &#8722;0.9 (&#8722;8.2;1.4)in the two compartments, respectively. In the eight patients who underwent both bone biopsy and QCT, cortical BMD was associated with trabecular separation and with trabecular bone formation rate (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.898 and &#8722;0.881, respectively, both p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05).
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					This series confirms that IJO is characterized by impaired trabecular architecture that can be detected by both bone biopsy and QCT. The association between bone biopsy and QCT results may have implications for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of these children.

Biophysical and biochemical regulation of the shape, size, and maturity of calf articular cartilage
Cartilage develops specific forms, sizes, and functional properties under the guidance of naturally present biophysical and biochemical stimuli during in vivo growth and maturation. Analogously, controlling the physical and biochemical environment of cartilage during culture may facilitate the in vitro manipulation of tissue properties. This dissertation explores flexural deformation as a physical stimulus capable of inducing changes in the free- swelling shape of articular cartilage explants and specific biochemical agents in modulating the shape plasticity, size, and maturity of cartilage through altered matrix metabolism and remodeling. The bulk of the work described herein was conducted with a model system of immature articular cartilage explants from bovine calves, with consideration of the potential translation of the experimental approaches to other native and engineered chondral tissues. A system for analyzing mechanically- induced reshaping of cartilage was developed through the creation of a novel bioreactor to apply flexure to cartilage explants and a means of sensitively quantifying specimen shape. Using these tools, static flexure was shown to produce significant changes in the free-swelling shape of cartilage in a duration-dependent manner. The flexural stimulus was characterized with micromechanical strain analysis techniques, and the observed asymmetrical strain distributions within the tissue were found to be a result of the pronounced tension-compression nonlinearity of cartilage mechanical properties. Inhibitors of chondrocyte and cartilage extracellular matrix metabolism were used to probe potential mechanisms of cartilage reshaping, and findings indicated that the process of reshaping was largely independent of chondrocyte-mediated matrix synthesis or remodeling. However, a strong temperature-dependent response suggested a possible biophysical mechanism of matrix remodeling. Altering matrix metabolism and remodeling by supplementing cultures with specific biochemical agents or growth factors resulted in changes in tissue composition with respect to the predominant collagen and glycosaminoglycan matrix components. These treatments differentially modulated cartilage volume and functional properties, including shape plasticity and mechanical properties in compression. These studies further elucidate the regulation of the shape, size, and maturity of cartilage by biophysical and biochemical stimuli. The tools and techniques developed here may be translatable to creating chondral grafts with desired properties for joint repair or craniofacial reconstruction

Somatosensory Neuron Subtypes and Sensory Transduction in Larval Zebrafish
Larval zebrafish are emerging as a model for describing the development and function of simple neural circuits.  To analyze somatosensory neuron diversity in larval zebrafish, we identified several enhancers from the zebrafish and pufferfish genomes and used them to create five new reporter transgenes.  Sequential deletions of three of these enhancers identified small sequence elements sufficient to drive expression in zebrafish trigeminal and Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons.  One of these reporters highlighted a somatosensory neuron subtype that expressed both the p2rx3a and pkca; genes, as well as a previously described trpA1b reporter. To determine whether neurons of this subtype possess characteristic peripheral branching morphologies or central axon projection patterns, we analyzed the morphology of single neurons.  Surprisingly, although these analyses revealed diversity in peripheral axon branching and central axon projection, PKCa/p2rx3a/trpA1b-expressing RB cells did not possess characteristic morphological features, suggesting that even within this molecularly defined subtype, individual neurons may possess distinct properties.  Due to their external fertilization, rapid development, and optical clarity, zebrafish larvae are particularly well suited for optogenetic approaches to investigate neural circuit function.  Here we demonstrate a procedure for expressing a light-sensitive ion channel in larval zebrafish somatosensory neurons, photo-activating single cells, and recording the resulting behaviors. Specifically, we created a transgene using a somatosensory neuron enhancer to drive the expression of the tagged channelrhodopsin variant, ChEF-tdTomato.  Illuminating identified cells in these animals with light from a 473 nm DPSS laser, guided through a fiber optic cable, elicited behaviors that can be recorded with a high-speed video camera and analyzed quantitatively. By introducing a few modifications to previously established methods, this approach was used to elicit behavioral responses from single neurons activated up to at least 4 days post-fertilization (dpf).  The new transgenes created in this study will be powerful tools for further characterizing the molecular, morphological, and development diversity of larval somatosensory neurons and in combination with genetic or pharmacological perturbations will be a powerful way to investigate circuit formation and function.

Time course and progression of wild type ¿-Synuclein accumulation in a transgenic mouse model
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					
					Progressive accumulation of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;-Syn) protein in different brain regions is a hallmark of synucleinopathic diseases, such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. &#945;-Syn transgenic mouse models have been developed to investigate the effects of &#945;-Syn accumulation on behavioral deficits and neuropathology. However, the onset and progression of pathology in &#945;-Syn transgenic mice have not been fully characterized. For this purpose we investigated the time course of behavioral deficits and neuropathology in PDGF-&#946; human wild type &#945;-Syn transgenic mice (D-Line) between 3 and 12 months of age.
				
				
					
						Results
					
					These mice showed progressive impairment of motor coordination of the limbs that resulted in significant differences compared to non-transgenic littermates at 9 and 12 months of age. Biochemical and immunohistological analyses revealed constantly increasing levels of human &#945;-Syn in different brain areas. Human &#945;-Syn was expressed particularly in somata and neurites of a subset of neocortical and limbic system neurons. Most of these neurons showed immunoreactivity for phosphorylated human &#945;-Syn confined to nuclei and perinuclear cytoplasm. Analyses of the phenotype of &#945;-Syn expressing cells revealed strong expression in dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons, subsets of GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic principal cells throughout the telencephalon. We also found human &#945;-Syn expression in immature neurons of both the ventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream, but not in the dentate gyrus.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					
					The present study demonstrates that the PDGF-&#946; &#945;-Syn transgenic mouse model presents with early and progressive accumulation of human &#945;-Syn that is accompanied by motor deficits. This information is essential for the design of therapeutical studies of synucleinopathies.

Characteristics of Graphitic Films for Carbon Based Magnetism and Electronics
This dissertation concentrates on the characteristics of graphene, a single layer of graphite, defined as two-dimensional material for carbon based magnetism and electronics.  Carbon materials, which are demonstrated by diamond and graphite, have always been of great interest for their unique properties.  Moreover, in the last two decades, there have been three revolutionary milestones in the development of carbon materials, which were related to the discovery of fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, respectively.  Such research evolution led to the realization of the feasibility to tailor magnetic and electronic properties of graphitic sheets.  Magnetism of carbon materials is of particular interest because of its new and relatively unexplored origins.  The technological potential of the new materials is enormous as they promise to become the first room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors - the Holy Grail of the world of electronics.  Not to mention that the existence of the new materials is vital for the emerging field of spintronics.  Researchers believe that new carbon-based magnetic materials could greatly extend the limits of current technologies relying on magnetic and semiconducting properties.  In this work, the magnetic properties of pristine graphene and chemically modified graphene were mainly investigated.  The chemical functionalization with nitrophenyl (NP) groups was performed by covalent attachment of aryl groups to the basal plane of carbon atoms.  The functionalized samples were found to be in mixed state of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states with spins aligned in the main plane at room temperature.  Based on these findings, this work attempted to identify the origins of the intrinsic magnetism and potential ways to tailor magnetism in graphene.  Such technology has great potential to pave a way to the next-generation technologies containing high-speed and high-density nonvolatile memory as well as the production of reconfigurable logic devices, integrated magneto-optical devices, quantum information devices, and many devices.

Large-Area Quality Control of Atomically-Thin Layered Materials
Fast progress in chemical vapor deposition of graphene and other quasi-two-dimensional layered materials such as topological insulators call for development of a reliable high-throughput method of layered materials identification and quality control. The number of atomic planes in graphene or other ultra-thin films has to be determined very fast and over large wafer-scale areas. The previously existed methods of accurate counting of the number of atomic planes in few-layer graphene were primarily based on micro-Raman spectroscopy. These methods were local, slow, and could not be scaled up to characterize the whole wafers. In this dissertation research I proposed and developed an automatic approach for graphene inspection over the wafer-size areas. The proposed method can be scaled up for industrial use. It is based on the image processing analysis of the pseudo-color contrasts uniquely assigned to each few-layer graphene region characterized by a specific number of atomic planes. The initial calibration of the technique is performed with the help of micro-Raman spectroscopy. The image processing is also used to account for the lighting non-uniformity of the samples. Implementation of the technique developed in this dissertation research reduces the cost and time required for graphene identification and quality assessment, and can become the next major impetus for practical applications of graphene, few-layer graphene and other atomically-thin films. The technique was tested on mechanically exfoliated graphene and then extended to the chemical-vapor-deposited graphene, and to bismuth telluride topological insulator thin films. The second part of the dissertation research deals with development of the electrostatic transfer process. The investigated approach allows one to transfer the patterned few-layer graphene films controllably to Si3N4 substrates compatible with other materials. The large-area quality control and graphene transfer techniques developed in this dissertation research are important for the proposed practical applications of graphene in electronics and optoelectronics.

The Folding and Binding Partners of the Perlecan SEA Module
Sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin (SEA) modules are small folds within large heavily glycosylated modular proteins.  Because decreased expression of SEA-containing proteins such as perlecan (PLN) can lead to diseases such as Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), characteristics of the PLN SEA module including folding, potential for autocleavage, and protein binding were studied.  Sequence analyses, recombinant protein evaluation, and a yeast two-hybrid screen were used to study the PLN SEA module and compare it to the mucin (MUC) 1 SEA module.  In silico modeling of the PLN SEA module demonstrated a well conserved α/β sandwich fold.  Experiments with expressed proteins showed that unlike MUC1, the PLN SEA module does not autocleave. Two-hybrid screening identified four “high confidence” proteins as potential binding partners which were explored in preliminary experiments.   Together, these results demonstrate that PLN SEA module is unique and its properties cannot be generalized with other SEA module proteins such as MUC1.

Image cytometry classifiers : isolation of cancer cells from blood and morphometric characterization of cytotoxicity in high content screening
Advances in microscopy have made the automatic acquisition of large volumes of images from biological specimens a routine. In high content screening (HCS), databases of cytometric measurements from cell images can be easily made. The transformation of such cytometric data into biological knowledge is the general aim of this dissertation. One such transformation can help detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood based only on their morphology. CTCs travel from a primary tumor to settle in a metastatic site and form more tumors. Enabling the detection of CTCs can help characterize metastatic behavior and improve cancer diagnosis. Here, the use of neural networks in detecting CTCs based on nuclear morphology alone was explored (Chapter 1). Furthermore, various methods are proposed and tested to systematically improve the performance of such classifiers (Chapter 2). Additionally, since the method is novel, it could detect cells that may be key to the study of cancer progression but have been missed by current techniques. Therefore, it is also important to physically isolate the resultant cells to do down-stream experimentation. To accomplish this, a microscopy cell sorting instrument is developed and tested that retrieves desired cells directly from the surface of a microscopy slide with relatively high throughput (Chapter 3). Another transformation of cytometric data to biological knowledge was explored by attempting to gauge cytotoxicity using morphology alone. In HCS, hundreds of thousands of compounds are tested on cells and a desired biological response is assayed to find drug candidates. Assessing toxicity in that stage would stop the advancement of toxic candidates into more expensive testing and clinical trials. Implementing cytotoxicity assays into screens, however, is prohibitively costly. A method for mimicking the costly cytotoxicity measurements in large screens by using morphology alone is proposed and studied (Chapter 4). The method is then applied to a small screen and its performance is measured. Further, distortions often exist in screen data because of problems with preparation of microtiter plates. A median-based method has been developed and tested here to remedy this problem and make screen data statistically more viable (Chapter 5)

Study of Molecular and Biological Properties of  Citrus exocortis viroid and Dweet mottle virus
Viroids are RNA-based infectious agents that are single-stranded, covalently closed circular, non-coding and naked. For a successful systemic infection, viroid must replicate in a cell, move systemically in whole-plant. The high genetic diversity observed at the cellular level for <italic>Citrus exocortis viroid</italic> (CEVd) might be due to the absence of proof-reading activity of the host RNA polymerases and the bottlenecks, associated with systemic movement of the virus, played an important role in the observed low genetic diversity at the plant level. 	Study of molecular and biological properties of <italic>in vivo</italic> generated CEVd mutants has been approached by characterizing a single sequence variant and testing for its replication in citrus protoplasts, systemic accumulation in citron seedlings, biological properties in different experimental hosts and intra-population profile of progeny viroid within a single-host. <italic>In vivo</italic> generated CEVd mutant infection in a single plant resulted in a progeny population with distinct but closely related sequences composing a quasi-species. The study revealed the effects of mutation, selection, and genetic drift on the adaptation and extinction of CEVd RNA. The stability of the 62A+, U129A and U278A variants in their respective progeny populations indicates the phenomenon of genetic drift and fixation of a mutation in the population. Genetic structure and diversity of CEVd progeny population altered significantly with replication in different hosts and understanding these interactions may facilitate the prediction and prevention of emerging virulent strains.          The nucleotide sequence of Dweet mottle virus (DMV) was determined and compared to sequences of <italic>Citrus leaf blotch virus</italic> (CLBV) and other members of the family <italic>Alpha</italic> and <italic>Beta-flexiviridae</italic>. The DMV genome has 8747 nt excluding the poly(A) tail at the 3' end of the genome. DMV genomic RNA contains three putative open reading frames (ORFs) and untranslated regions of 73 nt at the 5' and 541 nt at 3' termini. ORF1 potentially encoding a 227.48 kDa polyprotein, which has methyltransferase, oxygenase, endo-peptidase, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domains. ORF2 encodes a movement protein of 40.25 kDa while ORF3 is the coat protein of 40.69 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis, based on RdRP core domain revealed that DMV and CLBV are closely related.

[time, point, fractional, method]

Computational efficiency of fractional diffusion using adaptive time step memory and the potential application to neural glial networks
Numerical solutions to fractional differential equations can be extremely computationally intensive due to the effect of non-local derivatives in which all previous time points contribute to the current iteration. In finite difference methods this has been approximated using the "short memory effect" where it is assumed that previous events prior to some certain time point are insignificant and thus not calculated. Here, an "adaptive time" method is presented for smooth functions that is computationally efficient and results in smaller errors during numerical simulations. Sampled points along the system's history at progressively longer intervals are assumed to reflect the values of neighboring time points. By including progressively fewer points as a function of time, a temporally "weighted" history is computed that includes contributions from the entire past of the system. This results in increased accuracy, and with fewer points actually calculated, also ensures computational efficiency. The end goal is to eventually incorporate this time-saving fractional method into a neural glial network that better-describes the mechanism of extracellular ATP diffusion that results in calcium signaling between astrocytes

Dilute Acid Hydrolysis of Oligomers in Hydrothermal Pretreatment Hydrolyzate into Monomers with High Yields
Biomass is one of the most important renewable energy which can reduce the energy consumption of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emission.  Ethanol converted from celluloses and hemicelluloses in lignocellulosic biomass by biochemical technology has great potential to replace gasoline for transportation fuels.  Hemicelluloses content abundant of fermentable five carbon sugars which can be release by thermal/chemical pretreatment process.  Dilute acid and hydrothermal pretreatment are two efficient ways to hydrolyze hemicellulose into xylose.  However, most of hemicelluloses are hydrolyzed into its oligomers form which cannot be fermented to ethanol during hydrothermal pretreatment.  Although, dilute acid pretreatment can easily hydrolyze hemicelluloses to monomeric xylose, the degradation products from xylose are dramatically increased when the pretreatment severity goes higher.  This study focus on maximizing xylose yields of pretreatment and minimizing degradation products during the process.  Two steps pretreatment was applied to achieve this goal.  The first step is hydrothermal pretreatment which convers hemicellulose into both oligomers and monomers form, and following the second step dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis at low temperature to convert oligomers into monomers with minimum degradation products.  Combine severity factor was used to estimate reaction time with certain temperature and acid concentration.  The results show that high xylose yields and low degradation products were observed.  The kinetics of oligomers hydrolysis was developed and the acid concentration and temperature effects were considered.  Rate constants (k) based on first order homogeneous kinetic models and activation energy were also estimated.  NREL biochemical ethanol conversion process was applied to estimate both capital and operating costs of the two step hemicellulose hydrolysis process.  Consequently, the dilute acid hydrolysis process convers most of the xylooligomers into xylose without forming large degradation products. And both capital and operating costs are reduced by using this two-step hemicellulose hydrolysis.

[pattern, linear, theory, potential, particle]

Pattern Formation in Particle Interactions
Large systems of particles interacting pairwise in $d$-dimensions give rise to extraordinarily rich patterns. These patterns generally occur in two types. On one hand, the particles may concentrate on a co-dimension one manifold such as a sphere in three dimensions or a ring in two dimensions. Localized, space-filling, co-dimension zero patterns can occur as well. This work develops an understanding of such patterns by exploring how the prediction and design of patterns relates to the stability and well-posedness properties of the underlying mathematical equations.At the outset we use dynamical systems theory to predict the types behaviors a given system of particles will exhibit. Specifically, we develop a non-local linear stability analysis for particles that distribute uniformly on a  $d-1$ sphere. Remarkably, this linear theory accurately characterizes the patterns in the ground states from the instabilities in the pairwise potential. We then leverage this aspect of the theory to address the issue of inverse statistical mechanics in self-assembly, i.e. the construction of a potential that will produce a desired pattern. As the linear theory indicates that potentials with a small number of spherical harmonic instabilities may produce very complex patterns, we naturally arrive at the linearized inverse statistical mechanics question: given a finite set of unstable modes, can we construct a potential that possesses precisely these linear instabilities? An affirmative answer would allow for the design of potentials with arbitrarily intricate spherical symmetries in the ground state.  We solve the linearized inverse problem in full, and present a wide variety of designed ground states. To conclude we begin the task of transferring aspects of the linear theory apply to the fully nonlinear problem.  In particular, we address the well-posedness of distribution solutions to the aggregation equation $\rho_{t} + \mathrm{div}(\rho \mathbf{u} ) = 0, \; \mathbf{u} = -\nabla V * \rho$ in $\Rd$ where the density $\rho$ concentrates on a co-dimension one manifold. When the equation for such a solution is linearly well-posed, we show that the fully non-linear evolution is also well-posed locally in time for the class of bi-Lipschitz surfaces.  In this aspect at least, the linear and non-linear theories therefore coincide.

Effects of chronic receptor blockade on intracardiac angiotensin II and aldosterone content in an angiotensin II-infused model of hypertension
Accumulation of angiotensin II (Ang II) in tissues is an Ang II receptor-mediated
process. In pigs, acute angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) reduced
the heart-to-plasma ratio of Ang II following acute infusion. However in rats,
chronic ARB treatment increased heart Ang II levels, suggesting that a
differential response to ARB treatment may exist in the mammalian heart.
Furthermore, the changes in heart aldosterone following chronic ARB treatment
are not well described. To address the discrepancy in heart Ang II
concentrations following ARB treatment, and to address the functional relevance
of increased aldosterone in the heart two studies were undertaken. The first
study consisted of three groups (n= 6) of rats, chronically studied: (1) control; (2)
angiotensin II (Ang II; 80 ng/min for 28 d); and (3) angiotensin II + olmesartan
(ARB; 10mg/kg/d for 21 d). Ang II-infusion increased intracardiac Ang II by 40%
and intrarenal Ang II over 2-fold, and chronic ARB treatment decreased Ang II by
48% in the heart and over twofold in the kidney, suggesting that accumulation of
Ang II in the heart is receptor-mediated as in the kidney. Ang II increased plasma
aldosterone 2.5-fold and was exacerbated by ARB treatment. Intracardiac
aldosterone was exacerbated by ARB treatment in the study. Suppression of
intracardiac Ang II with ARB is consistent with the existing view of Ang II
receptor-mediated uptake by tissues.
Ang II stimulates the release of aldosterone, and the chronic blockade of
the AT1 in the previous study increased aldosterone, as did the chronic blockade
of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). To evaluate the contribution of increased
aldosterone to cardiovascular damage, an MR agonist was used in a second
study, with and without an ARB to differentially assess the contributions of the
respective receptors. This study included two additional experimental groups and
a different ARB: 1) control (n=11); 2) angiotensin II (n=14), (Ang II; 80 ng/min for
28 d); 3) angiotensin II + losartan (n=17) (ARB; 10mg/kg/d for 21 d); 4)
angiotensin II + MR blocker (n=14)(EPL; 100 mg eplerenone/kg/d in diet; Pfizer,
St. Louis, MO, and 5) angiotensin II + ARB + MR blocker (Combo)(n=14).
8-isoprostane (8-iso-prostaglandin PGF2α) is a marker of oxidative
damage and studies have shown it to be correlated to risk factors in coronary
heart disease (40, 75). Nitrotyrosine is a marker of inflammation and nitrositive
damage linked to heart disease (19, 56). Measuring these biomarkers indicates
oxidative/nitrositive damage and inflammation. Blockade of the MR had no effect
on blood pressure (158.7 ± 6.9 vs 165.1 ± 15.9 Ang II), but substantially
increased cardioprotective actions demonstrated by a 57% decrease of urinary 8-
isoprostane that was further abated when combined with the ARB achieving an
additional decrease of 27%. Additionally, the nitrotyrosine concentrations were
also ameliorated by receptor blockade; the combo blockade (54% of Control)
have a 68% decrease from the Ang II (144% of Control). The data suggests that
damage to the cardiovascular system by Ang II and aldosterone occurs via their
respective receptors and in the case of aldosterone, independent from high blood
pressure. There is evidence from the combined studies that in spite of increased
aldosterone with ARB, there is a reduction in cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation
and nitrositive damage by blocking AT1 and MR. Ang II and aldosterone both
contribute to cardiovascular damage via their respective receptors and blocking
either one still resulted in decreased oxidative damage. Blocking both receptors
did seem to add some additional improvement, but not significantly. These
mechanisms may be better explained by studying the respective signaling
pathways or looking closer at local hormone production that perhaps initiate
receptor cross-talk. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate alternate
pathways.

Factors regulated by interferon gamma and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A contribute to responses that protect mice from Coccidioides immitis infection
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Coccidioidomycosis results from airborne infections caused by either Coccidioides immitis or 
						C. posadasii. Both are pathogenic fungi that live in desert soil in the New World and can infect normal hosts, but most infections are self-limited. Disseminated infections occur in approximately 5% of cases and may prove fatal. Mouse models of the disease have identified strains that are resistant (e.g. DBA/2) or susceptible (e.g. C57BL/6) to these pathogens. However, the genetic and immunological basis for this difference has not been fully characterized.
				
				
					
						Results
					Microarray technology was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in lung tissue between resistant DBA/2 and sensitive C57BL/6 mice after infection with C. immitis. Differentially expressed genes were mapped onto biological pathways, gene ontologies, and protein interaction networks, which revealed that innate immune responses mediated by Type II interferon (i.e., IFNG) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) contribute to the resistant phenotype. In addition, upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), possibly as part of a larger inflammatory response mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA), may also contribute to resistance. Microarray gene expression was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR for a subset of 
12 genes, which revealed that IFNG HIF1A and TNFA, among others, were significantly differentially expressed between the two strains at day 14 post-infection.
				
				
					
						Conclusion
					These results confirm the finding that DBA/2 mice express more Type II interferon and interferon stimulated genes than genetically susceptible strains and suggest that differential expression of HIF1A may also play a role in protection.

First Order Signatures and Knot Concordance
Invariants of knots coming from twisted signatures have played a central role in the study of knot concordance.  Unfortunately, except in the simplest of cases, these signature invariants have proven exceedingly difficult to compute.  As a consequence, many knots which presumably can be detected by these invariants are not a well understood as they should be.  

We study a family of signature invariants of knots and show that they provide concordance information.  Significantly, we provide a tractable means for computing these signatures.  Once armed with these tools we use them first to study the knot concordance group generated by the twist knots which are of order 2 in the algebraic concordance group.  With our computational tools we can show that with only finitely many exceptions, they form a linearly independent set in the concordance group.

We go on to study a procedure given by Cochran-Harvey-Leidy which produces infinite rank subgroups of the knot concordance group which, in some sense are extremely subtle and difficult to detect.  The construction they give has an inherent ambiguity due to the difficulty of computing some signature invariants.  This ambiguity prevents their construction from yielding an actual linearly independent set.  Using the tools we develop we make progress to removing this ambiguity from their procedure.

Laboratory investigation of the pre- and post-cyclic volume change properties of Sherman Island peat
We investigate through laboratory testing the volume change characteristics of peaty organic soil from Sherman Island, California under static conditions (consolidation, secondary compression) and post-cyclic conditions. Incremental consolidation tests indicate the material to be highly compressible (Cc = 3.9, Cr = 0.4) and prone to substantial ageing from secondary compression (Ca/Cc = 0.05 following virgin compression). Strain-controlled cyclic triaxial testing of the peat finds the generation of cyclic pore pressures for cyclic shear strain levels beyond approximately 0.5-1.0%, with the largest residual pore pressure ratios rur (cyclic residual pore pressure normalized by pre-cyclic consolidation stress) being approximately 0.2-0.4. Post cyclic volume change occurs from pore pressure dissipation and secondary compression. The level of post-cyclic secondary compression increases with rur. Many of these phenomena have not been documented previously and suggest the potential for seismic freeboard loss in levees due to mechanisms other than shear failure.

Gravity-driven intrusions in stratified fluids
All natural fluids stratify. Stable stratifications, in which isobars and isopycnals are parallel, are capable of supporting internal wave motion. Unstable stratification, in which density and pressure gradients are not aligned, results in gravity-driven flow. Gravity currents are a subset of these flows in which horizontal density gradients sharpen and propagate horizontally, transporting mass, momentum, and energy. If the density of the gravity current is within the density extrema of the stably stratified ambient fluid, it propagates as an intrusion at an intermediate height. Through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, this dissertation explores the influence of stratification on the dynamics of gravity- driven intrusions. Intrusions require stable stratification in the ambient fluid, which is capable of transporting momentum and energy away from the current in the form of internal waves. We investigate the constant velocity propagation of well-mixed intrusions propagating into a linearly stratified ambient fluid. Varying the level of neutral buoyancy, we quantify the corresponding variation in structure, momentum, and energy of the upstream wave field. Adjacent stable stratifications of differing vertical density structure necessarily entail horizontal density gradients. These gradients determine the hydrostatic pressure differences driving the ensuing gravity current. We examine the mid-depth, constant velocity propagation of one linearly stratified fluid into another more strongly linearly stratified fluid. Working from the available potential energy of the system and measurements of the intrusion thickness, we develop an energy model to describe the speed of the intrusion in terms of the ratio of the two buoyancy frequencies. Distinct from adjacent linear stratifications, adjacent discrete stratifications may create flow consisting of interleaving intrusions. Single intrusions into a two- layer ambient fluid are well understood. Limiting our study to an idealized system of multiple intrusions, we attempt to extend the two-layer model to describe the interleaving process. We show that this simple extension fails when the average densities of the two stratifications are unequal, and suggest that this failure is due to the coupling of interfacial waves across constant density layers

Identification of Novel Cellular Responses to Metal Homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Among the essential transition metals, iron and zinc are the most studied and much is understood about the effect and regulation of these important cofactors. Yet much still remains unknown about the biochemical mechanisms which are required for cellular homeostasis of these metals. My studies have focused on identifying novel cellular responses to iron toxicity and to zinc deficiency in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first part of my research focuses on identifying suppressor genes which, when over-expressed, can protect cells against iron toxicity. Suppressor screens were performed using a genomic library in a multicopy vector. The screen identified ORM2 and ORM1 as both were shown to rescue cell growth in high iron conditions. Both Orm1/2 are transmembrane proteins localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It was previously known that both Orm2 and Orm1 are negative regulators for sphingolipid biosynthesis and that they also play roles in protein quality control. Thus, cells show resistance to iron toxicity when sphingolipid synthesis is inhibited by the over-expression of Orm2/1 or by the treatment with myriocin, a potent inhibitor of sphingolipid synthesis. By measuring sphingolipid LCB levels with and without high iron, high iron was shown to induce sphingolipid biosynthesis and that over-expression of ORM2/1 can reduce sphingolipid levels, which protects cells from iron toxicity. Furthermore, data indicate that iron toxicity is mediated by sphingolipid-activated protein kinases Pkh1 and Ypk1 and by a transcriptional factor Smp1. Contrary to general belief that iron toxicity results from oxidative damage, my study shows that iron toxicity involves activation of sphingolipid signaling.The second part of my research focuses on elucidation of a novel cellular mechanism which yeast cells have developed in response to zinc deficiency. It was discovered that subunits of RNA polymerase I undergo degradation during zinc starvation. The observed degradation is specific to RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) and its associated proteins. Furthermore, this down-regulation of RNAPI is dependent on vacuolar proteases Pep4 and Prb1. Inactivation of the vacuolar proteases rescues the down-regulations of RNAPI as well as its associated proteins during zinc starvation. RNAPI complex is transported out of the nucleus as a complex and this process is mediated by the exportin Xpo1. Data also suggest that de-ubiquitination of RNAPI is required for its down-regulation during zinc starvation. It is hypothesized that the down-regulation of RNAPI, which is responsible for transcribing ribosomal RNAs and accounts for most transcriptional activities in yeast cells, can conserve energy used for ribosome biogenesis during zinc starvation. Moreover, several subunits of RNAPI are zinc-binding proteins. By degrading RNAPI in the vacuole, yeast cells can conserve and recycle zinc atoms for other important cellular functions during zinc deficiency.

Spatial mapping of gene expression in the salivary glands of the dengue vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti
Abstract



Background


Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the main vectors of dengue viruses to humans. Understanding their biology and interactions with the pathogen are prerequisites for development of dengue transmission control strategies. Mosquito salivary glands are organs involved directly in pathogen transmission to vertebrate hosts. Information on the spatial distribution of gene expression in these organs is expected to assist in the development of novel disease control strategies, including those that entail the release of transgenic mosquitoes with impaired vector competence.



Results

We report here the hybridization in situ patterns of 30 transcripts expressed in the salivary glands of adult Ae. aegypti females. Distinct spatial accumulation patterns were identified. The products of twelve genes are localized exclusively in the proximal-lateral lobes. Among these, three accumulate preferentially in the most anterior portion of the proximal-lateral lobe. This pattern revealed a salivary gland cell type previously undescribed in Ae. aegypti, which was validated by transmission electron microscopy. Five distinct gene products accumulate in the distal-lateral lobes and another five localize in the medial lobe. Seven transcripts are found in the distal-lateral and medial lobes. The transcriptional product of one gene accumulates in proximal- and distal-lateral lobes. Seven genes analyzed by quantitative PCR are expressed constitutively. The most abundant salivary gland transcripts are those localized within the proximal-lateral lobes, while previous work has shown that the distal-lateral lobes are the most active in protein synthesis. This incongruity suggests a role for translational regulation in mosquito saliva production.



Conclusions

Transgenic mosquitoes with reduced vector competence have been proposed as tools for the control of dengue virus transmission. Expression of anti-dengue effector molecules in the distal-lateral lobes of Ae. aegypti salivary glands has been shown to reduce prevalence and mean intensities of viral infection. We anticipate greater efficiency of viral suppression if effector genes are expressed in all lobes of the salivary glands. Based on our data, a minimum of two promoters is necessary to drive the expression of one or more anti-dengue genes in all cells of the female salivary glands.

Discrete Dipole Approximation for Low-Energy Photoelectron Emission from NaCl Nanoparticles
This work presents a model for the photoemission of electrons from sodium chloride nanoparticles 50-500 nm in size, illuminated by vacuum ultraviolet light with energy ranging from 9.4-10.9 eV.  The discrete dipole approximation is used to calculate the electromagnetic field inside the particles, from which the two-dimensional angular distribution of emitted electrons is simulated.  The emission is found to favor the particle?s geometrically illuminated side, and this asymmetry is compared to previous measurements performed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  By modeling the nanoparticles as spheres, the Berkeley group is able to semi-quantitatively account for the observed asymmetry.   Here however, the particles are modeled as cubes, which is closer to their actual shape, and the interaction of an emitted electron with the particle surface is also considered.  The end result shows that the emission asymmetry for these low-energy electrons is more sensitive to the particle-surface interaction than to the specific particle shape, i.e., a sphere or cube.

Computational prediction and analysis of protein structure
Identifying polymer-forming SAM domainsSterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains are common protein modules in eukaryotic cells. It has not been possible to assign functions to uncharacterized SAM domains because they have been found to participate in diverse functions ranging from protein-protein interactions to RNA binding. Here we computationally identify likely members of the subclass of SAM domains that form polymers. Sequences were virtually threaded onto known polymer structures and then evaluated for compatibility with the polymer. We find that known SAM polymers score better than the vast majority of known non-polymers: 100% (7 of 7) of known polymers and only 8% of known non- polymers (1 of 12) score above a defined threshold value. Of 2901 SAM family members, we find 694 that score above the threshold and are likely polymers, including SAM domains from the proteins Lethal Malignant Brain Tumor, Bicaudal-C, Liprin-beta, Adenylate Cyclase and Atherin. In polymerization experiments, all of these predictions (except Adenylate Cyclase) were confirmed. As a result, the original SAM database was updated and additional predictions were obtained.TMKink: A method to predict transmembrane helix kinksA hallmark of membrane protein structure is the large number of distorted transmembrane helices. Because of the prevalence of bends, it is important to not only understand how they are generated but also to learn how to predict their occurrence. Here, we find that there are local sequence preferences in kinked helices, most notably a higher abundance of proline, which can be exploited to identify bends from sequence information. A neural network predictor identifies over two-thirds of all bends (sensitivity 0.70) with high reliability (specificity 0.89). It is likely that more structural data will allow for better helix distortion predictors with increased coverage in the future. The kink predictor, TMKink, is available at http://tmkinkpredictor.mbi.ucla.edu/.Structural differences between mesophilic and thermophilic membrane proteinsProtein thermostability remains a focal point of interest for protein scientists. The differences in thermostability between mesophilic and thermophilic soluble proteins have been extensively studied. No differences in packing values have been found in soluble proteins. Membrane protein packing is different from soluble protein packing; thermophilic adaptation may be different as a result. Surprisingly, burial and packing values appear to be shared between mesophiles and thermophiles in both soluble and membrane proteins. We created a non-redundant database of unpaired and paired structures for the study of thermophile-mesophile structural differences in membrane proteins. We found little or no differences in burial or packing values in both the soluble and transmembrane regions of membrane proteins.

Correlating Humidity-Dependent Ionically Conductive Surface Area with Transport Phenomena in Proton-Exchange Membranes
The objective of this effort was to correlate the local surface ionic conductance of a Nafion? 212 proton-exchange membrane with its bulk and interfacial transport properties as a function of water content. Both macroscopic and microscopic proton conductivities were investigated at different relative humidity levels, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and current-sensing atomic force microscopy (CSAFM). We were able to identify small ion-conducting domains that grew with humidity at the surface of the membrane. Numerical analysis of the surface ionic conductance images recorded at various relative humidity levels helped determine the fractional area of ion-conducting active sites. A simple square-root relationship between the fractional conducting area and observed interfacial mass-transport resistance was established.  Furthermore, the relationship between the bulk ionic conductivity and surface ionic conductance pattern of the Nafion? membrane was examined.

Mass Spectrometry Based Method Development for Elucidation of Protein Sequences, Structures and Post Translational Modifications
The advanced development of mass spectrometry (MS) makes MS a powerful technique for proteomics study. The increasing demands for proteomics study stimulate creation of more applicable MS-based methods. This dissertation focuses on development of novel MS-based methods to characterize three different aspects of proteins: primary sequence, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and three-dimensional (3D) structure.  The first part (Chapter 2) is focused on primary sequence characterization. A novel technique radical directed dissociation (RDD) is developed for peptide gas phase fragmentation. RDD is recognized as a "charge-remote" dissociation in which RDD backbone fragments are mediated by &betaC-H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of all 20 amino acids. Therefore, RDD fragmentation of peptides with known sequences is predictable. This discovery indicates RDD is promising for proteomics study in terms of significantly improving the confidence level of peptide identification. The second part covers MS-based method development for PTM characterization.  Chapter 3 describes using RDD to rapidly map iodinated tyrosines in intact proteins. The iodinated tyrosines are identified in the portions of a protein where RDD fragments are frequently located. The only limitation is that when multiple tyrosines are located in the identified iodinated region, it could be challenging to differentiate the iodination states between adjacent tyrosines. In Chapter 4, iodination chemistry combined with tandem MS is used to localize acid-labile histidine phosphorylation sites in peptides. Phosphorylated histidines are immune of iodine-labeling whereas unmodified histidines are not. After iodination, labile histidine phosphates can be removed by acid treatment to yield free histidines, which can be easily identified by MS/MS. This new method provides a pathway forward for analyzing histidine phosphorylation in complex systems.The last part is aimed at protein conformational study using selective noncovalent adduct protein probing-mass spectrometry (SNAPP-MS). SNAPP-MS employs 18-crown-6 ether (18C6) as a probe of lysines and the numbers of 18C6s attached to proteins reveal protein solution phase structural information.  In Chapter 5, SNAPP-MS is used to study the dynamic structural interchanging in Lymphotactin (Ltn).  SNAPP successfully encodes the interchanging transition state of Ltn, which provides valuable information for interpreting Ltn biological functions.

Anatomy and evolution of telomeric and subtelomeric regions in the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi.
AbstractBackgroundThe subtelomeres of many protozoa are highly enriched in genes with roles in niche adaptation. T. cruzi trypomastigotes express surface proteins from Trans-Sialidase (TS) and Dispersed Gene Family-1 (DGF-1) superfamilies which are implicated in host cell invasion. Single populations of T. cruzi may express different antigenic forms of TSs. Analysis of TS genes located at the telomeres suggests that chromosome ends could have been the sites where new TS variants were generated. The aim of this study is to characterize telomeric and subtelomeric regions of T. cruzi available in TriTrypDB and connect the sequences of telomeres to T. cruzi working draft sequence.ResultsWe first identified contigs carrying the telomeric repeat (TTAGGG). Of 49 contigs identified, 45 have telomeric repeats at one end, whereas in four contigs the repeats are located internally. All contigs display a conserved telomeric junction sequence adjacent to the hexamer repeats which represents a signature of T. cruzi chromosome ends. We found that 40 telomeric contigs are located on T. cruzi chromosome-sized scaffolds. In addition, we were able to map several telomeric ends to the chromosomal bands separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.The subtelomeric sequence structure varies widely, mainly as a result of large differences in the relative abundance and organization of genes encoding surface proteins (TS and DGF-1), retrotransposon hot spot genes (RHS), retrotransposon elements, RNA-helicase and N-acetyltransferase genes. While the subtelomeric regions are enriched in pseudogenes, they also contain complete gene sequences matching both known and unknown expressed genes, indicating that these regions do not consist of nonfunctional DNA but are instead functional parts of the expressed genome. The size of the subtelomeric regions varies from 5 to 182&#8201;kb; the smaller of these regions could have been generated by a recent chromosome breakage and telomere healing event.ConclusionsThe lack of synteny in the subtelomeric regions suggests that genes located in these regions are subject to recombination, which increases their variability, even among homologous chromosomes. The presence of typical subtelomeric genes can increase the chance of homologous recombination mechanisms or microhomology-mediated end joining, which may use these regions for the pairing and recombination of free ends.

Molecular mechanisms integrating genetic and calcium activity-dependent neurotransmitter specification
Excitability regulates many aspects of neuronal differentiation in addition to forming the basis for rapid signaling in the mature nervous system. Several key features that determine the functional activity of neurons are modulated by calcium signaling during development, including neurotransmitter specification. The focus of the dissertation is on understanding the signaling cascades that mediate calcium spike-dependent specification of neurotransmitter phenotype in embryonic spinal neurons. I describe the identification and characterization of novel pathways that act in the specification of activity- dependent neurotransmitter phenotype by targeted screening of molecules known to regulate the expression of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. In addition, I describe a gain-of-function screen to identify novel molecules that were previously unknown to play a role in the activity-dependent specification of neurotransmitter phenotype. Finally, I describe the generation and development of novel transgenic Xenopus lines in which specific subsets of neurons are fluorescently labeled. These lines serve as the basis for further genetic screening and can be used to characterize the activity- dependent specification of neurotransmitters as well as numerous other processes in neuronal development

Biodiversity and connectivity in peripheral populations of corals of the South and Eastern Atlantic
The coral reefs of the South and Eastern Atlantic are impoverished in species diversity and abundance relative to the Caribbean because they occupy areas of suboptimal conditions for coral growth. Biodiversity and connectivity are important for the resilience and persistence of reefs, but corals inhabiting the periphery, or limits of the species range, lack the buffering qualities of ecological redundancy that accompanies biodiversity and may be isolated from sources of migrants that could replenish populations in the event of disturbance. Conversely, peripheral populations may be the site of divergence, local adaptation and speciation as a result of isolation. I explore the contributions of peripheral coral populations in Brazil and West Africa to preserving and generating biodiversity and their role in maintaining genetic connectivity across long distances in the Atlantic. Current estimates of coral biodiversity are confounded by pervasive morphological convergence, potentially underrating regional endemism. Molecular data presented here suggest that biodiversity has been underestimated for Mussismilia, a genus endemic to Brazil, and that the South Atlantic can be the site of species origination, such as for Favia gravida. Over ecological time scales, high connectivity provides a means for populations to persist in impacted locations by the influx of migrants from distant healthy reefs, while over longer time scales, isolation can be a creative mechanism that promotes diversification. I present the first molecular datasets that examine basin-scale dispersal in seven species of amphi-Atlantic corals. Isolation among regions is inferred for all but one species, indicating that coral populations must rely on regional recruitment to persist, but that local adaptation and future diversification may also take place. Within regions, however, differences in connectivity appear to be associated with reproductive mode. Among coral populations of Brazil, connectivity was greatest for broadcasting species and more restricted for brooding species, suggesting that aspects of reproduction may aid in dispersal at local scales. Peripheral coral reefs in the Atlantic are important sanctuaries for a host of endemic corals and other marine species and should be recognized for their distinctiveness, their role as sites of diversification, but also protected because of their isolation and vulnerability

Accelerated Testing Validation
The DOE Fuel Cell technical team recommended ASTs were performed on 2 different MEAs (designated P5 and HD6) from Ballard Power Systems. These MEAs were also incorporated into stacks and operated in fuel cell bus modules that were either operated in the field (three P5 buses) in Hamburg, or on an Orange county transit authority drive cycle in the laboratory (HD6 bus module). Qualitative agreement was found in the degradation mechanisms and rates observed in the AST and in the field. The HD6 based MEAs exhibited lower voltage degradation rates (due to catalyst corrosion) and slower membrane degradation rates in the field as reflected by their superior performance in the high potential hold and open-circuit potential AST tests. The quantitative correlation of the degradation rates will have to take into account the various stressors in the field including temperature, relative humidity, start/stops and voltage cycles.

Menopause leads to elevated expression of macrophage-associated genes in the aging frontal cortex: rat and human studies identify strikingly similar changes
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					The intricate interactions between the immune, endocrine and central nervous systems shape the innate immune response of the brain. We have previously shown that estradiol suppresses expression of immune genes in the frontal cortex of middle-aged ovariectomized rats, but not in young ones reflecting elevated expression of these genes in middle-aged, ovarian hormone deficient animals. Here, we explored the impact of menopause on the microglia phenotype capitalizing on the differential expression of macrophage-associated genes in quiescent and activated microglia.
				
				
					
						Methods
					We selected twenty-three genes encoding phagocytic and recognition receptors expressed primarily in microglia, and eleven proinflammatory genes and followed their expression in the rat frontal cortex by real-time PCR. We used young, middle-aged and middle-aged ovariectomized rats to reveal age- and ovariectomy-related alterations. We analyzed the expression of the same set of genes in the postcentral and superior frontal gyrus of pre- and postmenopausal women using raw microarray data from our previous study.
				
				
					
						Results
					Ovariectomy caused up-regulation of four classic microglia reactivity marker genes including Cd11b, Cd18, Cd45 and Cd86. The change was reversible since estradiol attenuated transcriptional activation of the four marker genes. Expression of genes encoding phagocytic and toll-like receptors such as Cd11b, Cd18, C3, Cd32, Msr2 and Tlr4 increased, whereas scavenger receptor Cd36 decreased following ovariectomy. Ovarian hormone deprivation altered the expression of major components of estrogen and neuronal inhibitory signaling which are involved in the control of microglia reactivity. Strikingly similar changes took place in the postcentral and superior frontal gyrus of postmenopausal women.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					Based on the overlapping results of rat and human studies we propose that the microglia phenotype shifts from the resting toward the reactive state which can be characterized by up-regulation of CD11b, CD14, CD18, CD45, CD74, CD86, TLR4, down-regulation of CD36 and unchanged CD40 expression. As a result of this shift, microglial cells have lower threshold for subsequent activation in the forebrain of postmenopausal women.

The Investigation of Innate Immune Pathways in the Yellow Fever Mosquito, Aedes aegypti
Mosquitoes are vectors of many parasitic and viral diseases that continue to burden the global public health system. The innate immune system of insects is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. This system is governed by two major pathways, Toll, and IMD pathways. This dissertation involves the investigation of these pathways. Aim 1 involves the exploration of the Toll and PPO activation pathway in response to pathogen invasion. Aim 2 seeks to investigate the components of the IMD pathway and lastly, Aim 3 provides a comparative genomic study of the mosquito immune system. The results of the first aim identified an interleukin receptor associated kinase (IRAK), IRAK4, in the mosquito, Aedes aegyti. Furthermore, it was found that IRAK4 serves an important immune function in the Toll immune pathway. Addtionally, several cytoplasmic components of the IMD pathway were identified including PGRPLC, IMD, IKK&#946;, and FADD (Aim 2).

Morphological diversity of cell types in macaque monkey visual system
The mammalian central nervous system is a dynamically complex network of anatomically and functionally distinct cell types, neatly organized into laminar and columnar functional domains. An excellent example of this is the primate primary visual cortex (V1), which is comprised of 6 layers, each containing various cell types interconnecting to one another to create a dense yet precise network of circuits (Callaway, 1998). The morphologically diverse cell groups in layers 5 and 6 of primate V1 are important in facilitating the transmission of visual information (Callaway and Wiser, 1996 ; Wiser and Callaway, 1996). They participate not only in local, intracortical circuits, but also distant, cortico-cortical feedforward pathways, e.g. the projection to middle temporal area (MT), and cortico-subcortical feedback pathways, e.g. the projections to the superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and pulvinar (Ungerleider et al., 1983 ; Fries, 1984 ; Shipp and Zeki, 1989 ; Fitzpatrick et al., 1994). In addition, certain layer-6 cells are believed to send collateral axons to both MT and SC (Fries et al., 1985; vogt Weisenhorn et al., 1995). However, due to limitations in anatomical tracing techniques, detailed morphology of the cell types participating in each of these corticocortical and corticosubcortical pathways is still largely unknown. In these experiments, we injected a modified rabies virus into the SC and area MT of macaque monkeys and performed detailed characterization of the labeled cells in V1. We found that SC projecting neurons in V1 are located in layers 5 and 6, consisting of layer-5 tall-tufted, layer-5 non-tufted, and layer-6 non-tufted. However, a few MT projecting neurons are located in layer 6 and have a single non-tufted main ascending branch of apical dendrites similar to those of the SC projecting non-tufted cells. The morphology of the different cell types found in my experiments suggest that they receive and process different types of information before sending their outputs to the SC or area MT. Knowing the detailed morphology of different participants in different circuits provides insight into understanding their functional importance. Furthermore, anatomical information is also useful in guiding future physiological and reversible inactivation studies

The role of computer simulations in the preclinical development of semiflexible polymeric anticancer therapeutics
Poly(glutamyl-glutamate) paclitaxel (PGG-PTX) is a potential anticancer therapeutic in preclinical development. There has been increasing attention on how structural and functional properties of therapeutic nanoparticles, such as size, shape, flexibility, surface hydrophilicity, and aggregation, influence efficacy. This thesis demonstrates the application of computer simulations to elucidate these properties of PGG-PTX candidates, which would otherwise be tedious or inaccessible to achieve experimentally. Computer simulations were carried out by running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on eighteen coarse-grained (CG) PGG-PTX models, varying in the PTX loading fraction (f/PTX = 0.18, 0.24, and 0.37) and spatial PTX arrangement (uniform : 'even' and 'random', clustered : 'clusters' and 'ends', concentrated : 'middle' and 'side') on the PGG backbone. The results show that PGG-PTX molecules with concentrated spatial PTX arrangements produce filamentous shapes and are more flexible, while PGG-PTX molecules with uniform PTX arrangements generate globular morphologies and are less flexible. The PTX loading fraction and spatial PTX arrangement have a minimal effect on the size of a PGG-PTX molecule. Intermolecular aggregation increases with increasing PTX loading fraction, while surface hydrophilicity decreases with increasing PTX loading fraction. The PGG-PTX molecules at f/PTX = 0.24 with concentrated spatial PTX distributions exhibit nonspherical shape, high flexibility, low aggregation, and high surface hydrophilicity. Since these properties have been shown to be clinically advantageous, we recommend the PGG-PTX molecules at f/PTX = 0.24 with concentrated spatial PTX distributions for experimental testing. The shape, flexibility, and surface hydrophilicity of nonpeptide RGD-targeted PGG-PTX systems varying in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer length (500 Da, 1000 Da, and 2000 Da) and npRGD ligand density (4, 8, 12, and 16 per PGG-PTX-PEG-npRGD molecule) were also examined. Results from CG MD simulations show that the PGG-PTX- PEG1000-npRGD₈ and PGG-PTX-PEG1000-npRGD₁₂ molecules were the most promising candidates, given their filamentous shape, high flexibility, and high surface hydrophilicity. Overall, we introduce computer simulations as a tool for facilitating the preclinical development of polymeric drug delivery systems

[magnetic, chapter, current]

Spin Torques in Magnetic and Superconducting Tunnel Junctions
The main text is presented in four parts. In chapter 2, we develop a phenomenological theory of voltage induced torques in magnetic tunnel junctions. The reciprocal of this effect and spin-transfer torque can pump charge into an attached circuit when the magnet precesses. We calculate the resulting change in impedances due to this pumping as a function of applied magnetic field and thickness of tunneling spacer. Because the impedances due to voltage and current pumping are qualitatively distinct under variation of the magnetic field, we suggest that this measurement could be used as experimental differentiation between these effects.In chapter 3 we study magnetic Josephson junctions wherein spin polarized Ohmic and supercurrent exert a torque on the magnetic layer. As a result, there is a nonlinear dynamic interplay between the magnetic order parameter and the phase of the superconducting parameter. This results in a modified stability diagram for both the magnet and superconductor. In particular, we find a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical current on the applied magnetic field and current. When the temperature is raised above the superconducting critical temperature, the leads become metallic and the equations of motion coincide with those of chapter 3.In contrast to the monodomain models studied in other chapters, chapter 4 examines the effects of micromagnetics on the thermal stability of a typical MRAM bit. In addition to noting that a finite stiffness parasitically effects bit stability, we find that domain-wall nucleation and propagation is the dominant mode of thermal bit flipping.Finally, in chapter 5 we derive a nonequilibrium expression for spin current between two magnetic leads biased by voltage, temperature or spin. The interaction on the dot is left general and the equation for current can be written as a function of the full retarded Green's function on the dot. We apply this methodology to a dot with large on-site Coulomb interaction.

Interactions Between Ecology and Evolution in the Trinidadian Guppy (Poecilia reticulata)
Ecology has long been thought to influence the evolutionary process by determining the selection pressures that cause adaptive evolution. The reciprocal influence of evolution on ecological processes has received less attention, but interest in its potential influence is increasing with the recognition that ecological and evolutionary processes can occur on congruent timescales. When these two fields are combined in theoretical models, the results are predictions about population and community dynamics not obtainable when modeled alone. Despite the theoretical work on these interactions, there is a paucity of empirical studies testing the assumptions and predictions of this body of theory.The aim of this dissertation is to fill this gap. Chapter 1 reviews the theoretical literature related to how density-dependent population regulation has been incorporated into models of life history evolution. Additionally, I review the empirical literature on density-dependence with aim of finding general patterns in how populations are regulated. In chapter two I test whether density could potentially be important in the evolution of the life history of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). First, I conducted density manipulations of natural populations of guppies and found that guppy populations are regulated via density-dependent compensation of the demographic rates. Second, using factorial mesocosms experiments, crossing guppy phenotype with density, I found that the phenotypic fitness (measured as phenotypic growth rates) were dependent on density and that high predation guppies have a significant fitness advantage at high, but not low, densities. In chapter 3 I tested whether divergent guppy phenotypes had alternative affects on the structure and function of ecosystems. Each phenotype did produce significantly different phenotypes and the effects were often much larger than density--a traditionally important ecological trait. In chapter 4, I used a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling to separate the effects of divergent prey selectivity and nutrient recycling among the different phenotypes. The results of this analysis show that the indirect effects of the phenotypes are larger than the direct effects and that the interplay between the two are important in determining the evolution of foraging traits and potentially the rest of the life history.

The stressful characteristics of commuting constraints are conceptualized in terms of both physical and perceptual conditions of travel impedance. This study develops and operationalizes the concept of subjective impedance, as a complement to our previously developed concept of impedance as a physically defined condition of commuting stress. The stress impacts of high-impedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing inter-domain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress.

[pthrp, cell, proliferation, inhibition, action]

The site of action of PTHrP's proliferative inhibition in non-small cell lung carcinoma
Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is expressed in many tissues and is often enriched in cancers. Tissue reaction to PTHrP varies as it is expressed as multiple isoforms, undergoes peptide processing, and has selective trafficking. PTHrP is secreted via a pre-pro -36 to -1 amino acid portion and interacts with extracellular receptors, including parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTH1R). PTHrP is also present within the cell and shuttles into and out of the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES). Patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinomas that express PTHrP, experience higher survival rates. PTHrP's benefits in non-small cell lung cancer may result from its previously demonstrated anti-proliferative effects. Because of PTHrP's highly intricate actions, its site of inhibitory action on proliferation is not known. This project experimentally isolated the site of action and likely receptor responsible for PTHrP's inhibition on H1944 cells, an adenocarcinoma cell line. Early experimental results suggested that exogenous PTHrP has at least a partial role in growth inhibition. We successfully demonstrated that the nuclear trafficking of PTHrP is not necessary for inhibition of proliferation. We showed that PTHrP peptide introduced into the cell has no major effects on proliferation. Finally, we demonstrated that exogenous PTHrP treatments have the potential to inhibit proliferation at levels near stably transfected lines and that PTHrP does not inhibit cells with PTH1R knocked down. Based on these results we conclude that PTHrP inhibits proliferation of H1944 cells in an extracellular fashion dependent on the PTH1R

Nitroxides: Profluorescent Sensors and Functionalized Alkoxyamine Initiators for Nitroxide Mediated Radical Polymerization
Nitroxides have played a vital role in many areas in chemistry, due to their persistent radical nature, and facile redox properties. In this thesis, nitroxides are used to quench the fluorescence of organic fluorophores and quantum dots, as well as to prepare end-functionalized polymers using nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMRP).    Quantum dot (QD) fluorescence is effectively quenched by binding to functionalized nitroxides. The association constants and fluorescence quenching of CdSe QDs with nitroxides bearing a ligand coordinated to the QD surface have been examined using electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy. Quenching of QD fluorescence is dependent on the distance between the radical and the QD, and the binding affinity. The quenched fluorescence is restored when the surface-bound nitroxide is converted to a hydroxylamine by a mild reducing agent, or trapped by a carbon radical to form an alkoxyamine. A fluorescence quenching mechanism is proposed.    The phenomenon of fluorescence quenching was extended to organic fluorophores. Nitroxides were synthesized bearing a tethered photosensitive species that undergo photocleavage to form a radical, which is then intramolecularly trapped by the nitroxide. When a fluorescent tag is appended to these nitroxides, the fluorescence is restored upon photoexcitation. A profluorescent nitroxide sensor of mild reductants was also developed, which undergo cyclization upon formation of the hydroxylamine. Unlike existing methodologies, this sensor is non-reversible since it cannot be reoxidized in the presence of oxygen.    Thiol-derivatized N-alkoxyamines, functionalized with a free thiol, disulfide, or trityl-protected thiol group were synthesized and employed in NMRP. Deprotection of the trityl group and mild oxidation provided disulfide linked polystyrene of double the molecular weight. Reduction of this polystyrene, followed by trapping with N-phenylmaleimide (NPM) resulted in a NPM-protected thiol terminated polystyrene with the same molecular weight as prior to oxidation.

[miscanthus, yield, pretreatment, genotype]

Rapid selection and identification of Miscanthus genotypes with enhanced glucan and xylan yields from hydrothermal pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis
Abstract
				
				
					
						Background
					Because many Miscanthus genotypes can be cultivated with relatively high productivity and carbohydrate content, Miscanthus has great potential as an energy crop that can support large scale biological production of biofuels.
				
				
					
						Results
					In this study, batch hydrothermal pretreatment at 180&#176;C for 35&#8201;min followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was shown to give the highest total sugar yields for Miscanthus x giganteus cv. Illinois planted in Illinois. High throughput pretreatment at 180&#176;C for 35&#8201;min and 17.5&#8201;min followed by co-hydrolysis in a multi-well batch reactor identified two varieties out of 80 that had significantly higher sugar yields from pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis than others. The differences in performance were then related to compositions of the 80 varieties to provide insights into desirable traits for Miscanthus that enhance sugar yields.
				
				
					
						Conclusions
					High throughput pretreatment and co-hydrolysis (HTPH) rapidly identified promising genotypes from a wide range of Miscanthus genotypes, including hybrids of Miscanthus sacchariflorus/M. sinensis and Miscanthus lutarioriparius, differentiating the more commercially promising species from the rest. The total glucan plus xylan content in Miscanthus appeared to influence both mass and theoretical yields, while lignin and ash contents did not have a predictable influence on performance.

[coral, host, microbial, holobiont]

Microbial diversity and transcriptome profiling in coral holobionts
Coral reefs are often considered as the proverbial canary in the mine for
the oceans. Their current decline alarmingly correlates with indirect and direct
anthropogenic stress resulting in increased frequencies and geographic spread of
mass mortality, i.e., coral bleaching, and disease events. Thus, a rapid advancement
in the understanding of the factors determining coral health and disease is
of great importance. The post-genomic era has propelled both the development of
high-throughput technologies and a shift in biological research from reductionist
to system-level approaches. By viewing an organism as an integrated and interacting
network of genes, proteins, and biochemical reactions, the nascent field of
systems biology seeks to understand biological processes at a holistic level.
In this dissertation, corals are considered as superorganisms, or holobionts,
i.e., biological entities composed of a host organism and all of its associated
microorganisms. The microbial component has been shown to play key
roles in the functioning of the coral holobiont, but much remains to be studied
about its 1) diversity, 2) response to stress, and 3) influence on the physiology,
ecology, and evolution of the host. To address these gaps, I have applied a combinatorial
approach of 454-sequencing, microbial community profiling (Phylochip),
algal and host genotyping, as well as cDNA microarrays. The results include the
most comprehensive census of coral-associated bacteria so far and illustrate that
corals provide specialized habitats for an extremely diverse consortium of bacteria,
including taxa that are often unknown, as well as rarely or not detected in the
seawater. In diseased corals, bacterial communities profiles shifted and displayed
a higher abundance of bacteria that are commonly found in other diseased marine
invertebrates. Finally, correlating algal genotype and coral host transcriptomic
data revealed a substantial interaction between microbial symbionts and host gene
expression.
These results represent initial efforts towards capturing the parts lists, i.e.,
the microbial diversity in coral holobionts, and integrating them with host transcriptomic
data. The relevance of the results are discussed in the context of an
envisioned coral (eco)systems biology approach to advance our understanding of
coral health and disease.

[human, vision, photometry, visual]

Looking Beyond Photometry: What can we predict about the effect of light on the human eye?
Designers are often asked to gauge the influence of an illuminant or a visual signal on the human eye in a particular application. It has long been known that physical measurement is insufficient for this purpose. This is, in part, because the human sense of vision is not equipped with a competent radiation detector that is independent of wavelength.
      "The ability to see is a partnership of light and sight..."
      Photometry, a specification computed from a radiometric measurement, was developed as an attempt to capture what is human about human vision so that the sterile specifications of radiometry might be thus rendered more useful as a predictive tool. As it has developed and matured, photometry has become an exacting tool requiring sometimes extraordinary attention to detail that lies beyond the experience of many of us. But even with appropriate attention to detail, photometry takes account only of the spectral distribution of radiation in comparison to the spectral sensitivity (luminous efficiency) of the observer, and the size of the pupil. These characteristics of vision arise early in the perceptual chain. Other features of human vision, which vision science is beginning to systematically quantify, may be viewed as additional signposts pointing to the need for a more thorough humanization of radiometry. Visual illusions provide an example as do a variety of visual effects in which the percept is not veridical. This paper will review selected characteristics of human vision that point to the need for moving beyond photometry. Two examples, one involving the use of LED illuminants in traffic signals, and the other showing the theoretical advantages of a modified wing-tip strobe, will be used to illustrate the problem area. It is possible to foresee a future in which designers could use a photometric correction incorporating these additional factors.

[dart, credibility, debate, australopithecine]

Experts and australopithecines : credibility and controversy in the science of human evolution, 1924-1959
This dissertation investigates debates in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century over the significance of the Australopithecine fossils discovered in South Africa. The initial specimen, famously known as the "Taung Child", was characterized by Raymond Dart in 1925 as a possible evolutionary ancestor of human beings, linking our species to a distant past in which our anatomical similarity to the apes was much more conspicuous. Most of the recognized scientific authorities disagreed with Dart's assessment, instead seeing the specimen as a mere extinct ape, without any special place in humankind's evolutionary history. My narrative examines the debates that ensued over the next three and a half decades, closely following the changing credibility of Dart's initial claim, as well as subsequent claims by Dart and other scientists about the Australopithecines, through the shifting networks of objects, texts, people, practices and institutions that made up the infrastructure of paleoanthropological knowledge. The narrative demonstrates that the determinants of credibility in the Australopithecine debates were strongly tied to the particulars of local circumstances and personal relationships, and cannot be reduced to any normative, a priori account of how credibility is or ought to be achieved in science

[bimolane, effect, icrf-154, study, cytotoxic, similar, genotoxic, cell, result]

A Comparative Study of the Cytotoxic and Genotoxic Effects Exerted by the Bisdioxopiperazines, Bimolane and ICRF-154
Bimolane and ICRF-154 have been used for the treatment of cancer, psoriasis and uveitis in humans. Previous reports have revealed that the two drugs are topoisomerase II inhibitors, and patients treated with these agents have developed unique subtypes of secondary leukemia. Early studies have suggested that the therapeutic effects of bimolane were due to ICRF-154, an impurity present within the bimolane samples that may also be responsible for the toxic effects attributed to bimolane. To date, this hypothesis has not been tested. The objective of our study was to characterize the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of bimolane and ICRF-154 in a series of in vitro tests in TK6 cells and to compare the results for the two chemicals. Bimolane and ICRF-154 were both cytotoxic exhibiting similar effects on cell proliferation across a number of endpoints. Clastogenic and aneugenic effects of both agents were assessed using the micronucleus (MN) assay with CREST staining. These drugs induced mainly chromosome breakage and, to a lesser extent, chromosome loss at very similar frequencies. In addition, the drugs' potentials to interfere with cytokinesis were detected by measuring binucleation. Very similar responses in the induction of binucleated cells were observed with the two agents. Three assays were used to screen for numerical chromosomal abnormalities. In our flow cytometry studies, both compounds induced hypodiploidy, hyperdiploidy, and polyploidy with pronounced effects at the highest test concentration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses with a chromosome 7 specific centromeric DNA probe were then performed to confirm the flow cytometry results. Bimolane and ICRF-154 induced similar frequencies of numerical aberrations including hypodiploidy and a combination of hyperdiploidy and polyploidy when either of the two FISH methods were used. The results of our study demonstrate that the bimolane and ICRF-154, topo II catalytic inhibitors, exhibit very similar cytotoxic and genotoxic effects at equimolar concentrations. The results of this study strongly suggest that bimolane is efficiently converted to ICRF-154 during cell culture, and that ICRF-154 is most likely responsible for bimolane's cytotoxic, genotoxic, and, possibly, leukemogenic effects.

[stress, load, boundary, plate, tectonic, fault]

Stress in the lithosphere from non-tectonic loads with implications for plate boundary processes
Stress in the lithosphere from non-tectonic loads is calculated, making use of semi-analytic Fourier models. Sources of non-tectonic stress include coastal lithospheric bending in response to the rise in eustatic sea level since the Last Glacial Maximum, lithospheric rebound and pore pressure changes in response to the intermittent load of Ancient Lake Cahuilla in the Salton trough, stress sustained through the formation and long- term support of local short-wavelength topography, and topography created by the ejecta debris from impact craters on the surface of the icy Galilean satellites. Stresses from time varying surface water loads are calculated along major plate boundaries globally to determine to what extent, if any, these loads influence the major tectonic processes at work in plate boundary regions, such as the earthquake cycle on major faults. It is determined that the stress perturbations from these loads are generally an order of magnitude smaller than the tectonic stress accumulation rate. Their ability to noticeably affect the seismic cycle is therefore restricted to specific circumstances including when the tectonic loading rate is particularly low, such as along secondary plate boundary fault structures, when the non- tectonic loading rate is particularly high, such as in the case of catastrophic flooding events, or when the fault in question is already critically stressed to a near-failure level. Stresses from local topography are calculated along the global mid-ocean ridge and along the Chilean subduction megathrust. The predicted orientations of these stresses are compared to a presumed ridge-normal and transform-strike-slip faulting regime or the focal mechanism of a single large earthquake, respectively. Quantitative constraints for the coincident tectonic stresses are subsequently established with implications for the strength of the plate boundary faults and the necessity of particular topographic and bathymetric features

[root, symbiotic, species, sequencing, nitrogen, poplar, uptake, association, woody, condition]

Nitrogen (and phosphorus) nutrition of a woody plant and its root associates: a post-genomic perspective
Trees differ fundamentally from annual plant species in that they are adapted to survive on a long time-scale. The sequencing of the poplar genome and the use of appropriate functional tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to highlight key and specific mechanisms that characterize woody species. Most particularly, the isolation and characterization of complete sets of genes encoding transporters for inorganic / organic N and for P will bring fundamental knowledge that will be used to tackle changes in capacities for N and P uptake and assimilation under natural conditions. Additionally, under natural conditions the majority of trees are believed to have ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations (intimate symbiotic association between fungi and roots), which can have a significant role in the worldwide nitrogen and/or phosphorus cycle. This mycorrhizal status relies 1) on efficient uptake processes by the fungal partner 2) on the bidirectional transfer of nutrients between the two symbionts, which was first demonstrated by Melin and Nilsson >50 years ago. The recent sequencing of the Laccaria  bicolor genome, together with that of poplar, will probably reveals key genes that are essential for symbiotic functions, and hence for tree physiology.

[spatial, cell, eeg, pattern, odor-specific, granule]

Relation of Olfactory EEG to Behavior: Spatial Analysis
The hypothesis that odor-specific patterns of mitral cell activity during odor discrimination might be found in the corresponding spatial patterns of electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude over a surgically accessible segment of the bulbar surface was tested in rabbits with chronically implanted electrode arrays. The spatial spectrum of the bulbar EEG was derived and compared with the spectrum predicted for the granule cell generator. Spatial filters were devised to identify, enhance, or remove the granule cell contribution to the EEG. Spatial deconvolution was applied to the filtered granule cell activity patterns to correct for distortion caused by volume conduction. The results indicated that the bulb generated odor-specific spatial patterns in rabbits trained to discriminate between two odors. The odor-specific information was not localizable to subsets of channels. This suggested that the discriminative output of the bulb involved the entire structure, even though the receptor input was delivered to limited subsets of mitral cells.

[film, nus, substrate, native, layer, oxide, thickness, reaction]

Structural changes during the reaction of Ni thin films with (100) silicon substrates
Ultrathin films of nickel deposited onto (100) Si substrates were found to form kinetically constrained multilayered interface structures characterized by structural and compositional gradients. The presence of a native SiO2 on the substrate surface in tandem with thickness-dependent intrinsic stress of the metal film limits the solid-state reaction between Ni and Si. A roughly 6.5 nm thick Ni film on top of the native oxide was observed regardless of the initial nominal film thickness of either 5 or 15 nm. The thickness of the silicide layer that formed by Ni diffusion into the Si substrate, however, scales with the nominal film thickness. Cross-sectional in situ annealing experiments in the transmission electron microscope elucidate the kinetics of interface transformation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Two competing mechanisms are active during thermal annealing: thermally activated diffusion of Ni through the native oxide layer and subsequent transformation of the observed compositional gradient into a thick reaction layer of NiSi2 with an epitaxial orientation relationship to the Si substrate; and, secondly, metal film dispersion and subsequent formation of faceted Ni islands on top of the native oxide layer.
